00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
The following is a conversation with Brian Armstrong,

00:02.600 --> 00:05.280
co-founder and CEO of Coinbase,

00:05.280 --> 00:07.840
the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform

00:07.840 --> 00:11.380
with 98 million users in 100 countries,

00:11.380 --> 00:13.920
listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano,

00:13.920 --> 00:17.360
and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.320
I recorded this conversation with Brian

00:19.320 --> 00:21.920
before this week's SEC probe

00:21.920 --> 00:25.480
into whether some of the crypto listings are securities

00:25.480 --> 00:27.920
and thus need to be regulated as such.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.280
As always, with conversations that involve cryptocurrency,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.040
I try to make it timeless

00:33.040 --> 00:37.240
so that the price soaring high or crashing down low

00:37.240 --> 00:40.520
doesn't distract from the fundamental technological,

00:40.520 --> 00:42.760
economic, social, and philosophical ideas

00:42.760 --> 00:47.760
underlying this new form of money, energy, and information.

00:47.780 --> 00:52.440
Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value,

00:52.440 --> 00:55.380
and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter

00:55.380 --> 00:58.700
of how money works and what it can do.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.300
Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this

01:01.300 --> 01:04.300
by working together with regulators and governments,

01:04.300 --> 01:06.780
which is a long and difficult road.

01:06.780 --> 01:11.260
Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.

01:11.260 --> 01:14.700
The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.500
It is a serious attempt to limit fraud,

01:17.500 --> 01:20.980
but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation

01:20.980 --> 01:24.460
and limiting financial freedom of individuals.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.060
This is a complicated mess,

01:26.060 --> 01:29.400
and I applaud everyone involved for trying to work through it.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.120
I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.060
Decentralization, after all,

01:35.060 --> 01:37.260
is a hedge against the corrupting nature

01:37.260 --> 01:39.340
of centralized power.

01:39.340 --> 01:41.340
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.540
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:43.540 --> 01:44.780
in the description.

01:44.780 --> 01:48.320
And now, dear friends, here's Brian Armstrong.

01:49.220 --> 01:51.700
Let's start with the fact that you're a programmer.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.980
What was the first program you've ever written,

01:53.980 --> 01:55.940
or the first one that you remember?

01:55.940 --> 01:57.740
The first memory I have of programming

01:57.740 --> 01:59.340
was probably in middle school.

01:59.340 --> 02:01.820
And I remember it was recess,

02:01.820 --> 02:04.820
and they had this time period where you could read books,

02:04.820 --> 02:07.260
and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.260
And for some reason, I had gotten into this idea

02:10.260 --> 02:11.580
that I wanted to get into computers,

02:11.580 --> 02:13.920
and I was playing with computers at home.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.940
And so I got this book, I think from the library,

02:15.940 --> 02:19.540
it was called How to Learn Java in 30 Days.

02:19.580 --> 02:24.060
So I was reading this book at the recess,

02:24.060 --> 02:25.740
and I didn't understand anything.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.020
And I remember I went home

02:27.020 --> 02:29.660
and I tried to get this thing working.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.900
And if you've ever written a Java program,

02:31.900 --> 02:33.340
the first lines are like,

02:33.340 --> 02:35.920
public static void main string args or whatever.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.460
And it's so foreign, and it's so difficult to get started.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.580
And so I was kind of frustrated.

02:40.580 --> 02:41.900
I was like, I don't understand anything

02:41.900 --> 02:43.340
that's happening in this book.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.020
So the first thing I wrote was probably just like

02:46.020 --> 02:48.300
a Hello World app in Java.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.700
But I felt like I was so confused

02:51.700 --> 02:52.900
about what was actually happening

02:52.900 --> 02:55.860
that I later learned a bit of PHP.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.740
And PHP was like more fun for me

02:57.740 --> 03:00.460
because it was like, oh, just print out what you want.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.140
It didn't have all this complexity around it.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.380
So then I got more into PHP.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.940
I started building some simple websites.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.300
I think learned some HTML.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.220
So I think that was my introduction to programming,

03:12.220 --> 03:13.420
at least the very beginning part.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.340
Yeah, you know, Java has a lot of,

03:18.540 --> 03:20.740
out of all the Hello Worlds it can possibly write,

03:20.740 --> 03:23.300
Java is the one where I think it's the longest.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.260
Yeah.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.180
Which is quite interesting

03:25.180 --> 03:27.140
because Java is often at least for a long time

03:27.140 --> 03:29.260
was used as the primary programming language

03:29.260 --> 03:30.900
to teach people how to program,

03:30.900 --> 03:32.780
or at least about object oriented programming.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.380
I think most universities have now switched

03:35.380 --> 03:37.460
and high school switched to Python.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.900
I'm not sure if that's the case.

03:38.900 --> 03:39.740
Probably better.

03:39.740 --> 03:40.580
It's easier to learn.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.300
It lowers the, it makes it less scary.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.580
There's like less of a hurdle.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.380
And certainly none of them use PHP.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.460
I love PHP and I feel like it's a dirty secret.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.060
I have to keep private to myself.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.660
Like it's somebody I'm seeing on the side

03:52.660 --> 03:53.500
or something like that,

03:53.500 --> 03:56.380
because it's just not a respected programming language

03:56.380 --> 03:57.940
because I think there's so many ways

03:57.940 --> 04:00.780
you can write poor code with PHP,

04:00.780 --> 04:02.140
which is why it's not respected.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.020
Yeah, it's a scripting language more so,

04:04.020 --> 04:06.340
although of course Facebook built like a huge stack

04:06.340 --> 04:07.700
on top of it and valuable company,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.260
but I still love Ruby to this day.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.340
Ruby is probably my favorite language.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.180
Python's great too,

04:13.180 --> 04:15.540
but I just love the idea behind Ruby

04:15.540 --> 04:18.220
that it's like, let's make it easier for the human,

04:18.220 --> 04:20.740
harder for the computer and make it a joy

04:20.740 --> 04:22.620
to be expressive and all these things.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.940
So I was never the best computer scientist,

04:24.940 --> 04:26.260
but I was a good hacker.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.260
I could rapidly prototype products

04:28.260 --> 04:30.500
and using languages like Ruby.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.100
Do a lot of computer science programs still use

04:33.100 --> 04:35.260
like Lisp and Scheme and things like that?

04:35.260 --> 04:38.020
No, no, they do for, that's like,

04:38.020 --> 04:39.100
that's if you're hardcore.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.540
If you're legit, you're gonna do

04:40.540 --> 04:42.300
some of the functional languages.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.940
I think there's a few others that popped up,

04:44.940 --> 04:48.580
but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.980
That's like somebody has to like,

04:49.980 --> 04:53.620
you go to the library, you dust off the book,

04:53.620 --> 04:55.780
but Scheme a little bit.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.260
I think if you're starting,

04:57.260 --> 04:59.460
I mean, there's courses about languages themselves,

04:59.460 --> 05:01.580
like programming languages.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.180
Lisp might be one of those,

05:03.180 --> 05:05.460
you know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore,

05:05.460 --> 05:06.820
like ancient languages?

05:06.820 --> 05:07.700
Yeah.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.660
You might have to go to school

05:08.660 --> 05:10.620
in that same way for programming languages.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.820
Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.820
I, of course, still use Emacs as the editor

05:15.820 --> 05:17.420
for most things that I do.

05:17.420 --> 05:21.660
And Emacs is, you know, a lot of the customization

05:21.660 --> 05:23.500
you could do is in Lisp.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.780
And that's the language probably when I first

05:26.900 --> 05:30.020
really fell in love with programming is Lisp.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.020
Because for a long time

05:33.020 --> 05:34.460
throughout the earlier history

05:34.460 --> 05:35.540
of artificial intelligence,

05:35.540 --> 05:36.820
Lisp was the primary language,

05:36.820 --> 05:40.700
but it still had a life in the nineties

05:40.700 --> 05:43.220
in the arts where some people would use it.

05:43.220 --> 05:44.060
Yeah.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.460
Such a beautiful functional language,

05:46.460 --> 05:48.260
but it just somehow didn't pick up.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.500
That said, I should say sort of push back,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.820
PHP, I feel like it's still true

05:55.820 --> 05:58.860
that most of the web runs on PHP.

05:58.860 --> 06:02.220
Most of the back end is still PHP.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.740
So if you look at, you know,

06:03.740 --> 06:05.700
it's like the stuff that people don't talk about.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.540
It's like what runs most systems in the world?

06:08.540 --> 06:11.140
What runs most back end?

06:11.140 --> 06:12.780
What runs most front end?

06:12.780 --> 06:13.620
Yeah.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.660
JavaScript, you know, HTML.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.780
JavaScript, I think the Stack Exchange surveys

06:17.780 --> 06:19.460
show JavaScript is the most popular language

06:19.460 --> 06:20.420
in the world, I think, right?

06:20.420 --> 06:21.260
Oh yeah.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.660
In terms of programmers and numbers of, I wonder.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.980
By survey of number of programmers on Stack, Stack Overflow.

06:28.980 --> 06:31.420
Oh yeah, but that's also the cutting edge, right?

06:31.420 --> 06:33.220
Those are the people that are just like

06:33.220 --> 06:34.500
excitedly writing codes.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.340
That's true.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.500
There's people that are just like

06:37.500 --> 06:40.300
maintaining gigantic code bases.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.140
Yeah.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.580
I feel like the amount of Java out there

06:43.580 --> 06:46.700
just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.300
And then of course in the banking industry, finance,

06:49.300 --> 06:52.780
it's like even older stuff, Cobalt and whatnot, but.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.420
I've been actually looking for somebody to interview

06:57.420 --> 07:00.860
who represents Cobalt and Fortran.

07:00.860 --> 07:05.300
Like who's the figure still there that holds the flag?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.740
I did with Java, founder of Java, creator of Java,

07:08.740 --> 07:11.340
creator of Python, creator of C++,

07:11.340 --> 07:14.340
but nobody wants to hold the flag for Cobalt and Fortran,

07:14.340 --> 07:17.900
even though some of the most important systems in the world

07:17.900 --> 07:19.460
still run on those.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.300
Yeah.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.460
Like power systems and infrastructure systems.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.700
Which is fascinating.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.060
Which, and ATMs and stuff like that.

07:27.060 --> 07:31.340
Like a lot of stuff that we rely on that just works,

07:31.340 --> 07:33.940
and the reason we don't change it is because it works well.

07:33.940 --> 07:34.780
Yeah.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.940
Which is the people don't use anymore.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.180
Yeah.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.620
That'd be a cool series of interviews.

07:39.620 --> 07:42.460
Get the stuff that's like tech that was invented

07:42.460 --> 07:45.340
40, 50 years ago, but still is being used widely.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.140
I mean, Emacs is an example of that.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.140
Let me ask the big question of

07:50.820 --> 07:54.020
what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's Coinbase?

07:54.020 --> 07:55.060
How does it work?

07:55.060 --> 07:57.460
Before, I'll ask even bigger questions,

07:57.460 --> 08:00.820
but it's just a nice kind of palette cleansing question

08:00.820 --> 08:02.100
of what is Coinbase?

08:02.980 --> 08:07.580
Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange, brokerage, custodian.

08:07.580 --> 08:11.100
Basically, we're the primary financial account for people

08:11.100 --> 08:12.420
in the crypto economy.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.260
How they buy crypto, how they store it,

08:14.260 --> 08:16.140
how they use it increasingly in different ways.

08:16.140 --> 08:17.300
We can talk about that.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.820
So yeah, we wanna be the way that a billion people

08:20.820 --> 08:23.820
hopefully access the open financial system globally.

08:23.820 --> 08:24.820
How does it work?

08:27.180 --> 08:28.700
What's cryptocurrency?

08:29.660 --> 08:33.500
There's Bitcoin, there's Ethereum.

08:34.860 --> 08:37.380
What does it mean to be an exchange?

08:37.380 --> 08:39.020
What does it mean to store?

08:39.020 --> 08:41.260
What does it mean to transact?

08:41.260 --> 08:43.700
What does Coinbase actually do?

08:43.700 --> 08:46.740
Okay, so basically in any given market,

08:46.740 --> 08:47.900
there's some people who wanna buy,

08:47.900 --> 08:49.420
some people who wanna sell,

08:49.420 --> 08:53.340
and you keep an order book of all those prices.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.980
And then if someone's willing to buy

08:56.980 --> 08:59.860
for more than the lowest price someone's willing to sell,

08:59.860 --> 09:02.180
then you get a trade to execute.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.460
That's kind of how an exchange works underneath.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.820
And a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.

09:06.820 --> 09:09.020
You don't have to look at the whole order book

09:09.020 --> 09:10.700
and everything, but you just go in there and you say,

09:10.700 --> 09:14.060
I wanna buy $100 of Bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency.

09:14.060 --> 09:16.260
You get a quote, and if you like it, you can hit accept.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.500
And the core things that we do to make all that

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
kind of just work, make it seamless,

09:21.500 --> 09:23.100
it sounds simple on the surface,

09:23.100 --> 09:26.180
is we have to do payment integrations

09:26.180 --> 09:27.580
in a variety of places around the world

09:27.580 --> 09:29.580
to make it easy for people to get fiat currency

09:29.580 --> 09:31.780
into this ecosystem.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.780
We have to work on cybersecurity a lot.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.220
There's lots of hackers out there

09:35.220 --> 09:37.140
trying to break into our systems and steal crypto,

09:37.140 --> 09:39.900
or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts

09:39.900 --> 09:41.940
and things like that into these systems.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.500
We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves,

09:45.500 --> 09:48.420
which are periodically getting updated

09:48.420 --> 09:51.340
and having various airdrops and all kinds of things.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.500
So we're integrated with lots of different blockchains.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.580
And then we have to store the crypto

09:54.580 --> 09:57.060
that people buy securely as well.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.380
So crypto is kind of like storing,

09:59.380 --> 10:00.940
you store the private keys essentially.

10:00.940 --> 10:03.020
And we've invented a lot of cool technology

10:03.020 --> 10:06.980
about how to do that securely that helps me sleep at night

10:06.980 --> 10:09.540
as one of the largest crypto custodians out there.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.420
So those are some of the pieces that had to come together

10:12.420 --> 10:16.340
to get that early, simple buy-sell experience to work.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.860
And yeah, Coinbase actually has a lot

10:18.860 --> 10:20.020
of different products now.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.900
So we have like an institutional product.

10:21.940 --> 10:24.700
We have Coinbase Commerce, which is like merchant payments,

10:24.700 --> 10:26.180
like Stripe for crypto.

10:26.180 --> 10:28.780
We've got a self-custodial wallet, which we can talk about.

10:28.780 --> 10:30.340
There's all kinds of cool applications

10:30.340 --> 10:31.580
people are building with Web3,

10:31.580 --> 10:32.740
and they can access it through that.

10:32.740 --> 10:35.060
We just launched an NFT product.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.660
I can go on down the list.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.700
So we're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.020
We're big enough where we can do multiple things.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.940
But yeah, the core thing we got started with,

10:43.940 --> 10:45.540
and still the majority of our revenue today,

10:45.540 --> 10:48.700
is people just wanna come in and buy and sell some crypto.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.540
And we help them do that and make it simple and easy to use.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.900
I'll ask you about wallet, NFTs, about,

10:53.900 --> 10:55.420
what is it called, the Stripe type?

10:55.420 --> 10:56.700
Oh yeah, Coinbase Commerce.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.060
Coinbase Commerce.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.140
I'll ask you about all that.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.300
But order books and exchange,

11:01.300 --> 11:04.860
what's the difference between that and stocks, for example,

11:04.860 --> 11:06.500
which there's also order books?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.580
Yeah, so I mean, stocks trade through order books too,

11:08.580 --> 11:09.580
so do commodities.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.980
It's all a similar type of situation.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.140
So when I wanna buy one Bitcoin,

11:14.140 --> 11:17.700
and I see Coinbase say the price of that Bitcoin

11:17.700 --> 11:22.700
is say $40,000, and I press buy, what happens?

11:25.420 --> 11:27.220
Yeah, okay, so you've gotten a lot.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.940
When you press the button on your keyboard,

11:30.940 --> 11:32.860
like an electrical signal goes up the wire

11:32.860 --> 11:35.020
on your keyboard, no, it won't go down the level.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.740
That's also important, the timing, right?

11:36.740 --> 11:38.780
Because it's not price fixed.

11:38.780 --> 11:39.620
Yeah, that's true.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.020
It's giving you a quote, right?

11:42.900 --> 11:44.500
There's a whole concept of slippage,

11:44.500 --> 11:47.340
and by the time the quote is executed,

11:48.220 --> 11:50.740
if the price has moved too much, we may reject it,

11:50.740 --> 11:52.900
and there's various things like that.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.020
But what's the simple version I can give you?

11:55.020 --> 11:59.060
So we'll basically check the order book, give you a quote.

11:59.060 --> 12:00.580
It's good for some period of time,

12:00.580 --> 12:02.460
or for some amount of slippage.

12:02.460 --> 12:06.220
And then what's happening is we're initiating a debit

12:06.220 --> 12:08.100
to your payment method, whether that's a credit card

12:08.100 --> 12:11.260
or a bank account, or you're storing dollars or euros

12:11.260 --> 12:12.420
or something on our platform.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.820
There's various payment methods.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.580
So we're basically debiting that.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.540
And then we're crediting you the crypto,

12:17.540 --> 12:19.660
and we're taking a fee for it too.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.180
So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.140
And then there's just some interesting slippage.

12:26.140 --> 12:30.700
How do you calculate how much slippage is allowed?

12:30.700 --> 12:33.300
Like how do you know these things?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.260
Because order books are fascinating.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.380
The dynamics of that is pretty interesting,

12:39.380 --> 12:40.740
the little I know about it.

12:40.740 --> 12:43.740
Yeah, so there's a lot of people, like traders,

12:44.660 --> 12:46.820
who get super into this, and like high frequency traders

12:46.820 --> 12:49.220
and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.660
Flashboys was like an interesting book

12:50.660 --> 12:51.500
on this whole thing.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.580
You want like access to information the fastest,

12:54.580 --> 12:57.540
sometimes even putting your thing in the data center

12:57.540 --> 12:58.700
right next to the thing.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.140
We don't allow that colo stuff

13:00.140 --> 13:02.140
because we want it to be more democratized.

13:03.980 --> 13:07.620
But basically, let's say we wanted to just keep it math

13:07.620 --> 13:09.460
simple, we want to charge a 1% fee.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.980
So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin,

13:11.980 --> 13:14.820
$101, we've presented you the amount of Bitcoin

13:14.820 --> 13:16.300
you're gonna get for the $100.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.740
Now, let's say 10 seconds later you hit accept.

13:18.740 --> 13:20.980
We go to fill the order.

13:20.980 --> 13:25.380
So it's gonna be some error bound around that 1% fee,

13:25.380 --> 13:27.520
and if we think we're actually losing money on the trade,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.540
I think we'll often reject it.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.940
So some part of the fee,

13:31.940 --> 13:34.980
the slippage is incorporated into that,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.980
averaged over a large number of people.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.660
I mean, it's fascinating,

13:39.660 --> 13:41.540
because even just like that little detail

13:41.540 --> 13:44.260
probably requires a lot of experimentation.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.980
Yeah, and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there

13:46.980 --> 13:48.500
because if you get it wrong,

13:48.500 --> 13:50.020
there's people who are gonna arbitrage that.

13:50.020 --> 13:53.600
And we've had people sort of pen test our systems

13:53.600 --> 13:55.840
in really creative ways where like,

13:59.740 --> 14:01.300
programmatically with APIs,

14:01.300 --> 14:03.580
they'll fire off like a million different quotes

14:03.580 --> 14:05.300
and look for one of them that's out of bounds

14:05.300 --> 14:07.180
and then actually take that money right there.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.300
We get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.260
So how do you protect against that?

14:12.260 --> 14:13.340
How do you protect?

14:13.340 --> 14:15.820
So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways,

14:15.820 --> 14:18.180
but there's a lot of clever people

14:18.180 --> 14:20.900
trying to do clever things to earn,

14:20.900 --> 14:22.600
not even just to break into the system,

14:22.600 --> 14:26.260
but to earn an edge of some kind in the system.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.800
How do you stay one step ahead?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.660
There's no silver bullet,

14:29.660 --> 14:30.780
it's a bunch of lead bullets, right?

14:30.780 --> 14:34.640
So it's like, one thing we do is,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.180
we just have good test suites, right?

14:36.180 --> 14:38.420
So you're testing every piece of code that goes out.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.180
That's like just common, good best practice,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.900
but it's particularly important in financial services.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.980
Another thing we do is we hire third party firms

14:45.980 --> 14:48.060
to try to audit this stuff and break in.

14:48.060 --> 14:51.300
Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.420
So we basically pay white hat hackers

14:54.420 --> 14:56.820
to find this stuff before the black hats do.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.800
And we've paid out lots of good bug bounties.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.780
So try all the above.

15:02.780 --> 15:03.860
And occasionally you don't get it right

15:03.860 --> 15:05.420
and you lose some money and then you fix it

15:05.420 --> 15:07.380
and you keep going, so, yeah.

15:07.380 --> 15:10.420
Let's talk about cyber security a little bit more.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.220
You mentioned using stolen bank accounts.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.260
So that's another one, that's another interesting one.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.500
How do you protect against that?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.760
Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.160
So one of the, there's a lot of things people do,

15:23.160 --> 15:25.540
but one of the things they do is

15:25.540 --> 15:28.220
that you use machine learning, right?

15:28.220 --> 15:29.700
So you look at 100-

15:29.700 --> 15:30.980
To protect or to attack?

15:30.980 --> 15:32.460
To protect against it.

15:32.460 --> 15:37.060
So what you wanna do is build up a labeled data set

15:37.060 --> 15:40.380
of all the different people who have turned out

15:40.380 --> 15:42.720
to be fraudulent and good actors

15:42.720 --> 15:44.220
and hopefully collect as much data as you can.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.360
And then you might feed hundreds or thousands

15:46.360 --> 15:49.460
of these factors into your machine learning model

15:49.460 --> 15:51.580
and it'll come back with a risk score.

15:51.580 --> 15:55.540
So an example of the kinds of factors people create

15:55.540 --> 15:57.420
or put in there, obviously I don't wanna disclose

15:57.420 --> 15:59.740
too many of them, because it's a cat and mouse game,

15:59.740 --> 16:01.380
but just kind of, I don't know,

16:01.380 --> 16:03.300
relatively well-known stuff might be,

16:05.420 --> 16:06.900
you have device fingerprints, right?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.860
So what kind of device are you on

16:08.860 --> 16:10.380
and what fonts do you have installed?

16:10.380 --> 16:12.300
A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts,

16:12.300 --> 16:15.220
they're using emulators and virtual machines and stuff.

16:15.220 --> 16:18.160
They're not an average person on that device.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.180
And then you'll see sometimes,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.260
one of my favorite metrics we track for this

16:23.260 --> 16:26.120
was called improbable travel velocity.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.480
So we're tracking people's IPs, right?

16:28.480 --> 16:33.360
And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.000
and then like an hour later,

16:35.000 --> 16:36.200
they were in London or something.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.600
It's like, well, that's very improbable.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.560
I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.520
So you gotta be careful with that

16:40.520 --> 16:42.820
because there's legitimate people who use VPNs too.

16:42.820 --> 16:46.080
But if it's not possible for them

16:46.080 --> 16:47.660
to have gotten on a plane and gotten there that quickly,

16:47.660 --> 16:50.280
then that's usually they're spoofing a device or IP.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.560
Sometimes those are interesting factors.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.560
But yeah, if you feed enough of these in,

16:55.560 --> 16:57.920
you will, oh, another fun one is like,

16:59.500 --> 17:01.600
real users will type their credit card

17:01.600 --> 17:03.760
like one number at a time.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.320
Scammers have a list of them

17:05.320 --> 17:08.300
and they'll just paste in a whole number.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.800
So you can look at like the number of milliseconds

17:10.800 --> 17:11.920
between keystrokes.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.720
Like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.400
And even for travel velocity,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.760
you could probably incorporate VPNs too

17:17.760 --> 17:21.120
because there's probably a travel velocity

17:21.120 --> 17:23.440
for VPN switching too.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.520
That's human-like.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.360
Like if you're using legitimately VPN for something else,

17:27.360 --> 17:31.120
that might be, there's like legitimate uses too.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.720
Actually, I feel embarrassed that I don't know this.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.880
Probably should.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.440
But the I'm not a robot capture thing.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.760
Capture thing?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.640
So that probably works in the same way.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.080
Like how do you move your mouse maybe?

17:46.080 --> 17:49.000
Or the dynamics of the clicking?

17:49.000 --> 17:49.840
Totally.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.720
But how does that even work that well then?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.000
And why can't it be fake?

17:53.000 --> 17:53.960
I need to look into this.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.880
Cause it's such a trivial capture.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.800
It feels like it should be very crackable.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.400
And yet a lot of high security places use that.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.240
Yeah.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.060
It's really interesting.

18:04.060 --> 18:04.960
It's another cat and mouse game.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.000
So I think they've, yeah,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.480
but it's using a lot of similar signals

18:07.480 --> 18:10.280
like mouse movements, keystrokes,

18:10.280 --> 18:13.340
and then obviously all the stuff that comes over the wire

18:13.340 --> 18:14.220
with your browser.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.360
So like what operating system, what fonts,

18:17.360 --> 18:19.000
what headers are being sent over.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.960
And there's an old website,

18:22.000 --> 18:22.840
I can't remember what it was called.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.520
It was kind of like Panopticlick or Panopticon or something.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.600
But it basically was like a proof of concept site

18:27.600 --> 18:30.220
that they would just show you all the data

18:30.220 --> 18:33.120
that was kind of getting sent over with your request.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.200
And like say that there's only one person in the world

18:36.200 --> 18:37.480
who has this exact set of data.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.320
It's you.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.160
And so it's almost like a work around,

18:41.160 --> 18:43.840
a clever work around to track somebody,

18:43.840 --> 18:45.440
make, identify a unique person,

18:45.440 --> 18:48.360
even if like there wasn't a cookie involved or something.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.180
Yeah. This is a fascinating world

18:50.180 --> 18:51.320
where you can't see anybody.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.080
You're in the dark and yet you have a lot of signal

18:54.080 --> 18:56.280
and you have to figure out who's a real person, who's not,

18:56.280 --> 18:57.680
who's a robot, who's not.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.520
Yeah.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.340
Let me step back.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.480
We're gonna jump around all over the place.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.320
Great. Let me step back.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.140
That's why I like your interviews.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.120
You get into like technical topics.

19:04.120 --> 19:09.120
So just let's use Bitcoin as a measure of time.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.200
You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.480
Yeah.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.040
And you just mentioned an incredible system

19:17.040 --> 19:19.840
with security, with transactions.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.960
Everything is thought through.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.960
There's a lot going on, but what was version one

19:23.960 --> 19:25.120
back in those early days?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.800
The first prototype of Coinbase.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.080
What did that look like?

19:28.080 --> 19:28.900
Yeah.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.200
Like what did it take to write it, to think through it

19:33.200 --> 19:37.000
and make it work enough to at least make you believe

19:37.000 --> 19:38.640
that it's gonna work?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.120
Well, I definitely didn't know if it was gonna work.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.440
I mean, it was kind of,

19:41.440 --> 19:44.160
I felt like I was just following my gut.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.040
So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.120
I was a software engineer there, project manager.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.680
I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.320
And I read the Bitcoin white paper

19:55.320 --> 19:57.040
in kind of December of 2010.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.040
I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay area,

20:01.040 --> 20:02.320
met lots of interesting people there,

20:02.320 --> 20:04.800
like crazy people, anarchists,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.880
really brilliant people, all the above.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.760
And so I started nights and weekends trying to put together

20:10.760 --> 20:11.600
a prototype.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.480
And my initial thought was, well,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.720
SMTP is a protocol that runs email.

20:16.720 --> 20:21.120
And Git is a protocol for version control.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.360
But people made like Gmail and GitHub.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.480
Most people don't wanna run their own email server

20:25.480 --> 20:26.840
or even their own Git server.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.920
They just wanna like use a hosted thing

20:28.920 --> 20:31.680
that will do all the security and backups for them.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.280
So the thought in my head at that time was,

20:33.280 --> 20:34.600
Bitcoin is this new protocol.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.480
There's probably gonna be somebody who makes

20:36.480 --> 20:38.800
a hosted service that does all the security and backups

20:38.800 --> 20:42.080
for you, makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.840
So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet

20:45.840 --> 20:46.680
or something.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.560
That was my, it was gonna make Gmail for Bitcoin

20:48.560 --> 20:50.040
or something.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.840
And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.080
Like most of my smart friends who I told about it,

20:55.080 --> 20:58.000
they were like, well, first of all,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.440
I don't really get what you're doing at all.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.480
Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam or something

21:01.480 --> 21:02.920
you've gotten involved in.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.040
But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was

21:06.040 --> 21:07.080
told me they thought it was a dumb idea.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.960
Cause they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin,

21:09.960 --> 21:10.840
you're just gonna get hacked.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.800
Like nobody, you know, why would you do that?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.160
And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what?

21:18.160 --> 21:21.120
I'm not gonna go all in and like make a store

21:21.120 --> 21:21.960
everyone's Bitcoin.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.800
That would be too much right now.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.040
I have a job, I have a day job, you know?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.240
But let me just make a prototype and I'll tell people

21:27.240 --> 21:29.280
this is like a beta thing, like don't put any real money

21:29.280 --> 21:31.080
in it and just see if there's interest.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.240
And if I feel like I'm onto something,

21:32.240 --> 21:33.840
maybe I'll go do this as a company.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.440
Cause I did, I really wanted to be an entrepreneur

21:35.440 --> 21:36.280
at that time.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.640
I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30

21:38.640 --> 21:40.480
and I was, I always wanted to like start a company,

21:40.480 --> 21:43.520
but I was, I was, you know, I wasn't yet.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.040
I was an employee at a company that was great.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.760
But so anyway, I had this prototype.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.320
I was hacking together nights and weekends.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.900
I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby,

21:53.900 --> 21:54.880
which turned out to be a,

21:54.880 --> 21:56.280
maybe a weird decision in hindsight

21:56.280 --> 21:57.960
cause Ruby wasn't the most performant language.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.680
We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times,

21:59.680 --> 22:03.120
but yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.000
And the thing that I didn't have any users for it,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.520
by the way, I applied to Y Combinator cause I was like,

22:08.520 --> 22:10.700
maybe if somebody there writes me a check,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.320
this will like make it feel like a real company.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.160
And I was trying to find,

22:13.160 --> 22:16.120
I was trying to find a co-founder at that time unsuccessfully.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.200
So I was basically just wandering in the desert.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.480
I had a lot of self doubt about this.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.840
Cause I was like, I don't know,

22:21.840 --> 22:24.200
all my friends don't think this is kind of dumb

22:24.200 --> 22:27.400
and maybe Bitcoin is just going to get shut down.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.020
And like, this is all be some stupid thing.

22:29.020 --> 22:32.160
So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost

22:32.160 --> 22:33.860
in the desert, lots of self doubt.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.200
Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group

22:37.200 --> 22:38.560
kind of wrote me the first check

22:38.560 --> 22:39.860
after I went and interviewed and stuff.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.380
And they wrote me a check for like 150 K.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.020
And that was the first time somebody

22:44.020 --> 22:45.980
who I really looked up to kind of said,

22:45.980 --> 22:47.540
this is worth pursuing.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.240
Like maybe you're onto something, maybe you're not,

22:49.240 --> 22:50.940
but like, let's at least try it.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.740
And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence

22:53.740 --> 22:55.420
to quit my job and try it.

22:55.420 --> 22:58.740
And I'll wrap the story here by saying that,

22:58.740 --> 23:02.860
like I found the right co-founder after Y Combinator.

23:02.860 --> 23:03.980
We still didn't have any customers.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.920
The thing that, I basically launched

23:05.920 --> 23:07.600
the hosted Bitcoin wallet.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.100
There were people signing up.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.300
I just posted on Reddit and places like that.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.300
And maybe like 100 people would sign up

23:13.300 --> 23:14.980
and then nobody would come back.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.300
And so I was like, I just, in Y Combinator,

23:18.300 --> 23:20.300
they often tell you like,

23:20.300 --> 23:21.860
talk to your customers and improve your product.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.140
Talk to your customers, improve your product.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.220
That's all you're supposed to be doing.

23:24.220 --> 23:25.740
Try to find product market fit.

23:25.740 --> 23:28.820
So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up

23:28.820 --> 23:30.540
and I was like, hey, I worked on this app.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.380
I saw you signed up.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.200
Can I get on the phone with you?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.420
I get on the phone with like five of these folks.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.820
And I was like, why didn't you come back?

23:36.820 --> 23:38.860
And the guy was like, well, the app was okay

23:39.500 --> 23:41.620
for a beta, but like I don't have any Bitcoins.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.380
So I didn't really know what to do with it.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.980
And I remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head.

23:44.980 --> 23:48.020
I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there,

23:48.900 --> 23:49.740
would you have used it?

23:49.740 --> 23:51.500
And he was like, yeah, maybe.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.180
So then I had this, we went about the process.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.340
My co-founder at that time, we like got,

23:56.340 --> 23:57.900
basically you had to get like a bank partnership,

23:57.900 --> 23:59.300
payment rails, you know, an exchange,

23:59.300 --> 24:00.420
basic exchange functionality,

24:00.420 --> 24:03.620
all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place.

24:03.620 --> 24:05.340
And the minute we launched that feature

24:05.340 --> 24:06.260
where you could just click buy,

24:06.260 --> 24:08.060
put in your bank counter credit card, buy it,

24:08.060 --> 24:09.580
buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.420
From that day forward,

24:10.420 --> 24:12.620
like the number of users started to go up like this.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.980
And so we finally had found product market fit

24:14.980 --> 24:17.180
after two years of wandering in the desert.

24:17.180 --> 24:20.500
So you weren't even thinking about to buy the, on ramps.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.100
You would think it would be just the wallet,

24:22.100 --> 24:26.380
a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten.

24:26.380 --> 24:27.500
Yeah. Okay.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.140
This is, I mean, cause that's such a pain to do,

24:31.140 --> 24:34.380
to have to work with others to convert dollars

24:34.380 --> 24:37.860
of any fiat currency into Bitcoin.

24:38.420 --> 24:42.700
So did you, I mean, were you overwhelmed

24:42.700 --> 24:45.460
by the immensity of the task here,

24:45.460 --> 24:50.460
or were you just sort of not allowing yourself

24:51.900 --> 24:53.900
to think too deeply through this whole thing

24:53.900 --> 24:57.220
and just letting the optimism take over here?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.580
You know, I was really looking forward

25:00.580 --> 25:03.340
to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.

25:03.340 --> 25:08.340
And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that

25:09.580 --> 25:12.300
where, you know, I'm very determined, right?

25:12.300 --> 25:14.820
And especially when I get like very set on something

25:14.820 --> 25:15.700
and I'm just like, you know what?

25:15.700 --> 25:18.420
I'm gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work.

25:18.420 --> 25:19.700
Like no matter what.

25:19.700 --> 25:23.140
And so I reveled in that.

25:23.140 --> 25:26.220
I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups

25:26.220 --> 25:28.140
and like every startup has these like, you know,

25:28.140 --> 25:30.340
major setbacks and just like nothing works.

25:30.340 --> 25:31.180
And so-

25:31.220 --> 25:33.460
So that was a sign that you're doing something right.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all,

25:35.460 --> 25:38.020
but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience

25:38.020 --> 25:38.860
of it in a weird way.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.700
It felt stressful at the time, like, you know,

25:41.700 --> 25:44.420
nothing was working and, but I was just,

25:44.420 --> 25:47.220
I felt like I was on the right path somehow.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.180
And so I just kept going.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.020
I don't know.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.900
What was the darkest moment that you've gone to

25:53.900 --> 25:56.460
in your mind during that time?

25:56.460 --> 25:58.660
What were some of the tougher moments?

25:58.660 --> 26:00.460
You said self-doubt.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.900
Yeah.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.740
Have you, yeah, where'd you go?

26:04.740 --> 26:06.180
Where'd you go in your mind?

26:07.980 --> 26:10.500
Is there a moment where you're just like laying there?

26:10.500 --> 26:12.260
This is, this is hopeless.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.540
Well, there's a couple of moments I'm remembering.

26:15.540 --> 26:18.300
I mean, so for whatever reason,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.820
I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.420
And I was like, I really want to do something important

26:23.420 --> 26:24.260
in the world.

26:24.260 --> 26:26.300
Like, you know, I could have a good life

26:26.300 --> 26:27.900
and like work for some good companies

26:27.900 --> 26:29.140
and write some software.

26:29.140 --> 26:30.700
And I'm, for some reason,

26:30.700 --> 26:31.980
I never wanted that for myself.

26:31.980 --> 26:33.380
That probably would have been healthier, honestly,

26:33.380 --> 26:35.900
just to like, as an expected value outcome,

26:35.900 --> 26:38.060
that's probably a better thing in life.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.300
But I was like, I was like, man,

26:40.300 --> 26:41.980
I really want to do something important

26:41.980 --> 26:43.180
and have a bigger impact.

26:43.180 --> 26:46.260
And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.

26:46.260 --> 26:49.660
I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.

26:49.660 --> 26:50.700
I remember one of the,

26:50.700 --> 26:52.820
just for like years working on this stuff,

26:52.820 --> 26:55.980
I remember one of the darker moments was,

26:56.980 --> 27:00.100
we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.540
And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened

27:03.540 --> 27:04.380
like all at once.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.620
And it was, so first of all,

27:06.620 --> 27:08.820
you have to remember at this time,

27:08.820 --> 27:10.380
we were all very sleep deprived,

27:10.380 --> 27:11.860
which kind of exacerbates everything.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.420
If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill

27:14.420 --> 27:16.260
and all these like natural disasters,

27:16.260 --> 27:18.420
like sleep deprivation is often involved.

27:18.420 --> 27:20.900
So, because the reason why we were so sleep deprived

27:20.900 --> 27:22.060
is not just because we were working so much,

27:22.060 --> 27:24.540
but like the site would go offline

27:24.540 --> 27:25.660
in the middle of the night and we'd get,

27:26.260 --> 27:27.180
I was like on pager duty.

27:27.180 --> 27:29.420
So I'd get woken up sometimes like two or three times a night,

27:29.420 --> 27:31.940
like have to try to fix something, go back to sleep.

27:31.940 --> 27:36.940
So in that environment, you can kind of get discouraged.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.380
So one bad thing that happened was

27:39.380 --> 27:40.660
we had a bug on the website

27:40.660 --> 27:43.740
and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter

27:43.740 --> 27:46.660
who were all like pissed at Coinbase

27:46.660 --> 27:48.340
because like the balances were showing wrong.

27:48.340 --> 27:51.580
And they were just like, fuck this company, it's over.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.500
Like, I hate these guys.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.300
And so that was, I'd never had this feeling

27:55.300 --> 27:57.460
of a thousand people mad at me at the same time.

27:57.460 --> 27:58.820
I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy.

27:58.820 --> 28:00.420
Like most of the time people don't get mad at me.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.060
So that was one.

28:02.060 --> 28:03.420
Another one was that-

28:03.420 --> 28:04.260
Can we pause on that?

28:04.260 --> 28:05.220
That's so interesting.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.100
So you were saying like, here's a dream,

28:07.100 --> 28:08.660
I'm trying to create something

28:08.660 --> 28:13.180
and now forever the reputation of this dream is ruined.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.860
It will never, it's irrecoverable, it's over.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.220
That kind of feeling.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.660
Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right.

28:18.660 --> 28:21.620
I didn't know at that time I was like, is this the end?

28:22.140 --> 28:23.140
That's what the end looks like.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.140
We're so tiny now, everybody hates us.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.340
So is it over?

28:28.820 --> 28:30.820
Nobody told me this before starting a company

28:30.820 --> 28:33.620
that like a bunch of people will hate you for this,

28:33.620 --> 28:35.260
which is like a very counterintuitive thing.

28:35.260 --> 28:38.660
Cause most companies I think are doing good things

28:38.660 --> 28:39.820
in the world, at least you're trying.

28:39.820 --> 28:41.980
And so even if someone's like trying,

28:41.980 --> 28:43.940
but they're failing, I'm generally rooting for them,

28:43.940 --> 28:45.380
at least you're trying.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.140
But that's not the case at all.

28:47.140 --> 28:50.180
And most founders I've known have gone through this too,

28:50.180 --> 28:52.620
where they're very surprised

28:52.620 --> 28:54.140
at the amount of hate that they get.

28:54.140 --> 28:55.940
And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle

28:55.940 --> 28:57.700
you can build your tolerance to it.

28:57.700 --> 29:01.420
Like, because, you know, you go talk to somebody who's like,

29:01.420 --> 29:02.380
for you, it feels terrible

29:02.380 --> 29:03.580
cause you're at the center of this storm.

29:03.580 --> 29:06.380
And like, but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know,

29:06.380 --> 29:08.100
your family or some other person, like, dude,

29:08.100 --> 29:09.020
I didn't even hear about that.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.300
Like my, they're just busy in their own life.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.420
And so they, they have no idea

29:13.420 --> 29:16.500
that you had all this negative press or like whatever it was.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.020
Can I once again put a linger on that?

29:19.020 --> 29:19.860
Yeah.

29:20.420 --> 29:23.540
There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up,

29:23.540 --> 29:26.500
just as an example, Bill Gates.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.660
Yeah.

29:27.660 --> 29:31.580
So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.

29:31.580 --> 29:32.420
Yeah.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.260
And there's something about him,

29:34.260 --> 29:35.460
this is me talking, not you,

29:35.460 --> 29:38.980
that he seems out of touch about that hate.

29:40.020 --> 29:43.500
I believe, at least in my understanding,

29:43.500 --> 29:46.260
that with the resources he has,

29:46.260 --> 29:49.540
he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.660
And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate,

29:52.660 --> 29:54.980
conspiracy theories and stuff like that.

29:54.980 --> 29:57.980
And it feels like that's the case

29:57.980 --> 30:02.100
because he's somehow out of touch with people.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.340
So I wonder how you stay in touch

30:04.340 --> 30:05.540
with the voice of the people

30:05.540 --> 30:08.820
without being destroyed by the outrage.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.860
Is there any wisdom you have to that?

30:10.860 --> 30:12.940
I don't know about wisdom,

30:12.940 --> 30:14.460
but I've thought about this too,

30:14.460 --> 30:19.100
because yeah, you want to always be open to feedback,

30:19.140 --> 30:20.420
especially from people who have

30:20.420 --> 30:22.420
your best interests at heart.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.500
And you can become isolated from it

30:25.500 --> 30:28.380
and just surrounded by yes people.

30:28.380 --> 30:33.180
And who knows, maybe she and Putin and people like that

30:33.180 --> 30:35.220
are in situations, I have no idea.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.140
But if you listen to too much of it

30:39.140 --> 30:40.300
and you just try to please everyone,

30:40.300 --> 30:41.500
you'll never get anything done.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.940
And most of the best leaders are people

30:44.940 --> 30:47.940
who they can act when they believe

30:47.940 --> 30:49.780
that they're doing something net positive

30:49.780 --> 30:51.580
for the world and humanity.

30:51.580 --> 30:52.740
And they actually don't really care

30:52.740 --> 30:55.620
if they piss off some proportion of the people.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.220
Almost anything you're gonna do of significance

30:58.220 --> 31:01.100
in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people,

31:01.100 --> 31:04.860
maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don't know.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.740
So you never wanna become so surrounded

31:07.740 --> 31:09.740
by people who just work for you and will say yes.

31:09.740 --> 31:11.500
And then you think like, well, I'm a genius

31:11.500 --> 31:14.180
and that's how you become a dictator or whatever.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.700
But you also can't care so much

31:16.700 --> 31:18.060
about what people think,

31:18.060 --> 31:19.300
because then you'll never do anything

31:19.300 --> 31:21.580
that's truly authentic to yourself.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.780
One other thought on that, by the way,

31:22.780 --> 31:25.140
I think it's a really good question.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.540
So I've thought about this a lot,

31:26.540 --> 31:29.580
like why people generally kind of hate on Zuck

31:29.580 --> 31:32.340
and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on,

31:33.420 --> 31:34.820
they don't really hate on Elon.

31:34.820 --> 31:36.020
Well, actually Elon has a lot of haters too,

31:36.020 --> 31:37.380
but it's a different thing.

31:37.380 --> 31:39.460
This is measured, this is measured.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.220
I was looking at some surveys.

31:41.220 --> 31:45.540
So I think Zuck is the most loved and hated, right?

31:45.540 --> 31:46.540
Yeah.

31:47.380 --> 31:50.740
Zuck is the most, both loved and hated.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.300
He's the most hated.

31:52.300 --> 31:55.300
And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there.

31:55.300 --> 31:59.900
I think it's like a 40% hate Zuck people asked.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.660
And then Elon is in the double digits,

32:02.660 --> 32:04.580
but low double digits.

32:04.580 --> 32:05.420
It's interesting.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.100
You just look at this data, ask yourself why.

32:08.100 --> 32:08.940
Right.

32:08.940 --> 32:10.420
So I ask myself this sometimes too,

32:10.420 --> 32:13.100
because I don't claim to know any of these people well,

32:13.100 --> 32:15.100
but like I've met them briefly

32:15.100 --> 32:17.780
and my impression is that they're actually all smart people

32:17.780 --> 32:18.820
trying to do good things in the world.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.180
So there's not too much difference there

32:21.180 --> 32:23.300
despite public perception.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.460
So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?

32:25.460 --> 32:28.100
I mean, it's a complicated question.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.300
Obviously Zuck and his Facebook got blamed

32:31.300 --> 32:34.300
for the whole election thing and all that didn't help.

32:34.300 --> 32:38.180
Social media has gotten a lot of pressure just from like,

32:38.180 --> 32:40.820
hey, why aren't you solving all of society's tough problems?

32:40.820 --> 32:42.660
It's like, well, they're just one company.

32:42.660 --> 32:47.660
But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of these people,

32:48.020 --> 32:49.340
they have like Asperger's, right?

32:49.340 --> 32:50.180
A little bit.

32:50.180 --> 32:53.380
And sometimes people with Asperger's

32:53.380 --> 32:54.780
don't really emote in the same way.

32:54.780 --> 32:57.060
And so I think it's almost a form of like

33:00.900 --> 33:05.860
bias against their cognitive type or something,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.980
which is like that person doesn't emote right.

33:07.980 --> 33:11.300
I don't trust their intentions.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.420
And the other thing I've thought about too

33:14.420 --> 33:16.900
is that sometimes I think some leaders,

33:18.020 --> 33:19.300
like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates,

33:19.300 --> 33:22.980
they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.900
Like they're basically,

33:24.900 --> 33:26.980
they're giving the PR approved answers

33:26.980 --> 33:29.700
where Elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.060
So even if people hate what he says,

33:31.060 --> 33:33.260
they're like, at least I believe it's authentic.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.940
So I've always thought about that too for myself.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.500
I'm like, how do I,

33:36.500 --> 33:38.460
cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?

33:38.460 --> 33:39.940
Like if you just come out and you're like saying

33:39.940 --> 33:42.220
whatever stream of consciousness,

33:42.220 --> 33:44.660
you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team

33:44.660 --> 33:47.460
or like saying tripping over some like regulation

33:47.460 --> 33:48.420
that you, you know,

33:49.660 --> 33:51.420
there's all kinds of things about running a public company.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.100
You know, you can't say certain stuff,

33:53.100 --> 33:56.300
but if you're too PR approved and your answer is like,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.260
nobody trusts you what you're saying.

33:58.260 --> 34:00.460
And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.

34:00.460 --> 34:01.500
I don't think I have the right answer,

34:01.500 --> 34:02.780
but I'm trying to find that balance.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.340
And more and more with the internet,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.220
there's a premium on authenticity,

34:06.220 --> 34:07.540
just like you're saying.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.020
People really, really appreciate that.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.940
So for leaders, it's a challenge to be,

34:11.940 --> 34:15.580
how do I make sure I'm authentic,

34:15.580 --> 34:19.580
but also don't say stupid shit.

34:19.580 --> 34:20.940
And so that's an interesting thing.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.660
I've noticed that just having interacted

34:23.660 --> 34:28.660
with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful

34:28.860 --> 34:31.900
how much you surround yourself with PR folks.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.380
Cause the best I would say,

34:33.380 --> 34:36.300
let me just say a nice thing about marketing and PR folks,

34:36.340 --> 34:40.700
the best marketing folks are extremely good.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.660
So they understand exactly what great marketing is

34:43.660 --> 34:46.060
and great PR, it's authenticity.

34:46.060 --> 34:48.300
It's showing, revealing the beauty,

34:48.300 --> 34:51.500
as opposed to PR and marketing out of fear.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.420
Oh, don't say that, don't say this, don't say that.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.140
Because then you start living in this kind of,

34:57.140 --> 34:58.500
that pushes you towards a bubble

34:58.500 --> 35:01.460
where you can't express your beautiful quirks

35:01.460 --> 35:03.220
and weirdness and all that kind of stuff.

35:03.220 --> 35:06.100
And also the cool, the beautiful things

35:06.100 --> 35:07.140
about what you're doing.

35:07.140 --> 35:10.260
I find like, especially with the tech thing,

35:10.260 --> 35:12.140
like even like Coinbase,

35:12.140 --> 35:15.100
the way to reveal the beauty of it

35:15.100 --> 35:18.460
is not only by showing all the things you could do with it,

35:18.460 --> 35:20.660
but showing that there's great engineering

35:20.660 --> 35:22.180
going on underneath.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.780
So letting the nerds shine too.

35:23.780 --> 35:28.540
It doesn't have to be like these kind of commercials

35:28.540 --> 35:33.540
where it's like a happy family using Coinbase

35:33.540 --> 35:36.700
to send a transaction about flowers for mom

35:36.700 --> 35:37.700
or something like that.

35:37.700 --> 35:41.620
Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.

35:41.620 --> 35:45.300
So that's a general observation I made.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.980
But you said you were talking about dark moments

35:46.980 --> 35:49.100
and that there's people on the internet

35:49.100 --> 35:51.220
that were pissed off that the site was down

35:51.220 --> 35:54.100
and you said there might be something else.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.900
Yeah, so sleep deprived,

35:55.900 --> 35:57.820
like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me,

35:57.820 --> 35:59.460
the balances were fucked up,

35:59.460 --> 36:01.260
like people were tweeting the companies over,

36:01.260 --> 36:03.620
just give the money back, whatever.

36:03.620 --> 36:07.820
And then, oh yeah, somebody posted,

36:07.820 --> 36:08.740
so we had all this,

36:08.740 --> 36:11.340
we started to get all these customer support inquiries

36:11.340 --> 36:14.260
and like we only had like a few people at the company

36:14.260 --> 36:18.020
and so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests

36:18.020 --> 36:19.780
so people couldn't get ahold of us.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.860
So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit

36:22.860 --> 36:24.260
and they were like,

36:24.260 --> 36:25.860
if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever,

36:25.860 --> 36:28.300
because everyone's upset about where their money is.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.060
So I remember we're in the office,

36:30.460 --> 36:31.460
it's like late at night,

36:31.460 --> 36:32.700
we've been working like 12 hours,

36:32.700 --> 36:33.540
we're all sleep deprived,

36:33.540 --> 36:36.620
I'm trying to hack and like get this bug fixed

36:36.620 --> 36:38.660
and we all need like food at the office.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.020
And so my phone has been blowing up all day

36:41.020 --> 36:43.020
because someone posted my phone number on the internet

36:43.020 --> 36:44.140
and there's like a guy,

36:45.380 --> 36:46.980
there was a guy like trying to deliver food

36:46.980 --> 36:48.500
and I needed to answer my phone

36:48.500 --> 36:50.420
to like get the food from downstairs.

36:50.420 --> 36:53.020
So I was like, shit, I gotta just see if that's him.

36:53.020 --> 36:55.940
So I started answering the call and it's like,

36:55.940 --> 36:56.780
is this Brian?

36:56.780 --> 36:58.460
I'm like, nope, wrong number, click, you know.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.900
And I pick up the next call,

37:00.900 --> 37:02.620
it's like every way when I finished the call,

37:02.620 --> 37:03.620
another call is like coming in.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.380
So I was like, I'm a reporter from Japan

37:06.380 --> 37:08.020
like asking about a security,

37:08.020 --> 37:09.020
nope, wrong number, click.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.100
And then I like finally I get the delivery guy downstairs,

37:11.100 --> 37:11.940
bring the food up,

37:11.940 --> 37:15.180
we were all like surviving to like fix this bug.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.940
I remember there was just basically a point that night

37:18.940 --> 37:20.620
where I was like, fuck, I need to just,

37:20.620 --> 37:24.420
I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor

37:24.420 --> 37:27.300
and I just like cried for a little bit.

37:28.260 --> 37:30.860
I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self-pity,

37:30.860 --> 37:32.580
kind of took a nap for about five minutes

37:32.580 --> 37:34.980
and I was like, let's fucking solve this.

37:34.980 --> 37:38.140
And I like, you know, stop being like a little whatever

37:38.140 --> 37:39.220
and like got back up.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.020
Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress

37:42.020 --> 37:44.540
and the pressure of the site going down

37:44.540 --> 37:46.900
and everybody wants the site to be up,

37:46.900 --> 37:48.460
just the pressure from people

37:48.460 --> 37:51.180
and the number of users is growing and growing and growing.

37:51.180 --> 37:53.580
So that pressure is just mentally tough.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.420
Yeah.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.380
What was your source of strength during that time?

37:58.340 --> 38:02.100
Like what, like somebody that patted you on the back

38:02.100 --> 38:04.140
and said, we got this.

38:04.140 --> 38:04.980
Yeah.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.780
Well, it definitely helped to have a co-founder.

38:06.780 --> 38:10.020
So, you know, there's like that old saying about

38:10.020 --> 38:12.260
it's better to be in a great relationship than to be single,

38:12.260 --> 38:13.980
but it's better to be single than being in a bad relationship.

38:13.980 --> 38:17.300
So co-founders actually blow up a lot of companies too,

38:17.300 --> 38:18.660
but when you find the right co-founder,

38:18.660 --> 38:21.540
which I was lucky to find with Fred Ersam,

38:21.540 --> 38:22.500
that was very important.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.940
There was definitely moments where, you know,

38:24.940 --> 38:28.860
I was like kind of, you know, at the wits end or whatever.

38:28.860 --> 38:31.620
And he was like, he's like, dude, let's rally.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.460
Like, and he basically carried the team, you know,

38:33.460 --> 38:35.460
a couple of times, like in really key moments.

38:35.460 --> 38:39.060
What advice would you give to startup founders

38:39.060 --> 38:41.540
about this particular stage,

38:41.540 --> 38:44.500
about surviving it to the five

38:44.500 --> 38:47.060
and through the five employee stage where you-

38:47.060 --> 38:47.900
Yeah.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.940
Well, if your pre-product market fit,

38:50.020 --> 38:52.740
the best advice that I have from that period

38:52.740 --> 38:55.780
is action produces information.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.780
So just like keep doing stuff, you know?

38:58.780 --> 39:01.980
I remember like Paul Graham-

39:01.980 --> 39:02.820
Good lines, a good line.

39:02.820 --> 39:03.660
Yeah.

39:03.660 --> 39:05.620
Paul Graham had this great line like that.

39:05.620 --> 39:06.460
I think that's his line.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.540
And he was like, startups are like sharks.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.700
If they stop swimming, they die, you know?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.300
So even if you're like not sure what to do,

39:12.300 --> 39:14.420
like just do anything because when you do it,

39:14.420 --> 39:16.140
it'll produce some information.

39:16.140 --> 39:17.620
Like people liked it, they didn't.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.620
This was very true for me.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.540
There was times where I just did something

39:22.660 --> 39:24.700
instead of debating it endlessly and like just try it,

39:24.700 --> 39:26.260
you know, like, all right, so we shipped it.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.780
And like, there was a couple of times

39:27.780 --> 39:29.660
where like the minute I shipped it,

39:29.660 --> 39:32.900
I was like, I know we built this wrong,

39:32.900 --> 39:34.380
but now I have an idea of what to do next.

39:34.380 --> 39:36.500
And it wasn't, I only would have had the idea

39:36.500 --> 39:37.940
if we'd actually gone through the exercise

39:37.940 --> 39:38.940
of going to build it.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.260
It's like, my other favorite analogy for this

39:41.260 --> 39:44.020
is that you're like at the base of a mountain

39:44.020 --> 39:45.980
that's shrouded in fog,

39:45.980 --> 39:47.100
and you're looking up at the mountain

39:47.100 --> 39:47.980
and you're trying to think like,

39:47.980 --> 39:49.020
okay, how do I get up there?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.020
But you can only see like three or four steps ahead

39:51.020 --> 39:52.620
because the fog is so thick.

39:52.620 --> 39:55.940
So you have to just take steps into the unknown.

39:55.940 --> 39:57.700
And when you take three steps,

39:57.700 --> 39:59.980
another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.940
And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum,

40:01.940 --> 40:04.100
you'll have to retrace your steps or whatever,

40:04.100 --> 40:06.020
or come up to a cliff, you know?

40:06.020 --> 40:11.020
But most people in life don't take the steps into the fog,

40:11.460 --> 40:14.180
into the unknown because it's scary.

40:14.180 --> 40:15.860
Or they're like, I don't know, what if I fail?

40:15.860 --> 40:17.660
Or like, I don't know how that's gonna work.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.500
Or I might run out of money

40:18.500 --> 40:19.820
or I won't be able to get a job after,

40:19.820 --> 40:21.700
or I don't know, whatever reason.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.540
But that is like one of the things that separates,

40:24.540 --> 40:27.180
I think, entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination

40:27.180 --> 40:31.740
is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance,

40:31.740 --> 40:33.900
but it's actually not really risky if you think about it.

40:33.900 --> 40:38.180
It's not like, you know, at least in most places,

40:38.180 --> 40:40.820
like if you go to a startup and it fails,

40:40.820 --> 40:44.180
like you're even more valuable to your next employer, right?

40:44.180 --> 40:47.260
Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary,

40:47.260 --> 40:49.060
try it for like two years or three years.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.540
If it doesn't work, go get another job.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.820
It's not like you weren't paying yourself a salary

40:52.820 --> 40:53.660
during that time.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.540
So I think people overestimate the risk of doing a startup

40:56.540 --> 41:00.940
and they never start because it seems crazy

41:00.940 --> 41:02.140
and all your friends think it's silly.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.620
Like, that's sort of the default nature

41:03.620 --> 41:05.620
of every big startup idea.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.820
It's just basic fear.

41:06.820 --> 41:10.140
It's the same kind of fear that if you see a guy

41:10.140 --> 41:11.700
see a cute girl at a bar,

41:11.700 --> 41:14.300
it's the fear associated with coming up to her,

41:14.300 --> 41:15.820
you like her, asking her.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.180
It's like, what's the actual risk exactly?

41:18.180 --> 41:19.340
Right.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.900
She'll say, no thanks, I'm not interested.

41:20.900 --> 41:21.740
No thanks.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.380
I guess the risk is like,

41:23.380 --> 41:26.020
that's going to be mentally difficult

41:26.020 --> 41:27.700
to deal with rejection.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.700
So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.780
If you had a bunch of ideas and you're excited about them

41:33.780 --> 41:37.140
and you implement them and you realize they're not good,

41:37.140 --> 41:40.380
that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.

41:40.380 --> 41:41.860
But I suppose that's life.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.580
You're supposed to persevere through the failures

41:46.580 --> 41:48.100
and then the risk is low.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.100
So that's, and then the whole time through the fog,

41:50.100 --> 41:52.380
up the mountain, you're looking for product market fit.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.340
Yeah, that's right.

41:53.340 --> 41:55.620
So you know you have it when the usage of your product

41:55.620 --> 41:57.420
keeps growing without any marketing dollars

41:57.420 --> 41:58.260
or anything like that.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.700
It's just like more people keep coming back

41:59.700 --> 42:01.180
every week or month.

42:01.180 --> 42:04.420
So you're basically watching your stats.

42:04.420 --> 42:05.860
Nothing is working.

42:05.860 --> 42:09.380
You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics

42:09.380 --> 42:11.380
and you basically just keep talking to customers,

42:11.980 --> 42:12.820
improving the product.

42:12.820 --> 42:13.900
Talk to customers, improve the product.

42:13.900 --> 42:16.300
Talk to customers, improve the product.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.300
And try not to run out of money, so be really scrappy.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.340
And then if you're lucky, you hit some kind of threshold

42:22.340 --> 42:24.060
where like, okay, the thing is good enough now

42:24.060 --> 42:25.140
or we hit on some use case

42:25.140 --> 42:28.340
and then it'll organically start to grow a bit.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.740
And then you have a whole different set of problems

42:30.740 --> 42:31.700
once you hit product market fit,

42:31.700 --> 42:34.220
which is how do we scale this thing?

42:34.220 --> 42:35.700
How do we hire people?

42:35.700 --> 42:40.060
How do we hire an executive team or raise more money?

42:40.060 --> 42:43.100
So the problems totally change, but yeah.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
You were there through the whole thing.

42:45.100 --> 42:48.100
So that's the other question that's fascinating.

42:48.100 --> 42:50.980
Again, back to the girl at the bar,

42:50.980 --> 42:52.260
how do you hire people?

42:52.260 --> 42:55.340
It's like, how do you find good friends?

42:55.340 --> 42:57.780
How do you find good relationships?

42:57.780 --> 43:01.100
And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?

43:01.100 --> 43:04.940
Engineers, executive, all of it.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.740
One thing is I've done a lot of reps on hiring

43:06.740 --> 43:07.580
at this point.

43:08.540 --> 43:10.660
Coinbase has about 5,000 people,

43:12.020 --> 43:14.420
probably the first 500 people or something

43:14.420 --> 43:15.580
maybe in that range.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.180
I interviewed every single one of those,

43:18.180 --> 43:20.740
but you have to remember there's probably like,

43:20.740 --> 43:22.500
I don't know, on average, maybe 10 people

43:22.500 --> 43:24.140
that we went in the process

43:24.140 --> 43:25.300
for every one we hired or something.

43:25.300 --> 43:29.340
So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees,

43:29.340 --> 43:31.260
I had done like 5,000 interviews or something.

43:31.260 --> 43:32.860
I was like very burned out at interviews.

43:32.860 --> 43:36.380
I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews

43:36.380 --> 43:39.780
in a day or maybe, you would do lots of interviews,

43:39.780 --> 43:40.700
maybe you wouldn't get burned out,

43:40.700 --> 43:42.460
but different kind of interviews.

43:42.460 --> 43:44.980
Very different, very different, very different

43:44.980 --> 43:49.180
because you're, so first of all,

43:49.180 --> 43:51.420
most of your interviews lead to rejection.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.540
Yeah.

43:52.540 --> 43:54.740
Which is also exhausting.

43:54.740 --> 43:57.420
Yeah, and there's a whole part of the interview

43:57.420 --> 43:59.140
which is about candidate experience, right?

43:59.140 --> 44:00.860
Sometimes you know it's not the right person,

44:00.860 --> 44:03.020
but you wanna make sure they have a good experience.

44:03.020 --> 44:05.060
If you're just exhausted and you're on your sixth interview

44:05.060 --> 44:06.820
and you're like, well, thanks for coming in

44:06.820 --> 44:08.620
and you wrap and you just, and then like,

44:08.620 --> 44:10.460
you're gonna create a detractor, someone who's out there

44:10.460 --> 44:12.700
like fuck that company or Brian was rude to me or whatever.

44:12.700 --> 44:15.100
So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit

44:15.100 --> 44:16.700
in the early days because I was doing so many interviews.

44:16.700 --> 44:20.060
Like I needed to make sure that when people came in,

44:20.060 --> 44:22.580
I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable.

44:23.580 --> 44:25.260
Ask them a couple of like warmup questions.

44:25.260 --> 44:27.060
It's like, oh, how was it getting in the office?

44:27.060 --> 44:27.980
Like, did you find it okay?

44:27.980 --> 44:29.220
And like, what have you been up to this week?

44:29.220 --> 44:32.740
And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line,

44:32.740 --> 44:34.860
like boom, boom, boom, like, yeah.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.540
But also there's a moment,

44:36.540 --> 44:37.380
because I've interviewed a bunch of people

44:37.380 --> 44:38.700
for like teams and stuff.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.860
There's also a moment when you early on know

44:40.860 --> 44:42.740
it's not gonna be a good fit

44:42.740 --> 44:44.940
and you still have to land that plane

44:44.940 --> 44:46.860
and all that kind of stuff.

44:46.860 --> 44:49.340
And that could get really, really, really exhausting.

44:49.340 --> 44:51.540
So yeah, anyway, sorry, so.

44:51.540 --> 44:54.380
Yeah, so basically we've tried so many things over the years

44:54.380 --> 44:55.660
to make interviews more efficient

44:55.660 --> 44:58.860
because it's a huge time sink for the team.

44:58.860 --> 45:01.540
So, you know, we basically, we'll usually get them down

45:01.540 --> 45:03.300
to like 25 minutes.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.820
I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team,

45:05.820 --> 45:09.820
let's say, you know, of people who are like contractors

45:09.820 --> 45:11.220
or something, not necessarily full-time employees.

45:11.220 --> 45:14.260
I've seen people actually do 10 minute interviews.

45:14.260 --> 45:16.380
You can even interview like a thousand people

45:16.380 --> 45:17.740
almost like in a week or something.

45:17.740 --> 45:18.900
I'm not sure if that quite works out,

45:18.900 --> 45:20.820
but let me listen to that.

45:20.820 --> 45:23.660
But you can basically get six and six down an hour.

45:23.660 --> 45:25.860
If you're just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors

45:25.860 --> 45:26.680
for whatever purpose.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.420
But if you're talking about full-time employees,

45:28.420 --> 45:31.100
I usually do like 25 minute, you know,

45:31.100 --> 45:33.740
you're oftentimes like, one thing we've done

45:33.740 --> 45:37.300
is we'll put like a Google form online

45:37.300 --> 45:39.540
and it's like, put some basic hurdles in there.

45:39.540 --> 45:43.100
Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer

45:43.100 --> 45:44.220
of which you can check in a spreadsheet

45:44.220 --> 45:45.140
if it was correct or not.

45:45.140 --> 45:46.740
And like, there was some funny examples

45:46.740 --> 45:47.860
in the early days of Coinbase where we put in

45:47.860 --> 45:49.240
like brain teasers and stuff,

45:49.240 --> 45:50.460
but we don't do that anymore.

45:50.460 --> 45:52.620
We do like normal interviews, we do references.

45:52.620 --> 45:56.460
The kinds of things I ask in interviews, you know,

45:56.460 --> 45:58.940
it's usually like, I like to think about

45:59.580 --> 46:02.180
what do we need this person to accomplish in this role?

46:02.180 --> 46:03.020
Right?

46:03.020 --> 46:05.300
And get really specific about that.

46:05.300 --> 46:07.180
It's like usually something pretty hard.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.540
And then I'll ask them a question.

46:08.540 --> 46:11.380
It's like, tell me about a time you did X

46:11.380 --> 46:14.580
and, or tell me about the hardest,

46:14.580 --> 46:17.400
the hardest kind of problem you've had to solve in Y

46:17.400 --> 46:19.540
and what did you do specifically to overcome it?

46:19.540 --> 46:20.380
Right?

46:20.380 --> 46:22.400
So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff

46:22.400 --> 46:23.240
we need to get done,

46:23.240 --> 46:25.860
but then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions

46:25.860 --> 46:27.440
if I'm interviewing for that.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.400
And so I'm trying to see like,

46:29.400 --> 46:30.840
are they concise communicators?

46:30.840 --> 46:34.440
Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?

46:34.440 --> 46:37.200
Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes

46:37.200 --> 46:38.720
if you ask the first question.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.400
Some people are, you know,

46:40.400 --> 46:42.160
they're interrupters like church of interruption.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.840
So like, they won't stop talking until you interrupt them,

46:44.840 --> 46:46.780
which for me, I'm always patient and I wait.

46:46.780 --> 46:48.220
So that's weird.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.920
I'm looking to see for humility too.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.380
Like, you know, I'll tell us people,

46:53.380 --> 46:55.420
tell me about a time something went really wrong,

46:55.420 --> 46:57.080
like you had conflict with someone on a team

46:58.040 --> 47:00.200
or what I'm kind of looking for is,

47:00.200 --> 47:01.320
were they part of the solution

47:01.320 --> 47:03.200
or are they still holding onto like blame

47:03.200 --> 47:04.520
and criticism about that and be like,

47:04.520 --> 47:06.360
well, I told them I shouldn't do that way,

47:06.360 --> 47:07.360
but they didn't listen to me.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.440
And you know, these are all like bad signs.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.960
So I'm looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?

47:11.960 --> 47:13.600
Will they work together on a team?

47:13.600 --> 47:15.800
Can they communicate effectively?

47:15.800 --> 47:18.280
Do they fit into our cultural values and you know,

47:18.280 --> 47:19.120
those kinds of things.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.200
Yeah, I mean, there's a,

47:20.200 --> 47:24.440
cause I've even for help with this podcast here,

47:24.440 --> 47:27.400
but also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring

47:27.400 --> 47:30.360
and I was always looking for, you said brain teasers,

47:30.360 --> 47:33.120
all kinds of simple questions that can,

47:33.120 --> 47:35.600
they can reveal a lot of information.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.880
And it's always been challenging.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.040
I used to, I still ask this question,

47:39.040 --> 47:43.820
but do you think it's better to work hard or work smart?

47:45.600 --> 47:50.360
And you know, I had this idea that I've,

47:51.080 --> 47:54.920
that I think I've matured about,

47:54.920 --> 47:59.080
which is I kind of believe that people who say work smart

47:59.080 --> 48:03.320
on that question don't actually work smart.

48:03.320 --> 48:07.920
So the right textbook answers is better to work smart.

48:07.920 --> 48:12.180
But the reality is it's people that haven't actually

48:12.180 --> 48:15.040
ever done anything that say work smart.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.880
They're like, they haven't really struggled

48:17.880 --> 48:21.360
because my general belief at the time was in order

48:21.360 --> 48:25.760
to discover what it means to work smart,

48:25.760 --> 48:29.040
to be efficient, to, you have to work your ass off.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.960
So you have to really fail a lot

48:30.960 --> 48:33.440
and failure feels like hard work.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.400
And so I was always suspicious of people

48:36.400 --> 48:37.840
that would say work smart.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.520
I would want to interrogate that question.

48:41.400 --> 48:45.560
But then I also, you know, have learned that there is people

48:45.560 --> 48:50.560
that are just exceptionally, exceptionally efficient.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.880
They really do know what it means to work smart,

48:53.880 --> 48:55.600
even at a young age.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.520
And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.360
You have to dig in deeper.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.800
But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked

49:02.800 --> 49:05.040
with would say work hard unapologetically.

49:05.040 --> 49:08.600
And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient,

49:08.600 --> 49:11.240
which is, it's just an interesting thing like that.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.960
And I've always searched for questions of that nature

49:13.960 --> 49:18.960
to see, can I get a person to reveal something profound

49:21.200 --> 49:25.560
about them in as brief of a question as possible?

49:26.960 --> 49:28.560
And I, you know, and then of course,

49:28.560 --> 49:31.520
there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers

49:31.520 --> 49:33.920
and stuff like that, depending on the role programming

49:33.920 --> 49:38.920
and so on to see, can they solve a tricky puzzle and do so?

49:39.040 --> 49:40.960
Like one that doesn't require a lot of effort,

49:40.960 --> 49:45.960
but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.800
Is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal,

49:49.800 --> 49:51.760
but is there some questions

49:51.760 --> 49:55.040
that you sometimes find yourself leaning on?

49:55.040 --> 49:58.120
You said like, how did you solve a hard problem

49:58.120 --> 50:01.360
in your past and have them talk through it?

50:01.360 --> 50:02.200
That's one.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.760
You know, we started with brain teasers periodically

50:04.760 --> 50:07.680
at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly.

50:07.680 --> 50:10.880
And I think one, it's a tough one,

50:10.880 --> 50:13.680
because I actually think it does show

50:13.680 --> 50:16.440
how somebody kind of performs under pressure,

50:16.440 --> 50:18.680
but it's, I don't think it's a super reliable indicator

50:18.680 --> 50:22.440
because there's some people who are really good

50:22.440 --> 50:25.200
in the typical work situation,

50:25.200 --> 50:26.480
but that's not a typical work situation

50:26.480 --> 50:27.640
where somebody puts you on the spot,

50:27.640 --> 50:29.920
like in a live interview and sometimes people get nervous

50:29.920 --> 50:31.040
and they can't think clearly

50:31.040 --> 50:32.720
and like they don't have their computer in front of them

50:32.720 --> 50:34.520
or whatever they normally use.

50:35.720 --> 50:39.200
So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now

50:39.200 --> 50:41.040
of the brain teaser thing.

50:42.320 --> 50:45.920
There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question

50:45.920 --> 50:47.880
about like a lot of universities are getting rid

50:47.880 --> 50:48.960
of entrance exams.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.360
So if you're hiring right out of universities,

50:52.680 --> 50:54.720
sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator

50:54.720 --> 50:56.560
of like, are they in that university?

50:56.560 --> 50:58.520
And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet,

50:58.520 --> 50:59.760
but I've heard some companies are actually creating

50:59.760 --> 51:01.680
their own like for college grads,

51:01.680 --> 51:06.680
like their own basically exams, like standardized testing

51:06.680 --> 51:08.120
almost to get people in the door

51:08.120 --> 51:10.360
because the degree almost like doesn't mean

51:10.360 --> 51:12.800
what it used to, which is the whole topic.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.320
Yeah, that's fascinating

51:14.320 --> 51:17.560
because it's fascinating both for them

51:17.560 --> 51:20.640
because it's not just about you trying to hire a great team.

51:20.640 --> 51:23.360
It's also to help them find the right place to work at.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.200
Yeah.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.920
It's like a two-way street.

51:28.080 --> 51:32.360
All right, so once you found the product market fit,

51:33.480 --> 51:36.160
how did Coinbase become what it is today?

51:38.800 --> 51:42.200
So let me ask on an engineering question actually,

51:42.200 --> 51:47.200
sort of from the Ruby wallet days,

51:47.600 --> 51:50.440
what are some of the interesting challenges there

51:50.440 --> 51:52.360
or are they not engineering?

51:52.360 --> 51:56.560
Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?

51:56.560 --> 52:01.560
Engineering, regulation, financial, hiring, lawyers,

52:06.120 --> 52:07.760
what was it?

52:07.760 --> 52:10.600
So post-product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling

52:10.600 --> 52:12.400
and you gotta build out an actual company.

52:12.400 --> 52:15.480
So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there

52:15.480 --> 52:17.200
for a while and we were hiring in,

52:17.200 --> 52:19.440
we had like maybe 25 people or something.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.080
I remember one of our investors came by one day

52:21.080 --> 52:22.840
and he was like, Brian, how much of your time

52:22.840 --> 52:24.320
are you spending writing code?

52:24.320 --> 52:27.280
I was like, maybe 50% or something.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.600
He was like, how much time are you spending hiring people?

52:29.600 --> 52:31.960
I was like, probably 20%.

52:31.960 --> 52:35.200
He was like, I think you need to flip those numbers.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.720
Like this company is not gonna scale.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.560
You're the CEO.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.400
You don't need to be writing code every day.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.800
You're gonna have to transition that stuff.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.720
Like even if people can't, all that stuff's locked

52:42.720 --> 52:44.560
in your head, so maybe they're not gonna do it as well

52:44.560 --> 52:46.560
as you for the first six months or something.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.360
But like, if you don't start to transition it,

52:48.360 --> 52:49.760
you're never gonna build a real company.

52:49.760 --> 52:52.640
It's just gonna be, you're gonna be the bottleneck.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.880
So, like a lot of founders that took me a while

52:55.880 --> 52:57.240
to like really internalize that lesson.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.800
I'd always heard people say that and you know,

52:59.800 --> 53:02.880
but I still was holding on too much to decision-making.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.080
And I probably still am by the way,

53:04.080 --> 53:07.320
like even to this day at Coinbase where we continually

53:07.320 --> 53:09.040
have to push down decision-making in the org,

53:09.040 --> 53:11.440
like even with 5,000 people, like who are the owners

53:11.440 --> 53:12.280
of each of these things?

53:12.280 --> 53:14.120
And so the temptation is people to push it up

53:14.120 --> 53:15.040
and you become a bottleneck.

53:15.040 --> 53:19.000
And anyway, so yeah, you basically need to make sure

53:19.000 --> 53:21.120
you have enough money where you don't die

53:21.120 --> 53:23.200
if there's some kind of a downturn

53:23.200 --> 53:24.920
or hit break even profitability.

53:24.920 --> 53:27.640
We were in a position where we were periodically profitable

53:27.640 --> 53:29.240
during up periods, but then crypto would go down

53:29.240 --> 53:30.560
and we were unprofitable.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.280
And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology

53:33.280 --> 53:35.920
and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't like die

53:35.920 --> 53:38.960
in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.040
We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch

53:41.040 --> 53:44.000
of services that had been just very quickly thrown together

53:44.000 --> 53:45.680
by like 20 year olds, right?

53:45.680 --> 53:47.880
Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay,

53:47.880 --> 53:50.400
how do you get like a really senior experience

53:50.400 --> 53:52.440
cybersecurity person, but not someone who's so senior

53:52.440 --> 53:53.480
that they can't get their hands dirty

53:53.480 --> 53:56.360
and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.120
How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?

53:58.120 --> 54:00.080
Our finances were a mess.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.920
Like we didn't even really know how much money we had

54:01.920 --> 54:03.000
at certain times and stuff.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.600
It's embarrassing to say, but it was true.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.680
Like I remember there was a point where we had raised,

54:09.680 --> 54:12.040
I think like our series C or something like that.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.920
And I think we had our bank accounts

54:14.920 --> 54:16.280
and I just put like $25 million

54:16.280 --> 54:18.560
like in a different bank account that none of this stuff

54:18.560 --> 54:20.120
was touched to the actual operation of the business.

54:20.120 --> 54:23.600
Cause I was like, you know, our operations were so messy

54:23.600 --> 54:25.280
and we needed to hire a new finance person.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.280
And I was like, I had heard horror stories

54:28.280 --> 54:29.520
of actually startups where they thought

54:29.520 --> 54:31.360
they had X amount of money.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.040
And then it turned out they had way less

54:33.040 --> 54:35.160
and then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.240
So you wanted to have some padding to at least like,

54:37.240 --> 54:38.880
all right, I can at least count on this

54:38.880 --> 54:41.400
to save us if we go to like super negative.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.560
Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack,

54:43.560 --> 54:46.040
but that was like the only I could come up with.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.840
And you know, until we could hire like a real CFO

54:48.840 --> 54:50.880
and financial team who like, okay,

54:50.880 --> 54:52.800
now we got our arms around how much cash we have.

54:52.800 --> 54:55.960
It sounds silly, but we had such high volume of money

54:55.960 --> 54:57.320
coming in and out anyway.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.840
What was the ordering of hiring by the way?

54:59.840 --> 55:03.400
Like how many engineers was it early on?

55:03.400 --> 55:06.960
You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit.

55:06.960 --> 55:10.880
Like what was the landscape of hiring

55:10.880 --> 55:12.480
as you building up this company?

55:13.360 --> 55:15.240
Was it engineering focused?

55:15.240 --> 55:17.280
Well, let's see, I mean, so the first person we hired

55:17.280 --> 55:20.040
was just like, we needed to solve customer support.

55:20.040 --> 55:20.960
So we brought someone to do that

55:20.960 --> 55:22.520
cause we were all staying up till midnight every night

55:22.520 --> 55:23.840
trying to do customer support.

55:23.840 --> 55:26.400
And then we got more engineers.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.960
And then I think maybe the sixth hire

55:27.960 --> 55:29.520
or something like that was a recruiter.

55:29.520 --> 55:31.960
Cause that turned out to be, you need to build,

55:31.960 --> 55:34.320
hire the person who can hire more people.

55:34.320 --> 55:37.160
That turned out to be a great force multiplier.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.800
And then you go on down the list.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.520
Eventually you want to hire some more senior people.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.200
We needed legal and compliance.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.440
We needed that really badly.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.320
Cause we, you know, it was all kinds of questions

55:48.320 --> 55:50.400
about what the legality of it was.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.720
Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto

55:52.720 --> 55:54.960
like serious adults?

55:54.960 --> 55:57.520
Cause it's such a cutting edge new world.

55:57.520 --> 56:01.120
Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than,

56:01.120 --> 56:02.360
nobody had three years of experience with it

56:02.360 --> 56:04.040
cause it had only been around a few years.

56:04.040 --> 56:07.200
So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.

56:07.200 --> 56:08.880
There's a certain personality type of people

56:08.880 --> 56:10.440
who are willing to join early companies

56:10.440 --> 56:12.520
because they have no structure.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.120
You can't really commit to them about,

56:14.120 --> 56:16.600
you're going to have this team or this boss or whatever.

56:16.600 --> 56:18.920
Like everything's in chaos and flux.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.360
So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things

56:22.360 --> 56:23.240
in the early stage, for sure.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.640
You got to find people crazy enough

56:24.640 --> 56:26.240
to join you in this journey.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.200
So one of the interesting things about Coinbase

56:28.200 --> 56:31.320
and you've written, we'll talk about it a bit.

56:31.320 --> 56:33.560
You're very focused on the mission.

56:33.560 --> 56:34.400
Yeah.

56:34.400 --> 56:38.000
You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things

56:38.000 --> 56:40.720
that makes hiring easier.

56:40.720 --> 56:42.840
That makes working at Coinbase easier.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.960
That makes, I mean, it's similar.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.800
Sort of Elon has the same thing.

56:46.800 --> 56:47.760
It's pretty clear.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.440
It's pretty clear what we're here to do.

56:50.440 --> 56:55.440
So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?

56:55.560 --> 56:57.880
Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.960
And what is economic freedom?

56:59.960 --> 57:02.720
Yeah, so economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP

57:02.720 --> 57:04.080
that economists use.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.880
And it's basically a measure of different countries

57:05.880 --> 57:06.720
around the world.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.680
It looks at things like, are there property rights

57:08.680 --> 57:12.560
enforced, is there free trade, is the currency stable?

57:12.560 --> 57:14.120
Can you start companies that you want to start

57:14.120 --> 57:15.360
and can you join the ones you want to join?

57:15.360 --> 57:18.640
And is there corruption and bribery prevalent

57:18.640 --> 57:20.760
or is it relatively free of that?

57:20.760 --> 57:24.320
And so there's several different organizations

57:24.320 --> 57:27.240
that basically score countries by economic freedom.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.880
And the really cool thing about economic freedom

57:28.880 --> 57:31.800
is that basically it positively correlates

57:31.800 --> 57:33.360
with things that we all want in society.

57:33.360 --> 57:36.680
Like not only higher growth of the economy,

57:36.680 --> 57:39.360
but also things like higher self-reported happiness

57:39.360 --> 57:41.800
of citizens, better treatment of the environment,

57:41.800 --> 57:44.360
better income for the poorest 10% of people.

57:44.360 --> 57:46.280
And it negatively correlates with things we don't want

57:46.280 --> 57:49.240
in society like corruption and bribery and war even

57:49.240 --> 57:50.480
and things like that.

57:50.480 --> 57:54.000
And so it's this pretty crazy provocative idea,

57:54.000 --> 57:58.600
which is that if you give people good property rights

57:58.600 --> 58:01.160
and rule of law and allow them to trade,

58:01.160 --> 58:03.400
it basically encourages them to do more good stuff

58:03.400 --> 58:05.240
and the whole society benefits.

58:05.240 --> 58:08.320
Like one of the things, you may have noticed this

58:08.320 --> 58:09.640
growing up in various places you did,

58:09.640 --> 58:12.200
or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina

58:12.200 --> 58:13.360
that went through hyperinflation.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.840
And there's a certain like pessimism

58:15.840 --> 58:18.520
that can creep into countries

58:18.520 --> 58:21.040
when they don't have economic freedom,

58:21.040 --> 58:24.040
which it's basically like everyone has a bit of this vibe,

58:24.040 --> 58:26.640
which is like, don't stick your head up,

58:26.640 --> 58:28.960
don't try too hard, cause it could all be gone tomorrow.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.920
Like the things that really are valuable in life

58:30.920 --> 58:32.560
are just family and friends

58:32.560 --> 58:35.440
and the past was better than the future will be.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.560
And so you don't really, people don't try as many,

58:37.560 --> 58:40.240
they don't try hard because you're not really sure

58:40.240 --> 58:42.080
you can actually keep the upside of your labor

58:42.080 --> 58:43.520
if you try hard.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.840
So you just don't try as hard.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.720
Whereas in America historically,

58:47.720 --> 58:49.560
or high economic freedom countries,

58:50.760 --> 58:53.720
you know, people basically like they just try more stuff

58:53.720 --> 58:55.520
cause they're like, if I do good for other people,

58:55.520 --> 58:56.800
I'll get to keep part of it for myself

58:56.800 --> 58:58.120
and I can improve my lot in life

58:58.120 --> 59:00.560
and for my children and my community, whatever.

59:00.560 --> 59:03.720
So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper

59:03.720 --> 59:07.120
a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch at the time,

59:07.120 --> 59:09.360
I was like, this might be a really powerful piece

59:09.360 --> 59:13.640
of technology that can inject good financial infrastructure

59:13.640 --> 59:15.920
into all these countries around the world that don't have it.

59:15.920 --> 59:18.040
Basically good economic freedom principles

59:18.040 --> 59:20.720
in like, you know, property rights and things like that

59:20.720 --> 59:22.200
into these countries all over the world,

59:22.200 --> 59:23.640
which just, as long as you had a smartphone

59:23.640 --> 59:25.120
and now crypto got invented,

59:25.120 --> 59:27.240
everybody could have economic freedom.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.960
And crypto is kind of really well suited

59:28.960 --> 59:29.800
for economic freedom.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.840
Cause if you want property rights,

59:31.840 --> 59:32.960
it's basically like crypto is,

59:32.960 --> 59:34.640
if you can remember a 12 word phrase

59:34.640 --> 59:37.040
or, you know, have an app on your phone,

59:37.040 --> 59:38.680
you can store as much wealth as you want.

59:38.680 --> 59:39.800
And it can't be taken away from you.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.520
You can even, you know, there's like refugees who need

59:42.520 --> 59:44.720
to flee and they want to take their wealth with them

59:44.720 --> 59:46.240
and they can't do it often

59:46.240 --> 59:47.520
in the traditional financial system.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.760
And so crypto lets them do that, right?

59:49.760 --> 59:51.040
Crypto is inherently global.

59:51.040 --> 59:53.760
So it allows free trade and cross border payments.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.120
It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.040
You know, it's, it provides a stable currency to everyone,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.960
not only with Bitcoin,

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.080
which is kind of like this new reserve currency,

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.880
but also with stable coins, right?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.200
Which are, you know, new, new inventions there.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.560
So yeah, I basically feel like crypto is,

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.120
is this secret hiding in plain sight

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.760
that can create economic freedom

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.760
for people all over the world

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.960
and a more fair and free and global economy.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.520
Well, so the limit, and by the way,

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.080
I didn't know about Argentina.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.160
Why'd you end up in Argentina?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.040
Okay, so I was basically, you know,

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.160
I was living in Houston, Texas after college

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.240
where I went to school and I had never studied abroad.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.200
I kind of like, I don't know,

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.120
I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.200
And I was like, I was running this other startup

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.880
that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.720
and I could work from anywhere.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.920
So my plan was, you know what?

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.280
I'm just gonna go do like a month

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.120
in every city around South America,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.240
just like almost like to force myself

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.200
out of my comfort zone.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.640
Cause I had never traveled by myself

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.720
to a foreign country or whatever,

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.320
and where I didn't really speak the language.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.440
And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.720
thinking I'd go all around South America

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.200
where I had never been there.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.960
But I basically, once I was set up in South,

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.280
in Buenos Aires with an apartment

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.120
and a cell phone and stuff,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.240
then I was like, I don't wanna do that all again next month.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.560
So I just stayed there for most of the time

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.400
and took some day trips.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.040
But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.880
in that regard.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.560
You got a chance sort of unexpectedly

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.440
to experience the social effects of hyperinflation,

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.480
which is interesting.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.560
But I also, I've never been where I really, really wanna go

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.760
as a person who likes tango,

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.960
as a person who likes the Argentinian national team

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.320
and soccer and steak.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.600
All right, and all the other things

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.200
that Argentina is known for.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.360
Okay, so economic freedom.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.560
One of the limits on economic freedom

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.280
comes from government and government regulations

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.320
and all those kinds of things throughout the world.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.320
So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.520
So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.880
What are the things that limit economic freedom

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.880
and how does crypto help ease that?

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.400
Today, the world, the traditional financial system

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.280
is basically every country of the world,

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.200
for the most part, has their own currency.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.320
And so there's a group of people or institutions

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.400
in each of those countries that's controlling

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.600
that economic policy or that money supply.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.440
And it can be manipulated, right?

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.120
So it's not like many of these currencies

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.840
are not linked to gold standard.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.280
The US kind of famously came off that in the 1970s,

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.040
for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff,

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.520
like he talks about, there's thousands of fiat currencies

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.720
that have been in existence over time.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.640
And basically all of them eventually get disconnected

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.680
from backing of like hard commodities.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.440
And then they get over inflated and printed.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.960
And so in times of stress, with Nixon,

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.560
I guess it was like in the US,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.880
it was the Vietnam War or something like that.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.280
It kind of drove government spending.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.880
And so under times of stress, they say,

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.080
hey, it's a temporary measure.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.760
We need to break the peg.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.120
Temporary was like famous words that he used.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.480
And they go print.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.280
And so the bad thing about that, of course,

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.920
is that it sort of erodes people's like wealth

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.520
if they can only hold their assets in cash,

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.400
which basically like poor people tend to do that.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.160
You know, if you're wealthy, you can hold stocks

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.720
or like real estate and things like that.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.640
But it's really a tax on the poorest people

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.720
in society, inflation.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.000
So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit of like

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.600
a return to the gold standard in this digital era, right?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.800
Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.880
It's deflationary.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.360
There's never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.760
And so that's a really important principle.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.280
I also think, you know, not just Bitcoin,

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.080
but like cryptocurrency generally,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.960
it's really important in terms of this.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.720
You asked about regulation, right?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.200
So think about like, if you wanted to make

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.120
a global borrowing and lending marketplace

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.120
or a global exchange,

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.800
you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world,

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.800
sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.800
and get lending licenses or an operating exchange

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.000
or whatever.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.840
And, you know, that's just an incredible amount of work

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.880
and you can't even do business in many of these countries

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.280
because like, you know, you have to bribe somebody

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.800
or it's corrupt or whatever.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.280
And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance,

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.240
people have published, you know,

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.240
like Uniswap is a decentralized exchange.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.760
Everybody in the world, no matter what country

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.400
you're in, what jurisdiction can interface

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.360
with that decentralized exchange.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.480
And there's no central company operating it.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.640
It's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain,

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.160
which is globally decentralized.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.240
So there's no throat to choke.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.720
There's no one person or a company you can go to

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.520
to like, hey, shut this thing down.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.880
Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.160
the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.560
on the Ethereum blockchain.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.400
Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace,

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.720
you know, like it's, you know, if you want,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.600
somebody in India wants to borrow from somebody in the US

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.240
or whatever, like there's very difficult to do that

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.240
in the traditional financial world.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.880
But in a smart contract that's decentralized,

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.640
you can enable anybody to access it.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.280
So it's really kind of this great democratizing force

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.320
that is creating a new financial system

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.960
that is more fair and more free.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.140
Yeah, and in some ways it is,

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.720
it's a clever way that's not, you know,

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.360
it's enabling people to do that in a novel way.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.200
So is Uniswap in some sense a competitive Coinbase?

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.680
In which way is it, in which way is it not?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.320
So, because for people who don't know,

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.640
Coinbase is centralized.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.640
So let me ask, doesn't that go against the spirit of crypto

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.120
since crypto is decentralized?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.940
What are the pros and cons of being centralized

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.960
as an exchange?

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.000
So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.340
We have many different products

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:01.100
and the way that I think about it is that our exchange

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.740
or our brokerage is a centralized,

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.100
regulated financial service business.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.140
And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.500
to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.380
in the world to flow into the crypto economy.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.940
So we, you know, we're very proud of that

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.620
and I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.620
Now, once people have money in crypto,

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.280
they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.660
and they can choose to hold it in a self-custodial wallet,

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.240
which is more decentralized.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.580
They can choose to use decentralized exchanges,

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.800
which we love and Uniswap is not really,

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.920
I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.480
We basically have integrated Uniswap

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.360
into a number of our products.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.440
We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.320
So Coinbase wallet, which is a self-custodial wallet

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.820
is more decentralized and it allows people

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.480
to hold their own crypto.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.520
They don't have to trust us.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.880
Can you explain what a self-custodial wallet is?

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.880
What is a wallet and what is a self-custodial wallet?

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.560
Yeah, so it's confusing.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.280
So a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.440
to store your crypto, the private keys themselves.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.640
And, you know, for some people in institutions

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.960
and everything, just meeting them where they are today,

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.020
that's nice because it's simpler, you know,

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.720
they're not afraid of losing their crypto

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.240
if they make some accidental mistake or so, you know,

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.120
a custodial crypto products are important

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.480
to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.600
But I'm very supportive of self-custodial wallets.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.500
And I think in some ways there are the future

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.440
because more and more people are gonna wanna

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.400
store their own crypto,

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.360
not trust a third party institution to do it.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.960
And in some ways that is much more authentic

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.160
to the ethos of crypto.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.640
So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.080
Frankly, that's a more centralized thing,

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:46.960
but once you have crypto,

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.120
you can then go to the self-custodial world,

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.080
store it yourself.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.540
To get into the technical details just for a second,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.540
it's basically saying you're gonna store the keys

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.940
on your own device.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.220
And so even if Coinbase, you know,

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.700
get some court order to seize it, we actually can't,

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.620
like from an architecture point of view, we can't do it.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.560
Or, you know, if Coinbase gets hacked or something,

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.580
we can't lose your funds.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.620
Like, now you, the thing is you have to take

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.140
the responsibility because we're not taking it.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.940
So the individual person could get hacked, right?

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.620
And there's a whole bunch of really cool research

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.980
happening to make self-custodial wallets

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.680
more resilient to accidental loss, hacks,

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.860
and just user error.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.060
Like, you know, I don't know how much you've looked at

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.300
like various cryptography things, but there's like,

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.020
basically you can have multiple key, multi-sig,

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.500
multiple signatures from different keys

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.580
on different devices where you need like two of the three

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.780
or three of the five.

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.260
There's a whole technology called a multi-party computation

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.500
or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.100
But those are the things you would run locally?

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.140
Like what, these are all security measures,

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.900
like cryptography measures to protect you

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.660
without a centralized component?

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:57.500
Right.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.060
So like a simple example would be,

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.380
let's say you had a two of three key signature

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.900
and, you know, one key might be stored at Coinbase,

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.280
but that's not a quorum.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.220
So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.820
But another key is on your device, on your phone, let's say.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.660
Oh, cool.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.880
So that, so in a normal situation,

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.940
you have a key on your phone, we have one.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.740
But you, and so two out of three, now just, you know,

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.980
it can all get signed very quickly for day-to-day use.

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.020
But let's say you lose your phone or something.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.460
Now there has to be a third key,

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.700
and that's where, you know,

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.740
you could store it in a backup somewhere,

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.900
like in Google Drive or iCloud.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.900
You could trust a third party that's not Coinbase

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.300
to also have that one key,

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.240
and they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.700
So that's a simple example.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.300
You can get way more complicated.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.300
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.460
And so like, if your funds get seized,

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.900
Coinbase can't do anything,

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.460
but you better not lose your phone, maybe in that case.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.300
Yeah.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.500
So that's, okay.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.780
But it provides a, there is,

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.700
so even if you lose your phone,

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:57.900
then there is a recovery mechanism.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.180
Because you can get the one key from Coinbase,

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.540
the one from your backup provider,

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.900
and recover a new one back on your phone.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.740
I know, yeah.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.900
But what if Coinbase is no longer,

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.460
but because of government,

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.060
because of a, say it's in North Korea,

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.700
government says you're no longer,

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.820
like Coinbase is shut down in that country

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.900
or something like that,

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.780
then you can get it even if you have access to those two.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.620
Right.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.220
So again, perhaps a silly question,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.820
but isn't a self-custodial wallet

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:29.900
a competitor as a notion to Coinbase?

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.500
No, I mean, so we offer a self-custodial wallet.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.620
We've built one and it's like-

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.500
But doesn't it bleed the,

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.620
like I guess I'm asking a sort of a financial question,

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.660
is like, how does Coinbase make money?

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.460
And transactions.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.300
So does this not,

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.140
it does not decrease the number

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.700
or does not significantly negatively affect transactions

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.980
or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.700
of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency?

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.580
Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.740
would probably say, well, we should be storing,

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.740
let's keep more of the custody with us

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.780
because that's how we prove to the world

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.540
that we're valuable or whatever.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.660
I don't really believe that.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.020
Like, I think that actually we kind of want to encourage

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020
our users to move to self-custody over time

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
for those who are ready and willing.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.660
And that technology needs to mature.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.260
I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.100
who doesn't want to do it.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.300
But to me, that's like the future

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.860
of how we get billions of people using crypto.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.420
But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else easier?

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.660
Yeah, that's sort of the point is like,

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.020
we're all using the same protocol.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.340
So there's low switching costs,

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.500
which keeps all the companies accountable, right?

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.500
Like if you want to access the Visa network,

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.620
there's only one company in the world

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.740
that you can go through to do that, like Visa.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.540
But if you want to access the Bitcoin network,

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.780
there's dozens or hundreds of companies out there

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.620
who can do that.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.980
So it's, you know, it's arguably,

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:51.340
you could argue it's worse for us as a company,

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.180
but I think it's better for,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.580
it's what makes Bitcoin interesting

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.660
and cryptocurrency interesting

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.020
is that nobody controls it.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.980
There is low switching costs for customers.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.220
It's better for customers.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.300
And that means that all the companies in the space

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.540
are going to be held to a high standard

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.100
because the minute you lose someone's trust,

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.020
they're just going to move their Bitcoin

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.540
to some other service.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.260
And that's good for the world.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.540
Do you think of Coinbase as,

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.380
so there's these ideas of layer one,

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:17.100
layer two, layer three technologies.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.060
Do you think of Coinbase as layer one,

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.780
layer two, layer three?

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.780
Now that said, there's so many products

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.780
that are under the Coinbase umbrella

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.180
that it's hard to answer that question,

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.980
but what do you think?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.380
Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.860
So, you know, usually when people are using those terms,

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.700
layer one, layer two,

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.940
so they're referring to like layer one

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.900
would be the blockchain,

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.780
layer one blockchain itself,

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.740
like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.140
not like a centralized service like Coinbase

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.700
or even our decentralized self-custodial wallet.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:56.220
So yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.500
These are the decentralized protocols

01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.700
that we're integrating,

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.740
but Coinbase itself is not those.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.020
Yes, but layer two is the thing

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.060
that was basically doing transactions

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.180
without the settlement on the blockchain.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.180
And so you get to have some of the benefits

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.420
of faster transactions

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.420
without the security associated with the blockchain.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.300
And layer three is, I suppose,

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.060
sort of apps built on top of that.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.860
So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor,

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.940
he considers Coinbase a layer three technology.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.220
Interesting, okay.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.460
I'm not really particularly familiar

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.460
with this kind of distinction of layer three and two.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.340
I don't see them as fundamentally different.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.620
But some of the, okay, I mean,

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.860
one way of asking that,

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.180
is there some layer two like of magic happening

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.220
in order to make transactions associated

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.340
with the blockchain happen instant

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.660
so that they're quick?

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.300
So that-

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.140
On Coinbase?

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:57.980
On Coinbase, yeah.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.140
Is there some magic going on?

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.820
Because you're, okay, we should say,

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.980
how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.420
So it's more than two.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.580
Yeah.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:08.500
It's a lot more than two.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.340
Yeah.

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.500
So you have to understand,

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.580
you have to incorporate all of these technologies.

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.900
Yeah.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.140
So how do you make that magic

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.820
of sort of universal transactions happen

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.260
across all of these different cryptocurrencies?

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.580
There's our centralized products

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.820
and decentralized products, right?

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.100
The centralized products,

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.060
we are storing that crypto for you.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.420
And so if you're moving from one of your accounts

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.260
to another account,

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.060
like an ETH one account to ETH two account,

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:39.820
or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.660
to your ETH centralized,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.540
so we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster.

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.380
And it saves the customer fees

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.980
and it just confirms instantly.

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:49.700
But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain, right?

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.220
So you can also send any Bitcoin address

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.900
or Ethereum address, for instance,

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.380
and that is putting the transaction on chain.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.300
Now our decentralized products like Coinbase wallet,

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.020
the self-custodial wallet,

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.580
every transaction is happening on chain with that.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.700
And so basically it just shows a little bit

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.980
of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.380
Like in the early days,

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.220
these networks were not scalable.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.820
And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.540
And so we had to do sort of these hacks,

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.100
like moving the crypto off chain,

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.540
if you were moving between your own accounts

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.460
and stuff like that.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.580
Otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.820
as a company, right?

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.020
But now the blockchains are starting to scale.

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.900
There's a whole bunch more work

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.740
that needs to be done on that,

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.260
and we're getting L2 solutions.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.780
So I think more and more of the transactions

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.580
are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.860
And we shouldn't be like,

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.620
ideally we shouldn't be doing that many transactions

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.020
off chain, but just internal Coinbase ledger or something.

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.740
That's not really in the spirit of crypto.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.220
So when you say on chain, that includes like a Lightning Network,

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:54.820
that includes layer two technology

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.660
that the blockchain proposes.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.220
Yeah, okay.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.540
So I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.420
off chain within Coinbase.

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.340
And you're saying in the early days you had to,

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.660
but you're trying to do less and less.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.660
So look, there's a bunch of like high frequency traders

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:13.220
that use the centralized products,

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.340
and even just regular retail people,

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.700
like they don't wanna pay the gas fees and stuff.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.740
And they're trying to...

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.580
It actually, back of the envelope,

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.220
calculated this out at one point.

01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.780
And it would be completely infeasible

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.140
for like high frequency traders

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.780
to put everything on chain at this point.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.460
That's basically what DEXs are doing.

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.660
And so both are important.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.020
I think more and more is gonna move

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.900
decentralized over time, which is great.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.220
And we're basically-

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.340
DEXs are decentralized exchanges, by the way.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.460
So anyway, we wanna encourage more and more of it

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.860
to move decentralized over time,

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.740
but the centralized things aren't going away

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.180
for like a long time.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.300
It's a decade from now,

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:55.540
there's gonna be some big institution or pension fund

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.980
or central bank that's like,

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.900
all right, we gotta hold crypto.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.700
Let's set up the account in a centralized way.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.980
So that's fine.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.180
Both are important.

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.460
Do you know the number of cryptocurrencies

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.220
currently on Coinbase?

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.140
Do you know that number?

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.260
It's over a hundred,

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.220
but it depends what jurisdiction you're in,

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.380
and are you an institution versus retail.

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.940
There's so many different categories now.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.100
Even like- But over a hundred.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.580
Yeah.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:25.780
So what does it take to become an asset,

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.180
to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase,

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.220
to add your technology to Coinbase?

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.500
Okay, well, so we're trying to get away

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.220
from this idea of being listed on Coinbase

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.380
as being seen as like an endorsement or something,

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.660
because I actually think it's very important

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.740
that we are not considered judge and jury about,

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.420
like imagine it was the early days of the internet,

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.700
and you were like, what's a good webpage

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.540
and what's a bad webpage?

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.740
Like you would have been totally wrong,

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:57.740
or anytime big tech companies try to make these review boards

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.060
of like, you know, Apple famously gets in trouble

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.780
for this a lot with their app store review process, right?

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:04.860
And so something that you think,

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.700
like a committee of people somewhere thinks looks silly,

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.260
may turn out to be the next big thing, right?

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.660
And so it's very difficult.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.480
So what do we do?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.100
I mean, we basically have a test of legality, right?

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.820
We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.660
If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:25.100
And there's a very rigorous process we go through for that.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.660
Just currently the way the laws are in the US,

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.940
you can't do that.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.780
And we acquired a brokerage license from the SEC.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.860
We're trying to work with them to get that operational.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.300
And hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities,

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.820
but today that's not possible in the US at least.

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.940
Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.540
of the crypto asset.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.300
Do we see that there's some flaw in the smart contract

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:49.380
or, you know, a way that somebody could manipulate it

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.280
without the customer's permission?

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.740
We look at some compliance pieces to it as well,

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.540
like the actors behind it and like, you know,

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.140
their any kind of criminal history, anything like that.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.980
But if we believe it meets our listing standards,

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.820
basically this test of legality

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.180
and everything for customer protection,

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.480
then we want to list it

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.660
because we want the market to at that point decide.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.140
And it's kind of like Amazon or something like that,

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.880
where, you know, a product might have three stars

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.940
or it might have five stars,

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.460
but if it starts to get one star consistently,

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.660
like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.680
or something like maybe Amazon will remove it.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.080
But otherwise you want to let the market decide

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.180
what these things are.

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.940
So that's generally how we do it.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:36.200
And by the way, more and more of these assets,

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.420
I think especially like low market cap assets

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.520
are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.200
It's not that we don't need to list every asset

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.240
on a centralized exchange.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.800
I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.640
And then it becomes an even,

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.920
it's even more clear to people,

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.960
like this is not some endorsement by Coinbase

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.400
of like this asset's good and this one's bad.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.960
Like, you know, my belief is there's going to be millions

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.080
of these assets over time.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.400
And so I hope it doesn't like make news

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.800
every time we add one in the future, basically.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.020
Yeah, I wonder how you get there

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.760
because even I look to Coinbase for,

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.080
for example, you know, people, as you could imagine,

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.400
sort of tagged me on Twitter or something like that

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.400
and all that, like, you should interview our sort of this,

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.200
the founder of this particular coin, right?

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.040
Yeah.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.400
And it's so hard for me to know what's,

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.600
first of all, what's the interesting technology?

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.880
What's, who's a scammer or not?

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.400
Who's actually legitimately representing

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.400
an ambitious new thing versus a scam?

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.200
And I, you know, there's very few sources

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.560
of like a verification signal.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.080
And unfortunately, Coinbase in part has become

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.600
a little bit of that too.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.520
And you're trying to get away from that

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.760
because you're trying to get as many,

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.760
sort of let the people decide.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.940
So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.680
where the people could rate.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.360
Yeah, so I think we'll actually probably add

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.040
like user ratings and reviews.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.480
So, and we'll be very cautious about like,

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.080
you know, these are real people.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
There's a bunch of stuff we have to do from that already.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.800
So I think wisdom of the crowds is good

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.920
in terms of getting feedback on items.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.180
But we also, we're gonna do our own review,

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.160
which I mentioned earlier, right?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.600
Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.680
to be listed on our site.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.520
Yeah.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.200
So I think, yeah, both are important.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.240
How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.080
Well, you can see a few things.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.120
So, you know, I hate to use the word scam

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.540
because a lot of these, these are judgment calls.

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:45.120
You got to, I kind of, a court may or a jury

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:45.960
may land either way,

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.940
but things that would be red flags to look at would be,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.600
you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.760
or insiders with short vesting periods.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.920
You know, are just the background of the founders,

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.800
like they may have criminal records

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.240
or if they've perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.360
There's a difference between something which is

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.520
just a me too product that's like,

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.100
doesn't have anything interesting about it

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.240
and something that's an actual fraud or outright scam.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.320
And you have to, a lot of this data,

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.540
what's cool about it is that it's now available on chain.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.480
You can look at like the tokenomics behind it

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.320
and see who owns it.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.520
Tokenomics, I love that term.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.360
Yeah.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.760
And are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.920
or are they pumping it on like YouTube and Twitter

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.120
and making promises about, hey, the value of this thing

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.280
may be a higher in the future.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.240
And like, all those are just big, big no-nos

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.880
that we would, you know, we just don't want to go there.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.240
So our whole thing is like,

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.940
we want to enable the innovation in this space,

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.640
but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.360
of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.420
or get rich quick thing.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.080
So it's a tricky industry

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.720
because I'm trying to figure out who to, you know,

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.800
what's interesting to understand, to research.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.840
And it's hard to know.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.120
Let me ask you about a tricky one to add

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.440
to a centralized exchange,

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.280
which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.400
So like Monero.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.240
Yeah.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.680
Is that technically difficult or is that why,

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.560
why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one,

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.560
but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains,

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.240
why is that, is that ever possible to add?

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.120
So that's a great question.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.880
So the answer is maybe.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.280
So here's the reason why.

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.700
So because we're a regulated financial service business,

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:46.320
we have various licenses to do that.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.500
We are regulated by various regulators.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.040
Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote,

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.040
reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity,

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.640
you know, an AML program, anti-money laundering, right?

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.840
And so if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.520
and we can't really do blockchain analytics

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.760
to track source of funds

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.680
and where these things might be going,

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.680
it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:15.960
that's defensible.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.400
Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash,

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.240
which have something called a view key.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.280
And a view key is basically another key

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.080
which allows you to de-anonymize the transactions

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.120
in specific situations where you want that.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.840
So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.680
and one of the ways we got comfortable with that is that

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.440
when you're buying it on Coinbase, you know,

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.400
you can basically have a view key,

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.080
the transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.640
and we can see where it goes afterwards

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.400
and do our whole standard program.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.040
Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road,

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.640
I mean, people could eventually

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.840
turn on privacy preserving aspects.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.880
So, you know, these are tough judgment calls

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.560
but at least in terms of our interaction with the customer

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.560
and everything, we feel comfortable at that.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.160
I think there's a broader point here, which is that

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.960
I actually think privacy coins are a good thing

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.000
for the world and they should be allowed and more like,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.400
you know, despite we've made this judgment call to operate

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.880
in a regulated and safe and compliant way,

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.200
but just taking my Coinbase head off for a minute,

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.600
I think the world would be a better place

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.880
if there were more privacy coins because

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.800
it's kind of like the internet when it first came online,

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.560
like there was no HTTPS, everything was HTTP

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.360
and there was, you know, so people were afraid

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.840
to put their credit cards on the internet

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.080
and your messages could be intercepted and all this stuff.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.560
And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.360
with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.600
Like, and financial information is like

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.640
the most important information to keep private, right?

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.440
So there's times where like,

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.080
let's say you're running a charity or something

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.560
and you wanna have total auditability transparency

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.320
for the whole world, who donated and where did the money go?

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.240
That's great, you want it to be public.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.160
But if it's like your personal money

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.120
or something like that,

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.120
you don't wanna be broadcasting that to the whole world.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.640
And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing,

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.320
you know, pseudonymously, cause like,

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.760
but it is a public ledger.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.800
And so if you can know who owns each address,

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.800
you can basically de-anonymize it.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.520
I, you know, I think basically the people should fight

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.000
for privacy and freedoms of all kinds,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.040
but privacy of money is a good thing.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.520
So I would like to see more of that in the future.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.520
You've chosen with Coinbase to have a seat at the table

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.200
with the regulators.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.200
So what kind of conversations are there at that table?

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.560
What are the regulations like?

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.920
What is the level of understanding with the regulators?

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.200
What are they worried about?

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.320
What are they thinking about?

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.960
What are the positive and what are the negative regulations

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.320
that you're facing, that you're educating,

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.760
struggling with, pushing back on, supporting,

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.840
all that kind of stuff.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.280
Yeah.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.320
Oh man, there's so many, cause we're, I mean,

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.600
we're live in like, you know,

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.040
maybe a hundred countries or more at this point.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.160
So the conversations are all over the map.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.080
I'm trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.440
So I'd say one trend that's positive is that basically

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.200
regulators around the world are more and more,

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.520
over the last five years, I would say,

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.840
it's more and more common to find a regulator today asking,

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.800
how can we preserve the innovation potential

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.200
of this technology while keeping the bad actors out?

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.560
Then it was five years ago where they were saying,

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.800
this is all bad activity, how do we prevent it?

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.560
And so maybe this is-

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.520
When you say more and more, what fraction?

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.520
I'll give you like a US specific example,

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.240
although we operate in many countries.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.640
So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know,

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.000
50, 60% of the people who I meet with

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.120
are basically, you know, they're in the camp of,

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.200
crypto has a lot of potential, we should regulate it

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.600
to make sure the bad people don't do something bad with it,

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.280
but this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.360
We should basically create the awful regulation

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.040
and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.200
to happen in the US.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.600
That's a huge change from just three years ago

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.400
where it was probably 30% of people saying that.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400
Now it's like 60, it's like almost double.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.320
It's getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.840
in DC.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.560
I'd say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.880
are like willing to say something negative.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.560
Like they actually think it's net negative.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.640
It's like, it's really hard to defend that position

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.600
at this point, because almost like one in five Americans

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.080
have used or tried crypto at this point.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.880
So you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.000
if you say that at this point, you know,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.240
especially with NFTs and all these things,

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.160
like a huge segment of people who don't even care

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.520
about investing or whatever came into the space.

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.400
So, and then basically that's that same conversation

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.440
is happening, but, you know, delayed by a few years

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.080
in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.240
And some countries have really embraced crypto

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.080
and they're like trying to really,

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.880
they're ahead of where the US is,

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.320
because they're trying to actually attract

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.400
the best startups and entrepreneurs like, you know,

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.240
like Dubai and the UK and Australia

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.400
and all are kind of pushing good regulation.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.440
El Salvador actually, I guess adopted it as like Bitcoin

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.440
as a legal tender.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.480
There was another country, Central African Republic,

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.160
I think that supposedly did that as well.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.440
But, you know, there's countries like China

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.040
that are more autocratic that are saying,

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.480
hey, this is a threat to our power

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.320
and like, we're gonna try to really curtail it.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.760
So what kind of regulations are there

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.800
that you feel the most that are limiting

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.160
or that are empowering?

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.200
Like, is there specific examples?

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.040
Yeah, okay.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.200
So, I mean, basically I think the securities laws

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.480
in the US need to be clarified about what,

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.560
there's crypto is many different things.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560
That's what people don't realize.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.640
So like some crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.080
and many others are probably more like commodities.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.240
They're not controlled by any one person, you know,

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.120
like anyway, there's people who wanna raise money

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.240
for a company that sounds more like a security

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.320
that should be regulated by the SEC.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.480
Commodities are regulated by the CFTC.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.360
Then there's some cryptocurrencies

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.160
which are more like currencies, like stable coins

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.720
and central bank digital currencies.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.840
And those are probably, you know,

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.120
should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.560
And then there's a whole another category

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.320
of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.680
They're NFTs like artwork or they're metaverse items

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.560
or decentralized identity and voting.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:28.560
And so I think that there's a very unhelpful point of view

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.200
out there by some folks, which is, hey, this is all,

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.200
most of this is like bad activity.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.720
We need to shut it down.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.880
So we're just gonna pursue enforcement actions

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.000
or something like that.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.040
Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.800
And I think the people of the US don't feel that way anymore

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.040
because a lot of them are using this stuff.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.200
And their general view is,

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.840
there's a lot of upside potential here.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.960
We can all agree, let's get rid of the fraud and the scams.

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.400
We all wanna get rid of that.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.880
So let's create a relatively simple test, which says,

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.840
you know, if it's like nobody controls more than 20% of it

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.520
or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.600
If someone's raising money for,

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.000
they're selling this thing for a business,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.120
then it's probably a security.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.360
And then, you know, if it's more like a medium of exchange,

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.200
it's a currency.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.080
And if it's none of those things,

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.280
maybe it's artwork or whatever,

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.480
a legal test like that would help clarify who,

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.600
which regulator is regulating what.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.200
And then, you know, we also wanna have probably like

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.760
a sandbox for innovation,

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.480
where if you're a startup and you're doing less than,

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.720
I don't know, some number,

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.040
less than some amount of payment volume

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.440
or customer funds you're storing,

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.720
it's like, just let those things get off the ground

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.560
without a soul crushing amount of legal bills,

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.920
you know, and uncertainty.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.080
So if the US can get there, that would be great.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.000
I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.320
around the world to sort of create that regulation

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.600
that does attract innovation.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:57.160
And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.200
and stuff, they're starting to look at proposed regulation.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.160
I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.360
can help in that conversation too.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.920
We have a whole policy effort.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.680
I think actually crypto policy efforts are like probably

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.160
one of the biggest things in DC right now.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:13.440
So it moves slow at the speed of government,

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.720
but yeah, and in the meantime,

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.520
we're just trying to help more and more people use crypto

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.960
because ultimately that's what in the democracies,

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.160
that's what they care about.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.800
Like they'll do what the people of the country want.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.760
So you want governments to start understanding differences

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.600
between in the crypto space, commodities, securities,

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.080
currencies, NFTs, I still don't understand.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.080
What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:40.360
What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.840
Is it the other categories?

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.200
Yeah, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork,

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.040
although it's, who knows where it's gonna go.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:49.880
It could be more broader.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.720
You mentioned metaverse, right?

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:54.920
You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:59.920
Yeah, like there's people selling virtual land in NFTs.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.760
I actually, I bought this NFT that's like,

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.960
it's like citizenship in this like city, Dow in Wyoming.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:06.800
Like I've never been there,

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:11.560
but it's almost like a badge or attestation

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.320
like to get access to this location.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.400
There's like people doing like tickets to events,

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.680
like they're called a PO ops,

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:23.640
like proof of attendance and things like that.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:27.840
So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.920
It could get, and that's the danger.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.720
You don't wanna try to like define the regulation

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.360
if you don't even know where this thing's gonna go.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.520
And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.880
Yeah, education, advocacy.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.960
We're just trying to be like a helpful

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.640
educational resource essentially.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.160
And then if they give us feedback and like,

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.720
hey, don't do this or do this,

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.560
like we're more than happy to do anything that's requested.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.480
We generally go get licenses

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.840
and we've just tried to do the right thing

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.960
in the absence of clarity,

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.200
because if it's not clear what the law says,

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.200
then you should just basically do good things

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.800
that you think may be required in the future

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.080
to show good faith effort towards the right thing.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.720
And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field,

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.080
which is a whole topic in itself.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.840
So if you are at the table,

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.280
I mean, this is less the case in the United States,

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.760
but can government agencies seize a person cryptocurrency

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.840
by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.360
So when you're centralized,

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.200
they have a phone number to call.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.440
Okay, so this is a complicated topic.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.800
Like if you really wanna be sure that,

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.680
this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.960
Like with self-custodial wallets,

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.400
like with Coinbase wallet and bracing decentralization,

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.120
they wanna avoid that.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.760
Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.200
So we have reasonable protections in place around

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.440
like search and seizure and things like that.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.640
You know, Coinbase does,

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.440
we publish transparency reports on this.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.400
We get subpoenas, court orders,

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.320
things like that from various countries around the world.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.280
And there are situations

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.880
where we have been ordered to freeze accounts,

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.800
things like that.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.440
You know, we have to follow the law.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.000
There's no other way to put it.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.800
We're a regulated financial service business.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.640
And so-

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.000
If the money is used as part of breaking the law,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.880
that's what that, in a particular jurisdiction,

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.520
in a particular-

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.960
Right, and then the other thing,

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.320
sometimes we will actually get court orders or subpoenas

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.240
that are overly broad.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.920
So they need to follow due process, right?

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.360
And so we've seen some in the past that were like,

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.560
well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.120
And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.760
and like pushed back on some of these and said like,

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.920
what is the probable cause?

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.440
And has the threshold been met?

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.920
And like, we've won some of those cases

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:46.920
on behalf of our customers.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.040
So yeah, it's actually really,

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.360
it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.800
As a large business, you spend a lot of resources

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.480
basically interacting with inbound requests

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.680
by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.000
And some of them are silly and ridiculous

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.400
and you have to push back and say no.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.840
And so it's kind of a tax on every company

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.160
at a certain size, which ultimately gets passed

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.160
onto the customer in higher fees.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.520
So you have to employ armies of lawyers

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.440
to deal with this stuff.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.800
Can you educate me on something?

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.800
How much innovation is there in the legal space?

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.320
So for lawyers working with Coinbase,

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.760
because it's such a new cutting edge thing.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.560
So you're, there's a lot of gray area

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.520
you're supposed to be operating under.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.160
Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.360
Like how much precedence is there?

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.480
I guess is what I'm asking.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.640
I mean, just like you said, three years.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.560
It's kind of a new space.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.160
Yeah, well, it's probably very hard to be a lawyer

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.800
at Coinbase and very fun because, you know,

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.200
whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast,

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:02.200
there isn't a lot of case law and just precedent set.

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.480
So that's also an opportunity for you

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.440
to go create that stuff.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.600
And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.720
is like take a complex situation

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.280
where you have to balance difficult things.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.080
Like how do we prevent bad activity

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.120
but still enable an innovation?

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.920
That's a hard question.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.440
And there's, you can go draft legislation

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.760
and circulate it to policy makers

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.520
or come up with these policies and, you know,

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.360
how do you operate a business in an environment

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.760
where the law is just unclear, right?

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.960
It's like, try to do the right thing,

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.840
but like, you know, strike the right balance.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.240
So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.800
Very creative stuff.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.560
You mentioned one of the things you're focused on

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.040
is expanding the number of people,

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.440
maybe a billion people on Coinbase

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.320
or using cryptocurrency.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.240
Where are we at now?

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.000
How do we get to a billion?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.680
As of Q4 last year,

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.600
we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase,

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.400
but in any given quarter,

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.880
only, you know, maybe like 10 or a little more million

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.080
of those are like really active.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.920
So, and then if you look at globally,

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.240
I think some of the estimates I've seen is maybe

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.240
there's like 200 million people or something like that

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.560
who have ever used or tried crypto.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.560
So we're along, you know,

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.640
there were ways from a billion,

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.600
but it's not like that far off.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.960
How do you get there?

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.360
How do you get to a billion?

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.440
So a few things.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.120
One is the blockchain has got to become way more scalable.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.040
It's kind of like we're all running dial-up modems

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.000
and we need broadband.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.160
And so it's just like too expensive, too slow

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.200
to do all these transactions.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.040
And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability,

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.920
you know, we'll see another order of magnitude

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.600
kind of come out just from that.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.920
I think the second one would be more clear regulation.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.960
That would help a lot.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.680
I do talk to, you know, pension funds and, you know,

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.840
various asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and stuff.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.040
And a lot of them tell me,

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.800
we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today,

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.200
but we really would rather have like 20% in there.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.600
But what we're waiting for is more clear regulation

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.880
coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying,

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.040
these assets are commodities regulated by SEC,

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.720
these are by SEC, these are by treasury, whatever.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.480
So that would be a big unlock.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.920
Do transactions, so one of the things

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.960
that you mentioned, payments, sorry.

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.800
Yeah.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.920
Well, does that unlock a lot of users?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.160
Yeah, it does.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.320
I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.120
People sending money home to their families

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.000
in other countries where the fees are super high.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.720
So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.080
and there's more global adoption,

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.280
like I think we'll see remittance quarters

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.320
move over to crypto a lot.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.480
There's also just, the other thing that's driving

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.320
a lot of crypto adoption is basically the creation

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.320
of more and more third-party apps.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.200
So, or DAPs, they're sometimes called decentralized apps.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.440
So a lot of startups now, you know how like used to use

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.560
in the early 2000s, they called them .com startups,

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.000
but now you don't need to say .com

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.560
because everybody's using the internet.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.960
And so now there's like hundreds

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.120
or thousands of these crypto startups.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:06.960
But I think in the future,

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.200
you won't need to call them crypto startups

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.280
because they'll just be called startups

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.920
because everyone's using the internet and crypto

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.920
and whatever.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:15.840
So anyway, the use cases, the utility of crypto

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.080
is getting better and better

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.080
with like all these third-party apps

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.480
getting funded and created.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.680
Do you think there's gonna be a killer

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.000
or a set of killer DAPs,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.760
like a thing where nobody can live without?

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.320
Are we still waiting for that?

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.240
There's gonna be a bunch of them.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.520
It's just like, it's like the internet.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.000
Like what were the killer web companies, you know,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.280
like Uber and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google and like,

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.460
so there's gonna be some big winners,

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.660
but there'll be thousands of,

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:45.060
this is basically the new,

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.780
it's like what happened with the .com startups

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.620
in the early 2000s.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.180
It's like a lot of the best entrepreneurs

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:50.860
are building crypto startups now.

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:54.140
So tons of venture money flowing into the space,

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:55.660
a lot of smart young people.

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.620
Do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.340
will become the reserve currency of the world

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.740
at some point?

01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.740
So this is kind of a controversial idea,

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.500
but I actually think yes.

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.660
I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:09.580
a reserve currency of the world.

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.180
There's, so, you know, I've been reading Ray Dalio recently

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.700
with his new book, like The Changing World Order.

01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:19.780
And I thought it was a really well-researched book.

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.820
He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.860
He looks at like empires and, you know,

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.740
going back to various Chinese empires,

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.140
the Dutch and Ottomans and everybody,

01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:30.660
and how did they rise and they were able

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:33.020
to have the reserve currency as they rose

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.300
and what produced that?

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.720
Like it came from, you know, good education and innovation

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.280
and better trade and anyway.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.720
So the U.S. by some measures is kind of,

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.640
looks like it's, maybe it's had a really good run

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.960
and it's coming down a little bit

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.960
and China is kind of coming up.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.280
Who knows how that'll play out, by the way.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.560
Like the world is very complicated.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.120
It could, that could switch.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.280
But I guess if the U.S. dollar is gonna be seeing

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.720
more inflation in the future,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.960
the Chinese yuan is not like necessarily better, right?

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.560
I mean, they have a ton of debt as well

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.240
and, you know, it's not like you could really,

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:15.520
that the yuan could be inflated as well, right?

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.080
I probably will be.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.000
And so I do think that there's this group of people today,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.480
which probably most traditional, I don't know,

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.400
like the people who run big banks

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.840
and like governments and stuff that they're not,

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.000
this is not really on their radar today,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.760
but I think there's basically a group of younger people

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.020
in that kind of, you know, 25, 35 year old range

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.560
who are tech savvy.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.960
They're starting to think of crypto

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.120
as like the primary thing in their financial life.

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.920
It's like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.960
and I use dollars or euros or whatever.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.440
If I happen to need something,

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.600
I convert it to that at the last minute.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.360
It's like, if I go home, if I'm traveling,

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.080
I might convert some local currency in the moment,

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.120
but that's not where I hold most of my wealth.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.600
So this segment of the population is not like massive yet

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.600
from a GDP point of view,

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.600
but I think it's a leading indicator

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.720
of where things could be going.

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.920
And this is actually good for the world.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.360
It's kind of like, especially if China does continue to rise

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.600
and it has a more authoritarian view,

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.920
it'll be kind of this very centralized East

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.640
versus a decentralized West

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.880
where people are in the West, in the free world,

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.420
really kind of embracing crypto

01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:27.760
and a more open, fair, free global financial system,

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.040
which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity.

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.940
And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency,

01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:36.220
the gold standard of the crypto economy.

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.300
So that's pretty crazy.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:40.380
Yeah, the gold standard.

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.640
I mean, it's also like with Ray Dalio,

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.860
I feel like China will drive a lot of this

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.980
either in response or directly.

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.380
I mean, I think the ruble,

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.440
I'm not paying as close attention to the financial systems,

01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.020
but I think they're trying to tie it to gold once again.

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.700
So that's an interesting,

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.660
maybe it'll be one of the more authoritarian regime

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.940
that will switch to Bitcoin's standard first.

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.400
And then it's the West that will,

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.980
out of that pressure will catch up

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:17.420
versus the other way around.

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:22.420
It's fascinating to think of what is the forcing function,

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:26.260
what kind of perturbation is required to switch,

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.580
to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.700
But it could be, as you're saying,

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.980
just waiting for the people that are young now

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.660
that are embracing crypto

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:41.020
to enter the positions of power, essentially.

01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:42.380
But I hope that's not the case,

01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:47.380
because if for any innovation we have to wait,

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:51.860
sorry to say for the older folk to pass away,

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.700
that's not an efficient way to make change.

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.480
Yeah, that's a super interesting topic

01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.460
of how people's minds become less plastic as they age.

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:05.000
I guess it's a feature.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.480
It's called wisdom,

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.080
but then we also need the wild ones to explore,

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.080
exploration versus exploitation.

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.480
You wrote a blog post that's really interesting

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.680
in September 2020 titled,

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.980
Coinbase is a Mission-Focused Company,

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.640
like what we're talking about.

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.520
So one interesting thing you said in that blog post

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.560
is that we're not going to be distracted

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.000
by sort of activism within the company

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.160
that's not related to the mission of the company.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.600
Now, that's a rare thing for a company to state,

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.320
for a company CEO to state, especially in this climate.

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.680
Can you, first of all, describe in a little more detail

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.320
what you meant?

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.400
Did you receive blowback for this?

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.640
Definitely received some blowback,

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.040
but yeah, I'll describe what I meant.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.720
And if you want to talk about how it came to that too,

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.560
we can talk about that.

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.440
But what I meant is that there's a lot of companies

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.360
right now, including tech companies,

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.440
but not exclusively where,

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.440
I think like great companies,

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.680
they have an important mission.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.080
They're trying to do something really good for the world.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.640
And unfortunately, they're getting a little distracted

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.840
from that at times because of employee activism

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.320
that is causing the company to basically jump

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.960
into whatever the current thing is

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.760
and try to help is like the positive interpretation.

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.480
The negative interpretation would be to virtue signal.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:38.480
And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to,

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.200
this is largely an American company phenomenon, by the way.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.640
I do worry that this is making America less competitive,

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:46.440
even though I think of myself

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.840
as kind of internationally minded,

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.080
but I am a US citizen and have my whole life here.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.000
So when we put out this statement,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.040
we had employees that were not in the US

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.200
who were confused by it.

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.560
They were like, why did Brian need to say that?

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:02.480
He was just saying, you're gonna focus on work at work.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.480
That's what we were doing already.

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.640
And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities,

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.320
in particular, we had employees

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.320
that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.440
where I think people really wanted the company they worked

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.720
at to be almost acting like the government or something

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.200
and trying to solve the hardest societal issues

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.400
and at least have an opinion on it,

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.360
if not contribute to the solution on almost everything.

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.960
And for me, it was a very uncomfortable situation for me

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.040
as a CEO, I'd never quite been in this situation

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.080
where most of the time when employees in the past

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:47.480
were kind of asking me questions,

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.600
they would be asking about like,

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:50.800
how do we make this product better?

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.360
Like, what do we do with this competitor?

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.760
What about this regulator?

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.720
And it got to a place around that time

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.640
where most of the questions we were receiving were,

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.120
I think even about things not related to the company,

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.280
they were about broader societal issues,

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.680
like Brian, what's your stance on XYZ controversial thing?

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.960
And it was, I often didn't have an opinion on these,

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.160
these are really hard questions, right?

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.840
And I felt like it was distracting the company.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.800
People internally were getting into fights a lot too,

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.640
like disagreeing with each other.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.520
There was a thing where like the Slack internally

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.160
was turning into a social media almost

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.360
with people putting in flame wars.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.000
So, and this culminated, by the way,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.320
with a walkout that happened in the company.

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.640
We had received like some demands from employee groups

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.440
about various things and there was like

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.320
basically an antagonistic thing with management

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.920
and I was like, we're all on the same team here.

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.240
If you wanna be antagonistic,

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.480
let's do it with somebody else outside the company,

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.480
that we're trying to improve the world in that dimension.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.080
So, yeah, eventually I was like, okay,

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.840
the company is not aligned on this.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.560
I just don't feel, I don't like the job as CEO, frankly.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.840
Like if the job is to come in here every day

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.160
and like have to squirm in front of like

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.160
these are the most difficult societal questions,

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.400
I don't think I wanna do that job.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.720
So like either they're gonna have to go

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:08.120
or I'm gonna have to go.

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.400
And I founded this company

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.360
and I really believe in the mission,

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.400
so they're gonna have to go.

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.120
And what I realized was that,

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.920
so I basically, I made an exit package available

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.320
to anybody who wasn't on board with this direction.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.200
5% of employees took it.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.880
I got the company realigned towards this mission.

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.160
We're all here to do work.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.480
By the way, people can, they can go do anything

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.760
like political or social activism outside of work.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.600
It's totally fine.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.360
Like we all, everybody has stuff like that

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.360
in their personal life, but while at work,

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.600
we can also disagree at work, by the way, on the work.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.800
You know, this is not like a no disagreement culture.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.320
Like we should, let's try to get the truth.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.040
But don't bring stuff into work

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.040
that's just gonna create division.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.440
Make the workplace a refuge from division

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440
about all these crazy things.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.720
And like, we're all aligned here to work on the mission.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.640
Let's do that.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:57.240
Yeah, that was really, really, really refreshing to hear.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.360
So this is me speaking, but there's a sense

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.520
when companies take on these issues publicly

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.160
from a CEO position or anywhere else,

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.960
that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:13.520
versus solving a particular problem.

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.680
Because to solve a particular problem,

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.840
you really have to, really put in a huge,

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.520
you have to hire a huge number.

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.960
You basically have to create a company within a company

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.440
to take on a particular thing.

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:29.440
But if you allow yourself to internally care

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.160
about a particular issue, you're basically pacifying

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.000
some number of employee, like making sure

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.960
Slack doesn't get out of hand.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.120
And then you're doing this kind of, from my perspective,

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.720
especially on issues I care about, fake virtue signaling,

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.520
basically trying to understand

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.200
what will make me look the best,

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.680
what will make the company look the best

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.280
in this particular aspect.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.080
And it just seems very shallow.

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.240
And it's optimizing for the wrong thing,

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.840
not for the solving of the problems,

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:01.840
but for the making yourself look like the good guy.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.920
And trying to then leverage that to say,

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.520
I'm the good guy in all situations.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.760
And it just, it's the wrong thing.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.880
And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader,

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.560
it's also creating division,

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:19.280
unnecessary division within people.

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.280
Like they get, yeah, there's something that bothers us

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.800
that gets extremely argumentative about certain topics.

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.760
They really bring out the emotion.

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.840
And I think that probably, as you were saying,

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.920
that emotion is even probably okay,

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.040
maybe productive when that emotion has to do

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.640
with the mission of the company.

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.400
Like you really care about those disagreements

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.880
versus like something that has nothing to do

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:48.880
with the particular, with increasing economic freedom

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.320
using crypto.

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.680
Yeah, it's fascinating.

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:55.440
But it was so refreshing because it's rare.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.320
Why do you think that's a rare?

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.840
So the city you're mentioning,

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.960
I mean, there's a bunch of cities,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
but San Francisco is one such city when that culture.

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.360
And it's sad because San Francisco is also,

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.680
the Bay Area is also the hub historically

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:20.640
of some of the greatest innovation in human history.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.080
So there's that tension.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.400
How did that culture emerge there

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:27.360
where like the innovation was done by people

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.040
that are very mission driven.

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.840
You get a bunch of smart people together

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:32.680
to solve a difficult problem.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.720
They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on,

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.600
but they try to balance that

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.440
because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.720
And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.320
It's a fascinating human dynamic.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.160
I don't know.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.440
Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley,

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.280
not just the innovation,

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.200
but the social dynamics that occurred there.

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.200
Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:01.720
Well, because people don't wanna get attacked.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.120
It's like super, you don't wanna get canceled, right?

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.680
It's super uncomfortable.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.000
Nobody wants to be called a racist

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.360
or whatever people wanna say on Twitter.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.200
So-

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.600
Did you get attacked?

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.040
Yeah, yeah, I definitely got attacked.

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.000
I mean, and I knew it would be controversial.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.640
The only reason I did it, frankly,

01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.600
was that I was kind of at my wit's end.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.800
I was like, well, like I said earlier,

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.480
like the job, the CEO job sucks.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.480
Like either I don't wanna do it or they have to go

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.320
and I'm gonna make the company into something that I want.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:36.320
And I'd spent eight or nine years of my life at that point

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.360
kind of building this thing.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.200
I was like, well, I could go start another company,

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.240
but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.440
And Coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.240
I feel very passionate about it.

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.800
So yeah, I'm not gonna go.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.040
Like I need to make this the company that I wanna work at.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.080
And what was really interesting

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.240
was that there was such a huge outpouring of support.

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.200
So I knew that it would be controversial

01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.040
and I would get attacked.

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:02.960
And predictably, there was some journalists

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.480
and New York Times and all these people

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:06.800
who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.400
on the company shortly thereafter.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.080
And they basically just call people who've left the company

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.640
and can get quotes on whatever they want

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.280
and then they'll write a story.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.560
So mainstream media,

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.560
I lost a lot of trust in mainstream media, frankly,

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:20.380
after that.

01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.680
And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:25.920
that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.760
at this point.

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.520
It's basically either super left or super right.

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.000
And it's not really that focused on truth.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.560
So that's kind of unfortunate

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.840
because I think journalism is actually

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:37.960
really important in society.

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.760
So that whole thing got eroded in the US.

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.160
Luckily, there's sort of new media,

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.680
people like you and a whole bunch of people.

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.680
Did that blog post help that statement,

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.560
the 95 people that remained?

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.520
Is this still something you struggle with

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.640
because it's also a culture of the broader tech space?

01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.000
Okay, so that was an interesting thing,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:58.840
which was that,

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.680
so the 95% of people stayed.

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:05.000
I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.240
thank God you finally spoke up and said something

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.000
because frankly, it was making it

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.280
not a very fun place to work either.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.240
And I realized that there is,

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:16.280
I think there was a,

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.000
I think that Nassim Taleb has this blog post

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.360
about the tyranny of the 1% or something like that,

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.040
but there's basically a relatively small group,

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.520
one in 5% or something like that,

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:28.360
that is really upset about something.

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.600
It's not the majority of the company.

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.840
It's like 5%.

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.400
There's another 15% or something

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.160
that are sympathetic to the cause.

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.960
They're actually somewhat suggestible.

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.520
They will go along with whatever,

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.680
because it sounds reasonable.

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.360
These are like real issues they're talking about.

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.640
It's not to say that it's not real.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.920
And they'll kind of get swept up in it.

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.600
But there's an 80% of the company

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:49.120
that basically doesn't agree

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:50.360
or just wants to get their work done

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.880
without all this drama or distraction.

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.600
And they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up,

01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.760
they're afraid of being, again, called a racist,

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.920
like fired, ostracized amongst their peers.

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.600
And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.360
for me to finally say, you know what?

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.080
I feel like I have to do this,

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.560
live through the short-term attacks of the press,

01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.320
which ultimately was very freeing for me,

01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.320
because now I don't really care.

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.080
And now I can actually just build the company

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:20.720
that I want to build without caring about that.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.160
So, and then what was cool was a lot of really great people

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.920
reached out to the Coinbase too after that.

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.240
And we're like, I'm an early engineer at Google

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.000
or wherever, and this culture has gotten kind of messed up.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.200
And I want to work at a company

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.240
that's willing to stand for that.

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.360
And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.920
Basically what I realized, and by the way,

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.520
our diversity numbers and all that stuff,

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:43.120
people told me when I was drafting this poster,

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:45.000
don't post this.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.240
People, underrepresented groups

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.840
will never want to work at this company again.

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:49.920
I don't think that's true.

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.680
I talked to our ERG groups,

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.520
and they're not telling me

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.840
they care about this stuff that much.

01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.160
They're telling me they just want to be respected at work

01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.840
and do good work and contribute.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.600
So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.000
And I can tell you a year after doing it,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.520
our diversity numbers are basically

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.840
either the same or better in every category.

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.360
So that turned out to be false.

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.320
Look, I hate to be polarizing on either dimension here.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.520
I just want to get good work done

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:19.960
and build good stuff with technology.

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:24.960
So I think companies should just have reasonable policies.

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.280
You want to get rid of bias in hiring.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.600
You want to attract great people

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.520
from all different backgrounds.

01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.840
We have pledged 1%.

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.080
We put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.760
I hope we're able to do good stuff with that.

01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:39.080
Let's give back in some way.

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:43.200
But the main message, I guess, for me,

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.480
is the core mission, the core work that we're doing

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.960
on economic freedom and just all of our products,

01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.480
that is the main value that we're contributing in the world.

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.360
Let's just do that more and hopefully we can get

01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.120
from 89 million verified users to a billion or whatever.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.960
And then I just think that's how

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.480
we'll have the biggest impact.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.440
It's tempting though.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:06.440
It's so interesting how companies get tempted to help.

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:10.160
And you step in and it's almost like a drug

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.920
and then you forget.

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:14.760
I mean, all of us in life, it doesn't have to be companies.

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.760
You get distracted and maintaining focus.

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:19.800
You're absolutely right.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.080
The way for Coinbase to add value to the world

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:27.080
is to maximize the mission that it's on, not other stuff.

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.920
And when you get wealthier and more successful,

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.960
it becomes more and more tempting

01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.360
to just help out in some other shallow ways.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:36.040
It's fascinating.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.560
And you just kind of brought that to light.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:38.720
So it was very refreshing.

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:40.280
And it shouldn't be controversial

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.960
to sort of focus on just getting stuff done.

01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:44.800
Well, let me ask you.

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.200
I mean, do you think that this,

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.640
it's all these things tied together.

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:50.560
There's like a general trend of like more censorship.

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:53.000
There's like more cancel culture.

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.080
There's some of these like freedom values are kind of,

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.680
even like freezing people's accounts,

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:02.480
like the trucker thing that happened.

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:05.080
And it seems like there's a general trend

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:10.080
of more authoritarian policies there.

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.920
But do you feel like the tide is turning on that?

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:17.040
Like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently.

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:20.880
I think it's the last gasp of old way of doing things.

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.880
And so there's desperation and so on.

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:27.120
Because to be fair, it's kind of the internet,

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:29.680
which is where is the source of a lot of this,

01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.200
where people have a voice,

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.320
is making the power centers of the world really nervous.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.560
And so that's where that's coming from, I think.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.800
And the internet is tricky.

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.000
It's weird.

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:41.680
It's full of bots.

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:45.800
It's full of like misinformation of all kinds,

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.840
full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on.

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.600
And I mean misinformation broadly.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.760
People are misusing the word misinformation.

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.200
They're just, governments are just labeling

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:59.040
random things with misinformation just to censor them.

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:03.560
But I just think it's just like a new world

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:06.120
where the internet is really finally taking hold,

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:09.280
where there's billions of devices and everybody has a voice.

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:14.320
It's almost, basically governments and powerful people

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.440
are slightly losing hold of power

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.560
and they're starting to freak out a little bit.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.920
That's it.

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:25.640
So once you have young people that are coming up now,

02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:28.720
gain power, I think we'll rebalance everything.

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.520
And then there's, yeah, like you said, promising signs

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:38.240
that it's obvious that the majority of people want freedom

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.440
and that means a lot of things.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:40.640
That means economic freedom.

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:43.040
That means freedom to have a voice,

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:47.960
freedom to move around, freedom to act in the way they,

02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.960
without reasonable sort of limitations

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.040
by people that don't have their best interests.

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.760
And I gain more hope from just regular people

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.760
that are fighting and like demanding

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.640
the being able to have freedom of speech

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.360
or more specifically sort of resisting crude

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.480
overreach of government in the acts of censorship,

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.000
at least in the United States.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.640
And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.320
that's struggling on a much more basic level

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.760
where people are being put in prison

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.040
for the words they say, not just banned from Twitter.

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:31.480
Right, it could be worse.

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.880
What are some lessons from your failures

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:40.080
and your successes about what it takes to run a company?

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.720
I think one of the things that I learned about leadership

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:47.240
is that I never really thought of myself

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.840
as a very natural leader, to be honest.

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.560
I don't think I was a natural leader.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.040
But so I always envisioned good leaders

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.480
as like these military generals,

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.920
like they seem so confident and they're just like

02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.360
bark orders, like charge that hill and do this.

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.240
And I was actually like more introverted

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.720
and kind of, I wasn't really confident

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:07.840
in the way I communicated.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:11.920
And so what I realized is that

02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.160
there's lots of different kinds of leaders.

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:15.040
You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:16.360
I was kind of more of like a product,

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.200
technical focused CEO.

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:21.720
And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion.

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:23.760
And it wasn't just gonna like render a decision in the room

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.080
in some like kind of heated moment

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:26.280
and like piss off half the people.

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:28.360
I would be like, all right, I'm gonna go think about it

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.680
and I'll send you my decision later today

02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:32.160
or tomorrow or whatever.

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:35.040
And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me

02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.600
where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like,

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.600
when people getting like super emotional about something

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.560
and like, I think they're thinking

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.480
their judgment goes down, right?

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.480
And it's like never make a decision when you're angry, right?

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.960
And so if I would always sort of try to get a sense of,

02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:52.280
are these people like trying to be right

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.640
or are they trying to seek the truth?

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:57.280
And you can do these little tricks like,

02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.400
okay, you argue that person's position

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.320
and you argue the other one and like,

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.880
see if you can genuinely represent it.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.360
Now I know you're listening and these kinds of things.

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.840
But I guess, sorry, getting back to your question

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.680
about leadership.

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:12.200
I think I basically just kept doing things

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:15.160
that were a little outside my comfort zone

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:17.800
and then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.640
You know?

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.080
And so I think that's how you build confidence

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.960
is you do the thing that's scary

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.840
and it's like a little outside

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.080
like when I first started Coinbase,

02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:30.200
I had never managed anybody.

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:32.040
I would have been scared to death

02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.640
to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.200
and sort of, all right, if 5% of people will go,

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.240
you know, we didn't know what percent it was gonna be

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.080
by the way.

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.320
It could have been 1%, it could have been 50%.

02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:45.240
Like, but we went into it scary because it was a scary thing.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.560
I was like, I don't know, I think this is right.

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:49.440
I'm just gonna do it.

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.920
So if you do enough scary things,

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.800
like you'll build the confidence.

02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.560
And I feel like I'm still on that journey.

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.080
Every year or two at Coinbase,

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.680
there's some big thing that comes out as like,

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.600
oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.600
and like, this is the next level, right?

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.600
But that's how you learn and grow.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:07.480
So you're still going up that mountain

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.360
through the fog one step at a time.

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.560
Yeah.

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.960
Can I just quickly ask you about a couple other efforts

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.840
that are super interesting that you're involved with?

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.880
So first of all, a little bit more old school,

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.640
fascinating effort or research hub.

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.320
So what's that about?

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.960
What's the Github for open science?

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:27.800
Yeah, okay.

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.200
So basically I've had a chance to try to help

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.920
a couple other companies get off the ground too,

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.600
cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.320
And one of them, I've always thought about like,

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:41.280
why is scientific research not more like open source software

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.720
or why couldn't it be much faster, right?

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:44.800
And there's, you've probably have seen this

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.040
like in an academic setting, right?

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.000
But there's all kinds of things that feel very antiquated

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.520
to me about scientific research,

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.720
everything from the funding process and grants

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.640
to how peer review works, to how you submit the journals,

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:00.040
all the costs associated with journals.

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.320
You know, the people you'd think like you'd get paid

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.800
for this or something and it would then be available

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.160
to all the taxpayers for free,

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.720
but no, they're like, they're all paywalled

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.400
and there's like these big companies that have sort of,

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:12.040
in my view, kind of held back innovation here.

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:15.000
So, and the preprint servers like bioarchive

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.600
and archive.org have really helped this,

02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:18.600
but those websites, they look like they're kind of

02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.200
from like 15 years ago or something.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.760
Yeah, it's like Craigslist or something.

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:22.720
Yeah.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.120
So anyway, one of the things I,

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.360
once Coinbase went public last year,

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:27.600
I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like,

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.920
all right, let me fund a small team

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.560
and let's see if we can,

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:32.720
if they can like go off and make something better here.

02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:35.200
So we have a prototype out there,

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.440
it's at researchhub.com, people can check it out.

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.720
And it's basically, you know,

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:41.560
the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:44.520
There's like various hubs, which are like journals,

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:46.480
but you know, you can publish papers there,

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:48.280
you can use an electronic lab notebook

02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:49.800
to sort of have a modern day paper,

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:51.600
which is not just a PDF that's static,

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.640
but it's a living document.

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:54.520
Ideally in the future, you know,

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.640
you can get comments and feedback from people in there,

02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:58.080
you can update it over time.

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:00.240
We want people to be able to share the code

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.800
and the data sets associated with their research papers,

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:05.080
not just a PDF.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.080
And in the future, we wanna make it even where like,

02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.920
you know, people can get funding for science

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:13.720
through that site and even license out innovations

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:14.560
that they've made.

02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:17.320
Because the other thing I've noticed in life is that

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:18.160
there's kind of like,

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:19.280
there's a bunch of people working on science

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.200
and there's a bunch of people building companies

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.440
and they very, very rarely intersect,

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:25.880
but when they do, you get the best things like,

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:28.720
like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google and like,

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.080
even Coinbase was based on a research paper,

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:32.520
the Bitcoin white paper.

02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:35.380
And so most business people are like creating companies

02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:36.860
that don't have any scientific innovation.

02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:40.280
They're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.820
And then a lot of scientists are making things

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:44.800
which never actually benefit humanity

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:47.640
because they're not commercialized and turned into products.

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:50.760
And so if we can somehow create a translation layer

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.360
between those two groups and help them,

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:56.360
you know, helps align the market forces,

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.160
align scientific research to market forces

02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.240
so that they're more incentivized.

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:01.820
Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that,

02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:03.280
like you should be a billionaire, you know,

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.600
and like all the downstream implications of that,

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.920
not going through some antiquated tech transfer office

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:08.760
or whatever.

02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:11.240
And if you're an entrepreneur,

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.640
you should be looking to commercialize

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.800
the latest scientific innovations.

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:17.120
And so that's kind of like the long-term vision

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.720
for that site.

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.260
I think it's just an early step today,

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.580
but we've got like a really passionate community on there

02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:24.840
that are jumping into like, you know,

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.740
computer science or longevity or various bio hubs

02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:31.820
or whatever, and like beginning to source

02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:34.220
the best innovations, but also discuss them,

02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:36.260
improve them and publish through the site.

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:38.260
So I have a question about incentives,

02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:40.380
but first let me say for people listening

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:42.700
outside of academia might not be familiar

02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:44.320
with an absurd situation.

02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.260
So there's journals, like you mentioned,

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:51.660
and scientists publish in those journals.

02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:56.340
And the journals provide very little value

02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:00.660
except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.

02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:05.540
And so in the digital world,

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:07.460
they're providing basically almost no value

02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.040
except hosting your paper.

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:15.320
And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.520
And that charge is not like even Netflix fees,

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.880
you're talking about a lot of money.

02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:24.080
So they're basically blocking your research

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:27.040
that should be wide open from the world

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.400
and creating a paywall.

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.840
It's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back.

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.640
I don't, it's a shitty scam

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.320
because you're not making that much money.

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:38.760
I feel like a definition of a scam,

02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.800
you should at least be making money.

02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.160
So like significant amount of money.

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.400
You're basically making shitty money

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.880
and holding back all of human knowledge, okay.

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:49.240
So that put aside, and people get a little confused

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.460
because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists.

02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.160
People think like the journals

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.640
are somehow funding the scientists,

02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:01.200
therefore they have the right to put up a paywall.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.520
No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere.

02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:07.080
Journals are the middle man that nobody asks for,

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:08.240
especially in the digital world.

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:13.240
Anyway, that said, there is interesting kind of incentives

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:16.080
for scientists, which is prestige and so on.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:20.040
So there's a thing with journals.

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.320
If there's a prestigious journal

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.160
and you pass the review process,

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:26.680
you get into that journal

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:29.760
or a prestigious conference in computer science,

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:33.440
then that's seen as a good thing in your resume.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.080
And not just your resume, within your community,

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.400
that's a respected thing.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.680
Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:44.760
in the open setting of Research Hub?

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.480
So like where I could say I got X, Y, and Z,

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:50.840
like look, I'm impressive

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:52.680
because this happened on Research Hub.

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:53.520
I think you're right.

02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:56.920
Like the whole academia progress track

02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:59.840
is about where you got published and how many citations.

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.240
And it's kind of like a false economy of reputation

02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.900
because there's not real money backing it.

02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:10.240
And so I think we've thought about this a little bit.

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.200
And I think the Research Hub team has an opportunity

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.920
to do something here that basically says like,

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.920
okay, I had the top paper for 2022 in biology in here.

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.240
And you basically publish a list,

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.160
a leaderboards of these like top for the month,

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:29.200
the year in all these different categories.

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.840
Then actually, we should probably give out grants

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.520
and awards in addition to that.

02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.360
Fund those people almost like fellows

02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.520
or even give out like,

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.080
I don't know how it's like the Nobel Prize.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.040
There should be like a Research Hub Prize or something

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.900
and like ship people,

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:47.680
maybe even ship like a print version of a journal

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:50.240
that is the top papers in each category

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:51.200
in each month or whatever.

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.800
And like people wanna put that in their wall in the lab.

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.560
And like, so I do think we need to sort of change.

02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:59.960
I don't know, like the traditional folks in academia

02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:02.500
or science would probably think this is like a crazy idea,

02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.540
but I think we need to change the culture

02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:09.340
to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals,

02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:11.380
almost like friends don't let friends publish

02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:14.100
in like paywall journals,

02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:16.460
like, cause that's, it's just not helping humanity.

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:20.100
So like, it should be more prestigious to publish

02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.900
in an open science way and get the top spot.

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:25.720
That should be celebrated above being published

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:27.780
in whatever, I don't even wanna name one of them.

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:30.060
Well, there's currently,

02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:31.260
the culture has already shifted

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:33.620
to where almost everybody publishes an archive

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.940
and by archive and so on.

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:39.220
But, so that the culture is there on that,

02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:42.380
that's seen friends don't let friends not publish open,

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:44.660
but then the prestige thing is missing,

02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:47.980
which is like, anyone can publish an archive.

02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:50.020
So how do you know it's actually a strong paper?

02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:54.980
Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now,

02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:56.580
word of mouth is powerful.

02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:00.260
Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.

02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:02.700
So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper,

02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:06.180
we don't need reviewers, our human eyes are the reviewers,

02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:08.540
like the community are the reviewers.

02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:11.060
So it's already, it's like that part is there,

02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:13.780
but it would be nice to have like,

02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:18.460
you know, nature level, like this is respect,

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:21.660
this is a respectful accomplishment.

02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:25.980
And something like a leaderboard, but a stable kind of system.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:26.820
Yeah.

02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:27.660
I should mention too,

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.100
so there's a crypto angle to this too,

02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:31.100
which is, so research hub has a coin

02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:32.540
associated with research coin.

02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:35.460
And it's basically, if people upvote your paper

02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:38.980
or like support it, you'll accumulate more research coin,

02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:42.180
which is basically like rep or like a reward token.

02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.340
And so that is a way to, I guess,

02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:49.500
measure the community's collective view of that paper,

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.180
a form of peer review.

02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:53.140
And it can even be weighted by like the reputation

02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:55.980
of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time.

02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.500
Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that,

02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:02.460
so I think from like a prestige point of view,

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:05.100
it won't start off that way.

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.460
It'll probably start off like being a little more quirky.

02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.140
Like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started,

02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:13.300
it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff.

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:14.420
And, but now like, you know,

02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.060
if you have a million subscribers on YouTube,

02:13:16.060 --> 02:13:18.500
that's probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC

02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:21.020
or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:23.500
So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever,

02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:27.180
but I'm hoping that this can sort of be the new

02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:30.100
prestigious way that young people publish in science.

02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:32.540
And it'll come to be viewed as more prestigious.

02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:34.140
The journals, the traditional journals

02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:36.060
will be viewed as old fashioned.

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:41.060
Well, it's definitely a system that could do a lot better.

02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:42.780
And there's a lot of incredible,

02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.660
brilliant people doing science.

02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.540
They deserve better, the better platforms.

02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:50.300
So another thing you're taking on and helping out with

02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:53.860
is this new limit, which is looking at longevity.

02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:55.700
What's the idea there?

02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:56.540
Yeah, okay.

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:58.140
So as you can see, I'm excited about science.

02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:01.180
Like I think, you know, science is sort of the,

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:03.340
basically if you get scientific innovation,

02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:05.700
then you get better products

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:07.140
and you get better economic growth.

02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:10.340
And then you get all kinds of like surplus in society

02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:13.340
that can go to arts and philosophy and like all kinds of stuff.

02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:17.700
But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got it.

02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:21.100
I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year,

02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:23.660
and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff

02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:24.660
happening in bio.

02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.740
And there's a lot of really cool stuff happening

02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:28.900
with like CAR T cells and CRISPR and all these things.

02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:32.060
And anyway, one of the topics that I started

02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:35.100
to learn more about was something called cell reprogramming.

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.740
And, you know, people maybe have heard

02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:39.980
of this induced pluripotent stem cells

02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:41.380
where you could take like a skin cell

02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:43.220
and turn it back into a stem cell.

02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:45.780
And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:48.980
for this work that was done in 2006.

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.740
And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.

02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.260
You can turn one cell into another type of cell.

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:57.980
Well, people recently have been experimenting

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.260
with different types of transcription factors

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:03.580
that would either not, you don't want the cell

02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:05.580
to go all the way back to being a stem cell.

02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:07.260
You can end up getting like cancer cells

02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:08.100
and things like that.

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:10.460
But you want it basically to the cell to revert

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:13.340
a little bit earlier in its, you know,

02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.980
it would call it the Waddington landscape,

02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:17.620
but it's basically like, it'll go, become,

02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.660
start to act like a bit of a younger cell,

02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:21.260
but not to de-differentiate

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.140
and become more like a stem cell.

02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:25.780
And so I decided this might be an interesting area

02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:27.020
to go fund.

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:28.780
I think that that team has come together.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:30.900
There's like some really talented people

02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:32.540
who've come together to help get that off the ground.

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:36.080
And they're basically building a platform

02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.820
that can test a lot of different transcription factors

02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.420
on different cell types and hopefully find ways

02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:44.380
to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues

02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:45.500
to extend human health span.

02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:47.740
I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know,

02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:51.700
the get to Mars is that there could be some therapy here

02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:54.260
that in, I don't know, 10 or 20 years that you take

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.580
and from a whole body point of view,

02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:58.340
is sort of rejuvenating tissue,

02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.740
not just one type of tissue like your immune system,

02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:02.540
but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain,

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:04.900
so that, you know, we don't have that issue

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.540
where people who are older have trouble learning

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:08.740
or they're more ossified in their thinking.

02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:12.100
To me, this is just, I always think about,

02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.540
you know, it's actually a little inspired by Elon, right?

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:18.380
It's like, what are some of the biggest things in the world

02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:20.520
that are probably high technology risk,

02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.520
but if they did work,

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.560
maybe they're kind of low chance of working,

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:26.040
but if they did work, it would have enormous impact.

02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.400
I like the idea of trying hard tech problems,

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.880
especially for people like founders like me

02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:32.440
who've made some money in software,

02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.680
which I think we're in kind of like a golden age of software,

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:36.520
so there's like fortunes to be made,

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.680
but if you do make some money in that,

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:42.680
my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits, you know,

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.580
and try some of the harder things like in biotech or,

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:48.480
you know, I guess he's doing cars and rockets and stuff,

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:52.480
but anyway, I think we should try hard tech

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.640
or, you know, physical science problems as well

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.120
and see if that can advance for Team Human.

02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.560
Yeah, so he's also doing bio with Neuralink,

02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:06.280
and I feel like bio is tough,

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:07.320
because it's messy.

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.360
We don't understand it as well.

02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:09.480
We don't understand it.

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:14.240
The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher,

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.240
but like you have to deal with the actual sort of,

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:23.240
to get to human, to get to stuff where it could be therapies

02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:28.240
for actual human bodies is tricky,

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.640
because you have to prove that it's safe,

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.560
it's effective, all those kinds of things with FDA.

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:34.920
I mean, it's just, it's tricky.

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:36.040
It's very difficult.

02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.520
It's a long journey.

02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:39.640
I mean.

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:41.720
If I can give a quick plug.

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.440
So yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit.

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:45.200
We're hiring talented scientists

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.040
that are interested in the cellular programming space.

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.840
They don't necessarily have to be coming

02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:50.720
from like an aging background or anything like that.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.120
There's sort of a small group of people doing even.

02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:54.240
So this is a new thing?

02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.400
This is a, is New Limit relatively new?

02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:57.600
Yeah, it's very new.

02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:00.680
There's a small team today, just a handful of people.

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:03.640
And so we're hiring more there.

02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:05.600
If people are excited about that space, reach out.

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:07.920
And same thing for Research Hub.

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:10.080
There's a small team there that's really awesome,

02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.840
that's doing more like software engineering, design,

02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:15.040
product, that kind of stuff.

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.000
What advice would you give if you put on your old,

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.240
wise, sage hat?

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:24.000
What advice would you give to young people today?

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.280
High school, maybe undergrad and college?

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:29.640
About life.

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:34.200
So like career, having a career they can be proud of,

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:36.360
or maybe a life they can be proud of.

02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.440
So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:42.360
So there's not one way to do it.

02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:44.840
I do think that some people,

02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:46.440
a particular type of people out there,

02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:47.280
a lot of people actually,

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:48.480
they want to have an impact on the world.

02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.960
That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:53.680
So, I mean, you need to have like health, physical health.

02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.000
You need to have good relationships.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.400
Like there's lots of things,

02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.400
but most people want to do something important.

02:18:58.400 --> 02:18:59.680
They want to have fulfilling work,

02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.720
a way that they can feel like they're contributing.

02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:04.360
I think a lot of people, young people today,

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:07.360
are thinking like, you know,

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:09.520
I should be an activist or something like that.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.440
And there's people in the world who have power

02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:13.760
and a lot of people who don't, I don't have power.

02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:16.560
And so the way to change the world is to, you know,

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:20.360
speak truth to power or like criticize power

02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.120
and try to pressure them to change.

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:27.160
To me, I don't think that's the right way

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.800
to actually have an impact on the world

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.640
because, you know, everybody has probably,

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.760
I think people have more power than they realize.

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.440
And by the way, it's easy to be a critic.

02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:41.040
It's hard to actually change these things

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:42.120
and fix it.

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:44.600
And so you'll get a lot of accolades

02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:46.000
from friends and things like that.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.920
If you kind of go around criticizing, you know,

02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:50.000
it's easy to do like everything is broken

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.520
and could be better, including, you know,

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:53.360
stuff I'm working on.

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.880
I find like so frustrating.

02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:57.600
There's a million things I want to be better about,

02:19:57.600 --> 02:19:59.200
like what we're doing in Coinbase.

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:04.080
So be the person in the arena, you know,

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.320
like that Theodore Roosevelt quote, I think he said it,

02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:10.160
right, like go chew glass and stare into the abyss.

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.840
Like if you really want to have an impact,

02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.560
either join a company that has a mission

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.200
that is trying to fix a thing you're passionate about

02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:18.920
or start that company if it doesn't exist

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:22.240
or start a charity if it's not suitable to be a company

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:25.640
or whatever it is, but go try to be a part of the solution.

02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.280
Don't just, you know, criticize or be a part of the problem.

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:35.280
My hope is that more people can, you know,

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.480
realize that they actually can have a meaningful impact

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:40.320
that way.

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:43.280
And I think that to me, technology is actually

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.440
one of the most important ways to improve the world.

02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.160
Like if you look at climate change,

02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.920
like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.600
all these things, it's a technology thing, right?

02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.920
If you want to try to fix education,

02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.360
it's like look at like Khan Academy

02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.040
and all the stuff going online, right?

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.960
If you want to fix, you know, whatever,

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:05.000
transportation and like the financial system

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.800
and global freedom and like equality of all these things,

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:11.240
like there's typically the way to get something changed

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:13.280
in the world today is with technology.

02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.880
And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me

02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:19.200
that there's this kind of like anti-tech thing going on.

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.520
Look, nothing is perfect.

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:21.640
Like if you create something new

02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:23.520
and like tens of millions of people use it

02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:25.320
or billions of people use it, it's like,

02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:27.360
there's gonna be some bad people who use it too, okay?

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.520
And there's, you know, society is complicated,

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:33.040
but like I think most of these things have been net positive

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:34.880
because most people in the world are good,

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.200
is at least my view.

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:39.120
So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.040
trying to, you know, abuse something,

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.680
but 99% of people in the world are good.

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:45.040
And the way you can improve the world is with technology,

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:46.480
joining companies, starting companies

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:48.240
that are working on the right stuff.

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.920
So I hope more young people do that.

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.560
And just, if you're not sure what to do,

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:54.880
like just get started with anything.

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:55.760
That's how you learn.

02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:57.800
And basically have the optimism

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:00.240
that you have the power to do the change.

02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:05.120
So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic.

02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:08.200
That's almost like acknowledging to yourself

02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:09.600
that that's all you can be.

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:15.320
But basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:19.800
I like chew glass and look into the abyss.

02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:24.000
That's much more fun than it sounds.

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:27.400
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.920
Why are we here?

02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:29.960
It's life.

02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:31.760
Yep, what's the meaning of life?

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:34.120
What's this existence we got?

02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:36.400
You're trying to increase the amount of economic freedom

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:37.240
on this planet Earth,

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:40.440
trying to alleviate some of the suffering, but why?

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:44.400
I don't really think there is any point to life.

02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:49.200
Somebody once told me,

02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:54.600
if you go into these really big existential questions,

02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.680
it can get a little scary

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.160
because you stare off the cliff

02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.560
and there's nothing there.

02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:02.800
This one person told me one time,

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:06.960
they were like, Brian, you should probably snorkel,

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.200
don't scoopa.

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:10.400
I guess, and I think they were trying to say,

02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:13.040
some of my friends have done this, right?

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:16.920
They'll go to epic meditation retreats

02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.320
and they'll come back with all this existential dread

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:23.200
of what's the meaning of it all.

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:24.080
As far as I can tell,

02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:27.680
we are just some organic molecules in the ocean

02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:29.960
started dividing and replicating

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:32.720
and the selfish gene and all this stuff,

02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:34.800
basically ended up here.

02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:38.080
It's some kind of really naive algorithm

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.960
that's just trying to get us to survive and replicate

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:43.600
and we have DNA just like every other animal.

02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:45.240
And so we happened to develop

02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:46.920
these really cool neocortexes

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:48.600
and so now we're self-aware

02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.000
and we have all these big questions.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.080
And maybe we'll create another,

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.040
as computers get better,

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.080
we'll create the simulation inside our thing

02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:58.960
and I think it's cool.

02:23:58.960 --> 02:23:59.800
We should basically,

02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:02.680
I just wanna keep watching the movie unfold.

02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.600
And that's part of why I wanna work on,

02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:06.440
like New Limit is really cool

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:07.280
because it's helping.

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.120
If people can live longer,

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.120
whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud

02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.760
or basically through,

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:16.680
we get biology to work or the strong AI to work

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:17.520
or whatever,

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.240
one of those two hopefully works out

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:21.160
and then we get to keep watching the movie

02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:22.600
and see how it all unfolds.

02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:23.880
I think that's fun

02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:26.120
and so I don't know if that's like an answer

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:26.960
but I guess,

02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:28.200
I don't think there's any real purpose

02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:29.040
so just try to have fun.

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.720
The cool thing is that we get to write the movie

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:34.440
as we watch it.

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.600
Yeah, that's exactly right.

02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:38.200
I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:39.120
and all that where he's like,

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:41.440
everything around you was invented by somebody

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:42.280
who just was like,

02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.520
this is a crazy idea they thought up.

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:48.520
So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want

02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:53.000
then that's what you start to go,

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.080
you start to go try crazier stuff.

02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.880
I mean, this is another one of those areas

02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:58.480
where not to get too out there

02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.000
but I think you can build your comfort zone

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.920
around people being upset with you.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:06.880
You can also build your range

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.960
of what you think is possible.

02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.440
When I was in my 20s,

02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:12.120
I was reading all these books

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.640
about self-improvement and how to write down your goals

02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:17.920
and stuff and my goals were like,

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:21.880
someday I wanna make $100,000 a year or something like

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:26.880
and it seemed like a little outlandish

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.960
and I wrote down these goals

02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.640
like I wanna own rental property or something anyway.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:35.080
And then I slowly started to get some of these things done

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:35.920
over a couple of years

02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.400
and so I started to think a little bigger.

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:39.880
I remember one time I wrote down this goal

02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.000
where I was like,

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.880
what's the craziest thing I could think of?

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.080
I was like, what if I wanna start

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:47.280
a billion dollar tech company?

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.200
That's crazy.

02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.920
And I had never started like a million dollar tech company

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:52.160
or any tech company really.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.920
So what business did I have writing that goal down?

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:57.440
I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper

02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:01.600
like probably every day for a year or something almost.

02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:02.480
I don't know if it was every day,

02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:03.680
but I wrote it down a lot.

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:06.640
And so little things started to happen.

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:07.520
I was like, all right,

02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:09.240
well, maybe I should move back to the Bay Area

02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:10.080
from Buenos Aires.

02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:13.240
Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever.

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.240
And I started thinking about these ideas

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:16.920
and so whatever gets you fired up,

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.720
it doesn't have to be like some company goal

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:19.560
or startup thing.

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.600
It could be anything, right?

02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.560
Maybe you wanna publish a book

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.080
or like do something creatively or whatever.

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:30.080
Anyway, I think like within seven years,

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:33.240
no, it's probably more like 10 years

02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:34.760
of me writing that goal down.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.760
Coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars.

02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.840
So it was out of my realm of what was even possible.

02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:44.600
And then within 10 years,

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:46.640
you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think,

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.440
less than a year than you think.

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.640
So now I'm like, okay, what's the next goal?

02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.600
Okay, maybe I wanna get a billion people

02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:57.560
accessing the open financial system

02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:00.000
through our products every day.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.640
That would be cool for humanity.

02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:03.440
And that's a pretty crazy goal.

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.040
Like there's only 8 billion people or something, right?

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:06.040
So one out of eight.

02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:09.680
Or maybe I can radically,

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:12.760
like if I make some like the right investments or whatever,

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:16.560
I can like help radically extend human health span

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:17.560
or whatever, right?

02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:21.200
So try crazier stuff.

02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.480
I don't know, even if it doesn't work,

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:27.480
like hopefully you'll advance the state of affairs

02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:29.080
like something interesting will happen.

02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:31.120
And so most people today,

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:33.000
they look at people trying this stuff

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.720
and they're like, oh my God, they're so,

02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:35.760
they're a genius or whatever.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:37.000
And it's like, or they're an idiot.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.560
Like one of the two, neither one are true.

02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.000
It's just like anybody can start

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.160
by thinking about what they want and then like go for it.

02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.360
And then once you get that,

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:47.440
like go for something a little bigger

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:48.880
and like you just have fun with it.

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:51.760
And the universe is a way of smiling

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.240
and helping you out if you just write it down

02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:57.480
and you dream big.

02:27:57.480 --> 02:27:59.840
There's something about just karma,

02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.280
about the energy you put into this world.

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:05.280
Other people will help you out, doors will open.

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.480
You'll notice that the door is open

02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:10.640
and you actually have a shot at making it happen.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:12.280
It's a funny world.

02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.400
Yeah, I mean, I don't really subscribe

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.080
to all like the woo-woo interpretations of this,

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.400
but my very rational brain interpretation of it

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.200
is that if you just wake up every day

02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:22.160
and write down like what you want to get done

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:24.400
and towards your longer goals, your larger goals,

02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.600
it's just on your mind that day.

02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:28.040
So you start to notice opportunities

02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.400
and you think about it more.

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.080
So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.440
Thank you for doing what you're doing,

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:35.640
doing incredible engineering at scale,

02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:39.600
trying to help people from all over the world

02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.400
and actually helping me personally get more into crypto

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:46.400
just because it's so easy.

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.080
So thank you so much.

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:49.560
And thank you so much

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.880

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:53.280

from Benjamin Franklin.

02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:12.120
