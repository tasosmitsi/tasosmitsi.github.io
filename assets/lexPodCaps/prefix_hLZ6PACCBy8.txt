WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
How would a kangaroo attack a human?

00:01.640 --> 00:03.600
Knock them down and then they choke them.

00:04.080 --> 00:04.960
The kangaroos do?

00:05.040 --> 00:05.920
They choke each other, yeah.

00:06.280 --> 00:07.280
They don't choke each other.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.080
You don't believe me?

00:08.760 --> 00:09.360
You want to watch a video?

00:09.360 --> 00:10.240
They choke each other out.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.120
I've seen this, yeah.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.040
I mean, probably the most annoying one was obviously the one where I had

00:16.040 --> 00:19.680
Gordon Anambar was like, tap, bro, and he wouldn't tap, so I let him out.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.960
I didn't get surgery.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.720
I didn't do essentially any rehab.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.480
I just have noise to yell at my left leg.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.600
So what's it like having noise?

00:28.760 --> 00:30.720
The surgeon goes, you've got two options.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.920
Surgery, rehab only.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.520
Nikki goes, I'll do nothing.

00:34.360 --> 00:34.520
Yeah.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.360
I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you're the world's best grappler hates

00:37.360 --> 00:40.200
you and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day?

00:40.200 --> 00:40.680
Well, I mean.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.560
In Texas.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.680
And you've stolen his brother, held him for ransom.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.240
It is like a story of a shitty Western.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.760
The last part of a difficult wake up for me is I try to find a sad movie and at

00:50.760 --> 00:53.120
least cry about a pound out.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.880
That really gets me over the line.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.200
What are the rules in the streets?

00:56.240 --> 00:58.920
Do you think if you're on steroids, you would have finished the joke?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.120
I mean, for sure.

01:01.160 --> 01:07.400
Who knew that the cure to the Dagestani wrestling were the Aussies?

01:10.160 --> 01:14.640
The following is a conversation with Craig Jones, Nikki Rod, and Nikki Ryan,

01:15.040 --> 01:20.000
who together with Ethan Krelsten and others make up the B team, a legendary

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Jiu-Jitsu team here in Austin, Texas.

01:22.360 --> 01:26.760
It was formed after the so-called Donaher death squad, the team headed by

01:26.760 --> 01:32.880
John Donaher split up into new wave Jiu-Jitsu and B team Jiu-Jitsu, both

01:32.960 --> 01:35.000
located here in Austin, Texas.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.520
There has been a lot of trash talk back and forth, including accusations

01:39.520 --> 01:41.560
of greasing and steroid use.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.640
And I, as a practitioner and fan of grappling, Jiu-Jitsu and martial arts

01:46.680 --> 01:49.280
in general, I'm here for it.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.920
To see the best grapplers in history, go at it, both on the mat and on Instagram.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.880
I like the people on both teams and train with both.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.080
And I'm really happy to see the exciting, rapid evolution of the sport that these

02:05.080 --> 02:08.040
athletes and coaches are catalyzing.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.640
This is the Lux Freedom Podcast.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.800
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:14.120 --> 02:20.080
And now, dear friends, here's Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.400
Craig, can you introduce everyone?

02:23.320 --> 02:23.600
Yep.

02:23.640 --> 02:29.720
So we got Nicky Rod here, brown belt, two-time ADCC silver medalist.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.440
Nicky Ryan here.

02:33.400 --> 02:33.720
That's it.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.400
Who are you?

02:37.520 --> 02:40.880
And I'm Craig Jones, also two-time ADCC silver medalist.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.880
Silver medalist.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.040
So the number one loser.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.120
Number one loser.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.720
And maybe a little bit more, your bio says, widely known as the black belt

02:49.720 --> 02:52.800
slayer hails from New Jersey, the land of pizza and biceps.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.760
Yes, that's pretty accurate.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.520
You also do carry a gun on you a lot?

02:57.840 --> 02:59.640
Yeah, I keep it, keep it loaded.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.520
You know, keep it on me.

03:00.920 --> 03:01.680
You have one today?

03:02.600 --> 03:03.120
In the car.

03:04.040 --> 03:04.760
That was a mistake.

03:04.760 --> 03:05.720
It was your first mistake.

03:05.760 --> 03:06.840
Yeah, I think you're too close.

03:06.840 --> 03:13.480
And you are Nicky Ryan.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.280
What else is there?

03:14.720 --> 03:15.440
What else do you know?

03:15.800 --> 03:16.640
Gordon Ryan's brother.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.520
Gordon Ryan's brother.

03:20.440 --> 03:20.880
All right.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.960
So, and you're all together a part of the leadership of the B team here in Austin.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.600
Let's just get out some introductory questions.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.920
What in general accomplishment of the things you mentioned you're most proud of?

03:33.480 --> 03:38.720
I mean, I'm proud just to not have to work a full-time job just to get by on the

03:38.720 --> 03:40.120
bullshit I've done so far.

03:40.480 --> 03:40.760
Yeah.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.840
Honestly, just making money of a thing you love.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.480
Exactly.

03:43.480 --> 03:43.680
Yeah.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.120
When was the first time you made money on a thing you love?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.200
Probably a jujitsu tournament.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.240
I think maybe in Abu Dhabi where I won a thousand dollars thought I was rich.

03:52.520 --> 03:52.800
Yeah.

03:53.200 --> 03:53.480
Yeah.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.040
What'd you spend a thousand dollars on?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.720
Probably something bad, probably drugs or something at the time.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.480
Maybe blew it at the after party.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.680
That's a good introduction, Craig.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.560
So what about you?

04:03.560 --> 04:07.800
When's the first time you made money on jujitsu or what's actually stepping back?

04:07.800 --> 04:09.240
Like what's the thing you're most proud of?

04:09.240 --> 04:10.360
Is it a similar kind of thing?

04:10.680 --> 04:15.800
I think I think I'm most proud of is, I mean, for sure to 80 CC silver metals,

04:15.800 --> 04:20.280
which hurts because you're so close to getting that gold, but you know, it takes

04:20.280 --> 04:24.080
time I'm understanding that, you know, sport of jujitsu takes quite a while to

04:24.080 --> 04:26.360
be at the tip top, to be the absolute best.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.960
Tip top to be the absolute best.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.360
So, uh, and I'm just being consistent in my training and my craft and I'll

04:32.360 --> 04:33.800
get that number one spot one day.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.600
What failure or loss is the most painful to you?

04:38.720 --> 04:39.040
I don't know.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.520
I can probably have a pretty short term memory.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.560
So my losses, I just like, I'll just forget about, uh, yeah, I mean, for

04:44.560 --> 04:49.720
sure, uh, my loss at, at this past 80 CC in the finals, you know, that one's

04:49.720 --> 04:51.880
so good because I definitely thought I was going to win.

04:51.880 --> 04:56.240
I mean, like it takes a while to produce the skills or the reactions more so

04:56.240 --> 05:01.040
that you need to have to be, you know, to be that number one pound for pound guy.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.800
Um, and you know, uh, pre 80 CC, I was coming off an injury.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.720
So it took me a little bit to, uh, find the right mentality and physicality

05:08.720 --> 05:12.480
that I needed in order to, you know, get the wins that required gold.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.200
So yeah, it's just process.

05:15.120 --> 05:15.600
Interesting.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.560
You keep saying process.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.960
Like it takes a while to build up.

05:17.960 --> 05:23.000
So you're not like thinking of a loss like 80 CC is like, uh, a specific

05:23.040 --> 05:23.560
failures.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.480
You're not, you haven't gone long enough in a particular process to being a champ.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.520
Well, I mean, for me, I'm coming, I'm closing in on five years of specifically

05:32.520 --> 05:33.200
jiu-jitsu training.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.920
I'm about, about four and a half right now.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.840
And, um, yeah, it's just, uh, you kind of, you constantly have these ups and

05:39.840 --> 05:43.400
downs in training where like, as long as you stay consistent, you'll have a

05:43.400 --> 05:47.600
gradual raise, but you know, it's still, you'll have these, uh, peaks and lows

05:47.600 --> 05:50.000
and, you know, just, just trying to get better every day.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.160
I'm definitely not where I will be in, in a few years, in a few years from now,

05:54.160 --> 05:55.240
but I'm striving to get there.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.920
Are you actually a brown belt?

05:57.000 --> 05:57.920
Was that a joke?

05:58.360 --> 05:58.840
Brown belt.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.080
Yeah.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.240
You're a brown belt.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.040
Like how many stripes?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.760
Um, no stripes, no stripes, stripless.

06:05.120 --> 06:05.480
Okay.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.880
Is that part of the process that you're working through?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.280
Definitely part of the process.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.320
I mean, I think a black belt is just based upon how much knowledge you have.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.000
Obviously, like, you know, if you're talking competitive wise, like from

06:17.000 --> 06:19.320
when I started, I was able to beat most black belts.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.640
That's just kind of how I was gifted from my, my wrestling experience.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.720
And, uh, you know, the time will come when it's right, but, uh, I'm not

06:27.720 --> 06:28.400
in a rush at all.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.400
I'm continuing the, I just kind of take every day for what it is and,

06:31.600 --> 06:32.640
and try to improve upon that.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.120
I mean, I want to give him the black belt.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.280
Nikki Ryan says he's not ready.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.360
What is, are you guys like, as no gee folks, do you take that seriously?

06:40.680 --> 06:43.360
Like the black belt or like, how much does it come into play into?

06:43.880 --> 06:44.200
Yeah.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.040
I mean, it's like Nikki Rod said, you know, it's based off of knowledge.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.960
Um, not just, you know, what you do out on the competition mats.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.960
Cause you know, like he said, he had years of wrestling experience and

06:53.000 --> 06:54.720
obviously he's very physically gifted.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.960
Uh, so we grade based off of the amount of knowledge that you have.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.160
Like, how do you measure knowledge?

07:01.480 --> 07:03.520
I think teaching is a good measurement of it.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.360
Like how well you're able to show the moves, um, and, you know, really make

07:07.360 --> 07:09.400
sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing.

07:09.800 --> 07:09.920
Yeah.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.760
It's an interesting rank.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.120
It's like, um, it's something that takes many years to accomplish.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.680
And for a lot of people, it's truly meaningful.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.840
It's like, it represents a particular step in a journey.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.920
But for you guys, it's almost like different because you've been so focused

07:22.920 --> 07:28.040
on competition that I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.680
Like as martial artists that that's bigger than just being like top

07:32.680 --> 07:34.000
of the world competitors, right?

07:34.680 --> 07:35.600
So I thought it was a joke.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.200
You guys are actually taking it seriously.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.560
Like he's a brown belt and he's, and you're taking seriously the

07:41.560 --> 07:44.920
rank of black belt and like, it's part of, it's part of your journey.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.360
I think by the time I get a black belt, I'll be no more pound for pound.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.240
I think it'd be pretty, uh, nice to accomplish that as a brown belt and

07:52.240 --> 07:53.480
then maybe toss a black belt on top.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.560
Maybe get promoted on the podium.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.600
What do you guys, uh, do you love winning or hate losing more?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.000
I definitely don't hate losing.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.000
If it pays the bills, I don't mind.

08:06.120 --> 08:06.520
Oh, really?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.920
Um, yeah, but honestly, if I win, I feel more relief than anything

08:09.920 --> 08:11.600
rather than like excitement and stuff.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.200
I'm like, Oh fuck, thank God that's over.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.840
I hate, I hate losing for sure.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.760
Um, but I understand that it's necessary to get, you know, to

08:19.760 --> 08:20.920
get to where you want to be.

08:21.360 --> 08:26.080
Um, and then winning is like, I mean, what I think winning is probably

08:26.080 --> 08:29.120
the closest you can think you can get to like heroin or something.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.040
Cause I mean, we're on a, like if you do have extreme success in a

08:33.040 --> 08:36.480
torment that you've been, you know, adamant about training for and competing

08:36.480 --> 08:39.560
in for a while and you end up winning it on me, I feel like you're on that

08:39.560 --> 08:41.560
high for days at a time afterwards.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.520
Heroin is going to be better.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.120
You think so?

08:43.320 --> 08:46.600
I'm a, I'm a stick with no, but I'm not going to suck dick to win.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.480
I guess that's a good boy.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.200
Well, you know, like, uh, because you, you, you're coming from a little

08:56.200 --> 08:57.560
bit of the wrestling culture.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.080
One of the things I really love is at the end of the match, when they

09:00.080 --> 09:02.480
lose, they just, there's no, they just run off.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.680
They're like almost pissed off.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.280
It's like some mixture of anger and frustration at themselves.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.480
I think, I think sometimes the people like freak out on the mat.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.200
And I think that's just to show everybody, like they're acting

09:15.200 --> 09:16.320
like they care it a lot.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.880
And really maybe they didn't work enough to, to, you know, get to where

09:20.880 --> 09:22.960
they want to, where they expect it to be.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.720
And they lost and then they had this big boost of emotion, like

09:25.720 --> 09:27.440
after their, after their loss.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.080
But, uh, yeah, I mean, I shouldn't, I think you just cry in the

09:31.080 --> 09:32.160
mirror and not to everybody else.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.440
Um, what, have you ever cried watching a movie?

09:36.680 --> 09:37.840
I don't think I've ever cried period.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.280
Okay.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.040
Have you cried watching a movie?

09:40.720 --> 09:41.280
Not yet.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.280
Not yet.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
The notebook.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.640
I try to avoid those.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.360
I lie actually Titanic.

09:47.400 --> 09:51.440
The last part of a difficult wake up for me is I try to find a sad

09:51.440 --> 09:54.280
movie and at least cry about a pound out.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.000
That really gets me over the line.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.320
Low energy cutting the tears.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.800
Um, there's other following, uh, liquids I could talk to you about, but

10:03.960 --> 10:07.000
let's just, let's just, let's just continue on low energy.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.200
What, uh, um, what about you, Nikki?

10:11.240 --> 10:13.280
Uh, love of winning versus hate of losing.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.920
I'm a very competitive person.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.120
So I for sure hate losing more than I like winning.

10:18.520 --> 10:23.000
Uh, I, I do think it's something that's kind of held me back over the, uh, the

10:23.000 --> 10:28.080
past few years, cause, uh, it makes it so that I'm not as active as I should be.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.480
Cause it's like, I really hate that feeling of, you know, after a match that

10:32.480 --> 10:35.760
you just lost, uh, so it kind of prevents me from competing.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.840
So it's definitely something I need to work past.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.040
So like, when you think about a competition, the possibility of losing,

10:41.040 --> 10:44.520
which is always there in competition, is the thing that like weighs heavy on

10:44.520 --> 10:46.760
you in, in the months and weeks leading up to it.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.480
Yeah, my whole life, you know, my financial stability, everything depends

10:50.480 --> 10:54.200
on, you know, my ability to go out there and compete and my ability to teach.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.320
Uh, so, you know, it's, it's a huge hit to the brand if you lose.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.880
So, you know, leading up to matches, that's, that's definitely

10:59.880 --> 11:00.840
something that's in my mind.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.120
I know you say you guys are like world-class athletes, but for me, more

11:04.120 --> 11:06.920
like a hobbyist competitor, I compete a lot.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.680
The thing I was, uh, cause I really wanted to win the thing I was probably

11:11.680 --> 11:16.760
most afraid I was not just losing, but like embarrassing myself, even, even

11:16.760 --> 11:22.040
actually winning by stalling, that was the thing I hated the most about myself

11:22.640 --> 11:28.880
in terms of crying in the mirror is like being too afraid to take risks after

11:28.880 --> 11:30.480
I'm up on two points or something.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.000
I think you got a competition.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.760
Sometimes it's good to take the emotion out of it.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.480
It's too easy sometimes to like, uh, think about all my girls and in the

11:38.480 --> 11:41.160
crowd and my family's watching, like, I want to win cause they're there.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.520
Uh, but the highest level, if you're emotional at all, no, that's affecting you.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.960
Yeah, that's tough though.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.040
That's tough, especially like leading up to when you're on the

11:53.040 --> 11:54.720
mat, maybe, but leading up to it.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.160
I think it's okay to be emotional prior.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.720
Like, you know, if we know ADCC or it's coming up and we have a big match, like

12:00.960 --> 12:04.800
definitely I'll go out and, and practice and I'll, I'll visualize, I'll put

12:04.800 --> 12:06.560
myself in that competition that way.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.960
When it's game time, it's like, I've been there a thousand times already.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.000
So not the actual competition, but even leading up to it, like stepping on the

12:12.000 --> 12:15.520
mat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that, all that stuff.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.480
Like I'll do the same exact warmup for weeks on end and, uh, until my

12:19.480 --> 12:22.520
competition day comes, that's way that way, you know, when I compete, I'm just

12:22.520 --> 12:24.400
like, oh, it's, it's another Tuesday at practice.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.560
Uh, what about you, Craig?

12:26.560 --> 12:29.360
Like, how do you prepare mentally for a tournament like ADCC?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.720
I push it completely out of my mind.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.640
Don't even think about it.

12:33.240 --> 12:38.560
Try to avoid any visualization, any rituals, warmups, anything like that.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.760
Block it out until the last second.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.040
Yeah.

12:41.080 --> 12:41.920
Try not to think about it.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.520
I just go to training to have fun, learn a bit.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.000
So I try to approach competition the exact same way.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.720
I don't warm up training, do very little warmup for competition.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.000
Uh-huh.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.680
And, uh, you just, you just step on the mat, step on the mats.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.880
My philosophy is there's no warmups on the street.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.520
We're so vastly different.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.360
All right.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.360
Uh, so you like legit don't warm up.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.240
No, I probably should now I'm 31, but I would just like in the gym, take it easy.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.200
The first round, you know, like if I look around the room and Nikki Ryan's down, I

13:13.200 --> 13:15.320
might go, all right, we'll have an easier first round today.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.480
So even for like the most high stakes matches, you try to push it out.

13:23.640 --> 13:23.720
Yeah.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.440
I didn't think about it.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
What about like all the social, like Instagram posts you have to do about

13:28.400 --> 13:30.920
that match, you just make a joke out of it and kind of,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.760
yeah, I mean, it's all kind of pretty silly, you know, we're just

13:34.920 --> 13:37.960
wrestling each other, you know, we put the meaning into it, but to someone

13:37.960 --> 13:39.960
that doesn't follow the sport, it looks stupid.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.080
Well, all of human existence is pretty silly.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.360
Like, what are we doing?

13:43.720 --> 13:45.120
None of us really know what's going on.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.320
We'll kind of have sex to reproduce.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.360
We'll get hungry, we eat, and then we're all chasing money and cars and whatever

13:51.600 --> 13:56.560
the hell in a capitalist society, or we worship a dictator in a authoritarian

13:56.560 --> 13:57.960
regime. Yeah.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.760
And then we'll get off on, we'll let power abuse us and then we just murder

14:02.760 --> 14:04.720
others because we get off on it.

14:05.400 --> 14:05.680
Yeah.

14:06.400 --> 14:10.400
And then eventually all of us will die because the sun will run out of energy

14:11.280 --> 14:13.320
because colonizing other planets is very difficult.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.680
So none of it matters.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.520
It's a good, good philosophy.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.760
It's pretty, pretty good.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.600
That's exactly what I was saying.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.920
How does the sun run out of energy?

14:22.280 --> 14:23.400
Well, you caught me there.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.320
It's burnout.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.320
It's like a, it's a nuclear fusion engine that eventually burns out.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.120
Like when you get tired of training.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.080
Yeah, it's never happened.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.760
I try to get tired.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.240
I was like, dude, it's not working.

14:37.240 --> 14:37.640
All right.

14:38.160 --> 14:38.440
Cool.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.640
So you legit don't care about losing.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.040
It doesn't weigh heavy on you.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.880
I try not to list, like if I win, I try to block out all the compliments, all

14:46.880 --> 14:47.920
the niceties and stuff.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.200
So I try to do the same with losing.

14:49.240 --> 14:49.840
It's happened.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.000
Move on to the next one.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.680
You know, don't dwell on it too much and sometimes make a joke out of it.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.320
Yeah, exactly.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.880
We're not losing with the right joke.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.240
We can make money off of the event that's just transpired.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.960
That's what's most important.

15:02.400 --> 15:02.840
Excellent.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.280
Thank you.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.560
I have a bunch of your merch.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.440
Oh, nice.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.680
This one's the Jordan Burrows ripoff.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.840
Uh, all I see is silver.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.840
The way pronounced Burrows is very, is very, very sexy.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.160
Okay.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.760
Um, I throw lines at people and I try to gauge their reaction.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.360
Like sometimes I'll say something to Nikki and I'll be like, all right,

15:23.360 --> 15:24.360
that's probably crossing the line.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.360
You know, I mean, we'll tone it down for the public.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.280
So, yeah, so it's not just right.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.920
You have to think, is this crossing the line?

15:29.960 --> 15:30.280
Yep.

15:30.280 --> 15:30.480
Yep.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.480
I get as close to it as possible.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.040
Yeah.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.160
I feel like he can't really cross it.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.080
Just, just a little bit.

15:38.160 --> 15:38.800
Just a little bit.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.040
Yep.

15:39.080 --> 15:39.440
Okay.

15:40.760 --> 15:46.400
Speaking of which, uh, you said that I'm Switzerland in world war II since I'm

15:46.400 --> 15:50.600
friends with both you and Gordon and John, uh, rich country.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.240
Are you a Hitler or Stalin, by the way, in this analogy, would you

15:54.240 --> 15:55.640
like to be Hitler or Stalin?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.760
And should you make a t-shirt out of it or?

15:57.960 --> 16:00.840
I mean, a Nazi t-shirt, I don't know how well that sells.

16:01.040 --> 16:05.120
Yeah, I think it would, you know, I think that let's brainstorm out on this one

16:05.120 --> 16:10.440
offline and I think since Hitler lost, so you got second place in world war II.

16:10.520 --> 16:10.920
That's true.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.360
That's true.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
That makes you Hitler.

16:12.880 --> 16:19.200
Anyway, uh, in, to the degree that you can, can you tell the story of how the

16:19.200 --> 16:22.640
time you've had with, uh, the down on her death squad and, and why you split up.

16:23.400 --> 16:29.920
I competed against Gordon for ADCC and the EBI in 2017.

16:30.440 --> 16:35.160
And I remember I competed against him at ADCC and then we had the EBI event.

16:35.200 --> 16:39.840
And then I had a Kasai, I was, I compete, I used to compete all the time, every

16:39.840 --> 16:42.480
week, I wouldn't even do the prior preparation or anything.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.760
I'd just be like trying to do seminars, make money, and then jump in and compete.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.400
I remember I showed up to Kasai after I faced him twice and there were like four

16:49.400 --> 16:54.840
locker rooms and they put me with all the DDS guys, it was just me and all of DDS.

16:54.840 --> 16:58.760
And I think we had competed the week, weekend before, so I thought it was

16:58.760 --> 17:01.480
going to be super awkward, but it was actually, it was actually pretty chill.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.960
And the Kasai was in New York and they suggested to come train that week.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.560
So I came trained, hung out with them a bit.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.840
Uh, ultimately the goal was to move to America and join a bigger team, just

17:13.840 --> 17:16.960
because that flight to Australia is death.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.400
Australia is so far away from everywhere.

17:19.400 --> 17:23.080
It's kind of like not realistic to base yourself in Australia when all

17:23.080 --> 17:24.760
the tournaments are in America.

17:25.320 --> 17:29.480
And then I went and trained with the guys and they just had a massive, uh,

17:29.920 --> 17:32.000
massively deep talent pool in that room.

17:32.400 --> 17:37.360
Like show up to like a, it's meant to be 7am, actual 8am class, uh, on Brazilian

17:37.360 --> 17:41.000
time and there'd be like a hundred people in there, maybe, I don't know how

17:41.000 --> 17:42.840
many black belts, but a ton of elite guys.

17:42.840 --> 17:47.160
And I was coming from Australia, um, training with Lachlan Giles, but really

17:47.160 --> 17:51.200
that room was pretty shallow and like most people had serious jobs and stuff.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.280
So it was like basically me just training with Lachlan, maybe a couple of other

17:54.280 --> 17:59.920
guys, and then to go to New York and have access to a, a wide array of training

17:59.920 --> 18:03.720
partners and guys that are training twice each day, I feel like that's what

18:03.720 --> 18:04.400
you really need.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.320
You need people that can train as much as you are, work together, humbled in

18:09.320 --> 18:10.600
that room at first for sure.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.920
Cause my style at the time was basically a ripoff version of what they were

18:14.920 --> 18:16.600
doing, leg locks came in.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.440
I remember just watching Eddie Cummings nonstop and just seeing this guy rip

18:21.440 --> 18:22.160
people's legs off.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
And I was like, you know what?

18:23.160 --> 18:25.040
That's probably a good move.

18:25.080 --> 18:29.040
You know, that looks like an easier path to victory than trying to beat these

18:29.040 --> 18:33.240
guys at what they, what they're good at already, you know, my philosophy at the

18:33.240 --> 18:37.880
time was if it's bothering old Brazilians, it's bothering them for a reason.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.280
It's probably effective.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.480
And that's the path I took to sort of try to rip off their moves.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.840
And then obviously to go into that room, try to do them to them.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.520
It's going to be a bit more difficult.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.240
All right.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.280
So that's how it started.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.120
How did you end up here?

18:55.520 --> 18:56.560
How do we end up here?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.000
We're in Austin, Texas.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.840
I mean, I like to think of Puerto Rico as apocalypse now, John

19:04.320 --> 19:09.920
as Colonel Kurtz, things got very weird in the jungle and the teams went in two

19:10.160 --> 19:15.040
different directions, but honestly, I mean, it's not really my story to tell.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.240
I had some issues with some of those people at the time of the split.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.800
I got along very well with John.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.120
I feel like me and him connected very well.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.960
I don't know why that was.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.200
Maybe it was just because of the, he missed home.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.520
He missed a familiar accent, Australian, New Zealand accent.

19:28.960 --> 19:35.800
Uh, but I mean, I basically followed Nikki left with Nikki, sort of that core

19:35.800 --> 19:37.400
group of guys left with Nikki.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.000
And I mean, I just back, there was personal problems.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.400
I just backed Nikki basically.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.200
Got it.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.320
Just sticking on you for a bit.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.000
Is there a part of you that, you know, finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.880
This part of you miss working with John and everybody.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.200
Now, can you steal me on the case for that?

19:54.600 --> 19:58.840
I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the

19:58.840 --> 20:00.440
freedom of being apart from it.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.720
It's obviously a very strict regime under John Danaher.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.800
You know, obviously there's parts of it.

20:05.800 --> 20:11.000
I miss the parts the public doesn't see of John, the behind the scenes banter.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.400
I feel like he's very conscious of the image he portrays to the world, but

20:15.400 --> 20:17.320
basically it closed doors.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.880
He's always making jokes, always finding, I guess, more in line with the

20:20.880 --> 20:23.440
Australian Kiwi sort of culture.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.160
But you don't really see that in the public eye.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.880
So that perspective, I do miss that relationship with John in terms of

20:31.000 --> 20:32.720
setting aside personal differences.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.360
Gordon was a good training partner.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.520
Definitely a good training partner to train with.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.840
But obviously the negative things we can't really talk about outweighed all of

20:42.840 --> 20:47.800
those things and we obviously had to make a decision to leave, but yeah.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.200
The things that happen in the jungle.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.800
The things that happen in the jungle.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.120
Should never be spoken of.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.800
That I personally cannot speak of.

20:54.800 --> 20:54.960
Yeah.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.400
But obviously I do miss certain aspects.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.240
Like, I mean, nothing's all bad.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.240
Nothing's all good, you know?

21:00.240 --> 21:00.440
Yeah.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.800
This goes back to your, like, uh, everything we're doing is silly.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.080
Yeah, exactly.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.000
That's why I don't get people take it so serious.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.040
Martial arts are serious.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.040
It's just, it's just pretty stupid, really, especially in the Kiwi.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.200
It looks just, it looks bad.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.640
And then I mean, it's pretty silly with, with, and without the

21:16.640 --> 21:18.640
Kiwi, it's just a bunch of apes.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.760
What's silly about no Gi and what's silly about the Gi and just

21:21.800 --> 21:23.040
makes the match bottom set.

21:23.080 --> 21:23.680
You know what I mean?

21:24.120 --> 21:24.720
Wait, which one?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.480
I see what you're doing, brother.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.280
You come to my house and defend my people.

21:34.520 --> 21:34.920
All right.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.240
This is, we're going to go to every dark place.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.520
Apparently, um, Nick, how did you get with a DDS?

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
Like, what was that journey?

21:44.560 --> 21:48.680
Like, is there, uh, try to see if there's things that you remember

21:48.680 --> 21:51.920
fondly that, that you've gotten from the experience?

21:52.240 --> 21:52.480
All right.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.080
So the way I started, um, training with DDS, um, initially I was training

21:58.080 --> 22:02.360
for like, well, initially I was, I was a bouncer, right?

22:02.400 --> 22:06.160
I w I dropped out of college to pursue this, uh, fitness modeling career.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.800
I ended up signing with a Wilhelmina models up in New York.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.560
And I was like, trust trying to get in better shape.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.800
And while I was bouncing kind of the talk of like, you know, who's tougher

22:13.800 --> 22:17.560
came up between the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers that train Jiu-Jitsu.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.600
And, uh, you know, they convinced me to go to a practice and, and I went

22:21.600 --> 22:23.000
to my first practice over there.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.200
And, uh, for the most part, I just controlled everybody got on top of them,

22:27.200 --> 22:30.160
was able to avoid like, kind of like, you know, shitty submissions.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.960
Cause I had, I had an awareness of the sport and, and, you know, I'm

22:33.960 --> 22:35.080
a fan of fighting and whatnot.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.880
So, um, you know, I kind of understood it pretty well.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.400
Um, and then soon after that, I joined a school and my second week of

22:42.400 --> 22:46.680
Jiu-Jitsu, I started competing, had pretty good success, you know, I was

22:46.680 --> 22:49.800
like subbing a few black belts and beating everybody, like, you know,

22:49.800 --> 22:51.520
pretty decisively with points and stuff.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.840
And, uh, about three months into training locally, I got connected with,

22:55.880 --> 22:58.920
uh, Gordon, Gordon Ryan and John Danner up in New York.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.640
And I started, I committed to, you know, make the drive up there as many days

23:02.640 --> 23:06.520
as I could at the, at the time I lived in South Jersey and it was about two

23:06.520 --> 23:10.000
and a half hour, three hour drive without traffic to New York, to where

23:10.040 --> 23:14.040
we're in South Jersey, Gloucester County, um, Clayton, New Jersey

23:14.040 --> 23:15.360
specifically, but Gloucester County.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.040
Yeah.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.680
So it was about, it was about about 130 miles and without traffic, you know,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.640
about two, two and a half hours or so.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.520
But on the way back, man, we, it'd be three plus sometimes, you know,

23:24.520 --> 23:25.600
you're catching that rush hour.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.200
What year was this?

23:26.200 --> 23:26.680
Do you remember?

23:26.720 --> 23:29.880
This was in 2018, but I forget how young you are.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.440
Yeah, I was there before, before all that.

23:33.440 --> 23:33.880
All right, cool.

23:34.120 --> 23:37.480
Uh, anyway, you're doing the long drive and then, and then, and then what?

23:37.520 --> 23:41.120
Yeah, doing the long drive and then, uh, you know, once I went ADCC trials,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.840
I was able to make a couple bucks and then, you know, I got my silver

23:43.880 --> 23:48.120
medal at ADCC and I was able to afford to live up there in New York and North

23:48.120 --> 23:48.760
Jersey area.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.240
So I lived up there, trained there full time every day.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.160
And, uh, you know, just kind of stuck with the team throughout, throughout

23:54.160 --> 23:56.720
the turbulent times and found ourselves in Austin.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.480
In the jungle, in the jungle, the things we shall not speak of.

24:02.880 --> 24:08.840
What, uh, what, uh, are there things that you remember that you've learned from

24:08.840 --> 24:10.640
John Donoher from your time spent with him?

24:10.680 --> 24:14.160
Yeah, I mean, I definitely learned a ton from, uh, from John and the team as a

24:14.160 --> 24:19.440
whole, like, uh, you know, it's, you have to be the guy that asks questions in,

24:19.480 --> 24:21.160
in that type of environment, right?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.320
Cause there's not, it's not, you're not going to get singled out to be that

24:24.320 --> 24:28.440
specific, uh, like star or the best guy in the room when you have all these

24:28.440 --> 24:29.640
other, you know, stud athletes.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.320
So I really had to seek out and figure out the kind of questions that I needed

24:33.320 --> 24:33.800
to ask.

24:34.160 --> 24:39.320
And, um, once I became a bit more verbal with my training and, you know, uh, I'm

24:39.320 --> 24:42.840
showing, I'm expressing all my curiosities about grappling to these guys.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.240
Definitely help boost my, uh, boost my technique and my career as a whole.

24:46.440 --> 24:46.600
Yeah.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.000
Did you understand what kind of stuff, like technically you want to get good at

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
what fits your body?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.960
What, like, what would be good for you?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.760
What, what are your weaknesses and all that?

24:54.920 --> 24:58.880
So initially, when I started grappling, I had an innate ability to just

24:58.880 --> 25:00.160
get to opponents back.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.760
So I was like, all right, I I'm good at getting to the back.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.440
Let me get, let me perfect controlling the back and then submitting opponent

25:06.480 --> 25:07.640
via reneged choke.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.360
Um, and then besides that, I really focused on leg lock defense.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.040
And then eventually came the Roddy lock pass where, you know, I'm, uh, I'm really

25:15.040 --> 25:16.840
good at body lock passing my opponents now.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.120
And then, and, um, yeah, it just takes a quite a long time because you have to

25:20.120 --> 25:24.840
find, uh, different sequences and then there's always these, uh, an abundance

25:24.840 --> 25:28.000
of opportunities that your opponent gets from these specific sequences.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
So it takes a while.

25:31.320 --> 25:35.400
Is there part of you that finds the fact that DGS split up heartbreaking?

25:36.360 --> 25:41.600
Um, I definitely, you know, having one person to go to that runs practice

25:41.600 --> 25:43.320
every day, that's, you know, consistent.

25:43.760 --> 25:48.120
Um, it was definitely, it was definitely, definitely a gift, but now I've also

25:48.120 --> 25:50.160
gifted with many, many other partners.

25:50.160 --> 25:59.720
I have Nikki Ryan, um, you know, Craig Jones, we have Ethan Crellison, Damian

25:59.720 --> 26:03.560
Anderson, so a full team of knowledgeable athletes that I can continue to go to

26:03.800 --> 26:06.800
with, uh, multiple questions, but yeah, definitely, definitely.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.640
Uh, it took me some time to adjust the, to training or to learning from, you

26:11.640 --> 26:17.680
know, uh, specifically my team and not just one person we should mention for

26:17.680 --> 26:21.360
people just listening, cause you can't visually see that Nikki Ryan is currently

26:21.360 --> 26:28.280
terrified and Craig Jones is currently enjoying the fact that anyway, uh, can

26:28.280 --> 26:31.600
you talk about your, uh, Nikki, can you talk about your time with DDS?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.680
I started training when I was like around 13, um, you know, my brother

26:35.680 --> 26:40.720
Gordon had started prior to me and, uh, I really just went into training just as

26:40.720 --> 26:44.480
like a means to exercise and lose weight at the beginning cause I was pretty fat

26:44.480 --> 26:48.760
as a kid, so I went to the first class, loved it, uh, and then just started

26:48.760 --> 26:53.320
training every day at, uh, at Gary's gym Brunswick and then during the summer,

26:53.320 --> 26:57.160
when I'd get off from school, they would take me up to New York to, uh, to train

26:57.160 --> 27:00.640
under John and, you know, I just absolutely loved it.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.960
I knew what I wanted to do with my life at a young age, so I ended up dropping

27:03.960 --> 27:08.680
out of school actually after my freshman year in high school, so yeah, 15, I ended

27:08.680 --> 27:12.640
up dropping out and just pursuing jujitsu full time, uh, you know, training

27:12.640 --> 27:14.280
every day up in the, uh, the blue basement.

27:14.440 --> 27:19.840
Like what aspects of jujitsu was, made you know that this is the thing for you?

27:20.240 --> 27:23.680
It was just something I just enjoyed being, you know, like on the mats every

27:23.680 --> 27:26.840
day, I love that there's, you know, a problem solving aspect to it.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.440
Um, so it's, you know, it's mentally challenging, it's physically

27:29.440 --> 27:31.360
challenging, uh, helps me get in shape.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.920
So I just, yeah, right off the bat, I knew I loved it.

27:34.840 --> 27:35.200
Okay.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.520
So, uh, then we'll go to the jungle.

27:37.680 --> 27:45.200
What happened in the jungle and in general, like, uh, I like this, I like

27:45.200 --> 27:50.280
this, this is like this, like shroud of mystery that she'll never be penetrated.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.880
That should never be like, we've got a book deal.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.280
It's coming.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.480
Obviously left high school.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.120
He's not writing it.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.320
Uh, okay.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.080
I'll do the Russian translation.

28:01.920 --> 28:02.240
Okay.

28:03.040 --> 28:07.360
So what are, what are things that you enjoyed that you remember

28:07.360 --> 28:08.360
from working with John Donahue?

28:08.800 --> 28:09.040
Yeah.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.000
I mean, you know, obviously he's considered one of the best coaches in the world.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.640
Um, you know, very charismatic guy when you see him in person, uh, you know, I

28:17.680 --> 28:21.160
pretty much was, you know, kind of raised in the DDS, you know, that's where I

28:21.160 --> 28:23.600
spent the majority of my time every day.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.840
Uh, so I obviously had very deep connections, you know, with John, my

28:26.840 --> 28:30.800
brother, uh, Gary, um, you know, even Eddie Cummings and stuff back then.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.640
Um, so obviously I miss interacting with those guys every day and, uh, you

28:34.640 --> 28:37.240
know, it's like they said, it's, it's good to have somebody to kind of

28:37.240 --> 28:38.640
crack the whip at you every day.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.680
Uh, and John, John was very good at that.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.080
When you're like younger in your teenage years, you can kind of, you

28:44.080 --> 28:45.400
like have to get humbled, right?

28:45.400 --> 28:46.600
There's like a process to that.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.640
Yeah, for sure.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.040
And, uh, it's a pretty good room to get humbled in, I guess.

28:50.040 --> 28:50.880
Yeah, exactly.

28:50.880 --> 28:54.720
I mean, I, I was, uh, I started training with them just when like

28:54.720 --> 28:56.040
everybody started to break out.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.320
Gary was like the biggest name at the time, uh, just cause he had won

28:59.320 --> 29:03.640
ADCC trials already, and, uh, he had a crazy match with Cron at, uh, Cron

29:03.640 --> 29:07.560
Gracie at, uh, ADCC, but Eddie was just starting to break out.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.400
Gordon just started winning EBI.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.600
So I started training under John, you know, right when, when

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
everything was exploding.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.840
What are the good things about life, about Jiu-Jitsu you learned from your brother?

29:18.840 --> 29:22.560
Both me and my brother never really wanted to, you know, work a full-time

29:22.560 --> 29:24.160
job doing something that we hate.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.360
Um, and he was always, you know, a very confident person.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.360
So he just went, you know, full, fully started pursuing Jiu-Jitsu.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.000
Um, so I'm very happy that, you know, he did that and I ended up following

29:35.000 --> 29:38.480
in his footsteps because you can ask these guys, I'm a lazy sack of shit

29:38.520 --> 29:41.200
out of, outside of the, the, uh, the mat.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.640
Uh, so that's, that's definitely one thing that, uh, I'm very grateful for.

29:45.640 --> 29:49.080
That he paved the way, like you can, you can make money doing stuff you love.

29:49.280 --> 29:49.960
Yeah, exactly.

29:49.960 --> 29:53.440
And he was, he was a big reason, you know, why my parents, uh, eventually

29:53.440 --> 29:56.560
let me drop out of school because, you know, when, when they were coming up,

29:56.560 --> 29:58.520
there was, there's no money in the sport.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.080
It was very hard to make a full living.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.960
Like if you wanted to actually make a living, you'd eventually

30:02.960 --> 30:04.080
have to transfer to MMA.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.440
And I feel like Gordon and Gary and those guys were, you know, some of the first

30:08.440 --> 30:11.320
people to make a very good living off of just Jiu-Jitsu.

30:11.960 --> 30:15.040
At this party, you find, you know, you're, you're, you're

30:15.040 --> 30:21.680
find it heartbreaking that you've split up from GDS, but also from your brother

30:21.680 --> 30:23.800
in terms of spending time in the mat every day.

30:24.160 --> 30:24.960
Yeah, for sure.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.840
You know, I mean, growing up, you know, obviously he's, he's my big brother.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.120
I looked up to him a lot.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.200
Uh, so I definitely, like I said, I miss interacting with those guys.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.520
I was pretty much raised, you know, in that blue basement, you know, that

30:35.960 --> 30:37.880
John was like, you know, a father figure to me.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.880
Um, so I definitely, you know, miss, miss seeing those guys every day.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.440
Do you have animosity towards Gordon?

30:44.440 --> 30:46.240
And does he have animosity toward you?

30:46.680 --> 30:49.040
And, uh, what is the source of that?

30:49.720 --> 30:52.280
And do you think you'll ever be able to forgive each other?

30:53.120 --> 30:58.480
Definitely initially during the, uh, the initial split, we definitely

30:58.480 --> 30:59.840
hated each other at the beginning.

31:00.280 --> 31:05.040
Um, but it's definitely started to, uh, to calm down actually just prior to, you

31:05.040 --> 31:11.280
know, all this social media drama that's going on currently he had reached out to

31:11.280 --> 31:15.720
me and that was literally like the first time that we have actually talked since,

31:15.800 --> 31:17.800
uh, since the split happened.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.960
So we didn't talk to each other for, was it now like almost two years?

31:21.720 --> 31:25.360
Um, and that was the first time that, you know, we, we interacted again.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.240
And, um, overall, you know, he wasn't, you know, aggressive towards me.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.920
I wasn't aggressive towards him.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.080
You were cracking some jokes.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.360
So hopefully the, the animosity is going down.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.040
Well, there's this, uh, Godfather quote that I wrote down.

31:40.840 --> 31:45.800
I recently rewatched it, uh, from, uh, from the Don from Don Corleone, uh, Vito

31:45.800 --> 31:49.840
Corleone, the strength of a family, like the strength of an army lies in its

31:49.840 --> 31:51.040
loyalty to each other.

31:51.120 --> 31:56.320
Is there some aspect of family that you miss of the blood that kind of connects

31:56.320 --> 31:57.800
you that you can count on?

31:58.200 --> 31:58.520
Yeah.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.120
My parents, you know, they, they both raised us that, you know, like

32:01.200 --> 32:02.160
family is everything.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.080
You never, you know, betray your family or anything like that.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.520
Uh, so I definitely, you know, missing from time to time.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.320
Okay.

32:09.320 --> 32:14.880
Imagine you're like 40 years from now sitting on a porch with a shotgun, drinking

32:14.880 --> 32:21.040
whiskey, looking over like all the land you've conquered, uh, looking back to

32:21.040 --> 32:25.360
this moment, is the reason you split up a bullshit reason, or is it a good reason

32:25.360 --> 32:29.480
from the perspective of the King who has now conquered the lands, have proven

32:29.480 --> 32:30.920
themselves, have done everything.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.840
I think it was definitely like a justifiable reason for the team splitting.

32:36.080 --> 32:39.440
Like it just, with the way things were going, it just was not going to work

32:39.440 --> 32:41.840
with, you know, all of us in the same room together.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.200
I was, it started, you know, affecting training.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.640
People didn't feel comfortable in things.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.920
So I definitely think that it was a justifiable reason to split.

32:49.840 --> 32:54.120
The things that happened in the jungle to be told about in the book.

32:54.840 --> 32:58.760
Is it going to be an audio book or is it just going to be, and who's going to voice

32:58.760 --> 33:03.520
it might be a play a musical on Broadway.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.520
Um, how's your singing voice?

33:06.640 --> 33:08.440
Mine's not so good, but Nikki has a beautiful voice.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.080
Does he have an angel like I had bet.

33:12.280 --> 33:12.760
Okay.

33:13.840 --> 33:18.320
Speaking of the, the social media drama, I should mention that I've talked to

33:18.400 --> 33:22.840
recently to Gordon a bunch, uh, I've talked to him about talking to you guys

33:23.320 --> 33:27.440
and he's had nothing but really nice things to say about you, Nick, right?

33:27.960 --> 33:30.160
And he has had nothing but bad things.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.280
What was some of the things?

33:32.840 --> 33:43.040
Uh, well, let's just go to the social media first because the social media

33:43.040 --> 33:46.440
stuff that he said publicly is just like a warmup.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.520
It's like a foreplay, I guess.

33:49.000 --> 33:56.160
So Gordon sent you Nicky ride flowers for Valentine's day, uh, posting on Instagram

33:56.160 --> 34:00.720
quote, I've been fucking him in every round and competition since we met in

34:00.920 --> 34:04.480
2018, the least that can do is buy him flowers.

34:05.560 --> 34:06.680
We didn't get the flowers.

34:06.760 --> 34:06.960
No.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.200
Yeah, that was the question.

34:10.680 --> 34:11.520
You never got the flowers.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.680
He sent it to the wrong address.

34:13.080 --> 34:13.560
He did.

34:13.680 --> 34:13.960
Yeah.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.320
Where, where do you think he sent it?

34:15.760 --> 34:17.320
It was close, but it was wrong.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.600
Did you appreciate the romantic gesture?

34:19.680 --> 34:20.120
I did.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.440
I was looking forward to the flowers and potentially chocolates in there.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.440
But, uh, you know, it was a bit of a let down.

34:25.960 --> 34:29.440
Uh, can you describe your recent match against Gordon, uh, the EBI match?

34:29.760 --> 34:30.040
Okay.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.080
So EBI match on UFC fight pouts.

34:32.080 --> 34:38.200
It was a 20 minute match and, uh, immediately, uh, you know, match starts, I

34:38.200 --> 34:40.760
pulled guard and then I stand up.

34:40.760 --> 34:44.080
He pulls guard and we have this, uh, kind of like back and forth where he's

34:44.080 --> 34:46.800
trying to dig for underhooks, trying to get on top of me and he can't really

34:46.800 --> 34:49.520
have find success, uh, and out.

34:49.720 --> 34:53.640
And then in the midst of me trying to work my body lock pass, uh, Gordon is

34:53.640 --> 34:58.040
able to underhook a leg and we end up in a leg entanglement and then I'm able to

34:58.040 --> 35:01.960
transfer that leg entanglement to a 50 50 position, still like it's still in

35:01.960 --> 35:06.480
the leg entanglement, uh, from that 50 50 position, I'm able to, uh, separate

35:06.480 --> 35:08.760
his feet and, and actually get a few pops in.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.520
And he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange with a toe hold.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.120
The toe hold.

35:13.120 --> 35:13.360
Yep.

35:13.520 --> 35:18.240
And, uh, you know, after, after that, uh, um, we had a, uh, a bit more.

35:18.240 --> 35:22.320
I was, I was just being, uh, working on top position, trying to get my body lock.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.280
Time runs out and we go to overtime and overtime.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.080
Can you hold on a second?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.720
Actually, what does it mean to break a leg?

35:28.080 --> 35:32.520
I was very confused about, is this like a expression or what do you mean?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.160
What, when you broke it, which part breaks in a toll?

35:35.360 --> 35:35.600
Okay.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.000
So on a toe hold, uh, there's a few different grades of it.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.760
Like you could get a few pops and have some, have some, you know, walking

35:42.760 --> 35:46.640
issues, um, and people consider that break and then you could break it fully

35:46.640 --> 35:49.000
and have your foot be like a limp noodle.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.920
You know, I think what, what was the Achilles?

35:51.120 --> 35:52.520
What is the front of the Achilles or something?

35:52.520 --> 35:54.000
I mean, probably the ligaments.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.080
I mean, it's funny, like a lot of people say they broke something,

35:57.080 --> 35:59.680
but like to me, you break bones, you tear ligaments.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.360
So I would imagine you probably had a grade three tear.

36:03.360 --> 36:03.880
Grade three.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.320
How hard do you think is it?

36:05.520 --> 36:09.280
I was wondering that with, um, like a straight foot lock, how hard is it to

36:09.280 --> 36:12.320
break the shin or like the actual bones versus to tear stuff?

36:12.560 --> 36:13.600
Depends on how many steroids they're on.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.360
And obviously how much you're on.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.160
You're one of the few guys that have actually broken bones in competition.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.160
Uh, yeah, have I?

36:22.600 --> 36:23.360
Oh yeah, a couple.

36:23.360 --> 36:23.680
Yeah.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.480
Uh, which bone did you break?

36:26.480 --> 36:28.240
Spiral fracture of the fibula.

36:29.120 --> 36:29.360
Hmm.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.120
Very specific.

36:31.120 --> 36:31.400
A lot of power.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.240
Is it like a twisting?

36:33.240 --> 36:33.960
How did you break it?

36:34.000 --> 36:34.840
Oh, it was a heel hook.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.480
Vinny always used to say heel hooks don't work.

36:37.480 --> 36:41.680
Leg locks don't work, but unfortunately age gets the best of all of us.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.760
I think he had some mileage on those ligaments and the bone, I guess.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.880
So it's actually what the bone.

36:48.440 --> 36:48.600
Yeah.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.320
His ankle like disconnected from the tibia and the fibula, but the fibula

36:52.320 --> 36:54.520
definitely snaps pretty bad there.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.600
That's fascinating.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.600
The dynamics of that.

36:57.640 --> 36:57.880
Okay.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.160
Anyway, it went to overtime.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.160
What happened in overtime?

37:00.200 --> 37:00.640
Okay.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.840
Oh, having overtime.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.840
Let's see, trying to hang.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.480
Oh, okay.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.360
I go defense first, uh, whistle blows.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.120
I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds.

37:10.640 --> 37:15.480
And then immediately after I go on his back and he gets out in exactly a 17

37:15.480 --> 37:16.920
seconds, I'm like, shit, all right.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
I thought I had a good start.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.320
And then, uh, he gets on my back right after that.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.440
And, uh, he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.600
After that, he, uh, I got back on his back.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.440
He escapes and maybe like a minute and some change.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.600
Uh, I think where I went wrong in the overtime is I should have, when I should

37:35.600 --> 37:39.880
have been less adamant about chasing the submission and more aware of collecting

37:39.920 --> 37:44.920
time, if I kind of, uh, diverted my attention towards acquiring, you know, time

37:44.920 --> 37:48.800
on the clock, it would have been more my favor, but yeah, uh, at the end of my,

37:48.840 --> 37:53.080
uh, overtime round, I would, I'm able to lock up a renegade choke over the face,

37:53.400 --> 37:55.640
but there just wasn't enough time to fully finish.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.480
You know, I got a few seconds of squeezed in there.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.440
I didn't have enough time to adjust.

37:59.440 --> 38:03.880
And do you think if you're on steroids, you would have finished the joke?

38:04.560 --> 38:06.680
I, I mean, for sure, for sure.

38:07.360 --> 38:11.120
If you're on gear, you're, you're changing the biology of your body.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.960
You're adjusting your DNA for sure.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.440
If I adjusted my DNA, I mean, it's a finish.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
You're implying you're a natural athlete is what you say.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.920
Oh, I'm definitely a natural athlete.

38:20.920 --> 38:21.240
Yeah.

38:22.040 --> 38:22.920
Heavy immigration.

38:25.320 --> 38:25.720
Okay.

38:25.800 --> 38:30.480
Uh, so for people who don't know that the EBI rules, it's an interesting rule

38:30.480 --> 38:35.360
structure where the overtime you put yourself in a, in like the worst possible

38:35.360 --> 38:37.280
position and the task is to escape.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.720
And then the other person gets the same thing.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.120
Uh, what do you guys think about that rule set?

38:41.760 --> 38:47.280
I, I like it just because I, first of all, I don't, I don't like the idea

38:47.280 --> 38:51.680
of having to put somebody on my back, but I do like the definitive answer in the

38:51.680 --> 38:55.480
match, like either you escaped in time or you got, you know, written out.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.960
So the absolutely like you have a, you get to define a winner.

38:58.960 --> 38:59.480
That's great.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.880
I'd much rather have that than a close decision.

39:01.880 --> 39:02.720
It kind of goes the other way.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.200
What about you?

39:04.560 --> 39:07.040
I mean, honestly, there's all the different rules.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.480
When I look at the rule sets, I just try to think of what rule set I could beat

39:10.480 --> 39:13.640
that individual in, and I sort of gear myself towards that.

39:14.680 --> 39:15.840
That's really the strategy there.

39:16.040 --> 39:20.320
I think there's some guys that like, uh, that stole a lot that you would love to

39:20.320 --> 39:23.680
have EBI overtime, but at the end, you know, they're stalling until they have

39:23.680 --> 39:27.240
to give us a good position, but then there's some guys that are so good in those positions.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.400
I'm like, Ooh, maybe we just do a regular match.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.480
You know, what are the rules in the streets?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.400
The streets, no time limit.

39:34.080 --> 39:34.440
Yeah.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.560
That's one of it.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.840
There's also like concrete and cars and stuff biting, biting.

39:39.880 --> 39:40.160
Yeah.

39:40.560 --> 39:41.000
Poking.

39:43.280 --> 39:43.600
Yeah.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.800
So you don't like that rule set?

39:45.440 --> 39:48.200
Are there some people you would prefer in the street as a rule set?

39:48.880 --> 39:49.520
Me?

39:49.560 --> 39:50.640
Probably not.

39:53.360 --> 39:56.400
Uh, I don't know that EBI, I mean, it's tricky, you know, it depends on the

39:56.400 --> 39:58.040
opponent, which rules that I'd want to do.

39:59.080 --> 39:59.320
Wow.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.080
What about you, Nicker?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.680
What do you think about the rule set of EBI?

40:01.920 --> 40:02.280
Yes.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.920
I think EBI is, is very good from a spectator point of view.

40:05.920 --> 40:09.720
You know, people find it very entertaining to watch, um, you know, cause

40:09.720 --> 40:13.280
you're people want to see submissions and you're putting people, you're putting

40:13.280 --> 40:16.560
the athletes in a, in a position where, you know, you have like the highest

40:16.640 --> 40:18.320
percentage submission in the sport.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.240
So obviously you're going to get a lot of submissions.

40:20.320 --> 40:25.840
Um, my issue with it is it is a rule set that allows somebody that's overall

40:25.840 --> 40:28.120
worse at Jiu-Jitsu to win a match.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.880
You know, a guy can go out there and just stall and just get completely

40:31.880 --> 40:34.160
dominated for the entirety of regulation.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.960
And then he gets to start on the guy's back.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.600
So that's, that's one, my, uh, my one issue with it.

40:38.960 --> 40:44.480
But also, I mean, it's interesting to see like the best people in the world have

40:44.480 --> 40:48.200
to be put in a really bad position and to see how good their escapes are.

40:48.200 --> 40:52.560
For example, it's interesting, but it doesn't feel like a realistic.

40:52.600 --> 40:58.200
It's, it's a fun thing to watch, but it doesn't feel like the real fight.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.040
It feels weird.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.480
I'll claim it.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.920
If I start an overtime on someone and finish them, I'll claim it.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.440
But if they submit me an overtime, I'm like, you're going to deny it.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.040
It's good.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.440
The issue is people like stalling to just win the overtime.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.360
So where you got this guy that his whole training camp is just not

41:15.360 --> 41:17.080
get subbed and, and win the overtime.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.200
It's a bit boring.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.880
By the way, I have a rose behind you.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.960
Somebody gave me a Valentine's flower.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.680
So if you, if you missed the one from Gordon, I got one for you.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.800
Well, I'd appreciate that.

41:29.080 --> 41:29.920
It's good to feel loved.

41:30.440 --> 41:30.720
Yeah.

41:31.240 --> 41:31.600
All right.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.360
So what did you learn from that match?

41:36.640 --> 41:40.400
Like takeaways, technically speaking, like what, what, what do you need to work on?

41:40.840 --> 41:43.320
Well, I learned that, uh, I am pretty good.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.080
Yeah.

41:46.080 --> 41:46.800
Pretty good.

41:46.840 --> 41:50.280
Uh, I got to, you know, a few, I know exactly what my weakness is.

41:50.280 --> 41:54.560
You know, it's the, the leg lock department and I'm doing, I'm doing a lot, um, to,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.760
to, you know, get better in that specific aspect.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.160
I think attack and defense attack.

41:58.200 --> 42:02.840
I would say, yeah, but attack defense reattacks, um, even if I wanted to

42:02.840 --> 42:05.760
offensively enter a leg, you know, I could use some work there as well.

42:06.080 --> 42:11.280
Um, but I feel like once I solidify, like, um, my, like if I come in, I'll become a

42:11.280 --> 42:15.040
black belt specifically in the leg lock department, I feel like I'd be unstoppable.

42:16.160 --> 42:21.400
If you Nicky Rod definitively beat Gordon Ryan, how would you do it?

42:22.120 --> 42:26.280
Buggy choke, buggy choke, buggy choke for the listener.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.480
I don't even know how to describe buggy joke.

42:29.560 --> 42:33.240
Uh, what's, what's the definitive like conclusion on, on, on that joke?

42:33.560 --> 42:34.240
Does it work?

42:34.240 --> 42:39.320
It's a, uh, it's a choke that you do when you're in a, uh, what's the

42:39.320 --> 42:42.360
opposite of a dominant, it's not submissive in a non-dominant position

42:42.360 --> 42:43.880
of bottom of the side control.

42:44.360 --> 42:44.560
Yeah.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.880
Just an embarrassing submission to get caught with really.

42:47.080 --> 42:47.400
Yeah.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.560
But does it work?

42:49.480 --> 42:51.040
It works on certain people.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.960
For the listener, he glassed over at Nicky.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.960
It's embarrassing, but it's also what it's a way to frustrate the opponent.

42:59.240 --> 42:59.600
For sure.

42:59.600 --> 42:59.760
Yeah.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.800
It's a new pilot.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.040
I feel like the Rotolo has brought it back into fashion.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.800
And even if you don't get it, because it's one of those moves, it's so

43:06.800 --> 43:11.640
embarrassing at the first sign of danger, the top guy abandoned ship.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.280
And you can basically retain guard by attempting a very embarrassing

43:15.280 --> 43:15.520
submission.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.960
So the threat of embarrassment.

43:17.040 --> 43:17.320
Yeah.

43:17.960 --> 43:22.080
People pull out very quick to avoid suffering the consequences.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.000
I think some people underestimate how, uh, good of a submission is.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.640
I mean, like once you're locked in there, there's not too many

43:28.640 --> 43:30.040
defenses for a buggy choke.

43:31.080 --> 43:31.600
I did.

43:31.760 --> 43:35.920
Are you, is there an instructional on the way from you on the J ride?

43:35.920 --> 43:37.080
Actually, the little brother has one.

43:37.440 --> 43:37.680
Oh yeah.

43:37.680 --> 43:38.000
For real.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.480
You actually legit have.

43:40.920 --> 43:41.840
Oh, wow.

43:43.560 --> 43:44.280
That's awesome.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.200
We'll check it out.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.720
So, I mean, there is, I mean, you're making a joke out of it, but it is a

43:48.200 --> 43:51.320
real, like there's a system to it.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.480
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.360
We call it a system.

43:53.360 --> 43:57.320
I mean, you take an opponent, uh, that was just winning in a, in a, in a

43:57.320 --> 44:00.360
greatly dominant position and then boom, in that same position, they're

44:00.360 --> 44:03.640
pretty much, they're losing, you know, it's, uh, it's an interesting move.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.560
What's the name of the, uh, what's the name of it?

44:06.080 --> 44:07.240
It's called the buggy pedia.

44:08.280 --> 44:08.720
Okay.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.040
The, the buggy pedia.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.960
I thought there'd be something like very Craig Jonesy about it.

44:13.000 --> 44:13.280
Okay.

44:13.280 --> 44:13.760
Awesome.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.440
Uh, I know you don't want to sort of reveal the secrets of what you're

44:16.440 --> 44:18.600
working on, but in general, do you, what,

44:18.640 --> 44:19.200
I don't know.

44:19.200 --> 44:19.440
I don't know.

44:19.440 --> 44:19.760
I don't know.

44:19.760 --> 44:19.920
I don't know.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.000
I don't know.

44:20.000 --> 44:20.080
I don't know.

44:20.080 --> 44:20.160
I don't know.

44:20.160 --> 44:20.240
I don't know.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.760
Secrets of what you're working on.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.360
But in general, dude, what does it take to beat Gordon?

44:25.360 --> 44:27.320
I guess it would have to be some kind of a choke.

44:27.320 --> 44:30.640
I think any joint lock or anything like that, he's just going to let it

44:30.640 --> 44:32.040
break and stay in the match.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.480
So I don't even think he'd tap from like a, a renegade choke.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.880
I think I would have to put him to sleep.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.160
So, um, putting him to sleep is how it would win.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.280
So Gordon is somebody who really hates losing.

44:41.640 --> 44:41.880
Yeah.

44:41.880 --> 44:44.200
Like he won't even tap in the, in the practice room.

44:44.200 --> 44:47.560
I remember like I had a toll hold a couple of times in practice room and

44:47.560 --> 44:49.080
he was just comfortable like working there.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.040
I'm like, I'm not really putting much on it.

44:51.040 --> 44:55.040
I think he just, you know, maybe because of situations like that in practice, he

44:55.040 --> 44:59.040
kind of didn't respect my tollholds ability in the competition.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.000
You've done that to me in the practice.

45:01.240 --> 45:01.560
I have.

45:01.560 --> 45:02.280
Yeah, I have.

45:02.280 --> 45:02.520
Yeah.

45:03.200 --> 45:03.480
Yeah.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.680
I'll give you a little, give me a little pop and then he let go.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.480
And that was just, that was only 10% right there.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.640
Hey, don't get it to mass.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.200
Okay.

45:13.280 --> 45:17.920
Um, is there some part of that you think is necessary to be a champion is

45:17.920 --> 45:21.040
to like this almost unwillingness and competition to tap?

45:21.680 --> 45:25.280
I think it's definitely something to be said for people that are just like, uh,

45:26.120 --> 45:29.600
you know, willing to go that extra mile or to take that damage, to secure their,

45:29.640 --> 45:30.400
their victory.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.680
Um, is there a part of you that like would hate to tap or hates to tap?

45:35.160 --> 45:35.400
Yeah.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.440
I mean, all, all of me, they would hate that.

45:37.680 --> 45:38.000
Yeah.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.760
The whole part of me.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.360
Uh, isn't there a John Legend song like that?

45:42.400 --> 45:44.040
All of you and all of me.

45:44.160 --> 45:44.800
Very romantic.

45:44.840 --> 45:45.200
Yeah.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.480
No, we're sticking on that theme.

45:46.520 --> 45:46.800
Okay.

45:46.800 --> 45:47.160
I'm sorry.

45:47.680 --> 45:53.920
Uh, Oh, one of the things, uh, Gordon asked, I forget how you put it because I

45:53.920 --> 45:57.760
think there's a lot of words that would need to be censored involved, but he

45:57.760 --> 46:04.720
said, ask them, um, how it feels to have a zero five record against me with four

46:04.720 --> 46:06.280
submissions combined.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.520
I mean, first of all, I wasn't sure he could count to five.

46:09.680 --> 46:09.840
Yeah.

46:09.840 --> 46:10.720
That's an impressive thing.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.320
Oh, and five, I mean, I will say one thing.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.960
Nobody beats me four times.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.240
I love you so much.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.440
I did have a question.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.360
I did have a question for you.

46:25.880 --> 46:30.640
There was some controversy on your Twitter about a list of books.

46:31.080 --> 46:31.480
Yeah.

46:31.560 --> 46:37.200
And I was wondering why Gordon's book wasn't featured amongst that literature.

46:37.280 --> 46:41.360
Well, it was only the first 30 books or like the first 20 books.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.920
And it would of course be in, uh,

46:43.200 --> 46:44.320
something interesting about Gordon.

46:44.320 --> 46:47.400
He's the first author that's written more books than he's read.

46:49.440 --> 46:49.880
Pretty good.

46:50.280 --> 46:57.280
Uh, if you, if you face them and beat them, like what's your take on what

46:57.280 --> 46:58.080
it takes to be Gordon?

46:58.240 --> 47:02.200
I mean, you guys kind of joke and they go pretty, pretty hard recently on each

47:02.200 --> 47:06.160
other, but as a fan of jujitsu, I'm all in on this rivalry.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.560
It's just fun to watch.

47:07.600 --> 47:10.760
I mean, first of all, I don't think I go really hard with him.

47:10.760 --> 47:14.120
I think Gordon is, he's pretty sensitive.

47:14.360 --> 47:14.680
You know what I mean?

47:14.680 --> 47:18.080
He's looking for a large insult in a small insult.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.920
And for me, like Australians, we just attack each other all day, every day.

47:23.320 --> 47:27.040
And for me, like, if I see someone that takes himself very seriously, that's

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
like blood in the water, that's funny to me.

47:29.040 --> 47:34.440
To me, if I can just gently provoke and get a strong reaction, that's hilarious.

47:34.480 --> 47:36.360
Like Aussies, we will just attack each other.

47:36.680 --> 47:39.720
And the first person that gets upset, he kind of loses the exchange.

47:40.160 --> 47:43.160
So I think that is very, very entertaining.

47:43.480 --> 47:47.320
Like if you were to beat Gordon, would the mental game off the mat be part of it?

47:48.400 --> 47:50.440
I think it would be a factor for sure.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.960
But I mean, I'm never going to come out too crazy direct with him.

47:52.960 --> 47:57.000
You know, like I don't, I, I find that like, if you get too upset online

47:57.000 --> 47:59.880
and you're going crazy, I find that I'd be embarrassed to do that myself.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.640
Obviously each, everyone's different.

48:01.640 --> 48:03.520
Everyone has a different style, you know?

48:03.520 --> 48:07.800
But like, yeah, I think mental, the mental aspect would play a big factor.

48:07.920 --> 48:14.640
I mean, mainly because if I were to beat him, I would send him a message every day.

48:15.720 --> 48:19.480
Until I died, just to gently remind him that I got the last one.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.960
The last one, it's all that matters.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.720
We're not giving it back, we're not giving it to him.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.720
So like once you beat him, you're going to run for the rest of your life.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.040
I mean, run, but look back.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.200
Yeah, with messages.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.280
Ride, ride your horse into the sunset.

48:38.280 --> 48:38.600
Okay.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.000
Oh, by the way, you've talked very lightly.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.920
You've talked shit very lightly against Alexander Volkanovsky's

48:46.920 --> 48:48.800
opponent, very lightly.

48:49.320 --> 48:52.920
Have you received death threats or how are you still alive?

48:53.560 --> 48:59.000
Like Gordon, I would say people from Dagestan take a joke very well.

48:59.600 --> 49:00.040
You know what I mean?

49:00.040 --> 49:00.360
Really?

49:01.160 --> 49:01.720
Do they really?

49:02.000 --> 49:02.240
No.

49:02.360 --> 49:03.000
Oh, like Gordon.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.040
Oh, sorry.

49:04.440 --> 49:04.880
Slow.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.480
Aggressive mode in my head.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.200
Now honestly, Islam was pretty cool.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.920
I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know, cause like I felt like that was a

49:12.920 --> 49:16.880
massive fight and it probably should have had more attention than it was receiving.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.480
So I wanted to just gently stir it up a bit.

49:19.480 --> 49:23.400
I feel like Sambo guys are in the same vein as catch wrestlers, very sensitive.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.240
You know, like obviously there's only three people in the world that

49:25.240 --> 49:28.160
do catch wrestling, Sambo, maybe 10 to 15.

49:28.280 --> 49:33.600
So I figured we could really provoke them with that sort of jiu-jitsu Sambo stuff.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.080
Islam took the jokes very well.

49:35.400 --> 49:39.440
The Russian fans, not so much a very serious, there's not many smiles in Russia.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.040
You know, they didn't take it as well.

49:42.120 --> 49:46.280
I'm trying to suppress the anger, the rages building up slowly.

49:46.920 --> 49:49.000
Um, so you guys mentioned steroids.

49:49.720 --> 49:53.040
I like that you bring that up after we talk about Russia for the record.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.440
Smooth, smooth segue there.

49:56.880 --> 50:01.960
I do not condone the statements, um, said by the Aussie, but I would

50:01.960 --> 50:03.440
love to travel with you to Russia.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.640
That would be a good time.

50:04.680 --> 50:04.960
Yeah.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.120
You might get killed with me now.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.800
No, I would be the, like the first to turn to backstab you.

50:15.080 --> 50:15.440
All right.

50:15.840 --> 50:20.000
Um, are most of the top grapplers on steroids?

50:20.840 --> 50:24.800
I mean, it's hard to say, you know, some people look like shit and they're on

50:24.800 --> 50:28.480
steroids, some people look excellent and they're not on steroids.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.840
It's so, so hard to tell, but that seems to be the general consensus

50:32.840 --> 50:34.000
that a lot of people on steroids.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.640
I'm always a little bit, I don't know.

50:35.760 --> 50:36.480
So be honest.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.560
I've never, I've never seen anyone take steroids.

50:39.600 --> 50:40.960
I've never taken steroids.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.760
I don't even know if that's the right term to use or like TRT, any of that.

50:45.040 --> 50:53.000
So I'm very careful, like to not let my naive that a, like, um, lead me

50:53.000 --> 50:57.280
to take conclusions, but I do feel a little bit weird about the witch hunt

50:57.280 --> 51:00.960
nature of it, that some people a little bit too eagerly claim that others

51:01.000 --> 51:03.080
on steroids just because they're successful.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.520
Um, but at the same time, it does seem that a lot of athletes will do

51:08.520 --> 51:10.440
whatever it takes to be successful.

51:10.640 --> 51:10.800
Yeah.

51:10.800 --> 51:15.600
I mean, if a sport doesn't test, you got to assume most people are going to do it.

51:15.600 --> 51:19.480
And especially now as more money comes into the sport, you got to assume more

51:19.480 --> 51:20.520
people are going to do it, you know,

51:20.640 --> 51:25.440
I generally like do ADCC and like, does jujitsu test.

51:25.560 --> 51:26.480
It's actually encouraged.

51:27.000 --> 51:27.560
What's encouraged.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.280
You get a pamphlet.

51:30.320 --> 51:30.680
Okay.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.640
They don't test.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.880
There's no test to make sure we're on steroids.

51:33.880 --> 51:36.880
Cause obviously it's a big show for the UFC fire pass in the future.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.240
You don't want anyone coming in out of shape.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.120
Very nice.

51:40.480 --> 51:43.760
Do you think using steroids in that kind of context and sports is wrong?

51:44.360 --> 51:48.000
Like stepping, stepping away if it's not illegal, I mean, do you think

51:48.000 --> 51:50.840
ethically speaking, I like to assume everyone's on steroids and I have to

51:50.840 --> 51:52.640
feel bad about using steroids myself.

51:52.680 --> 51:52.920
Yeah.

51:54.440 --> 51:54.920
Do you use them?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.280
You use all of the steroids.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.000
I'm over 30, a TRT, you know, that's the medical definition.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.240
That's, that's the medical.

52:02.320 --> 52:02.640
Okay.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.040
Uh, I'd like to meet your

52:05.040 --> 52:06.080
therapeutic use, you know,

52:06.720 --> 52:07.880
therapeutic, right.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.800
Um, like, how do you just feel about it?

52:11.320 --> 52:12.640
I mean, it is cheating for sure.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.720
Hey, whether they test for it or not, I think it is cheating.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.920
Obviously some people are going to say, Oh fuck, everyone's on it.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.680
Uh, I should be able to get away with it.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.280
It makes it even playing field, you know, but it kind of becomes rush

52:21.280 --> 52:24.480
and relax cause it's like, if one guy is taking a small amount and the other

52:24.480 --> 52:30.640
guy is taking a huge amount, he's going to reap huge rewards in the short term.

52:31.080 --> 52:34.800
Probably be dead pretty early, but diet champion, mind you.

52:35.040 --> 52:35.560
You know what I mean?

52:35.560 --> 52:38.080
So it's like, I don't know where that is yet.

52:38.200 --> 52:38.360
Yeah.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.280
What do you think about that?

52:39.320 --> 52:43.160
Do you think, uh, do you think it's worthy to take health risks?

52:43.400 --> 52:46.960
I think if you just for the glory, I think if you're 40 about to die,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.160
looking at a cabinet of gold medals for wrestling, other men, it's probably

52:51.160 --> 52:53.480
not going to hit the same way on your death bed, you know,

52:54.760 --> 52:56.160
sorry, in which direction?

52:56.800 --> 52:58.200
Like, is that a good thing or not?

52:58.240 --> 53:00.000
No, you're probably going to feel like, Oh fuck.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.760
I probably wasted a bit of health on that.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.720
You know, you think so.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.120
Isn't that, isn't that like the glory of it?

53:06.920 --> 53:08.120
Like you said, other men.

53:08.360 --> 53:08.800
Yeah.

53:09.680 --> 53:10.000
Yeah.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.440
Well, I mean, it might be, you know, maybe rest of a woman as well.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.280
What'd you do with, with Gabby on Valentine's day?

53:18.360 --> 53:19.120
What did you take her?

53:19.440 --> 53:22.760
Uh, we filmed some new stuff for OnlyFans for OnlyFans.

53:22.760 --> 53:23.600
We never stopped working.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.200
It says the love affair is also a work affair.

53:28.240 --> 53:28.520
Okay.

53:29.160 --> 53:29.480
I don't know.

53:29.480 --> 53:34.560
I, I, I, there's something too that made like, like a Olympic gold medalist

53:34.560 --> 53:38.800
accomplishing like the heights, like sacrificing everything, just everything.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.600
The first 20, 30 years of your life for this silly little piece of metal.

53:42.600 --> 53:45.200
I don't, I think there's something beautiful to that.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.840
That's like, inspires a lot, a lot of people.

53:48.320 --> 53:54.200
And that's like the height of the human condition in a way.

53:54.200 --> 53:57.520
Like if you survive, I'm just saying if you're in your death bed early

53:57.520 --> 54:03.160
in life, we all die, all men die, but not all men truly live.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.400
How many years are you willing to shave off for a gold medal?

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
That's a good question.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.880
How many, how many are you willing to shave off for a gold medal?

54:12.120 --> 54:14.080
Well, you're for silver medal for silver.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.320
I mean, for a silver medal, I'd shave a few off.

54:16.360 --> 54:22.560
I think two silvers makes a gold worth five years, five to 10.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.840
Maybe, uh, shave off the bad years, enhance the good ones.

54:27.120 --> 54:30.400
Well, I mean, you've sacrificed, you guys sacrificed a lot, a lot of your life.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.440
You continue to sacrifice.

54:31.440 --> 54:32.920
Oh, you don't, you don't see it as sacrifice.

54:33.280 --> 54:33.720
It's fun.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.360
I think training is fun being adamant about it.

54:36.640 --> 54:40.560
Consistent gives you, I mean, we, I think we have a great routine, great ritual.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.480
Definitely enjoy the process.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.080
All right.

54:44.080 --> 54:49.040
Well, do you guys know this is bro science or, or I'm talking to bro scientists, but

54:49.040 --> 54:50.800
do you know how long stairways stay in your system?

54:52.560 --> 54:53.040
Forever.

54:53.840 --> 54:54.200
Forever.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.760
Oh, because it's like, Hey, once you do it.

54:57.360 --> 54:57.880
You own it.

54:58.120 --> 54:58.400
Yeah.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.000
Just the knowledge.

55:01.240 --> 55:01.640
Yeah.

55:01.760 --> 55:02.120
All right.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.400
I think it's different for each steroid, right?

55:04.400 --> 55:05.960
I think some of them last longer than others.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.800
Depends if it's a year and you would think I would do a little research

55:08.800 --> 55:10.560
before this, asking these questions.

55:10.840 --> 55:13.880
Why do you think most athletes and coaches don't talk about steroids?

55:14.880 --> 55:16.720
Like, why is it such a, like a secret?

55:16.800 --> 55:17.960
Why is it so embarrassing?

55:18.280 --> 55:21.400
I think they probably talk about it, like amongst the team and whatnot.

55:21.680 --> 55:25.440
Again, I mean, it's, it's going to be more shady if it's like a, your, your

55:25.440 --> 55:28.760
sport is tested or not, or kind of in the wild west and the, and the grappling

55:28.760 --> 55:29.320
world, you know?

55:29.520 --> 55:29.680
Yeah.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.280
But why don't grapplers talk about it?

55:32.360 --> 55:33.360
Because it seems cheating.

55:33.920 --> 55:37.840
I mean, it's, it's kind of insinuated as a bit of cheating, even if it's not

55:37.840 --> 55:43.360
like, uh, if it's not tested, I mean, still you're, you're taking a person that

55:43.360 --> 55:46.560
could, you know, maybe has good jujitsu, good mechanics, you putting them on the

55:46.560 --> 55:49.840
leg and they're something with a heel hook versus breaking your leg with a

55:49.840 --> 55:54.200
heel hook, you know, something as subtle as that can make, you know, big differences.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.240
All right.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.640
This is going to make me sound dumb, but is it possible that steroids

55:58.640 --> 56:00.720
are not a huge help in grappling?

56:01.720 --> 56:05.400
I think if you're bad at jujitsu and you do steroids, you're going to

56:05.400 --> 56:07.200
continue to be bad at jujitsu.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.520
But if you're great at gear, I'm sorry, if you're great at grappling, if you're

56:11.520 --> 56:15.000
great at grappling and then you also do gear, it's going to enhance what you're

56:15.040 --> 56:17.080
already, you know, good at and make you much better.

56:17.080 --> 56:18.600
But like, how much is the enhancement?

56:18.640 --> 56:19.640
I guess is the question.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.560
How much is muscle valued?

56:21.800 --> 56:25.120
Like if you're, if you're doing gear and you're not changing weight that much,

56:25.120 --> 56:29.120
like maybe it helps you a little bit, but if, you know, you're gaining 50, 60

56:29.120 --> 56:32.520
pounds of pure muscle and it's like, that's a huge enhancement.

56:32.520 --> 56:33.480
That's another human.

56:33.760 --> 56:37.440
Does muscle, a small human, yeah.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.960
Does muscle matter in jujitsu?

56:40.080 --> 56:41.200
I guess is the question.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.040
Is it possible that it gets in the way?

56:43.200 --> 56:45.520
I'd say muscle matters, but technique matters more.

56:45.960 --> 56:50.000
I also think that it, it'll help you develop technique as well, because

56:50.320 --> 56:52.920
obviously, you know, testosterone helps with recovery rate.

56:53.120 --> 56:56.160
So if you're on gear, you're able to train a lot more.

56:56.560 --> 57:00.320
Now, that being said, if you're not able to learn, obviously it's not going to

57:00.320 --> 57:03.120
help in that aspect, but if you're somebody that knows how to learn and get

57:03.120 --> 57:06.760
good at jujitsu, and then you add gear on top of that, you're able to do

57:06.760 --> 57:08.800
significantly more sessions throughout the week.

57:09.360 --> 57:09.640
Okay.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.280
And by the way, gear is steroids?

57:11.280 --> 57:11.680
Steroids.

57:11.680 --> 57:11.880
Yeah.

57:12.560 --> 57:12.840
Okay.

57:13.160 --> 57:17.880
I also think that you don't have to be as consistent, uh, in like your sleep

57:17.880 --> 57:20.920
and your food and stuff, if you're, if you're on gear, you have a little bit of

57:20.920 --> 57:25.560
leeway, um, but I mean, being consistent in, in your diet and your sleep

57:25.560 --> 57:27.760
definitely would, would, would help, you know, the process.

57:27.880 --> 57:31.720
Since you use most steroids of any athlete I've ever met.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.560
Do you think steroids will help, help jujitsu?

57:35.880 --> 57:39.080
I think obviously it helps recovery and your ability to train more, but I think

57:39.080 --> 57:43.400
some, I've seen some guys go on steroids and then suddenly they feel like the

57:43.400 --> 57:47.320
incredible Hulk and now in the training room, they just start to rely more on

57:47.320 --> 57:49.400
strength than the techniques they had.

57:49.400 --> 57:54.720
And actually in some respect hinders them and makes them gas more in competition.

57:54.720 --> 57:58.400
Cause then they're using more of the muscle they never used to have.

57:59.360 --> 58:02.640
So you've implied that you're a natural athlete.

58:04.160 --> 58:05.920
You said that, you said that skeptically.

58:09.520 --> 58:14.360
Is this something you do for, for social media to talk shit to Gordon to imply

58:14.360 --> 58:15.760
that he's not a natural athlete?

58:15.760 --> 58:19.560
Well, I only, uh, pretty much recently on social media, I had this rebuttal,

58:19.560 --> 58:23.440
you know, saying that, you know, Gordon's on gear and I only said that because

58:23.440 --> 58:28.280
after, after our match in, in the, our most recent match, no, the EBI rules

58:28.280 --> 58:33.200
match, he accused me of greasing, which is like lubing up, so I'm slippery

58:33.200 --> 58:37.600
during our match, so I did not, I was checked multiple times before and

58:37.600 --> 58:42.160
after our grappling event and he still, you know, went out and accused me of

58:42.160 --> 58:44.800
this, so I was like, all right, as opposed to telling a lie, I'll just tell

58:44.800 --> 58:48.320
the truth about, you know, your, your steroid use, which it shouldn't be that

58:48.320 --> 58:52.520
big of a deal in retrospect because he kind of admitted it and whatnot previously.

58:52.960 --> 58:57.320
Um, so it's, uh, yeah, I just kind of felt like I had to rebuttal and I, I

58:57.320 --> 58:59.880
didn't do it immediately because I was like, all right, I'll know I have this

58:59.880 --> 59:04.960
podcast plan, so I'll wait to do it on my friend, uh, Mark Bell's podcast,

59:05.120 --> 59:08.160
you know, be a little more, more, get a little bit more exposure on it.

59:08.520 --> 59:12.120
And, uh, yeah, I knew he was going to bite the bait, but I didn't think

59:12.120 --> 59:13.840
he was going to, you know, bite the bait that hard.

59:14.320 --> 59:18.120
I, I know he's a little stressed out about, about the comments, but, you know.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.880
And that was the origin of you guys going back and forth on.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.480
Well, it wasn't so much back and forth.

59:23.480 --> 59:27.040
It was just, I went forth and then he kept going back, back, back.

59:27.040 --> 59:30.480
Like I, I remember one of, one of my guys, the enemy, and they were like,

59:31.000 --> 59:35.880
Gordon's made like 68 Instagram stories and 67 of them were all about you.

59:35.920 --> 59:38.160
I was like, all right, well, I'm in his head for sure.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.120
Got us a few followers.

59:39.160 --> 59:39.760
We appreciate it.

59:39.760 --> 59:40.120
We did.

59:40.560 --> 59:44.160
They get followers, even shout it out or, or B-team wipeout program.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.120
So thank you.

59:49.240 --> 59:49.640
Okay.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.880
Uh, speaking of which, uh, what's the B-team, how's it run?

59:55.120 --> 59:56.280
And why is it called the B-team?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.280
Well, I mean, Craig was the A-team.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.560
For me, B's for best.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.000
Okay, best.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.000
All right.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.280
What does B stand for, for you?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.600
What does it represent?

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:14.160
What is the ideal, like the, you know, uh, Miyamoto Musashi philosophical

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.520
foundation of B-team, aim low and achieve.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.000
If the bar is set low, you can't help but win.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:22.680
Okay.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.280
That's Nikki's philosophy with women as well.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.960
Set the bar incredibly low over achieve.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.440
So what, what, what is the B-team?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.320
How do you guys run it?

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.760
Like what, uh, yeah, I mean, can you just talk about the school, how you found it?

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.160
What, what, what is it?

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.360
Uh, what's it like?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.680
I mean, pretty much just a regular, uh, jujitsu gym.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.040
We started as sort of a pros only purple belt and above, um, team.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.600
And we have me, Nicky Rod, Nicky Ryan, Ethan, Damien, um, as coaches.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.320
Am I missing someone?

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.640
Oh, JB, your old age, impeccable memory.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:56.800
Yeah.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.240
And we got JB come on to teach wipeouts, but just just stock standard, uh,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.880
jujitsu team, we focus on, uh, more, we lean heavily towards the professional

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.080
athlete side of things.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.800
We have a lot of, uh, high level guys in that class structure, regular

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.280
instruction and positional sparring open rounds, but we sort of took a, a heavy

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.520
slant on marketing side of things.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.800
We really try to blow up the YouTube channel.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.400
Um, obviously we sell a lot of clothing, merchandise and stuff.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.080
So yeah, we just sort of took a modern approach to a standard jujitsu gym.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.200
Cause I mean, just the gyms are full of some of the most

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.400
boring human beings on earth.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.840
So we try to highlight words.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.240
Strongly highlight the other side of things, you know, keep it pretty light hearted.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:37.840
It can be fun.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:38.240
Yeah.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.360
That you just, it can be fun.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.800
I guess that it can be cool too.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.840
You know, it's not just full of steroided up autistic people, you know,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.120
question from Reddit quote, need to hear some of the stories about drop-ins that

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.360
led to the making of the gem of a video, the do's and don'ts of training a B team.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.360
And if any fun stories, and he wants to stand out, do you guys remember any

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.240
police involved ever, we had a guy come in, we had to kick him out.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.040
He was stalking two of the members.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.520
Um, yeah, well, I mean, that's just crazy people, you know, like I

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.400
portray a pretty insane image online.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.040
And I guess I am that a lot of the time, but at training, try to keep it

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.240
w w while training around training.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.400
I'm insulting everyone, but while training, I try to keep it pretty serious.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.480
But obviously the image I portray Lou is in some of the crazier members.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.200
I mean, like the thing is about the, the gym you guys run is, is really professional.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.160
It's like friendly.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.680
It's like the light hearted joking is there obviously the, you know, like

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.000
shit talk and all that kind of stuff.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.960
But like, it's, it's a pretty safe environment, but the public

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.200
persona might attract some, some maniacs.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.320
I won't say which places I've trained at, but it's obviously some places you walk

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.760
into the room and it's very, very serious.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.440
There's no smiles around.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.920
Obviously it's probably average training room in Russia, but no smiles, very

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.320
serious environment, you know what I mean?

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.040
And, uh, I definitely don't like that.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.280
I don't want to show up to training and be walking on eggshells, not know

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.040
what the coaches moods like that day.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.520
I want to go in and have a good time.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.280
Keep it lighthearted.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.680
What was in the video?

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.160
What, what are the do's and don'ts?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.840
Cause like the address is public.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.080
Like anyone can show up.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.400
Anyone can show up.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:14.600
Yeah.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.440
What were the do's and don'ts?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Does anyone challenge you like to a fight?

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.880
No, yeah, no.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.160
Yeah.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.960
I mean, probably from other gyms in town, they're probably, that's

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.240
probably coming down the line, but, um, do's and don'ts.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.760
I'm all in on that.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.720
I'm, I'm, I would be excited as a fan to just watch.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.680
I love the drama.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.160
Not the drama.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:33.640
No, no, no.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.840
Well, a little drama, a little drop of poison is good.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.160
Um, but ultimately it's the best grapplers in the world.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.680
Kind of, um, going at it.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.160
Yeah.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.480
Yeah.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.000
It's fun.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.280
Cause I may, maybe I'm wrong, but I think there is an underlying deep

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.680
camaraderie at the end of the day.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.240
When you're like at the top of the world and you're like in the same town.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.960
What could possibly go wrong?

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.840
It's like a shitty Western, but like an Epic Western where like Clint Eastwood,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.120
like the good, the bad, and the ugly.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.720
Of course I love it.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.720
I'm, I'm here just eating popcorn like that.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.720
Staring the pot.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.000
I'm not staring the pot.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.720
That one for sure.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.800
I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you're the world's best grappler hates

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.640
you and you're gently provoking him behind the scenes every day?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.520
Well, I mean, for sure in Texas and you've stolen his brother, held it for

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:25.880
ransom.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.920
It is like a story of a shitty Western.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.920
I think, you know, a lot of white belts to train with you.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.640
What's it like to open it up to a bigger audience?

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.320
Uh, we haven't opened it up yet, but it'll be interesting to see.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.080
I mean, I feel like your higher belts, they really understand what the

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.840
training room is, you know what I mean?

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.640
White belts early, they're trying to find their place in the gym.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.600
Could be kind of awkward and stuff in that environment.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.120
I think obviously those white belts coming in will change the dynamic, but

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.960
the white belts will have a separate white belt classes, obviously for them.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.280
Cause given it's such a high level gym, it'd be tough for a beginner to be able

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.880
to enter the more advanced classes.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.640
Well, obviously we're teaching more advanced techniques.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.920
So yeah, we've separated a white belt program, I believe 6 PM on Friday.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.080
Yeah.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.680
Maybe we'll have a Saturday one as well, but it'll be interesting to see how it

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:18.880
goes.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.680
We're trying to do things different, you know, like trying to do your traditional

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.320
jiu-jitsu gyms.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.040
Obviously you're not going to teach beginners wrestling at all.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.320
We're trying to split it at least 33% top game, bottom game and wrestling.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.760
So at least create more well-rounded athletes from day one, whereas I feel like

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.720
most traditional jiu-jitsu gyms might have no gi once a week that would touch

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.480
wrestling, very IBJJF heavy techniques.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.400
But again, the sport's changing for sure.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.160
Just to take that on, how does it begin to get good at jiu-jitsu?

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.920
Like given that you're starting this white belt, what's your philosophy on that?

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.560
Obviously by all of my instructionals at full price, not doing it

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.480
for sale, that would go a long way.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.920
For those of you who are Russians, I'll send you instructions or all the forms

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.680
so you know how to, how to steal it.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.160
Yeah.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:01.800
I'll share it.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
I bought them all.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.560
So I'll just send it to you for free.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.480
I mean, we do have the Makachev 50 discount code, you know, offering discounts

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.880
to help him out for the rematch.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:17.200
I got the nice, well, I got a hundred percent discount for you if you need it.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.080
But that said, your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant and it's one

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.600
of the most respected instructionals out there with incredibly great names.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:26.400
Yeah.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.360
It probably loses me sales, honestly, due to removing the seriousness.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.960
They think it's going to kind of suck.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.280
It's going to be some funny gimmicky thing.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.200
Or, I mean, some people don't even know if it's a real product.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.520
That's a big hurdle I have to overcome as they see it.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.080
And they're like, is that a real thing?

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.120
That's a problem.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.560
But how does the white belt get good?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.920
I think they just, I mean, just have to show up, just have to put in the effort,

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.920
try to focus on using techniques and training rather than just fighting to the death.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.760
You know, although that is entertaining for us to watch two white belts fight to the death.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:58.360
Yeah.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.000
But what are the techniques you should focus on?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:00.840
Like, what's the process?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.840
What does it mean to show up?

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.600
Like how much drilling, all that kind of stuff.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.760
Like what, if you were to optimize the first six months of a, of a beginner,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.320
there's a lot of people would listen to this and haven't tried.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.000
They've been curious.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.440
I have a lot of friends who haven't, who are like, you're just too curious.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.400
They're constantly looking for an excuse to start.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.080
I think it's just got to be as simple as possible.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.520
You know, like we shouldn't be teaching more advanced movements.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.360
I mean, obviously in the grand scheme of things, there's highly advanced techniques

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.920
and then there's slightly advanced.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.120
And I think trying to teach those guys real specific positions, even like real

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.960
specific types of guard is just beyond them.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.040
I think the best way to learn is through problem solving.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.000
And I think if you show the technique before they've discovered that problem,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.160
the learning is sort of held back.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:55.640
So I like the idea of using kids style games to show them a problem and then use

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.120
the techniques to fix the problems they've just discovered.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.320
I think that's the best way to learn.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.520
Can you give an example of a problem to show them before you give them the

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.000
techniques? Like, what are we talking about?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.200
All right.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.160
So say you wanted to teach posture in wrestling.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.920
You could create a game where one guy, the game might be get to a leg or get to

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.480
two legs, control the leg, like super simple.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.360
But the rules, the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upright posture

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.400
and one guy is forced, well, not forced, but he's allowed to keep a bent at the

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.240
hips, lower posture.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.640
And obviously within that constraint, the guy with the better posture is going to

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.840
have more success.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.440
He's going to have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.600
And therefore you've demonstrated the flaws of bad posture without having to

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.160
explain it to them before they really tested that out.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.080
Okay.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.280
And then the result of that, you would realize that the bent over posture is

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:47.560
better.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:47.720
Yeah.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.520
You have that aha moment rather than just being having a spoken to you.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.360
Uh, you wrote Craig, uh, I'm a big fan of constraint based learning.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.920
I guess was just what you're talking about.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.320
I love presenting beginners with a problem before the solution, like here

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.360
attempt to hold side control with no, with no cues on how then I see how the

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.160
guy got out and address issue by issue, cross face and him control and so on.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:12.920
Okay.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.960
So what are some other examples like side control?

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.240
Yeah, that would be excellent one.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.920
So I control like teacher, like obviously we say, oh, you secure a cross face so

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.280
they can't turn into you much easier to have them try to hold someone down

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.680
without explaining what a cross face is and then use that technique to address

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.080
the problem they've just encountered.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.760
So I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jujitsu, like even more

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.360
advanced, say 50, 50, obviously a mirrored position where you both have

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.720
access to each other's heels.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.560
Most people will stall out of that position and keep their feet crossed.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.320
I think a great constraint for both of them.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.760
You can't cross your feet.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.960
Now you have to learn how to, uh, slip the heel hook when they expose her and

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.080
how to safely re-attack of your own.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.640
So the constraint is you can't be too defensive in that position.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.400
And I think the, the rate of learning increases.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.360
Why do you think the rate of learning increases?

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.280
Like, why do you think that works?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.360
Cause you encounter more problems say in that situation, they're going to get

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.960
your heel a lot more in whatever period of time you allocate the drill for.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.520
Then if the legs across, I don't think the hard part splitting the legs to

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.320
get to the submission, I think the hard parts practicing control while they're

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.080
trying to slip it at a later stage.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.880
And then obviously trying to slip your heel when you're in more danger.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.240
So it makes you more comfortable in that bad position.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.280
If you're used to doing it with open legs.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:29.960
Yeah.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.840
I think that probably that style of teaching forces people to focus on.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.400
Cause it's so easy to fall into focusing on like memorizing a particular details

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.360
of a technique without thinking like, why the hell does this even work?

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.480
And if you don't have that, you get to focus on like, from like as

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.160
cliche as it sounds from first principles, like why the hell, how

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.280
the hell did I get out of this?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.480
Like, why does this even work?

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.640
Why does wrestling work?

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.240
Why do you have a bent over posture?

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.120
You get those like, start to ask those kinds of questions, which is kind of

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:03.360
interesting because it's not obvious to me that bent over postures is the right

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.600
posture for jujitsu, right?

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.760
I'm confused actually about that.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.480
I don't know about the correct posture.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:08.840
Yeah.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.800
For jujitsu, like what's the right answer?

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.600
I think bent over posture is still good for jujitsu.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.440
Even with the judo and all of that, like, why are so many jujitsu people

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.360
like at a high level, the posture is higher up.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.320
Well, I think the, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low because

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320
it's not necessary, right?

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.520
If wrestlers are like low enough to the ground where your hands could touch the

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.800
mat, but in jujitsu, you know, it's a, it's kind of a mix between like wrestling

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.440
and, and like, uh, judo or, or Greco-Roman wrestling.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.320
So, um, I think there's just a bit more, more lax and it's, it's bent over, but

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.320
it's not upright and it's also not super low, you know?

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:52.960
A bit more room for error too, because obviously the jujitsu guy shot isn't

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.480
going to be as athletic or as quick as a wrestler, especially a wrestler with shoes.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.640
So it actually comes down to the fact that jujitsu people just on the average,

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.560
even at the top level are not good at shooting.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:02.960
I think so.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.120
Yeah.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.680
I think obviously, I mean, all the wrestlers in American stuff, they're

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.160
starting super early, super young.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:09.880
You know what I mean?

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.160
They're, they've, by the time they get to the same age we are really, uh, in

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.480
our sport and stuff, they've spent much longer doing the actual sport and

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.080
the average jujitsu guy.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.480
And then there's another level of wrestling, of course, with the, with

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.880
the Soviet block that just was unachievable for your kind.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.440
Who knew an Australian rugby, a former rugby player.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.520
Rugby is that kind of like American football, but much less money.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.240
Is that what that is?

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.040
Much less money, much tougher, I would say.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:47.000
But who knew that the cure to the Dagestani wrestling were the Aussies?

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.160
Were the Aussies?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.200
Uh, okay.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:49.840
Let's go there.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.040
Your, your friend, your training partner, Alexander Volkonovsky, you

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.440
helped him prepare for the Islam Makachev versus Volkonovsky fight.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.560
Who do you think, first of all, won that fight?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.720
That's a tricky one.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.280
How is that the tricky question?

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.600
I will say when, when I was in the shit talk you've been doing, how is that the

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.360
tricky question?

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.120
When I was in the corner going into the fifth, I personally believed live that,

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.240
uh, Volkonovsky probably needed a, a finish to take the victory.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.520
But you have to think that way, right?

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.600
In general, or are you like legitimately?

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.280
It's a gray area because the judging.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.120
Who knows?

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.280
Plus I was like, wait, we're in Australia.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.040
Where's this bias?

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.680
You know, we've got some Australian judges here.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.840
I was really hoping we'd get a bit of bias on that.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.240
Unfortunately not.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.440
Hopefully they lose their jobs.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.480
But again, yeah, it was, it was a close fight.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.200
I think sometimes you're blinded in the moment because again, everyone counted

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.600
Volkonovsky out, the crowds behind him.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.320
So everything he does is going to get a huge cheer.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.800
You're biased towards the smaller guy.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.800
You're biased towards the underdog.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.640
So you sort of, whatever the underdog does has a bigger impact in your mind.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.800
And sometimes that can bias as the fight goes along.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.560
But yeah, super, super close fire.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.800
I got, I would really love them to have a rematch.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.000
Uh, but obviously that's going to hold up both divisions.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.400
So I don't know if they'll be able to do it.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.320
Do you think they'll do a rematch soon?

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.040
I mean, that was an, that was an epic fight.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.920
I was listening to the fight companion during, so they biased strongly the opinion.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.760
Round two was the tricky one.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.400
Round two is the tricky one.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.360
Anyway, I'd love to see that like, uh, run it back and do three.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.520
Actually, there's an epic fight.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.880
Uh, what was the brief conversation you had with Islam Makachev and his team?

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.360
I didn't know how we'd take the joke.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.200
Cause obviously it could be tried to flying Eagle kick Dylan

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.200
Dannis in the face, so I wasn't sure how my humor would go.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.600
But I mean, Dylan must've said some worse things to me.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.120
I was just playing around.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.880
I mean, you can't really take anything I say serious, come across like an idiot.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.240
But so when he was coming up to me afterwards, I was like, Oh, I

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.520
don't know what he's going to say.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.120
And again, he, maybe he would have been more upset if he had lost, but he

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.720
just received the judge's decision.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.720
But he came up, I went to check his hand, he gave me a big hug and

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.800
then pretended to throw me.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.000
And then I thought the interaction was over and then he circled back.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:06.920
So that's why I was so awkward.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.760
I was like, Oh, he's coming back.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.720
He wants to say he wants to, he wants something else, but he just said, why

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.840
didn't you teach your boy how to escape the body triangle?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.840
Oh, wow.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.520
Interesting.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040
What did you say to that?

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.200
I said, well, I mean, obviously you've got to learn how to

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.320
finish a really naked joke.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.440
Is that what you said?

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:21.760
No, I didn't.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.560
No, I was laughing.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.120
I was laughing.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.280
But then they ushered us out.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.640
They were like, get out of here before the Aussie crowd attacks here, you know.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.200
What do you think about the body triangle position they were in?

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.720
It seemed like for the first time, it seems almost like Volk was

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.160
dominant in that position, which is kind of weird.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.520
I mean, damage is meant to trump control.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.760
MMA judging damage is the number one.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.040
Do you think the judges saw that?

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.920
Who, what did they score that as?

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.240
I think they all scored four towards Islam.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.920
Three and five, two of the judges scored towards Volk's.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.560
One of the judges scored three for Islam.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.520
One of the, it was 49, 46 for one of them and the other ones were 48, 47.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.120
I think the, again, the confusing round was round two.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.160
I don't think anyone scored the body triangle round for Volk's,

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.000
which I wish they had.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.240
Volkanovsky was and is still arguably

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.840
palm for palm greatest fighter in the world.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.280
How long have you known him?

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280
I don't know the first one.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.960
I met him before he was in the UFC when I used to live in Melbourne.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.320
He came down to train at Absolute.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.760
Yeah. And then we really connected on Ultima fighter.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.200
He, one of these guys who's going to bring told him a fighter,

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.200
Brad Burdell pulled out last second.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.000
So he called me when I was in Puerto Rico and he's like,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.160
do you want to coach on tough for five weeks?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.920
And like I said, Puerto Rico was apocalypse.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.120
Now I was like, yeah, get me out of here.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.080
So I jumped on that opportunity and we were in Vegas five weeks together

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.120
because he was meant to fight Ortega and then he got hit with Covid real bad.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.320
Got stuck in, I think he was in hospital for maybe one to two weeks.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.040
And then before he flew back to Australia, they were like, all right,

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.640
maybe we just do you guys as the ultimate fighter coaches.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.680
So I jumped on board with that.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.200
And that's really when we've become close.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.080
Obviously, I was useful in the Ortega fight, help him get out of submissions.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.560
He fought then Korean zombie, Max Holloway.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.200
I basically just held the bucket at that point in the corner,

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.400
a couple of striking fights.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.480
And then again, yeah, we had to tackle the Islam problem.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.800
So I did spend five to six weeks down there preparing for that.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.760
How did you tackle the Islam problem?

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.840
How do I take was you somebody who barely knows anything about wrestling,

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.080
having to help doesn't take much, you know, especially Russian wrestling.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.040
I did the beard help or like what in all seriousness,

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.960
what were some of the key ideas that you worked on

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.040
with Volkonovsky to prepare for it?

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.440
I had the help of Frank Hickman.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.280
Hickman was down there to one of the Hickman brothers, a wrestling coach.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.320
So we were sort of like problem solving.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.640
I mean, basically we were confident in folks

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.000
fence wrestling, his cage work.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.440
He's super good on the cage, super like

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.480
under respected in that position.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.520
And we knew that if you're able to take the scrambles to the cage,

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.000
he would be effective against Islam, because again,

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.360
Islam is background in Sambo freestyle wrestling.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.560
But I mean, honestly, he's probably got the same experience on the cage as folks.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.960
Obviously, some of those wrestling skills will translate very well to the cage.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.120
But the cage is still somewhat of a gray area and equalizer.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.520
And folks again, incredible ability to stand up, incredible

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.800
defense on the cage, which you saw.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.280
We worked on strategies to get up and a ton of submission defense.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.680
Islam loves Kimura's obviously reenacted from the back.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.360
Ambas, those are sort of in arm triangles, dominant submissions.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.280
But again, the guys he submitted, not grapplers.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.200
Apart from Charles Olivera.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.120
And again, Charles Olivera was basically knocked out at that point.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.600
So I was still impressed if he submitted him.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.400
But again, I always told people this. They thought it was crazy.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.120
I was like Charles Olivera versus Islam in a grappling match.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.840
Olivera is going to win that match.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.800
Like submission grappling, submission grappling.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.920
Yeah. So if you are grappling skill set,

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.840
I think Olivera is a more dangerous grappler.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.240
So we didn't even come into it thinking Islam was this unstoppable bogeyman

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.360
that people make him out to be.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.160
So we approach it from that, just focused on the techniques,

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.360
ability to get back up, using turtle to get back up, using turtle

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.040
to scoot to the cage to get back up and him fighting from there,

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.920
keeping it pretty safe.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.480
But what makes folks so special, I think, is his gas tank, gas tank and his willpower.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.200
He's just unbreakable.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.760
The Dagestani guys, Khabib, Islam,

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.320
they are good at submissions, but they break guys mentally

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.440
and they fatigue him and then they take the submission that's offered.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.840
Olivera is a guy that can jump on submissions

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.200
and have an incredible technical ability to finish those submissions,

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.480
whether you're fresh or you're tired.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.760
And then you combine that with Volkanovsky, who incredible willpower

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.440
never gets tired. You're never going to break him.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.640
And as you saw, he only attempted one submission the whole fight.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.080
Is that learned?

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.360
Is that trained?

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.080
Are you just born with that that mental toughness?

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.640
It's a good question. I mean, he's like an anomaly,

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.600
like the entire fight camp, not nervous at all, supremely confident.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.800
The whole fight week, completely confident.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.360
He just has an attitude like, oh, everyone cast me out.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.040
We'll see. You know what I mean? Islam.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.440
He's like, let's see. No doubt.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.040
No doubt at all.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.280
Super relaxed up until about five minutes before.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.080
And then he starts to amp himself up.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.000
He's like, you are not taking this belt from my family.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.760
Gets into that sort of mindset.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.960
He actually says that out loud.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.200
You can't teach that survival.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.360
He didn't even take a fight, you know.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.400
Have you guys ever been like pushed to the limit like that

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.200
or broken in a grappling match?

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.480
I'll do it in practice.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:45.200
I'll push myself to like, you know, I think my pass out or die or something.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.400
Like, as far as like how tired you get, you know, because like in a match.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.920
They try not to ever get close to that.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.800
Yeah, you try to because, you know, it's important to understand

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.520
where your exhausted, exhausted point is.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.640
But yeah, if you have to push to that limit in a match, you probably do

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.560
doing something wrong, you know, like if you like you see in matches

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.000
where guys sprint the last minute, they try to win the match in last minute.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.800
And it's like you definitely had some mistakes leading up to that.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.680
If you have to, you know, kind of go balls to the wall.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.760
OK, but has there been ever times in competition,

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.880
especially like early on, because you're like you wrestled pretty hard

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.320
and wrestling is pretty exhausting, like not wrestling, but, you know,

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.400
wrestling style kind of thing, going against the best people in the world.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.400
Yeah, I mean, I definitely again, I think I think in practice

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.520
is important to do that hard work that where competition is is much easier.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.360
You know, I think if you if you redline in practice

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.720
and you really push to like death's door,

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.520
then once you're in competition and you're working with, you know,

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:52.160
you're being fresh in a comp, I mean, it's it's much better.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.360
Have you ever been to that thing where Dan Gable talks about

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.480
always wanting to be to a place where you can't get off the mat,

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.560
like you work so hard in the training room, you can't get off the mat.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.320
I think he says he's failed at that in his career.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.000
He was always able to at least crawl off the mat.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.560
Yeah, I definitely never like actually died on the mat,

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.200
but I felt like I felt like I was going to die, you know? Sure. Sure.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.360
What about you? Do you quit all the time?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.400
I get a lot of cramp. I'm like, you know what? You got me, man.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.920
Let's do this again tomorrow.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.720
Yeah, dude, if I'm asking Craig for a role, he's in the bathroom somewhere.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.000
Do you do you see the value of pushing yourself

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.240
like to that place where you're knocking on death's door?

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.440
Yeah, but within safety, you know, because obviously the most serious

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.520
injuries occur when you're tired over training and stuff like that.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.800
So I think like taking a page out of what those MMA fighters do,

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.960
especially Valks with his training, like he's not necessarily pushing crazy

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.880
in each round, but he's doing extra conditioning,

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.800
assault bike stuff, crazy workouts outside.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.400
And he does do some crazy training with us, but all safe, very safe.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.560
But when he's redlining like that in the training room,

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.400
it's a very controlled, safe setting.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.320
I think to do that in jujitsu against some of these lunatics out there

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.800
that are trying to kill you, especially when you have a name, can be dangerous.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.880
So your approach is just is don't warm up and don't try too hard.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160
No, for safety.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.360
No, for safety. Yeah. Longevity.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.760
And talk shit about Russians.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.560
I got it. I got it. I hear you.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.240
Oh, you mentioned cage work.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:27.560
What's interesting to you that you've learned over all this time about cage work?

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.720
What's like what's interesting about the dynamics of that?

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:35.280
Are you talking about both like the control in the dominant position,

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.920
but also getting up from the bottom while you're against the cage? All of that.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.800
The added dimension of that cage, that wall being there changes a lot of stuff.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.520
So obviously, in some ways, it's a much lower impact wrestling style

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.160
because you can't be sprawled on.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.560
You can shoot. The cage is going to block their feet.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.120
You're going to be able to chase down the hips.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.960
It's just a completely different fight.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.520
And again, because of Islam's judo skills, that upper body controls,

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.120
you see he's able to use against the cage, like the inside trips,

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.320
sort of the Uchi Mata style.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.720
All right, go she throws.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.480
So obviously, those skills do translate.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.480
But yeah, I think the cage is a great equalizer

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.520
for a lot of things like athleticism and stuff.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.280
It takes away a huge speed advantage or aspect of the fight.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.080
So he's really good at staying up.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.360
What is there?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.000
I assume he learned all that from you and your instructional just stand up.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.680
I mean, we were so confident.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.800
I was like, you know what?

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.320
Why don't we put this thing out a month before the fight? Yeah.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.400
Maybe the illegal download hasn't made its way to Russia yet. Yeah.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.160
But it was there for him.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.520
Can you can you explain to me what's in the instructional just stand up?

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.720
Like, what are the what are the ideas?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.160
I mean, the old school way to stand up, people talk about the technical get up,

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.680
you know, the old Gracie put the hand.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.280
But I mean, that's that doesn't work.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.240
Hasn't worked for 20 years.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.080
You know, if you look at everyone that gets up in MMA,

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.640
they're using turtle to get up.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.880
They're using wrestling to get up.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.680
You know what I mean? Yeah.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.640
Which is counter to what pure Jiu Jitsu says.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.920
They say don't expose the back.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.080
Don't ever expose your back.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.520
I think Jiu Jitsu is a terrible way to get back to the feet,

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.960
because if you were to retain guard and go half guard or closed guard,

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.760
super hard positions to get up.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.120
You're basically putting yourself in a leg tuck for wrestling.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.800
So I think you need to borrow from wrestling to learn how to get up in an MMA fire.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.680
So basically how to safely expose your own back

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.520
while not allowing them to get hooks and use that to get back up,

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.040
or at least not allow them to get to hooks.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.760
And that applies for MMA, especially for MMA, especially because obviously

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.400
striking is a factor.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.720
But if they are striking, they don't have locked hands around your body.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.800
Means you are able to move.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.640
You are able to make an attempt to get back up.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.680
They have to choose between control, submission or strikes.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:46.640
Post from Reddit.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.640
Why does Craig Jones push so hard for a bottom is bad Jiu Jitsu?

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.960
What is so bad about playing bottom guard, such as half guard or Delahue?

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600
Those are the two options.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.880
No one likes the bottom.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.080
Why would I want to get up?

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.760
It's the question for all of you.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.600
Is the bottom a bad place to be?

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.160
I mean, the bottom's bad if you don't want that guy on top of you.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.000
That's why I look at it.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.320
You know, that's it sounds like something a cowboy would say.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.520
I don't know if there's much meaning.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.760
I think the point of Jiu Jitsu is both are dangerous being on bottom and on top.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.960
I think the longer the match is, probably favorites the top guy more

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.520
because every movement the bottom guy makes is probably carrying your

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.680
your weight, carrying that gravity on top of you.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.080
So I think it's a bit more efficient

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.280
passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom bottoms.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.480
Reactive top is active.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.320
The top player decides how to engage, how to approach the guy

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.440
that can use angles, they can use footwork, they can throw people

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.800
throw the legs by.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.080
So it's an active position.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.680
Bottoms reactive, reactive.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.160
You're going to get fatigued.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.680
Yeah, I think I think it's very difficult to gas somebody out while playing guard.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.240
But I think it's very easy to gas somebody out when attempting to pass it.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.680
Well, you guys are talking about gassing people out, but is there more

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.800
dangerous from the bottom, like in terms of submissions

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.240
and all that kind of stuff for now?

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.640
I'm back and forth because I'm a top, I'm a top player.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.080
But I understand the value of being on bottom.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.960
Like when I do play guard bottom, I feel like the submissions come much easier.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.480
And when I'm on top, they come also pretty easy.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.600
But maybe I just take a different route.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.400
Two cowboys talking about you.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.160
Top on the straights, bottom in the shades.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.520
What was the hardest part of the training for the training camp

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.520
for Volconovsky, like you just experiencing world class

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.720
MMA fighters training and giving you approach of to just of not trying

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.440
to harden no matter what? Yeah, I mean, from my perspective,

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.080
there's a lot of pressure for that.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.920
You know, like that's a that's that's a lot of pressure for me to go in

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.480
and think that I could possibly figure out a way to help this guy

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.000
address this guy that's basically never been beaten.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I think you got knocked out once, but basically not really even

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.720
been put in bad positions.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.840
You know what I mean? That's a lot of pressure on me, especially because

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160
Volconovsky such a great guy.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.560
Yeah. Jiu-jitsu is different.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.240
You know, like you coach a guy who loses.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.680
He has time to tap.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.040
But in MMA, you could get severely hurt.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.640
There's a lot more weight in what you need to do as a coach.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.920
You have a greater sense of responsibility to their health and well-being.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.920
You know, like, obviously, I know Fox Kids.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.520
I know his wife. You know what I mean?

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.560
They're putting faith in you to not just win the fight,

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.920
but keep this man safe.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.240
You know, so from my perspective, a hell of a lot more pressure

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.480
coaching him as an MMA fighter.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.920
So almost like the psychological aspect of like

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.560
of doing the best you can for him.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.760
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.680
What was what was the hardest about the actual training?

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.800
Was it the technical aspect of trying to figure out the puzzle of Islam?

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.080
Or was it like being a good training partner in the in the in the

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.520
like in figuring out how the grappling would work?

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.320
Basically playing your best impression of Makachev.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.000
Were you trying to actually impersonate him?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.760
Like not just visually, but like in style.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.440
Yeah, definitely, definitely visually.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.440
You're not as good looking, but go ahead.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.800
A little taller, but not in terms of the training.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.200
Yeah, I mean, Islam is known as incredibly strong guys.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.720
Obviously, I'm heavier than Islam.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.400
So theoretically, I should be able to replicate that strength difference.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:24.120
And then in terms of grappling, targeting those submissions that Islam does,

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.120
like focusing on those in the training room, focusing on the way he holds half guard

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.960
and really in the grappling sense, trying to replicate him on the ground.

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.400
And then, yeah, I wrestled with him on the wall a ton.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.720
Trying to replicate, obviously, to the best of my ability, a lot of the stuff

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.880
he does on the wall, body lock, heavy inside trip, Uchi Matas

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.320
and just constantly put in the work on Vox.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:45.760
You know what I mean?

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.840
Like constantly chaining attacks against him, really replicate

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.000
as he's trying to get up and escape and all that kind of stuff.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.080
So submissions like both judo and submissions, just attacking and attacking.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.800
Exactly. There's only so much you can do, really, because obviously he's been

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.760
I think he's been fighting a long time.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.800
So it's like you're trying to polish what he already is good at.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.280
You can't just completely create an entirely new game for him

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.120
in the space of six weeks.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.960
So you're trying to take what he's already effective at, add to it.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.520
And luckily, a lot of the stuff he's already very good at

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.000
was easy to add to for the for the fight.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.160
Question from Reddit.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.280
I'm very curious why other MMA fighters don't employ high profile

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.240
grapplers from B team and New Wave to improve their grappling.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240
That's from the subreddit.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.760
By now, it's clear that they are levels above almost everyone in MMA,

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.600
simply because fighters there don't specialize in grappling.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.720
But it doesn't seem like fighters, even champions, get training partners

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.920
from the most successful teams.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.360
Why is that the case?

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.480
From your experience, why doesn't could be call you?

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.840
You might now.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.320
He put in a good word for me.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.320
Oh, I will.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.480
That's right. He takes a joke pretty well.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.240
Yeah. No, no, you'll be walking with open arms.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.240
I think your average Jiu-Jitsu coach, MMA fighters have bad experience

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.000
with Jiu-Jitsu guys.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Jiu-Jitsu doesn't have a massive place in MMA, obviously rounds, standups.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.960
It's hard, hard to submit people.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.640
Your average Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt doesn't know anything

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.880
about holding a guy down, doesn't know anything about how to stand up.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.680
So I think if you overly utilize that Jiu-Jitsu guy

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.400
that hasn't had experience in more modern no-gi or training MMA fighters

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.720
previously, it's going to be a complete waste of time to him.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.920
I think they're smart enough to realize that.

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.080
Do you have and do you guys do you have interest in MMA at all?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.120
Just not even like, well, certainly just competing yourself,

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.840
but like just understanding the puzzle of MMA.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:51.040
Yeah, I mean, I've been a fan of mixed martial arts, you know,

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.280
for a very long time before I trained Jiu-Jitsu.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.920
Personally, personally, I'd much rather coach than fight.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.840
But I mean, I'd fight somebody for, you know, a good check

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.760
and I get to pick the opponent and have a proper camp.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.520
OK. I can think of a good opponent.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.960
Who's that? All right.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.640
Who do you think is the greatest MMA fighter of all time?

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.800
Craig, we can start with you just as a fan of the sport

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.920
as somebody who's been deep in it.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.360
I mean, from my perspective, after that performance,

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:30.400
I'm going to say Volkanovsky because he was able to decisively outstrike

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.440
Max Holloway, one of the greatest strikers in the sport,

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.320
and he was able to hang with the wrestling of Islam Akhachev.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.960
And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega,

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.040
who has some of the most dangerous missions in Jiu-Jitsu.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.080
So I think, in my opinion, technically, he's the best.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.280
So even though even though he technically lost, he still he still has the crown.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.360
I believe so, given the size difference, given he's moving up in weight.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.320
Yeah. I think all those factors, really.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.880
The underdog, everything, the pressure.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:02.040
Did you think he would be able to hang in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam?

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.080
No, no, no. I was really surprised.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.720
That's why my eyes like.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.080
It's kind of funny, like winning at the end of the day,

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.240
I feel like judges influence that, although I did think Australian judges

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.480
would rob the other way.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.720
But I was assuming they kind of somebody paid somebody and not enough, maybe.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.560
But but in general, I just thought he won sort of in the eyes

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.280
of what martial arts stands for, like sort of go into the fire

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.120
and survive and thrive and finish the last round strong,

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.880
which is kind of like spiritually is what a victory is.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:40.200
So I wish we kept going like one more round.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.920
Yeah, exactly. That kind of thing.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.640
Well, what about you?

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.000
What do you think? Like, who are the fighters you admire?

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.800
Like, who do you think is the greatest of all time?

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.400
I think the fighter I paid most attention to was John Jones.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.080
You know, he has a great ability just to mix the high level

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:01.480
striking, high level grappling, although his, you know, jujitsu by itself

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.840
isn't, you know, probably isn't like, you know, super high level.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.480
But his ability to mix everything together, I would say he's he's the best.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.920
And he's a fellow, you know, heavier guy, heavyweight now.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.080
So it's nice to see, you know, how those guys move at that weight.

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.280
And a fellow natural athlete.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280
Do I did there?

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.480
All right. What about you, Nicky?

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.960
Yeah, if I had to pick a goat, I would probably have to say Khabib

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.400
just because he was he was undefeated and he had a very, you know, high

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.280
finishing rate, you know, very few of his fights actually went to a decision.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.480
So he just overall, he dominated almost every single opponent he won against.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.720
The dominance.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.040
I mean, we've been joking about it, but Craig, what do you think makes

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.400
the Dagestani fighter so good?

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.520
Like from this small region of the world, so much dominance has come.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:57.360
I mean, obviously the amount of freestyle wrestling champions from that

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:02.560
region, where he puts their wrestling above and beyond the best in all of MMA.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.120
And obviously a lot of even in the Olympics, a lot of champions,

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.560
so I think that skill set combines with them adding effective pin controls

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.080
on the ground and Jiu-Jitsu submissions.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.000
But again, I think it's that hard training.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.600
Those guys like Khabib would maintain that pressure throughout the entire

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.280
fight and break guys down their ability to fatigue guys to a breaking point.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.680
I think it's something they do best.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.160
I wonder what that is.

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.240
What is that technique?

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:27.840
What is that?

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.160
What is it about their upbringing?

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.200
Because it's that just that part of the world.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.640
What were the Satya brothers with on the freestyle wrestling side to all the

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.320
mixed martial arts people, like it must be part of the, the culture also.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.080
They must be doing something.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.720
I don't think I've never, I haven't seen a convincing explanation of why yet.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.400
Of what's specific about their training, what's specific about their

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.440
culture that creates that.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:55.640
Okay.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.480
What do you think about like the flip side?

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.280
Do you admire their training?

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.760
The flip side, do you admire somebody like Conor McGregor, who

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.880
it knows how to create a spectacle?

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.960
You Craig who likes spectacles.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:10.920
Spectacles.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.120
Yeah.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.680
I mean, I really admire early Conor McGregor because I found him absolutely

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.560
hilarious, you know, like I felt like that was peak banter.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.400
I feel like he just took the American world by storm.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.160
Aussie, British, Irish, Kiwis.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:30.520
I believe we have a way better level of banter and attacking each other.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.880
And it's almost too easy to pick on Americans that take themselves very

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.240
seriously.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.760
I mean, I keep believing other parts of the world to the far East of Europe.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.160
You know, but that's the, that's the tricky thing with Conor.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.400
I think he was, I feel like you could have gotten in the same kind of trouble.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.800
Cause the Russians really took everything very seriously.

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.240
They weren't joking around.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:50.000
Yeah.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.120
That's, that's the problem.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:54.600
It's like, it's, it's, it's a bit of, I mean, some things he's definitely

01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:00.000
takes too far, you know, but I felt like early on he had the right balance where

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.040
he wouldn't really cross the line, but he would do, he would do enough.

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.520
He just took it to another level, obviously later in his career.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.040
But I think early on bit of innocent banter, it gets a lot of eyes on the

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.640
sport though.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.640
It's probably by far the most popular combat athlete of all time because of that.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:15.960
Yeah.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.480
I feel like you have to cross the line.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.880
I don't think enough people appreciate like the values he's brought by

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.720
crossing the line.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.440
He's making a sacrifice crossing the line.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.960
That's going to affect him for the rest of his life.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.760
You know, I see.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.280
I don't think so.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.080
I think you can always walk back because I think unlike people might disagree

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:37.440
with this, I well, yeah, I thought he always radiated a respect for the

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.400
opponent, like afterwards and underneath it.

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.760
It felt like the same way you do it.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.600
When I hear you shit talking, I don't see a person who really means it.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.360
I see a person who's having fun with it.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.640
I always saw kind of McGregor the same way.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:53.960
I don't know.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.920
And then, but people took it like extremely seriously, but I saw the

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.040
respect, like the common respect, the martial artists have for each other.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.440
That felt like it was always there.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:08.800
If you don't like that individual, you're going to perceive what they say more

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.400
negatively than if you obviously were.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.160
So I feel like if you like someone, you're going to never think they

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.280
really crossed the line.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:15.880
That's true.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.960
So you're saying I like you.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.160
That's why I'm perceiving your bullshit in a positive light.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.080
Is there, are there people that hate you?

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:29.560
Uh, I mean, some of the family members of our students, people that really

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.800
get to know you all hate you.

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.000
The fans love me.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.120
The friends hate me.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.720
It's a good place to be.

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.880
Keep your enemies close.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:38.800
All right.

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.360
Uh, what do you think is the most important muscle for just as a biceps?

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.880
Oh, uh, I think a strong, I think a strong back, I think back one core

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.800
second and then biceps.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:51.320
Okay.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.560
But do you, do you legitimately think like weightlifting helps the Jetsu?

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.120
It's kind of the discussion under steroids is like the muscle mass and

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.440
strength and power and explosion is all that.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.560
I think sometimes when we're at that upper echelon of competition, there's

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.400
only, there's like little minute battles that you have to win.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.320
And if you're, if you're relatively close in technique, then a lot of

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.280
times a stronger opponent pulls it out.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.320
But it could be also just the limitation, right?

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.760
You hold position too long.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.960
Uh, what about for hobbyists?

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.400
Do you recommend weightlifting?

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.600
Like when you see people in the gym?

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.400
I always recommend weightlifting.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.520
I almost see muscle as the body's armor, right?

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:31.400
The, the more armor you have, the more damage you could kind of take.

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.560
And, you know, maybe recovery is a little bit better.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.240
Um, and I've always seen weightlifting as a means to, uh, stick to my routine.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.720
Like if there's no point in lifting, if you're not eating right.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:41.720
And you're not sleeping, right.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.040
So if you kind of put it all together, then it's, it's beneficial.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.560
What about you guys?

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.680
Do you go, do you go to the gym?

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:53.200
Do you go to the gym elliptical and that butt machine or, uh, yeah, I

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.480
focus on the glutes heavily.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.280
All right.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.400
Uh, what about like, what about the injury prevention and so on?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.680
Um, how do you train to, uh, minimize the risk of injury?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.280
You guys have all been pretty beat up.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.720
You've gotten a major injury with the ACL.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:08.280
Yeah.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.400
Uh, so how do you train to minimize injury?

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.720
Probably not the right guy to ask.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.920
Hey, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.160
Okay.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.480
Can you talk through your injury?

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.200
Like what happened?

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:20.760
Yeah.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.640
So, uh, about one week prior to, uh, this last ADCC, I was, I was wrestling

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.160
with, um, this guy named Kenta who was also competing and, uh, I went to go

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.000
lift him from like a rear body lock and he hooked the outside of my leg and

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.920
we just felt something pop, you know, he felt a shift with his, with his leg.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.360
And, uh, when it first happened, it hurt for like the first 30 seconds.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.840
And then I honestly debated.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.360
I was like, maybe it was just, you know, some freak thing.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.880
I was like, I literally thought about continuing the session.

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.920
Uh, then the next day I woke up and it was like super sore.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.920
I was limping around, couldn't, couldn't do a full squat.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.760
Um, so it pretty much killed all of my training for the entire

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.080
week leading up to the event.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.800
So I couldn't train or anything, uh, messed up the cut.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.520
Obviously there's, there's added nerves with that too, you know, when you're

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.960
not in the gym every day leading up to the competition, uh, I went out there.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:17.280
I wasn't really able to pull guard cause I couldn't get, you know, full

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.400
heel to buck connection, um, which is inevitable with playing guard.

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.400
Uh, and I was very, uh, hesitant to shoot as well.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.200
Um, so I came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to, to

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.120
tire, uh, my first opponent out and then mainly look to get to underhooks or

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.520
overhooks and do mostly upper body wrestling.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.480
Uh, in the beginning of the match, I, you know, successfully got to an underhook.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.120
I got to a rear body lock.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.760
Um, he tried to roll and I ended up in top position, um, and side control,

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.760
uh, but it was during the no points period.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.600
And then as the match went on, uh, I gassed out and, uh, eventually he ended

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.480
up, uh, taking me down and then scoring with, uh, with two hooks on the back.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:58.880
So what's the injury?

01:41:59.040 --> 01:41:59.240
Yeah.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.040
So I got an MRI actually after the event.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:02.720
I didn't know.

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.400
Wait, wait, you waited until after the event?

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:05.720
Yeah.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.880
I waited until after it was like knowledge or ignorance is bliss.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:09.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.280
I was like, I honestly, I don't even want to know what's wrong.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.800
I was like, I just go out there and compete.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.800
Um, you know, I knew it was like the, the biggest event, um, to date.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.000
And, uh, I really wanted to do it.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.640
Think about not doing it.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.760
Uh, it was definitely was a thought in my head, especially that, that, uh, the

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.320
day after, you know, it's always the worst day whenever you have like a

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.880
serious injury is the day after.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.920
Uh, and I was like, man, I really can't do a full squat.

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.120
I was like, I don't even know how I'm going to be able to do this.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.800
Uh, it got a bit better over as the, uh, the week went on.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.080
Um, but I was like, man, I, I have to go out there and compete.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.840
I was like, I'm, it'll always be in the back of my mind.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.000
Like, what if, if I ended up pulling out?

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.760
What did you think about this whole?

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.520
I thought it was just being a pussy.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:50.800
Yeah.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.520
Slap him around, just yell at him.

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.720
I don't think we pressured you.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.080
We just say you make your own decision, right?

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.040
We're just like, is that a tricky thing to do?

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.600
Like with a heavily, like, like a serious injury like this?

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.320
Well, we didn't know.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.400
That was the thing we didn't know.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.800
Honestly, initially I thought it was, um, I tore my lateral meniscus.

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.200
Um, but that ended up not being the case.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.040
It ended up being a full ACL tear.

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.600
I was actually super surprised when I got the MRI results.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.840
Um, so yeah, we, we didn't know how bad it actually was.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.280
What do you think of that situation?

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.000
I think, uh, Nikki's a tough kid.

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.080
And, uh, I mean, when you're so close to that competition, you know, there's not

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.560
many, you don't get many opportunities like that to compete in front of, you

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.880
know, 15,000 people.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:39.400
It's like, uh, you know, props to you for pushing through it and getting it.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.480
And man, he had a close match with one of the best grapplers in his weight class.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.560
And it's like, you know, a few adjustments here and there, and especially, uh, you

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:50.520
know, if he was able to train previously leading up to that match, I think

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.200
that he pulls it out.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.160
So some of the things you mentioned is nerves.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.080
So there's extra nerves just because you're underprepared.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:56.520
Yeah.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.160
I mean, you know, you want to go into a competition with, you know, the

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.760
confidence, I did everything that I could leading up to this event.

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:04.040
I trained as much as I could.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.360
And then when an injury prevents that, you start to doubt yourself more.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.240
How do you guys think about injury?

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.000
How do you train, you know, training with the best in the world training to be the

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.680
best in the world and avoiding injury as you've gotten, you tore your bicep.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.040
Yeah.

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:18.320
Yeah.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.840
I tore a bicep, uh, dude, honestly, I, I was, I was a body, uh, body building,

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.080
you know, for like seven years and no lie.

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:27.440
I did.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.680
I trained biceps like most days, like almost that almost every day in those

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.160
seven years, pretty much I injured my, I injured myself.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.240
That's so Jersey, man.

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.840
Anything else or just the buses?

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.720
Just, I mean, uh, yeah, I injured the bicep.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.800
Um, pretty much I, the day before a wrestling practice, I had like a killer

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.080
arm day and by arm day, I just mean training biceps very rigorously getting a

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:57.880
sick pump and, uh, I go to wrestling practice the next day, you know, pretty

01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.040
late, I should have been there.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.560
I didn't get a proper warmup in.

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.360
And the first thing I do is I shake hands and I go to shoot a single leg and

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.760
boom, I just blew my arm out the first movement I did.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.600
So just not being warmed up properly.

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.880
In addition to, you know, having of every vigorous arm day, few hours prior.

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.840
You hear that, you hear that about warmup.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.680
So like, what, what are some lessons about avoiding injury and training?

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.360
I would say number one is, is warming up properly.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.920
Make sure, making sure you're, your body's hot before you do hot stuff.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:29.280
Okay.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.160
Um, and what does warmup look like for you as a jujitsu or non-jujitsu stuff?

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.760
Yeah, just for a warmup in general, I'll do, I'll do something like a, uh, if I'm

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:43.400
talking competition, something like a, um, a jog walk back and forth a few times,

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:47.200
then a sprint jog a few times to get that heart rate, you know, up and down.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.080
And then, uh, I'll grab a partner.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.440
I actually just filmed a DVD, uh, or instructional, uh, specifically

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.640
on the pre-match ritual.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.080
Um, in addition to that, I'll, I'll, you know, grab a partner.

01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.720
I'll drill some, some movements.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.640
Uh, typically I'll drill some bad things.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.160
Like I'll start from bottom, bottom out, bottom side control, workout from there.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:08.240
And in pretty much like 20 minutes in, I'm, I'm hot and I'm ready to go for,

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.080
you know, rounds.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.400
Well, what about you Greg?

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.200
So what, uh, what's, what's the way to avoid injury?

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.440
What's the worst injury you've had?

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.320
What's the worst injury?

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.120
I don't even know.

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.880
I'm pretty good, pretty healthy.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:19.960
Yeah.

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.920
Whenever you, whenever you quit and practice, I'm like, that's a mental

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:22.400
thing.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.880
Has your heart ever been broken?

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.720
Many times, many times.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.680
But, um, there's a thing I notice people to spend the most time warming up.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.600
Often the most injured.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.320
It's a strong correlation.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.680
I can't, you can't argue with science.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.480
I remember training with all of the ties.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.360
All of the ties would have a 60 minute warmup.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:45.800
Yeah.

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.640
Surprise, surprise always injured.

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.200
Yeah.

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.640
Very common.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.080
Yeah.

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:50.880
I find that very common.

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.840
Now I think people, it's how they train.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.920
Like if you, like me, first sign of discomfort, backpedal, you know, push

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:01.760
through that stuff, go too hard, go when you're too tired, you know what I mean?

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.280
Get too emotional in the role.

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.520
I feel like those are the times that I've been hurt where I just like, oh, I

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.520
kind of let this guy get me.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.640
When I have that attitude and try, I believe it's how you train and sort of.

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.040
What does this come from?

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.800
You like, uh, positionally too, like, cause you're training against some killers.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.600
I mean, you're training, you're training, you're training with him and

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.880
going probably pretty hard.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.080
Craig gets a little tired.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.240
He's like, yeah, I'm good for today.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.680
We go once a month with Nikki.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:25.840
Right.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.240
That's it.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.880
And then you quit like 30 seconds and just say, yeah, you know, you got to be

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.800
safe, you know, I like it.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.680
What about you?

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.040
What have you learned from the ACL?

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:37.920
Do rehab.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.280
Yeah.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:38.760
Yeah.

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.400
Rehab definitely would help.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.880
Oh, so you haven't been like, I didn't get surgery.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.600
I didn't do essentially any rehab.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.400
I just have no ACL on my left leg.

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.480
So what's it like having no.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640
You've got two options.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.840
Surgery rehab only.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.440
Nikki goes, I'll do nothing.

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.680
Definitely should pick up on the rehab.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.640
What's it, what's rehab for that look like, like twice a day of doing some

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.400
weird like bands or something.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:08.920
It's good.

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:11.280
He's learned from, he's, he's learned some valuable lessons from

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:12.640
about taking care of his body.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:12.960
Yeah.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.680
What's it like just training with no ACL?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.520
Uh, so at the beginning, it was definitely a little iffy, you know, I

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.560
would have an occasional buckle.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.560
Like I'd just be wrestling with somebody and go to step back and it buckled

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:28.720
backwards a bit, um, but honestly now, like I haven't had a single buckle

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.200
instance in a while, it feels a hundred percent normal when I train, uh, it

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.800
feels better than my other knee, to be honest, like I had, I had my meniscus

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.560
taken out in my right leg and that one gets sore more often than the, the no

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.240
ACL leg.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.080
Okay.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:42.480
All right.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.160
So putting that aside, is there, is there wisdom you've learned from that

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:47.720
experience?

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.360
Yeah, uh, definitely should be doing rehab and, and pre-hab.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360
You know, I think that, you know, especially if you're a hobbyist or, or,

01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.040
or a professional athlete, um, you should be lifting, um, you know, whether

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.920
you're rehabbing an injury or just for injury prevention.

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.240
So I'm actually closer to, uh, correct.

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:11.120
Cause I, I've trained my whole life, like pretty hard, obviously just a hobbyist,

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.160
but like twice a day, the judo wrestling, all that never broke anything, never

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:22.160
injured, kind of like similar philosophy, except like last year, I guess a year

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.480
and a half ago, I got a tiny like groin pool injury and it still hasn't healed.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:32.800
And I've been using your approach of not giving a shit and like, all right,

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.120
surely this is going to heal.

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.720
It'd be fine, but it hasn't.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.200
Of course, if I was like an actual athlete, I would like probably still

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.360
train through it and just fuck it, figure it out.

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.280
But when you have other stuff going on, you just kind of wait it out.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.080
But now I think probably rehab, especially as you get older, you

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.160
have to do that kind of stuff.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:52.920
I think it's important for people to, you know, determine whether they're,

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.120
what they're going through is an injury or they're just hurt a little bit.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.160
Cause injury, you know, for sure take time rehabbing and get better.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.000
But a lot of people like those stubble toe or something like, oh, you're

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.040
out for a few weeks, you know?

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.400
So that's, that's the problem with the injury I have.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.080
It feels like a stubbed toe.

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.760
So I was like, I'll just wait a couple of days.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.400
It'll be fine.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.200
And then a couple of days later, it's not fine.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:16.640
And you wait and then I never got an MRI, never got any of that.

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.200
It's like, I'm sure I'll be, it'd be fine.

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:19.160
Yeah.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.400
So it's hard to know sometimes like what it's hard to know.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.040
I feel like a lot of people will just not check it out.

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:28.720
I'll be fine.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.280
Well, cause there's several failure cases.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.520
There is a failure case of where everything is a stubbed toe.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.280
You're like, fuck it.

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.480
I'm like, like you're bleeding everywhere.

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.160
Yeah, that's fine.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:39.680
Whatever.

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:41.280
Uh, so you have to be careful.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.240
A lot, a lot of, a lot of people can fall into that too.

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.560
I think I'm in that category.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.320
Go to the doctor.

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.320
Why do you go to the doctor?

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.280
Your best approach is typically wait until something else gets hurt so

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.440
that you'll forget about the grain.

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:55.120
That's yeah, exactly.

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.080
That's all I was hoping.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.400
I was hoping to get hurt.

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.120
Waiting for the, for the broken heart, maybe.

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:01.560
Okay.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.120
That was very helpful.

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:08.160
Oh, you mentioned you're doing a whole thing on the pre-match ritual.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.360
Can you kind of preview like what kind of what's involved in your pre-match ritual?

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:15.240
It's a pretty big in the wrestling culture and the fighting culture, like

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.880
kind of what, what to do before your competition.

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:21.200
But, uh, I think a few of our, a few people are just kind of missing out

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.800
exactly, you know, what to do.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.200
So I bring it down for them.

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.840
I bring it down to people like, uh, four weeks in advance, um, how, how

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.320
you're, you should prep, you know, your training and your nutrition and

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.040
your sleep for competition.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.680
Um, in addition to that, I break it down even like, uh, to a smaller

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:43.040
scale of like what, how, how early you should get to the event, um, uh, when

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.640
you're, when you should be visualizing, you know, your competition, uh, what

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.600
to do, like, you know, 30 minutes before 20 minutes, 10 minutes, five minutes.

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.040
And the kind of mentality you should have throughout those, uh, those

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.960
times before you actually step onto the mat.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.040
When are you visualizing?

01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:59.080
Like how much are you visualizing the action?

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.480
When you say competition, you talking about the tournament or the actual

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.840
people you might be competing against?

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:04.960
A little bit of both.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.120
I'll spend time, uh, just visualizing the crowd.

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:11.240
Like if, if it's going to be, you know, an arena with 15,000 people, I'll spend

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:15.760
time in practice and whatnot, like putting myself inside that arena and visualizing,

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.040
you know, stepping on the mat and hearing the, hearing the crowd scream and whatnot.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.920
That way, you know, when competition time comes, it's kind of the same deal.

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:23.760
I'm accustomed to it.

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.640
In addition, when I get to the arena, I'll step on the mat.

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.000
I'll kind of look at everything.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:31.480
I'll expose my senses to, to what it's going to be.

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.160
And then I'll kind of shut everything off.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.840
Like a lot, some people, you know, scroll through their phone and can treat, treat

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.880
it like normal, have this normal conversations for me.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:43.600
I like to limit my sensory input, my sensory intake before I go out and compete.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.960
I just feel like sometimes, I feel like sometimes we only have so many

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.440
decisions, you can make it a day.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.520
And I want all of my best decisions to be made when it matters, when it counts.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.320
Oh, what about you?

01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.160
What's, do you, uh, limit your sensory input on game day?

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.240
Honestly, no routine, nothing.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.520
Hey, I don't know.

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:05.680
Yeah.

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:06.320
I don't do anything.

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.280
I'm just like, this guy's a double silver.

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:11.480
You should get it.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.760
You should buy as a structural.

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.680
I'll get another silver now.

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.440
Honestly, nothing.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.680
Hey, I just try to relax, treat it like it's before training.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:24.040
Have a visualizations or no, no, no visualization.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.760
So the opposite of visualization, you just avoid it.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.320
Yeah.

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:28.640
Yeah.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:29.480
I don't even think about it.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.840
I'm just like, yeah, we'll have a good time, you know, try to

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.280
appreciate it, that I can do it.

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:37.080
By the way, when you visualize, are you visualizing tough positions

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.480
or you visualize winning mostly?

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.800
Uh, definitely visualize winning.

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.000
I visualize how I can get, how I'm going to get to my, uh, most dominant positions.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.200
Cause you know, in comp, I want to do what I'm best at.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.240
And I'm also see, uh, I see my opponent in his best positions and how I'm

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.000
going to escape those if necessary.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.120
But most of the time I'm just visualizing exactly what I'm

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.080
going to do in that match.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.320
And I go out there and do it.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:58.240
Okay.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:03.440
So what had, when, when your teammate Craig is, you know, another like

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:07.120
world-class athlete has a fundamentally different philosophy than you.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.600
Do you visualize being frustrated at him?

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:14.280
Not frustrated, but I'll definitely come into practice with like solutions

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.920
to problems that Craig gives me.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.200
You know, like if Craig's, Craig's, uh, you know, catching me at

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.400
something or giving me issues, like, you know, I'll go home.

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.720
I'll, I'll watch a match that he lost for motivation and I'll come back

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.160
and I'll, I'll put it on.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.760
Just DM him, like a highlight reel of him losing.

01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:32.480
Uh, what about you?

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.000
Like, does it, does it affect you that you're a bit of an outlier?

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.040
Usually before I compete, right before I go out there, I go, why am I doing this?

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:41.880
Do I still need to do this?

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.800
And I think hopefully don't embarrass myself affects my instructional sales.

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:50.080
That's the last thought, but I don't even put too much thought into the

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.960
whole competing thing.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.640
I'm just like, you know what?

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.360
Train hard.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:54.920
Hopefully have a good time out there.

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.000
What about the motivation aspect?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.360
Like that, that voice that says like, why am I doing this?

01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.120
That voice can break a lot of people.

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.280
Like in the weight cut, it can break a lot of people.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.280
Like, why am I doing this stupid, silly sport?

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.760
Like you said, a bunch of Jews just rolling around.

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.560
Like, what's the point?

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.160
I'll call someone with a nine to five job and I'll be like, yeah, that's

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.680
why I'm doing this, you know, avoid that.

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:14.880
Sure.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.200
Sell those DVDs, man.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:16.720
Yeah.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.000
I didn't get too deep on competing.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.520
Yeah.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.680
We're so polar opposite.

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.000
It's like almost uncomfortable to be around you.

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.680
Obviously one of us is a clean athlete.

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.480
You should do a DVD on that.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.280
What, what, what about you in terms of preparing for competition, Nicky?

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.080
The, the day before the day of, are there rituals that you follow?

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.480
Honestly, like the few days leading up to it, uh, it's different for me every time.

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.280
Um, like sometimes I'll warm up before the, I compete.

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.320
Sometimes I won't, sometimes I'll fast, sometimes I'll eat.

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:55.120
So it literally is just completely random.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.280
I don't follow any specific thing.

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.120
Um, but in the training room, leading up to the competition, I'll definitely, you

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.840
know, like Nicky Rod visualized that I'm walking out onto the competition mats.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.360
You know, I'll pick somebody that's, you know, a similar body type to the person

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.800
that I'm competing against and then, you know, we'll start out, uh, with some

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.720
distance between us, we'll come out, smack hands and, you know, act like

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.120
everything's a real competition.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.720
I'll even sometimes have, you know, corners that will yell out times and

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:23.440
things like that, just to replicate it as much as possible.

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:27.400
It's funny because I've talked to a lot of Olympic gold medalists.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.560
They used to do a podcast with like athletes and they all sound like Nicky Rod.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.880
The two of you are outliers.

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.480
I don't know.

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.960
Sometimes I'll do this sometimes.

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:39.200
So anyway, but that's also just a culture.

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.680
I think, uh, maybe the chaos of not taking things too serious is

01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.880
actually really, really helpful.

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.440
Sometimes the pressure of taking everything way too seriously can break you.

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.960
I mean, it's just, I think it's that biggest sport really, you know, I think

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.080
if I compete every day in practice, it just makes competition much easier.

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.000
So I just put the pressure on there on the competition area, on the, sorry, on

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.600
the training, uh, uh, competing in the training, I don't know, Olympic sports

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:06.440
aren't that big either financially and people take it extremely, extremely

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.320
seriously, like you don't really get, get that much money from judo.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:12.520
I mean, I just don't take it seriously because like, I was just

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.080
partying and having a good time until 21.

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.960
And then I was like, Oh fuck, do I get a job?

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.520
Or do I pursue professional sports?

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.080
And I feel like if I can make a career in jujitsu with a decision at that point.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:26.920
And now you just stumbled your way somehow into like being at the top of the world.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:27.920
Yeah, that's what I feel like.

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:28.800
I just walked into it.

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:31.720
I feel like I couldn't just do that in wrestling, boxing.

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:32.920
I couldn't do that in other sports.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:37.400
What was the toughest match you've ever had that pushed you mentally,

01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.680
physically, technically, this doesn't have to be the best person you face,

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:44.920
but it was there like a moment in your career that was like really.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.720
Uh, defining for you.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.160
I mean, I would say like the toughest mentally was just this, this last ADCC,

01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:57.240
you know, I just had a big injury leading into it that kind of screwed the whole

01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:59.280
camp and, and weight cutting everything up.

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:02.480
Uh, so yeah, I would say, I would say the last ADCC.

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:04.440
Are you proud of your performance there?

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.520
Like you stepped on the mat that you, uh, you pushed through all of it.

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.120
Uh, like I said, I'm a very competitive person and I hate losing.

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:12.760
So definitely not.

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.080
Yeah.

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.280
You had a collapsed lung.

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:25.520
He was so physically exhausted afterwards, couldn't breathe.

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.080
We had to get medical intervention.

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.160
He thought he had a collapsed lung.

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.120
So he goes the most tired that I've ever been in my life in that match.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.240
I actually popped the blood vessel in my eye.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.680
I was trying so hard.

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.840
He comes out, he walks off of them ADCC mat backstage and I'm

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:43.960
like, I'm kind of getting warmed up for my match and Nicky run and come.

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.560
He walks over a huffing and puffing.

01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:47.160
He, his mom's right next to me.

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:47.560
He looks at her.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.400
He was like, I think I need help.

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.800
I think I was called a lung collapse.

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.440
My mom's the one that called for medical.

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.840
I was just laying on the warmup mat, fucking dying.

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.720
Well, we're happy you're fine.

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.120
Late at all on the line.

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.960
Uh, what about you, Craig?

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.000
Defining.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.080
Or toughest matches.

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.000
I mean, they're all pretty tough.

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:14.560
You know, I don't know.

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:16.320
I can't really pinpoint one.

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:19.160
I mean, probably the most annoying one was obviously the one where I had

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.680
Gordon Anamba, I was like, tap, bro.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:21.840
And he wouldn't tap.

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.600
So I let him out mentally.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.760
I was like, I shouldn't have done that.

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.640
Do you ever have a thing in your brain where it says, should I shit talk now or

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.920
not, and you ever, you say, no, I'm going to be respectful.

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.800
I just can't be serious about some of these things.

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:38.920
I don't know.

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.520
It's just silly.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:41.440
All of it, the whole thing.

01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:42.640
Uh, what about you, Nick?

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:49.040
Um, dude, honestly, most of my toughest matches are, are in the

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.520
pride, the training room, right?

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.800
Cause I started with these guys.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.160
I started training under them.

01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:57.480
Like, you know, start training at DDS when I didn't have any knowledge

01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.200
like of, like I knew wrestling.

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:02.960
I knew like a knee cut in jujitsu, but like, I started training with them when

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:07.080
I knew almost no jujitsu and then I had to like, you know, really work my way up.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.560
So definitely in the training room, like being like having one of these guys on

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:14.440
my back or like, there was a stretch of like a few weeks or months when COVID

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:18.040
first hit, and it was just like four of the best grapplers in the world.

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:21.880
And we just did drilling and live rounds with these four guys.

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.720
And it was just, it was, it was hard.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:27.520
It was very hard, you know, every, every round doing six rounds, seven days a

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.240
week with the best grapplers in the world.

02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:32.120
And it's like, you get no break and you're forced to learn on the go.

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:36.280
So I think for me in the training room, that was definitely my, my toughest

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:39.000
matches and that's where I built, you know, those mental calluses.

02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:43.880
There was a period where I, I drew with Nicky Rod, probably what nine months,

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:47.040
12 months, and typically speaking, like I said, no warmups.

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:48.960
The first round, we should take it pretty easy.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.160
First round, you start in Mount.

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:55.240
The whole room, the rest of the training room, they take Mount very lightly.

02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:59.080
Me and Nicky Rod would be fighting to the death every day.

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.640
I felt like we did an extra round every day.

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.240
It was very grueling.

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.000
I'm very, I'm very mean when I'm in the midst of drilling or, or live, or live.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.400
Like we would do, we would drill wrestling, you know, quite a bit, like stand up.

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.000
And in the drilling, like, I just wouldn't let Craig take me down.

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:16.440
Like we're, we're not going live.

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.880
We're just drilling, but I just wouldn't let him put me on the floor.

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.320
So things like that, you know,

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.280
I know what that's like.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:25.240
Yeah.

02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:28.520
So you mentioned Mount, like, so you do positional training.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:32.440
So is that, would that be the hardest versus like live training, uh, open,

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:33.560
like starting from guard?

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.120
I would say Mount and Turtle definitely, definitely made me very tough because

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.160
you spent all this effort getting off of bottom out and then you got to get on

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:45.040
top of a guy in the, at the time I'm not that good at holding guys down.

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.000
So they escape quick.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.680
And I'm like, fuck, I just tried to hold them down.

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.840
Got to go back down.

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:49.920
Same thing with a turtle.

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:53.280
It's like you, you start bottom turtle, you try and explode, get out, get away.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.960
And then, you know, you switch and this guy gets up, gets up pretty quick.

02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.520
And you're like, damn, I got to go right back down.

02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.680
It was that constant circle, man.

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.880
It's, it's very tough, but definitely, uh, you know, build some character on the

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:04.080
mat.

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:07.600
What do you think is the value of positional training in general in Jiu-Jitsu?

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:11.200
Actually, this one just interacting with you guys, it's not commonly done.

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:13.080
You just like regular Jiu-Jitsu gyms.

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:14.320
What do you see?

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.880
Cause probably it's not commonly done.

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.600
Cause it's so, most of the experience is just frustrating.

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.520
Like if you're evenly matched, you're basically frustrated the whole time.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.640
If you, if you're doing it right,

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.800
it's a psychological battle that happens in like the mountain turtle rounds.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.240
It's like, you know, cause you, maybe you get close to subbing a guy and, or

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.200
maybe you do sub them.

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:36.400
Uh, you know, when you start on turtle and you're on their back, you finish

02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.240
them and then you get this high point.

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.160
And then immediately you got to go back down to defensive posture.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.160
It's very like, it's emotionally like up and down.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.080
It's hard to deal with.

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:45.960
Super important.

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.920
If you're one of the better people in the gym, because it just puts you in

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.600
positions you don't find yourself in, in regular training.

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.760
So I think like a lot of, uh, if you're a big fish in a small pond or you don't

02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.240
do positional sparring, you're probably going to get exposed in competition.

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.840
You might even look silly in those positions.

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.920
So you really have to force yourself to do it.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.400
Despite the fact that you've given someone worse than you, a position

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:07.160
where they might catch you.

02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:09.120
So you have to sort of put the ego aside.

02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.080
Yeah, that's one of the things when I was training regularly, of course,

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.080
training with you guys, it's like trivial, but, uh, I didn't work on, uh,

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.960
putting myself in bad positions when you get better.

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.240
And you regret it because the, the, the big negative thing it has consequence

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.440
it has on competition is you don't take as many risks because you're kind of

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:31.920
afraid for you back to get taken all that kind of stuff.

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.760
That was, that was me before I went to DDS.

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.200
I remember I showed up there in that old position.

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:36.720
I was like, fuck this.

02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.880
You better earn this position.

02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:39.920
Yeah, exactly.

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.680
I didn't really have escapes.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.040
That was a learning curve for me, for sure.

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.800
Uh, do you see the value in positional training or is it just the source

02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:51.560
of tremendous frustration?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.600
Uh, yeah, I definitely, uh, think it plays a big part in, you know, your

02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.160
confidence when you step out onto the, the competition mats, you know, being

02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.360
confident that even if you get put in the worst possible situations, you know

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:04.960
what to do and know how to work out of them.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.880
So I had a long argument with, uh, with Roger Gracie when you visited and he

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.840
thinks Mount is the most dominant position, even Nogi, uh, versus Beck.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.160
Would you, is there a case to be made for that or no?

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:22.120
I think, I think all of your opponent's utensils, their tools are in the front

02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:25.800
of them, so like if you're on Mount, they still have, you know, there's a few

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.840
ways to get out of Mount, I think if you're on somebody's back, I'd personally

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.280
much rather be on somebody's back than.

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:31.480
Flattened out.

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:34.320
I'd rather have someone's back and then flattened out.

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.600
Boots in, flattened out.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.040
Yeah.

02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.240
Boots in, flattened out.

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.280
So not, not even body triangle, but just flattened.

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.280
Just completely flat.

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.800
Almost like the position of a Mayweather, you see guys get finished

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.600
because they can't get out.

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.480
I think that position is probably the hardest position to escape.

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:50.280
Can you see what Hajar's talking about with Mount or is he just that good

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.680
at Mount that he says that?

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:54.040
He might mean the gi, cross collar, you know?

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:54.800
I don't know.

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:55.680
Or did he mean?

02:04:55.680 --> 02:05:00.200
He says controlling wise, he just believes that you can complete, that

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:04.560
there's, he actually thinks there's more ways to get out from the back than

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.440
there is from the Mount.

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.240
Prior to getting up, including like physically, prior to the Kipping escape.

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:14.800
I would probably agree with him, but that Kipping escape is so difficult to manage.

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.040
It's the funny looking escape.

02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:17.880
We legs are wiggling.

02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.560
People have a lot of trouble.

02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:22.920
It's like super hard to learn how to do, but then once you learn how to do it,

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:25.240
the effectiveness is just huge.

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:25.720
Yeah.

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:26.360
It's a weird one.

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:28.160
When did that come to be a thing?

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320
Is that pretty recent?

02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:32.760
I mean, I saw DDS guys using it first, I think.

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:33.960
Yeah.

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.720
Who was the first guy to discover something like that?

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.720
This seems like a ridiculous thing to discover.

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:43.960
I thought it was a joke at first.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:44.920
I was, are you guys really doing this?

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:46.560
All right.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.960
I remember somebody showing me like a tech technique where, uh, like if you just

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.600
like walk your hand on a mat or something like that, maybe an arm triangle or

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:58.640
something, walk the arm on the arm high.

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:00.320
And it's just like a funny discovery.

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:03.680
Like as opposed to like trying to like shove it in, just like walk it.

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:07.840
I like doing that to people, but with things that aren't true, you know what I

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:07.960
mean?

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:12.120
I'll just tell them this is a technique and watch him try to work out if I'm

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:13.000
being serious or not.

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:13.560
Yeah.

02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:15.560
That's what you do when you achieve guru status.

02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.440
They'll just listen to you.

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.480
Like you're Steven Seagal.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:18.800
See what they'll believe.

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:23.840
Speaking of which, how do you balance, you have to travel all across the world.

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.600
How do you balance that with running a school or being a world-class Jiu-Jitsu

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.000
athlete?

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:32.760
Or maybe, I mean, the secrets of travel for me are two, two drugs, Xanax and

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:33.280
Modafinil.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.640
That's how we time adjust and we hit the ground running.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.680
But what does Modafinil do?

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.560
Xanax puts you to sleep.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.040
Yeah.

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:42.440
I mean, I have narcolepsies.

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.480
It's a narcolepsy medication.

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:50.080
How does that work with the stairways?

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.240
I mean, they work well together, you know?

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:52.840
Yeah.

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.000
Focused and physical recovery.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:58.480
But in terms of traveling and training stuff, it is, I mean, we're lucky because

02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.880
we've got so many high-level guys.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.240
So we can travel and they're still in good hands.

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.360
I mean, there will be a problem if me, Nikki Ryder, Nikki Ryan left and the

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:07.960
gym had Ethan, that would be a problem.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.840
But we've got to make sure it's not just him there.

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.600
Although everyone says they're happy when you're gone.

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:16.000
So that's the moment I heard.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.800
Happy when I'm gone, but they do miss me for sure until I get back.

02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:21.600
All right.

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:24.160
What about, what about you just like balancing it?

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:27.160
Do you try to stay completely focused on competing, like for some of the big

02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.000
matches you have coming up, are you able to kind of diversify?

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:35.400
Well, I like to diversify my training to where, you know, if I don't have a

02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:38.640
competition scheduled, I'm more focused on skill development and, you know,

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:41.760
getting better and broadening, broadening my tool shed.

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:47.520
But, you know, if I'm like six weeks before comp, I really start amping up

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.000
the intensity that I bring into the mats against bringing some of that

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.400
visualization towards practice.

02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:59.320
And maybe I train less volume pre-competition, but higher output per session.

02:07:59.720 --> 02:07:59.880
Yeah.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.440
What is, what's the perfect week of training look like?

02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:07.120
If I'm not in, if I'm not in competition mode, I would say Monday, Wednesday,

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:09.600
Friday, twice every other day, just once.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:14.000
Uh, if I'm pre-comp, just Monday, Monday to Sunday, once a day.

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.000
So that's on the mat.

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.440
You're doing the full like positional training, live training.

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:19.640
Bicep curls.

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:20.520
Oh yeah.

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:21.720
I do a lot of bicep curls.

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:22.160
Yeah.

02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:23.720
I lift a few times a week now.

02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:24.280
Yeah.

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:24.640
Yeah.

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:26.400
Cardio or no cardio is all math.

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.800
Cardio is all math stuff.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.720
I do, I do do some CrossFit workouts, like CrossFits.

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:35.080
I'll do like some EMOMS or some AMRABS or CrossFit, you know, terms.

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.040
That's for Instagram.

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:36.720
Yeah.

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.240
Um, but, uh, yeah, CrossFit is, uh, is a good way to, um, kind of like

02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.120
push that, that threshold sometimes on the mat, cause I'm, I'm so good.

02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.760
I can't always get that, that like full red line.

02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.280
So I hop in across the gym and I'll do some workouts that, uh, you

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:54.840
know, bring me closer to death.

02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:58.560
Uh, what, what about you, Craig?

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:01.120
What, what is a perfect week in training?

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.280
What's like, like when you're back home training?

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.840
I try to be in the gym twice a day, every day when I'm back, just

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:09.160
cause I travel a bit more than, uh, these guys.

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:12.080
So I try to be there eight and 12 every day, hang out in between.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.160
Uh, usually definitely, usually train both of those sessions,

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.400
depending on how my body feels.

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.960
So doing positional, doing everything, technique, positional, live.

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.440
I should probably do more positional, but cause I'm just trying to

02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.560
work on wrestling and stuff.

02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.480
And especially leading up to the Volkanovsky's last fight, I was

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:30.880
trying to wrestle more and focus on those areas even before I traveled

02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.240
over that, just some experimentation with some stuff, but yeah.

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:34.760
Yeah.

02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:36.160
How do you, how do you experiment with stuff?

02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:38.680
Like, how do you, so there's like regular positional stuff, but when

02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.920
you have ideas, like what, like where do you do it in during the training

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.800
sessions to do it outside of that and you get to get together with somebody.

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.600
Usually every session I show up with something I'm thinking of, usually

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:55.400
something from top, maybe something from bottom, but, and then I just try

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.120
to maybe pick the right people.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.600
Some people obviously I'm just fighting to the death with it's

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.040
not a good time to experiment.

02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.240
And then others, obviously you can, you can play around with ideas on.

02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:07.120
Okay.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:08.080
Uh, what about you?

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:10.080
Uh, what's a perfect week look like?

02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.200
Uh, maybe, well, you said you're a hundred percent now.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:13.920
Yeah.

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.360
Um, so yeah, honestly, I have pretty much the same schedule as Nicky Rod.

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.880
So Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do twice a day, uh, every other day, once a day.

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.600
And then, uh, normally, uh, noon practice is like our biggest class.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.320
That's where, you know, all the pros go in.

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:28.600
So I tend to do more open rounds there.

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:31.880
And then we have a 7pm class as well, which is more hobbyist.

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.040
Uh, and that's where I'll do my positional rounds and, you know, force

02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.360
myself to be put in a bad positions.

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.480
So you have a, what you do 8am, 12, like in terms of what B team has

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:47.640
8am, 12, 7pm and the hobbyists are more 7pm.

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:48.120
Yes.

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:49.080
Okay.

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.040
Do you believe in overtraining?

02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.680
Do you think you can overtrain?

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:57.320
I used to not believe in it, but then I got hurt.

02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:01.920
Oh, you attribute that to overtraining the bicep?

02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:04.000
I think, uh, dude, I'm telling you, I train.

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.120
I lifted like a bodybuilder for like seven years and by lifting, I mean, I

02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:14.280
was lifting seven days a week and I train arms most days, like almost, almost

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.800
every day I would do like, you know, four or five sets and get a, get a pretty good

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:20.640
bicep pump in addition to my lift.

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:26.320
I think I had to contribute somewhat towards, towards my, uh, fair enough.

02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:29.520
Well, what about on the actual mat overtraining, like spending too much

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.680
time on the mat, psychological, physical overtraining?

02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.920
I think you can definitely overtrain, but it's more of a, like, as your body's

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.680
healthy, you have to make sure your mind is sharp, like sometimes, uh, maybe

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.800
taking a day away or even, even diverting your attention in a different aspect of

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.600
training can help you be a little bit sharper overall.

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.680
Sometimes it can be like, uh, I can get a little like, um, stagnant cause you're

02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.000
doing the same stuff over and over.

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.680
But I think if you just keep like, you know, overtraining, then your overall

02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.760
baseline just gets higher and you become, you become, you know, accustomed to that.

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.400
Uh, what about you?

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.040
You don't seem like a guy that overdrew.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:08.640
I've heard of it.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:10.320
Never been close to it.

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.200
No, I think, uh, controlling, uh, how hard you train is definitely

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:17.080
protects you from injury.

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:17.760
You know what I mean?

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.360
Like if you're redlining yourself and then you fight into the death in the

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.040
gym, that's a hundred percent when you're going to get injured, going to get sick.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.640
So I try to make sure I've, I've had enough sleep.

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:32.480
I've had obviously enough food post-training and that sort of helps me to

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.360
train a bit harder, but still try to avoid redlining myself too much.

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.600
I think established also like what days are going to be your peak days.

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:42.800
Cause you're, you're, you throughout the week, if you're training seven days a

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.200
week, you're going to have ups and downs.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.600
Like for me personally, when they Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, usually my best days.

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.400
And besides that also have other great days.

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:54.280
All my days are great.

02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:58.280
But Monday, Wednesday, Friday are also great.

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:03.360
You're like, I'm able to that some days are offered another.

02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.720
I'm always on bro.

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:07.480
Okay.

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:12.480
Uh, what advice would you give to people who are not always on, uh, hobbyists,

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.560
how to get better?

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:15.800
Like people that are already there.

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:16.120
I don't know.

02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:17.960
Purple bells, brown bells, blackwells.

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:20.760
There's just like doing like a couple of times a week or something

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.000
like that, like how to get better.

02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.880
I think, uh, being consistent, like find a schedule that you can consistently train.

02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.640
Maybe it's like, you know, three, four times a week, or even a little bit less,

02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:33.040
just be consistent over the, over the years.

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.120
I think too, too often people are like, Oh, I want to get really good, really fast.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.960
And it's like, definitely takes a long time to get to where you want to be.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.160
What about the, what you're doing during, like while being consistent,

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.240
what kind of stuff you're working on?

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:48.840
So honestly, I think one big thing, uh, for me, which is something I actually

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.840
started doing once, once B team was formed was, uh, filming all of your

02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.440
rounds, uh, and then watching it every day.

02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:00.040
Uh, cause then you can see what specific problems you're having and then you can

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:02.480
base your positional rounds around those problems.

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.560
That's really interesting.

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:05.800
It's kind of depressing though.

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.600
Like sometimes I have to, you know, add, I edited this podcast for a long time.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:15.600
I still do in part, and I hate the sound of my voice and like what I look like.

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:17.240
It's tough, but it does make you better.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:18.240
Yeah.

02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.640
And I also hate the sound of Craig's voice.

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.280
This would be doubly difficult.

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.960
Um, but I'm glad, glad the rest of you are here.

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:29.400
I don't know.

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:34.280
Do you, what do you watch competition footage of yourself?

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:42.400
Um, like to analyze, like my confidence while you're doing curls.

02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:44.680
I'm trying not to watch it to lose my confidence.

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:48.960
Is there advice you, Craig, you would give for hobbyists to get better?

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.840
I mean, just, uh, not every round has to be a fight to the death.

02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:57.000
You know, I feel like you're going to get injured, but it's out that way.

02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:58.680
You know, kind of learn as much.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:14:59.600
It's tough.

02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:04.400
I would say just as a black belt who took Jesus very seriously for a very long time.

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:11.080
Basically when you become a hobbyist, your skill is basically slipping your

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:12.480
age and your skill.

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.840
And so not taking stuff seriously is actually its own psychological skill of

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:23.000
like, you're that it's tough.

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:23.680
It's tough.

02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.920
Like it's, it's tough in a way that, uh, is different when you're like a blue

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.040
belt or something that you're, if you work hard and you train correctly, you're

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.040
going to get much better here.

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:40.600
You're kind of, you're looking downhill downhill and you're like, yeah, I guess

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:42.160
I'm going to enjoy the art of it.

02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:43.520
Reframe the victory.

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.240
You know, like if it's a young upcoming guy and he comes to me, you're like,

02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:48.480
well, that's a, that's a moral victory, you know?

02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:48.960
Yeah.

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:50.520
But then that has to happen.

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.800
You have to be able to not do that to avoid the injury sometimes.

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:54.440
Like if you want.

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:57.160
So yeah, it's a different, it's a different thing.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:04.160
Plus, plus with me, just because some people recognize me, they, you have that

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.720
probably, you guys definitely obviously have that.

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:07.680
I've solved that problem.

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:09.920
What, how did you solve that problem?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.960
Travel around and you do a seminar, anything like that.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:12.280
Yeah.

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.120
It's believable that you could get submitted once, but if they catch it, give

02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:22.120
them a few, if people tell their friends, they submitted me to seminar one time.

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:22.720
Believable.

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.040
Yeah.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:24.200
They got me four or five times.

02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:25.840
You've robbed them of that.

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:26.440
Okay.

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:32.680
That's pretty funny, but it's also, they have this energy, like they think, you

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.440
know, they're coming in hot and I usually like to, uh, just basically get

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:39.080
submitted quickly twice.

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.120
And just, it changes everything.

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.080
It makes it more fun.

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:44.000
I see.

02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:45.840
I've noticed them submit you twice.

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.120
Yeah.

02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:47.400
Just like very quickly.

02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:49.520
What, like what are the options?

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:53.040
We're not making it last longer.

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:54.360
Hold off.

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.200
But then it's like, it's very hard to like, yeah, if you're a very serious

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:03.280
competitor and so on, you take it seriously, then yes, but like, then people

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.000
go, people, what they try to do, this probably is what happens to you guys.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.520
They try to impress you by going super hard.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.800
I have people every day come to my gym.

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.240
Try to take me out.

02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:13.840
Yeah.

02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:15.440
You gotta, you gotta, I just stay sharp.

02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:17.480
Come to practice.

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:18.440
Let's get it on.

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:21.760
Uh, do you, do you feel that energy?

02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:26.680
Talk to Craig here for a seminar.

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.640
Like somebody is coming in like really hard, like a brown belt will come in

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.520
like, and they really want to impress you with like their technical side of their

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:35.040
big fan, they've been watching your DVDs.

02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:36.120
Like, what do you do with a guy like that?

02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.360
I make a complete joke out of the role, you know, give them the pass,

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.920
mess with them, do stupid shit, you know, like rub them of the realness of it.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:44.560
Cause it's stupid.

02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:46.440
I'm not going to roll hard with strangers.

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:50.280
You know, I feel like you should roll with a circle of people you trust.

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.840
Injuries happen rolling hard with strangers.

02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:55.640
Cause that's the same way you get injured in competition.

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:58.200
Cause you don't have that, uh, relationship with them.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:01.760
And I should also mention that's probably not a good way to impress somebody's

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.600
bug, just going ape shit, go to a hundred percent.

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:05.640
Oh yeah.

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:06.720
That's not, not at all.

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:09.280
I think the, the beauty of jujitsu is like the camaraderie of it.

02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:12.920
Like as you get to know each other, it's like technical, like different

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.080
ideas you have and all that.

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:15.720
Yeah.

02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:16.600
Okay.

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.160
Do you think, uh, Gi jujitsu is dying in popularity, Craig?

02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:22.920
Yeah, it's long dead.

02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:28.280
I think it says, I mean, it just shows like, uh, I mean, I have heard some

02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:31.680
numbers on the viewership for the Gi world's finals and they don't even

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.000
compare to the undercard of like who's number one events.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:36.960
So I think like when I was coming up and competing in the gear all the time,

02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:39.960
you looked at those guys that won black belt championships and you were like

02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.960
in war of them, it almost had that ADCC champion feel, but now that's not the

02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:48.600
case, you know, I just feel like that the younger generation aren't looking at

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:50.040
who's winning black belt, key worlds.

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:53.680
I personally don't think, and I don't think they're like, they want to be that

02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.000
guy, they want to be like a Ritolo Gordon, you know, those are the people

02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:59.080
they want to emulate.

02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:05.360
So you think like the Gi, like IBJJF Gi tournaments will just keep declining

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:06.040
popularity?

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:07.680
Oh, I think people will still do.

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:11.000
I mean, it's easier, I think as you're over 30, cause the Gi is a bit of a

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.240
slower thing and the master's participation is bigger in the Gi.

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.160
Cause obviously you know, Gi is now heading in a wrestling direction,

02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:19.360
wrestling and heel hooks.

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:20.160
You're over 30.

02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:24.560
That's a terrifying prospects, you know, what's terrifying about the Gi less.

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.200
So I think in a participation rate, the IBJJF will still be good, but I just

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.880
don't think people are as interested as they used to be.

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.160
Well, why is wrestling and heel hooks terrifying?

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.560
Like heel hooks, I can vaguely understand if you don't understand heel hooks.

02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:39.120
If you work a desk job and you've never wrestled and a guy double-a's you,

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.720
that's going to probably break your back.

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.320
You know, I think the older guys are scared of wrestling.

02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:45.440
It's hard to wrestle at 40.

02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:47.400
To learn wrestling at 40.

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:47.760
Is it?

02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.000
Yeah.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.360
It's like, yeah, I mean, I think it's even just hard in general to do

02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:53.800
wrestling at 40, but it's easy to pull half guard and the Gi at 40.

02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:57.360
I think it's hard to do Judo at 40 and people still do it at 40.

02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:58.800
Judo hurts more.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:00.640
Judo is scarier than all of them.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:01.520
Yeah.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I think, does wrestling really hurt at 40?

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:05.720
Um, I don't know.

02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:06.680
I don't know why I'm looking at you.

02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:08.720
Yeah, it does.

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.440
Interesting.

02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:12.640
I mean, I feel, I agree with you saying that, uh, Judo looks like the most

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.400
dangerous, like even their, their practice partners, they're just

02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:17.120
getting slammed flat.

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:19.120
Yeah, I did.

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:20.840
I mean, I did Judo for a really long time.

02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:24.320
There's a lot of people that are 40, 50, 60 do Judo and they get.

02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:25.960
They're the ones that are still alive though.

02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:28.720
It's true.

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:30.520
Uh, survivor bias.

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:33.120
You do a little bit of a Judo, right?

02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:34.440
Maybe I'm a yellow belt.

02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:35.960
You're a yellow belt in Judo.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:37.760
I should be an instructor.

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:40.480
Promote you to orange.

02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.240
I got a yellow belt in the sixth grade.

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:43.400
I believe it was the sixth grade.

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.960
I did it for about, I don't know, six months.

02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:50.520
But you're also using, uh, Judo in, uh, competition basically.

02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:51.000
All right.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.760
Aren't you doing like Harai type throw?

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:53.840
Like you're doing, uh,

02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:56.160
I just started doing it.

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:58.560
You just started lifting your leg in various ways until the work.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:20:59.400
Just figuring it out.

02:20:59.400 --> 02:20:59.680
Yeah.

02:20:59.680 --> 02:20:59.920
Okay.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:01.320
Doing different kinds of trips.

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:02.480
I looked at the sand boat guys doing.

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:03.640
I was like, can't be that hard.

02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:04.240
Yeah.

02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:05.000
Gave it a crack.

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:08.560
Well, they, they looked at your foot locks and they said, that can't be that hard.

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.440
They said, can't be that hard.

02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:11.640
Banner from the tournaments.

02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:15.320
All right.

02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:23.480
Uh, what do you think is the best, uh, take down in, uh, Nogi Jiu-Jitsu?

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:28.840
Like what, uh, like if people were trying to train for competition and so on,

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:30.360
like where you see the trends heading.

02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:34.160
I think those foot sweep is like catching a fire nowadays.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:38.080
See a lot of foot sweeps, uh, foot sweeps and arm drags.

02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:40.160
I would say pretty, pretty popular in our sport.

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:41.160
Arm drag.

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.800
She's just got arm drag to the, okay.

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:47.880
Arm drag either to get them like get to, uh, behind them or even just to cause

02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:50.400
reactions, make them pull away and we can start reattacking.

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:54.760
Are you talking about it in a context of what's the best take down to score?

02:21:55.040 --> 02:22:01.080
What's the safest take down to mitigate the risk of guillotine submission or

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:02.200
most effective in general?

02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:02.560
Yeah.

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.360
Most effective combined combined.

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:04.840
Yeah.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:05.320
Yeah.

02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:08.360
I mean, I think it's about scoring.

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:11.680
I think any sort of, uh, body lock, you know what I mean?

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.600
Locking your hands around the body.

02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:14.120
You've been able to put them to the floor that way.

02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:15.520
I feel like that's most effective.

02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:18.920
Save this might even have arisen out of a leg attack, a leg entry,

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:19.840
upgrade to the body.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:23.680
What about, uh, like foot sweeps, like outside foot sweeps?

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.560
What, what, what are we?

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:27.800
I would say, yeah, you know, uh, foot sweeps from outside foot sweeps or even

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:31.200
like something like you're tossing an opponent by and you're sweeping the foot.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:31.760
Yeah.

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:32.720
Those are all pretty safe.

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:33.840
See, why is that scary?

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:34.640
I don't understand.

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:35.920
It's not scary at all.

02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:37.480
I think it's the lifts that are scary.

02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:38.240
The lifts.

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:39.440
Who's lifting people.

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:41.720
I like the lift return.

02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.520
No, not you.

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.560
I mean, in master, like we're talking about older guys doing no gear.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.640
Some of those old bosses take it very serious.

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.480
They just start lifting.

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:49.440
TRT welts.

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:50.720
They're coming.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:52.080
They're coming to impress.

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:52.720
Grab a lift.

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:53.080
All right.

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:54.960
Just, just for the gram.

02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:55.480
Okay.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.160
Uh, what about submission?

02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:00.200
What's your favorite submission and what do you think is the most effective

02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.440
submission except the buggy choke?

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:04.440
Uh, I would have to say the rear naked.

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:09.040
It's definitely the one that's hit the most and the, uh, the highest level of

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:12.840
competition was that, uh, that was pretty interesting to see you escape all of

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.240
that and to put it, put it on.

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:17.160
That's the cool thing about EBI to see like the world-class athletes.

02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:21.560
I was surprised that it's possible to escape with you on his back.

02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.640
They're going to try some of the cream.

02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.320
Oh yeah.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:24.760
Be cream as it helps.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:27.320
What's in the brief?

02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:29.080
What's the formula or is that secret?

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:31.400
That is a proprietary blend for sure.

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:31.680
Okay.

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:34.080
Uh, but that's what you use for greasing.

02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.800
That's what you allegedly before.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:36.720
Allegedly.

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:42.240
Um, this is the other application outside of grappling or I'm sure you get creative.

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:42.600
All right.

02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:45.480
Asking for a friend.

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.680
Is that RNC for you as well?

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:49.680
Or a naked, uh, really good choke.

02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:53.040
I mean, overall favorite for like solidifying a finish.

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.760
Cause like you can push, you can put somebody asleep, right?

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.120
That even if they, they don't want to attack, put them to sleep.

02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:01.680
But as far as like something I've been working on now that I'm now starting

02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:06.160
to implement in competition, Yoko Senkaku side triangle is like, it's a beautiful

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:06.480
thing.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.920
You have multiple options.

02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.000
You have the triangle, the finish.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.840
If that fails, you have the Komori.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.720
You could break the arm.

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:13.520
You could also just transfer and take the back.

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:16.640
So Yoko Senkaku, I'm a big fan of, and I continue to

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:17.560
progressing and better at it.

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.280
Have you ever broken anyone's arm?

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:21.040
Oh yeah.

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:24.400
I mean, the first, first few competitions, cause I was like, you know, pretty

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.480
athletic grappler or athletic wrestler going against like local black belts and

02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:29.040
brown belts.

02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:33.840
Like my, one of my first matches, I broke somebody at Komora, um, pretty much

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:37.320
every time I've got a heel hook, which is only twice I've broken an opponent.

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:40.760
Um, if I have a joint lock, it's probably going to break.

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:42.440
Like a lot of times it breaks before they tap.

02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:43.560
Yeah.

02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.440
You seem like a really friendly fella.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:49.040
How hard is it to break an arm or any break a joint?

02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:51.640
Well, I don't think it's that hard.

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:56.040
I think, um, like if you're talking like about an arm bar, we have this position

02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:59.880
to where like people kind of holding on, holding on, and then it slips and their

02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:03.640
arm starts going and then it just, just breaks before they even, you know, get a

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.240
chance to tap.

02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:07.080
I love this point.

02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:08.920
I knew about a guy and he didn't tap one time.

02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:11.680
And it was actually, it was surprising.

02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.440
I had to put a lot of force into that as opposed to arms, shoulders, and the

02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:18.200
ligaments in the knees and ankles.

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:23.440
But to fully this kid, Sambo kid, fully let it go.

02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:25.920
And he tapped and I think the angle is like up here.

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:27.000
They're built different.

02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:31.840
Hopefully can be reconstructed.

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:35.960
All right.

02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:38.840
Um, what about a straight foot lock?

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:42.480
You've ever, do you guys do straight foot locks at all?

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:42.800
I don't know.

02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.040
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm learning them now.

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:49.600
We had some kid come, come in the practice one day and like, all of

02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.880
us do the straight foot lock, straight foot, like just this little like Polish

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:56.200
kid, not only did he foot lock everyone, but he told the entire world,

02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:00.680
how fucking email his friends and family.

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:05.120
Did we, we practically put a hit out on him in practice and he just everybody.

02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:06.600
Yeah.

02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:09.880
It's always interesting when you get like, yeah, people that specialize

02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:12.040
can surprise you that this could be effective stuff.

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.400
Uh, do you think there's other stuff that could be still discovered in

02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:22.440
jujitsu, like what, what areas do you think are ripe with techniques to discover?

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.160
Like wrestling is really interesting now.

02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:27.440
There's a lot of innovation happening in wrestling.

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:31.400
I think there'll be more innovation when, uh, we get people that are more

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.720
adamant about standing up from bottom position.

02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:36.160
I think if we get more of the community, they're like, all right,

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:37.400
I want to get off the bottom.

02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.720
I think just stand up, just stand up.

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:41.360
How'd you just, it doesn't work.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:42.880
We actually changed the name.

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:44.320
How Sambo doesn't work.

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:51.200
If you just, I'll change it to jiu-jitsu when I pirate it and send it for free

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:53.360
to the entirety of the Soviet block.

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:55.920
And Nick, you're right.

02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.720
Do you think ego is useful for martial arts?

02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:58.680
Or does it get in the way?

02:26:59.200 --> 02:26:59.560
Okay.

02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.320
I think you need to use it in both ways.

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:03.880
Um, for sure.

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:09.440
I have an ego, like if you're, if you're training competition, um, but also it

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.400
can prevent you from learning and progressing if your ego is too high.

02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:15.880
Like you really have to shut the ego down when you're in the mode of learning

02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:17.680
and trying to, you know, develop skills.

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:19.600
Cause you're going to put yourself in these bad positions.

02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:23.360
You're going to have issues with, uh, training partners that aren't necessarily,

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:27.160
you know, up to, up to your skill level, but because you're in these bad positions,

02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.200
you have to make these certain sacrifices.

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.120
And for sure, ego can be a good or bad thing.

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.920
But if you're able to shut the ego off and learn, then that'll have huge

02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:38.160
progression when it's time to put the ego on into use during competition.

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:40.680
When's the last time you put, uh, shut the ego off?

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:41.920
It's been a long time.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.120
What about you, Craig?

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:50.680
Do you, uh, do you, I mean, you seem to be super easy going.

02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:53.360
Is there like, is the ego just not part of it?

02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:54.160
Oh, for sure.

02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:56.240
I just don't want anyone to know they've damaged my ego.

02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.680
You know, you have to suppress it deep down.

02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:02.360
There's a child underneath all of it crying always.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:03.520
For sure.

02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:06.240
I think ego is good for a bit of perseverance, you know, like it'll help

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.040
you stick it out against a tough battle with a training partner for sure.

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.480
Bit of egos on the line.

02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:13.240
Plus the bands are back and forth.

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:15.400
We're trying to like stir each other up a bit.

02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.520
I think that helps hone sharpen the ego a bit.

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:21.000
Oh, what about you?

02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:22.960
Do you try, do you seem like a super humble guy?

02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.400
Is there like a monster underneath?

02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:25.560
I saw it's a total act.

02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.560
I think, uh, he goes a big motivator.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.880
Um, you know, I think it's very good to have in the aspect that it, like, it'll

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:38.800
drive you to help, to, to want to be one of the best in the world.

02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.800
Um, but like Nikki Rod said, you need to be able to turn it off in the training

02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:46.040
room and, you know, force yourself into bad positions where you may not be winning.

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.280
Uh, are there like, uh, you know, Donna has mentioned Boris, uh, are there like

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.240
grapplers like Boris?

02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:56.760
This is a question from Reddit, actually.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:00.720
Uh, Boris, like characters, anybody you've trained with in the past who

02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:03.160
doesn't compete, but it's just an absolute beast in training.

02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.840
Like people you've met, they're just like,

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.240
well, somebody that I think has a pride, the best, like submission grappling in,

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.840
in MMA, I think like Gilbert Burns is, is a, is a, his submission grappling.

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:15.200
That's amazing.

02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.040
Very, very good.

02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:18.360
I trained with him early, early on in my grappling career.

02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:22.320
And I was really impressed by his ability to, to move, hold down opponents

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:25.800
that are trying to stand up and as a whole, you know, he can, he can get

02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:27.160
submissions and put people away.

02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.840
Have you, when's the last time have you trained them recently or no?

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:32.600
No, it's been a few years.

02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:36.720
Which is so impressive, uh, ability to submit you're saying.

02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:37.240
Yeah.

02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:40.840
Like, I mean, you know, you would see, I'd see Gilbert go against a few, like

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:44.880
pretty decent black belts in the room and farewell and, you know, maybe he gets

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:48.400
to their back, puts a choke in and it's like Gilbert's super high level, uh,

02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:49.680
grappling or submission grappling.

02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:50.560
Yeah.

02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:53.280
But he's pretty widely recognized as a, as a monster.

02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:55.360
So I don't know that you didn't really answer the question.

02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:58.240
What was the question?

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:02.360
All right.

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:06.360
Well, what are the, is there, is there people like, you've done all these

02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:11.160
seminars, are there just, especially in, in the, in the Eastern block that you've

02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:14.640
seen, like you went to Kazakhstan, is there killers out there that.

02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:15.160
Oh yeah.

02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:16.080
There's tough guys out there.

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:17.800
Obviously I don't remember the names and all.

02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:20.920
Could I pronounce it if I did, but definitely some tough guys out there,

02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:24.160
obviously carrying skillsets over from, from wrestling for short, not

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.000
Sambo, but wrestling wrestling.

02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:28.160
Well, yeah, there are just people that surprise you.

02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:29.080
They just don't compete.

02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:29.920
They're really good.

02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:31.240
Are there, have you met those?

02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:36.480
I feel like it's less so today because there's so many, so many more athletes

02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:40.440
in the sport, but definitely when I was coming up back, like in Australia and

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:42.760
stuff, there were guys I trained with that wouldn't compete and that would be

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:44.320
like super tough rounds for me.

02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:45.160
Yeah.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:47.680
And there's so many more avenues for competing in general.

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:48.840
So, yeah.

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:50.880
Um, what about you?

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:52.000
Have you met some monsters?

02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:53.080
Yeah.

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:56.200
Uh, one guy I could think of in particular is, uh, Jason Rao.

02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:59.800
He's, uh, he trains, uh, up in Long Island, I think, right.

02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:02.040
Uh, opened up his own gym out there.

02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:06.760
Um, yeah, Vanguard, he used to compete, but he would never be able to

02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:08.600
compete at the same level he would train at.

02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:13.440
So now he's just focused on mainly, you know, opening up a gym and teaching

02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:16.680
his students, uh, but he was a guy that was, you know, extremely

02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:18.720
good in the training room, you know, world-class.

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:21.920
I still think to this day, he's, he's legitimately one of the best in the

02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:24.440
world, uh, but just doesn't compete anymore.

02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:28.080
Who wins in a fight, a lion or a bear?

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:30.680
Polar bear?

02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:31.400
That's for you, right?

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.200
No, not a polar.

02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:33.320
Well, yes, that's a good question.

02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:35.520
You're all, you know, the polar bear is pretty impressive.

02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.280
No grizzly bear.

02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:37.240
Grizzly bear.

02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:41.360
I think a grizzly bear wins.

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:43.840
Well, who was the most threatening predator in Australia?

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:49.880
Well, I mean, it's a tricky question here because everyone's scared of

02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:54.880
the animals in Australia, but I mean, you get bitten by a snake, bitten by a spider.

02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:56.480
That's not that bad.

02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:59.160
Bear, America, bear will just hold you down and eat you.

02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.120
That's a much more terrifying prospect for me.

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:03.320
Even sharks, sharks going to be quick.

02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:04.920
No one sees the shark coming.

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:06.040
The shark's just going to bite you in half.

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:07.440
Bear will take a bite and chew.

02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.760
A bear just holds you down and eats you.

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.720
So that's, uh, that's frightening for me.

02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:12.520
Australia is a bunch of just weird shit that can kill you.

02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:15.600
Did you see cocaine bear, the movie that's coming out?

02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:16.520
I saw the trailer.

02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:17.000
It looks good.

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:17.440
Yeah.

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:18.040
Yeah.

02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:20.840
So there's not every bear, there's like black belts and there's black

02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.280
belts, there's bears and there's bears.

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:24.880
So I think that's what they often don't talk about.

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:27.280
Everybody puts lions and bears in the same category.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.200
I think there's just some weak bears.

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.480
A lion would kill a black bear.

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:32.240
I think.

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:35.560
Not every black, again, I'm trying to tell you there's, there's difference.

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:38.400
Like grizzly and polar bound, betting on those.

02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:39.720
Yeah.

02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:42.680
No, I think grizzlies have the size, but actually every video I've seen of

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:47.280
grizzlies, they tie out within like 20 seconds, they get bored.

02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:48.400
That's the gas thing.

02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:48.760
Yeah.

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:50.160
That's a Nicky Ryan gas thing.

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:52.240
Yeah, that's all, that's all I got.

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:57.360
And they try to just, uh, they try to just take a breather.

02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:00.520
Like there's these crazy fights between bears and they last like 20 seconds.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.840
I heard this story about a, a Russian family was attacked by a bear in Russia

02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.080
and, uh, killed the dad.

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.520
And it took, it took so long to eat the daughter.

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:12.400
She made three phone calls to her mom while I was eating her and the first

02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:13.760
call the mom thought she was pranking her.

02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:15.480
That's crazy.

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:19.400
That's way scarier than, give me a snake bite any day food.

02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:20.400
Yeah.

02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:21.160
Hey, you know what?

02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:27.360
Let me, let me change the question is, um, like if you had to, uh, fight a

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.480
bear or a lion, how would you try to defeat it?

02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:31.880
Do you think you have a chance at all?

02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:35.760
Well, I think I'd, uh, I'd attack a lion a little bit differently than I

02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:38.160
had to attack a bear will be the difference.

02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:39.120
Okay.

02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:45.280
Well, I've seen this video where, um, uh, lions are eating and, and, uh, you

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:48.360
have three like screening guys walk up behind them and kind of scare

02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:50.160
the cat off of, off of their food.

02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:55.360
I think, uh, maybe I produced some props scare the lion away, right?

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.560
But if I have to fight it, um, I have to fight it straight on.

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.440
I mean, the thing is that you can't, even if you take the back, like you

02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:05.560
can't like bite it or choke it, the main is too big to lock your hands around.

02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:06.680
You know, are you sure about that?

02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:09.840
Cause I mean, it's just hair hair.

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.240
It's like, it's like matted hair.

02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:12.440
I don't know.

02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:16.840
So I think you can back control a lion.

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:18.040
Maintain.

02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:18.200
Yeah.

02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:18.480
Yeah.

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:23.400
But, but, but getting there, getting there, I think I fake high go low makeup

02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:26.520
thing, I'm going for the foot or something, a little pulse sweep and I take the back.

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.320
Uh, what about, what about a bear?

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:30.040
I feel like they're easier.

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.920
That might be easier to take, um, to hold back control.

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:33.680
Yeah.

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:37.320
Maybe the thing is if the bear falls on its back, just kind of crush it.

02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:40.200
So, so big, substantially bigger than a line, right?

02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:44.680
Like a, uh, they're also like terrifyingly like loud with their wars and stuff.

02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:45.080
Yeah.

02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:47.880
I think, uh, I think, so first of all, if I saw grizzly, I'm like, all right,

02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:48.640
he's going to attack me.

02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:50.360
I try to yell a little bit louder than them.

02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:55.080
Maybe the term a little bit, like give them a, and then, uh, yeah, for sure.

02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:56.200
I try to get behind it.

02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:00.120
I probably go like, uh, something weird, maybe like pull the eyes

02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:02.160
out or something, you know, for sure.

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:05.920
I mean, I'm going for the vital organs, you know, play dead, play dead.

02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:06.800
And then we'll check it.

02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:09.120
There's no, there's no pride in that.

02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.160
Wow.

02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:12.160
Pride even matters.

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:14.240
See the ego, the same advice you gave.

02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:15.800
You got to put the ego aside with the bear.

02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:23.920
Even then, even then, uh, would you, how would you fight a bear or a line?

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:24.520
Just play dead.

02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:25.080
Play dead.

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:25.360
Yeah.

02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:28.520
Could you beat a kangaroo, a kangaroo?

02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:30.040
Uh, kangaroo?

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:31.560
I'd beat the shit out of a kangaroo.

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:33.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.160
I mean, are we boxing gloves?

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:37.200
We just like, how would a kangaroo attack a human?

02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:40.560
Try to kick them with the claws, knock them down and then they choke them.

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:42.680
The kangaroos do?

02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:43.400
They choke each other.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:43.640
Yeah.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000
They don't choke each other.

02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:45.840
You don't believe me?

02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.120
You want to watch a video?

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:47.960
They choke each other out.

02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:49.640
I've seen this.

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:49.880
Yeah.

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:51.680
Yeah.

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:52.880
Yeah.

02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:54.840
With which, or like headlock or what?

02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:55.680
Yeah, they knock him.

02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:56.360
Sure.

02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.120
And just grip like this and hold him.

02:35:58.120 --> 02:35:58.720
What's the grip?

02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:00.840
What like a little pause?

02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.560
How are they gripping?

02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:02.320
I promise you.

02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:03.000
I'm not lying.

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:04.440
Pretty sure I've seen the video.

02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:05.920
They also do strange shit.

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.080
Like if there's a predator around, they'll wait in a pool of water.

02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:09.760
And then if it comes to attack, they drown it.

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:10.520
They're pretty smart.

02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:14.960
Okay.

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:18.400
Speaking of which, what's the most effective martial art for winning a street fight?

02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:20.760
You talked about rule sets and streets.

02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:23.960
I think you've talked about being a street.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.120
Have you ever been in a street fight?

02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:26.160
Yeah, just one.

02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:26.880
Yeah.

02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:28.360
Nothing special.

02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:29.000
Nothing crazy.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:30.960
Hey, you don't talk about that time.

02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.560
Like for self-defense purposes will be a strategy on the street.

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:38.920
I feel like whoever wins the street fights, whoever's willing to take it the

02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:41.560
furthest, the fastest, you know what I mean?

02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:44.480
If you're thinking that you're going to box and he's biting you, poking your

02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.960
eyes, that guy's going to win.

02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:46.880
He wants some more.

02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:47.720
You know what I mean?

02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:48.920
That's why the crack heads fight.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.720
They go for the kill straight away.

02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:52.040
You know?

02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:55.000
So I feel like it's more about who's willing to do the most.

02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.000
That's going to win that fight.

02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.440
Fastest, the most fastest.

02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:01.640
Who's got the least to lose, you know?

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:02.440
Okay.

02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:05.240
We can also define winning differently because you could also run away.

02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.080
But in terms of technique wise, wrestling, Jito.

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.040
I think if it's a one-on-one, I'd go, I go wrestle wrestler wins, but if it's

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:19.080
like a, you know, it's like a multiple people, you got to go Muay Thai, stay on

02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:21.960
their feet, can't go down to the ground if it's more than one person.

02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:22.480
Yeah.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:23.360
Big double leg, maybe.

02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:24.400
Yeah.

02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:27.080
Double leg, put them asleep on the, on the impact, right?

02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:28.080
Forehead to the ground.

02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:28.320
Yeah.

02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.560
What's the goal here is to win the fight and not go to prison?

02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:34.480
I haven't thought of it through that way.

02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:36.160
Yeah, certainly.

02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:36.480
Yeah.

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:37.160
Yeah.

02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:39.040
And not go, not, not to, not to kill the person.

02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:40.320
You got mutual combat here in Texas.

02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:40.800
We're good.

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:42.360
Is that in Texas?

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.200
Do you know what the paperwork for that looks like?

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.400
Do you have to actually sign something?

02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.040
Can you just say, I hope I don't need to find out.

02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:50.480
And I don't need to find out.

02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:53.920
I did hear a story where guys were on sixth street and they looked at a cop.

02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:57.680
They were like mutual combat, mutual combat, and just got like the cops to say yes.

02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:59.080
And just duked it out.

02:37:59.080 --> 02:37:59.880
It could be false though.

02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:02.600
That sounds crazy.

02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:03.200
I'm just saying.

02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:08.520
I kind of admire that, but I've also been playing Red Dead Redemption recently.

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:14.240
So I've like internalized the cowboy a little, a little too much just to return

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:18.800
to gym stuff, but I've also been playing Red Dead Redemption recently.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.520
Gym stuff.

02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.320
No, because it's a business, because you're running a business.

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:26.720
There's money involved, but you're also friends.

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.040
Um, but you also training partners.

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:33.560
Is there, um, attention that money creates that can threatens to destroy friendships?

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:36.640
That's something I always worry about with money.

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:40.280
I try not to go do any kind of business with friends or family.

02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:45.080
I think if it were all very clear and honest and open at the

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:47.000
start makes it much easier.

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:50.800
Um, I think people have issues when there's like, kind of like things are

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:53.280
written in fine print and nobody knows the exact answers.

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.320
And a lot of jujitsu guys can't read.

02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:57.040
Yeah.

02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:57.800
That makes it, that makes it.

02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:58.760
We're learning that today.

02:38:58.800 --> 02:38:59.120
Yeah.

02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:04.480
No, um, definitely complicated though.

02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:06.120
Yeah.

02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:09.520
I mean, it's, it's not always obvious to how to be transparent and stuff

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.840
and, uh, about everything.

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.400
Um, have you felt that tension?

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.680
Cause in a jujitsu world, the money's not really unlimited.

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:18.960
Just running a school.

02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.600
What's that like?

02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:22.720
Cause this is the first time you're running a school or running a gym.

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:23.720
Yeah.

02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.320
I mean, it's just constantly updating people about what's going on.

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.600
What your expectations are.

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:29.800
You know what I mean?

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:34.600
We've had some problems with coaches who I feel like think the pie is bigger

02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:36.320
than it is, you know what I mean?

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.480
They feel like, uh, maybe we're getting rich out of this and they're missing

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:41.080
out on things.

02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:45.400
So it's like even amongst managing staff that can be challenging too.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.640
So yeah, I mean, it's a constant work in progress to make not only to make

02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.240
sure everyone's happy, but to make sure they're comfortable enough to reach

02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:54.480
out and tell you they're unhappy.

02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.160
But I feel like those challenges are common amongst any small business.

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:02.600
Still it sucks.

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.400
Uh, just to mention, I'm, I'm clueless to this, but I'm just not learning this.

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:12.840
Uh, somebody I met and talked to and I really like is Isaac.

02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:18.000
Yeah, learned because you're also active on Reddit.

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:19.040
What's your name on it?

02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.320
It's John Belushi's mom as undercover as possible, you know?

02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.000
Oh, it's not you.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.080
It's, uh, it's actually, it's actually John Belushi's mom, right?

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.840
Uh, so I've done my research, I guess, and I guess you guys had a, had a

02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.240
falling out and have split.

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:35.280
I just want to say that.

02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.720
I don't know the few interactions I've had with him.

02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:39.680
He's like a beautiful human being.

02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:45.160
So that just shows to me visually, maybe not internally and sexually just

02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.960
the experience that, no, she's just a kind person.

02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:48.240
I don't know.

02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:49.280
I liked them a lot.

02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:56.880
Like to me in a business setting, um, yeah, tensions are created and it sucks.

02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:58.000
I don't know.

02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:03.440
I mean, I suppose money, all the stuff that happened in the jungle aside,

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:06.800
probably money had a role to play to create extra tension.

02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.560
Money and egos about like, who was the leader, who is not the leader.

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:11.040
It's tough.

02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:12.440
It's tough to manage that kind of stuff.

02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:15.040
I've seen it happen with jujitsu schools a lot.

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.920
I don't know exactly what, cause it's like, there is also a hierarchy

02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:22.200
inside grappling jujitsu schools.

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:23.760
Like people that are better or not.

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:26.160
There's literally ranks, black belt and brown belt.

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:28.000
There's like competitors that are better.

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.160
I mean, I don't, it's a weird dynamic in which to operate because like,

02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:38.520
usually there's more politeness and like humanity layered into the

02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:41.920
way a company works, but here there's just a bunch of, I mean, it's like

02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:45.720
violence laid on, on display plus money.

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:46.920
It's crazy.

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.040
Is there something you could say to that?

02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:52.480
Like how you try to minimize or something you want to comment on Isaac?

02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:53.000
Yeah.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.560
I mean, it was unfortunate situation, but it just didn't work out.

02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.880
You know, like there's going to be personality clashes.

02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:04.520
Some people, uh, I can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you.

02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:05.600
With me.

02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:05.960
Yeah.

02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:07.640
It's hard to imagine.

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.120
Surprising.

02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:12.840
You know, I mean, I didn't even know what to send that.

02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:19.120
I don't want to touch on it too much, but obviously his expectations about

02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:25.560
his role in the gym, obviously different from ours, uh, led to some personality

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.600
clashes that was sort of unresolved.

02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:29.320
Well, you know, some things happen that can't be resolved.

02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:30.280
He can't fix those things.

02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:34.720
You know, uh, obviously a lesson, I hope for both of us, definitely a

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:39.280
lesson, uh, for me, from a management role to try to address these things

02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:43.440
sooner, but also sometimes I came up in a different time where there was no

02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:48.560
money, no opportunities, I had to pave that I had to pay that way totally for

02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:52.920
myself, especially coming from Australia, like, uh, being a professional athlete

02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:56.240
introduced to wars, not I think so I had to pave a lot of opportunities for

02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:02.480
myself and I feel like sometimes, uh, Oh, I don't know what the right word

02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:06.800
is, sometimes people don't appreciate some of the ways you help them and they

02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:12.040
just think, feel like almost they deserve or entitled to certain things.

02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.600
And that is very difficult to manage.

02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:18.840
But I think again, like we, we both see the situation different.

02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.800
I do hope he finds a better, a more comfortable place to train, but yeah,

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:26.800
obviously I've known him for a long time, sort of like a, a brotherly

02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:31.680
relationship, so that's going to really make personal problems a lot worse when

02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:32.760
you're that close to someone, you know,

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:34.120
I just hated that.

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:39.720
Like I've seen in jujitsu especially, but in other places where like close

02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:45.400
friendships were destroyed because of like gym stuff, like people running

02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:52.320
gyms and it just as a person who is in this case, just a fan, but in like in

02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.480
general, just like a student, it's like sucks.

02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:01.120
Well, again, in my position, sometimes I wonder if there really was a friendship

02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:06.440
or mere opportunity, I have to be careful of that with some people in the sport.

02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:11.400
Is it a sincere relationship or like, I mean, it's difficult for me to tell or

02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.760
am I a means to an end?

02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:14.480
Sure.

02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:19.120
But I think it's actually a trade-off because I think a lot of close

02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.760
friendships we have, like even relationships we have, like when tested,

02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:28.440
like can break if they're not properly communicated.

02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:31.680
Like some of it could be just misunderstanding of like for prolonged

02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:36.240
period of time, um, not, not, it's not explaining it to just like a lack of

02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:36.720
integrity.

02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:40.320
It's just like you, like you have to like talk through that shit, like just

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:41.200
be honest with each other.

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200
Take some MDMA and really get down to it.

02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:44.800
Drugs solve everything.

02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:46.680
You've already heard it from this conversation.

02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:49.200
I've actually haven't done MDMA yet.

02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:51.360
People say that that's something I would enjoy a lot.

02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:53.360
Cause my brain is, I think, natural on MDMA.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.680
Um, I'd recommend it for sure.

02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:56.200
For sure.

02:44:57.720 --> 02:44:59.280
Um, is that what you do with Gabby?

02:44:59.280 --> 02:44:59.560
I don't know.

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:00.000
Okay.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:02.640
She drugs me.

02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:08.880
In general, why is there always seems to be drama in the Jiu Jitsu world, like

02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:13.520
outside of, outside of what's going on here, or is that just, uh, it's universal

02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:15.000
to anything dramas everywhere.

02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:17.520
And then drama rises to the surface.

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:18.640
I'm gonna make some money.

02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:19.400
Yeah.

02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:21.400
I wish there was a little bit less.

02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:25.760
Uh, you've, uh, you have a bunch of, like we mentioned some of them.

02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:27.280
You have a bunch of instructionals out.

02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.040
What are some interesting things that, uh, you're looking forward to, like

02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:33.080
exploring, uh, in terms of teaching.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:35.400
So just stand up as your most recent one, right?

02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:36.160
Yeah.

02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:39.960
You also have one called power bottom and inclusive modern approach to the

02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:40.280
guard.

02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:43.040
You're tight.

02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:45.360
What are some other, what are some other ones?

02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:47.040
False reap allegations.

02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.080
False reaper allegations.

02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:48.280
Yeah.

02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:51.600
By the way, people talk about power bottom again, hilarious title, but they

02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:54.400
say it's a really good instructional on like the guard.

02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:55.000
Yeah.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000
I try to, I try to at least be innovative, you know, like everyone else, I

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.840
feel like ripping off John and Gordon putting some sort of slants on that.

02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:03.920
So I'm trying to take sort of a different approach.

02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:09.600
Uh, I think you can actively influence the sport with what you release because

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:10.840
people are going to try to emulate that.

02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:13.960
So I think that's those types of instructions.

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:16.520
Just stand up power bottom, like approach to the sport differently.

02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:21.560
I think definitely has a positive impact on the, how people play the game.

02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:23.320
Are you working on something now?

02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:28.400
Probably a fundamentals, uh, course, just cause we're bringing out with the

02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:29.600
white belt program coming in.

02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:33.720
So I'm trying to develop a fundamentals course along the line of the constraint

02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:37.400
based learning stuff we were talking about today, like a way to approach

02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:41.720
learning as a beginner to sort of speed up the process a bit and not make it as

02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:46.440
so technique dense, at least have it a bit more fun and focusing in on just

02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:48.680
like examples of problems to solve.

02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:49.320
Exactly.

02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:49.560
Yeah.

02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:53.240
Approaching jujitsu learning that way, like, I mean, kids learn quick through

02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:56.840
games, I think adults are capable of that to a certain extent as well.

02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.840
You're releasing that instructional on, um, pre-match preparation.

02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:01.280
Yes.

02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:05.040
What are the, what are the stuff, do you have a thing in a body, a body lock pass?

02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:08.880
Yeah, I have a, I have a body lock or Roddy lock, DVD or instructional.

02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:10.920
Um, yeah, I had the pre-match ritual coming out.

02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:15.560
I also have, um, I'm filming, uh, how to build athleticism for grappling.

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:19.160
Um, just really trying to capture different angles, kind of like the same,

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:22.480
you know, what Craig's doing, uh, try not to do the same thing that everybody

02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:25.680
else does, you know, there's a ton of wrestling, ton of, uh, jujitsu

02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:26.760
instructional, instructional.

02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:29.680
So, and the steroid results are coming out.

02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:30.200
Oh yeah.

02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:30.480
Yeah.

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:35.440
More plates, more dates, you know, Derek, that runs that, um, hit me up for a blood

02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:37.280
panel test, like an impromptu thing.

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:40.440
And, uh, I did it a few days ago and I believe the results will come out shortly.

02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:41.240
Oh yeah.

02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:43.120
I, do you know the results?

02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:44.200
What are you betting on Lex?

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:47.200
It's hard.

02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:47.880
It's hard to believe.

02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:51.080
Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's very, very impressive.

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:55.480
Putting me in awkward position here.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:02.400
Do you, do you think you'll face Gordon soon?

02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:05.240
Um, I'm open to it.

02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:06.120
I don't know.

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:09.640
I don't know how soon, maybe in the next six months, I could see me facing him

02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:11.680
before, uh, ADCC worlds.

02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:14.600
I think that's a great rivalry.

02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:15.960
I think it's a really interesting one.

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:16.960
It's fun for me.

02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:25.880
Um, is there any chance that the, the, the two, the Soviet union and Nazi

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:31.880
Germany get back together, um, the DDS under whatever name gets back together?

02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:35.520
No, highly unlikely.

02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:39.920
I mean, we kind of did this to, you know, um, to back up Nikki Ryan and,

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:41.320
you know, we're sticking with our guy.

02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:43.760
So what, what do you think?

02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:47.320
Uh, yeah, I think there's just too many personality conflicts for

02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:48.960
it to, to really ever work again.

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.240
Do you think there will always be war in the world?

02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:54.720
War?

02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:55.320
Yeah.

02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:55.720
Oh yeah.

02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:59.440
I think from the, from the beginning of time, it's, it's been, you know, some

02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:02.080
kind of war, some kind of battle controversy.

02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:04.360
It's what helps people evolve.

02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:10.480
Uh, until AI, super intelligent AI becomes way more powerful than humans

02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:15.480
and humbles all of us with his power before he destroys us until it runs out

02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:18.120
of batteries because I'm screwed.

02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.840
Um, I'm really fortunate to be able to hang out with you to train with you.

02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:23.760
Uh, and thank you so much for talking today.

02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:26.480
This was the best ending.

02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.840

And now let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.

02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:44.360
You must understand that there's more to this conversation than just

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:45.200
listening to this podcast.

02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.280
