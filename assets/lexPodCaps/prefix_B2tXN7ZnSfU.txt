00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Dear ladies and gentlemen,

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello, comrade!

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Happy New Year!

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Happy New Year!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Beauty will save the world

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Beauty will save the world

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Beauty will save the world

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Beauty will save the world

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You are actually a model

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
You are my friend

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
To maintain a sense of cynicism and hopelessness

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Because if there's even one moment when some

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Element of perfection has been actualized

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
If there's one moment where

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Beauty has been realized and captured

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You can't say, well, it's never gonna happen again

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
So I think beauty, it means hope

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I think, I hate

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
That cynical idea of like

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I get, I appreciate Solzhenitsyn's broader point

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
That a lot of times people, there's something called a deepity

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Where people throw words together to sound profound

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And if you take it apart, like this is just complete gibberish

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't think this is an example of that

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I think beauty inspires

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
And it, more importantly, it proves to you

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
This is something that can actually happen on this Earth

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Plato, right, the Platonic theory of forms

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Like this world is imperfect

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
But these perfect forms exist in another dimension

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
And that's where our concepts come from

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
He was an early person trying to figure out

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Where our concepts come from

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And epistemology and so on and so forth

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
But that is something that is real in here

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So I completely disagree with his analysis of that

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And I don't know if it'll save the world

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
But it's certainly a prerequisite

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
And what's the point of fighting for your values

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
If you don't want to make the world a more beautiful place?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Well, it's also how you define beauty

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Because beauty could be just aesthetic

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Beauty could be art

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Of course, art could encompass a lot

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
A lot more than just literature and paintings

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
It can encompass the full life

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The full dance of life

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
But then beauty could be something just deeper

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Like whatever that awe you feel

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
When you pause and hear the music

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Just hear and look up at the stars

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
For some reason when I see rockets go up

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
For me it's like science

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What is that?

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
The awe that we're able to accomplish that as humans

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
That's funny because there's lots of different schools of thought

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Like these people versus these people

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
And maybe vegans versus steakhouse people

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I think in terms of the sciences

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And I guess you and I would be on opposite sides here

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
You have the astronomy people versus the zoology people

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Like the big question is

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Would you rather spend 10 minutes on the moon

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Or would you rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And for me it's clearly the deep sea

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
The zoology that's down there

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
There's something I would encourage people to look up

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Called deep staria

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Which is a jellyfish

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
What's amazing when you watch these deep sea dives on YouTube

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Is that the scientists, their nature dorks like everybody else

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
They went into this field

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And there's none of this maybe Solzhenitsyn style cynicism

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Of when they see an amazing animal in its natural environment

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
You know, exhibiting these crazy behaviors

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
They lose it

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
They're on the mics like oh my god

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Like it's so exciting to watch

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
So I'm not a rocket person

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
But I'm definitely a zoology person

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So animals and plants in the sea

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And also it's so mathematical

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
There's so many forms

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
There's this plant called areospermum

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Tighten up soities

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't know how to pronounce it

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Because they're always in Latin

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
You never hear them pronounced

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
You said sperm

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Areospermum, yeah

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Because it's a woolly seed is the genus

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
The leaf, it just always puts out one leaf

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
But the leaf is covered in little magnifying glasses

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Lenses

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
To make it maximize the sunlight

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
So it looks like this little crystal seashell

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
It's tiny

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
It's like two centimeters

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But it's just this amazing thing

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
That grows out of the sands in South Africa

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Just to defend Solzhenitsyn for a second

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
So if I may read a couple of his lines from the speech

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Sure

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
So he said

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
One day, this is how he introduces it

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
One day Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic remark

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Beauty will save the world

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
What sort of a statement is that?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
For a long time I considered it near words

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
How could that be possible?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
When in bloodthirsty history did beauty

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Ever save anyone from anything?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And then later he goes on to argue with himself in the speech

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
As an older, wiser man now

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But perhaps that ancient trinity of truth, goodness, and beauty

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Is not simply an empty, faded formula

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
As we thought in the days of our self-confident, materialistic youth

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
If the tops of these three trees converge

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
As the scholars maintained

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
But the two blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Are crushed, cut down, not allowed through

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Then perhaps the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Will push through and soar to that very same place

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And in so doing will fulfill the work of all three

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
In that case, Dostoevsky's remark

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Beauty will save the world

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Was not a careless phrase, but a prophecy

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Which of these three things are your favorites?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Truth, goodness, or beauty?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
What do you call truth and goodness?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
The blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
Versus the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Which is how I see your Twitter account

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I think there's a certain dearth of beauty

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
To be had in my Twitter account, that's for sure

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And certainly no goodness

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Or truth

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah, yeah, it's Twitter, there's no truth to be found

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I will answer the question, I will of course point out

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
That having this kind of distinction between the three things

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Is I think kind of synthetic

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I think they very heavily overlap, if not

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
If I could probably make the argument, they're synonymous

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
In fact, I do believe that they're largely synonymous

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Goodness, that's such an interesting word, goodness

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Which of those three is my favorite?

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
I think truth is overrated in the sense that

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
If something is a good story

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
The story doesn't have to be true or real

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
In order to motivate you and move you

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
A lot of times we can delude ourselves about somebody

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And that might actually serve a purpose to some extent

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
If you have someone who's maybe a family member

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And you kind of ignore bad things that they do

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
There might be a reason for that

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Of the three which is most important

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I think, I would say probably goodness

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I would say of the three the most important is goodness

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Because if you don't appreciate goodness

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Then beauty is just empty

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
It's just a picture or it's nice

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Bad people appreciate beauty

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Bad people are often seductive or have a beauty about them

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And in terms of action, I think it takes a lot of skill

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And work to create beauty or to create truth

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Or to express truth or to express beauty

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
But I think goodness is the easiest default state of being

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Just being good to others

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, there'll be things where

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
These videos where one dog is drowning

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And another dog jumps in and saves it from the pool

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
That to me is just really amazing stuff

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And it's very moving

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
To me goodness means integrity

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And it means kindness

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And yeah, I think of the three that would be the one I pick

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
And I think people also have this idea

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Which is inculcated to them

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Especially by corporate America

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
That as you get older it's okay to do the wrong things sometimes

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I don't buy that

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And so I think goodness gets rarer and rarer

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And I think people know better and they tell themselves lies

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, but once you allow yourself the chance to just be good

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I think it makes for a better life

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's not that much work

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's not like going to the gym or working out

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
That's a lot of work and it's great afterwards

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
But goodness is easy once you get into the habit of it

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I suppose working out is the same way

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
There's a lot of stuff

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If you make it a habit

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You're going to get the rewards of it

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And it's going to be easy

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
The rewards of goodness I think are more immediate

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Than the rewards of working out

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
As opposed to the hard drugs

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
You mentioned this quote on one of your live streams I think

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
If you save one life you save the world

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
That's such a cool line

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I remember reading about Paul Farmer

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I think his name is, he's a doctor that really

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I mean doctors in general

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
They kind of don't care about

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
What they're doing as a broad policy across

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Hundreds of thousands of millions of people

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
They just care about the human in front of them

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Which is so interesting

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
They don't care it's going to cost

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Like in his case

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
To save one child

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
It will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
They don't care about that

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
They can't

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
They know very well

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
That their actions cannot be scaled

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But they can't help

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But help the child in front of them

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And it's so interesting

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
There's such an interesting way to live

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And that's the way I kind of think

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
When I try to do something positive

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Is

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Will this help one person?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And I just kind of imagine

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
A specific person

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Depending on the thing

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
That that would help with

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Like when I'm trying to create something

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Whether it's a piece of hardware or a video

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Or anything like that

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Or educational material

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Lecture that kind of stuff

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't know

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
What do you think about this quote?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Is it profound or is it just poetic?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I think it's more profound than it sounds at first

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
The example I think of is Michelle Bachman

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
She was a former congresswoman from Minnesota

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
She clearly had crazy eyes

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Something weird was going on with her husband

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
But she adopted like 20 kids

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Terry Shappard is another friend of mine

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
He's like either a Navy SEAL or Marines

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Whatever it is, Terry, I apologize

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm not trying to be funny

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
And he adopts like elder dogs

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So going back to Bachman

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's like yeah, you can say she's crazy

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
You can make fun of her politics all you want

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And all that stuff's legitimate

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
But if you save a kid

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Give them a home

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And you save them from the foster system

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And you put a roof over their heads

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And make them feel loved and appreciated

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It's really hard for me

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
To sit here and call you

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Like a totally bad person

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I think that kind of thing is

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Nick Cerci is another one

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
He adopted a kid

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I said I think you're a hero

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
One of the things that's very hard for me

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
As you know, I talk about this endlessly

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
This book, The White Pill

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
But writing about when people do

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Hurtful things to children

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It really is hard to watch

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
And it's hard to

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Because when you're an author

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You have to kind of empathize with the character

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Where is this character coming from?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Explain their point of view

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And that's the one that's the hardest for me

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
To wrap my head around

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Cruelty to children

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, sadism to children

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
It's just like this is something

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Even animals know not to do

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Do you know what I mean?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Like dogs, when you see them around kids

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
They're very protective

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Like if the kid pokes their eyes out

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
The dog doesn't do anything

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So it's like if you can't even get to that level

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
What kind of person are you?

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
So I think that quote is a profound one

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
And it's an important one

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
It also means we're not all called upon

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We're not all called upon to be Superman

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Right?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You only have a very finite ability

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
To move the needle

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But at the same time

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
If you have actually saved a life

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
You can go to meet your maker

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You did your part

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You left the world a little bit better than you found it

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And that's all you could ask anybody

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Also I think from a policy perspective

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It seems we just do better

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
When we focus on doing a small thing

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Helping one person

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It feels like when you start talking about communism

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
And all those kinds of things

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
When you start to believe

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
You could do good by a lot of people

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
That's where your mind somehow

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Stops being able to do good by a lot of people

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
That's when you start to think about utopias

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And somehow utopias goes to

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Feeds power into the brain

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
To where it deludes you completely

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
And then you start

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Kind of a reasoning

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And you run into trouble

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It seems like it's much better

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Even when you have the power and the money and so on

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
To achieve scale

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
To focus on one

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Or locally

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Locally, yeah

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Because then you have the feedback

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So if you have some kind of program

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
In Austin or Brooklyn or something like that

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
And you can watch

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh this is working

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
This isn't working

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Then you can port it out to other places

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But top-down helping is

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
At the very least is going to be inefficient

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And also I think it's a lot more useful

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
When you're helping people

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
When it's a one-on-one relationship

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Because then it's less embarrassing

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
But certainly less something to receive help

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
And you also feel

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's one thing if you get a check from the government

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Food stamps

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
It's not a thing if someone's like

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Hey I'm going to buy your groceries

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Until you get back on your feet

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You have this kind of motivation

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I think for most people

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
To be like you know what

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
This person believed in me

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm going to make it worth their while

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
That they believed in me

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Because I didn't believe in me

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
When I was giving lectures at MIT

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
There was one I was scared shitless

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And I mean everybody

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You know how students are

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
And all that kind of stuff

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
They're kind of bored

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And they don't understand

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
That you're human too

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Or this could be just me

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
They don't understand

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
You're trying to pass this human

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I know

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
But there was one gentleman in the audience

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And he went to all the lectures

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Older gentleman

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
He was a faculty at MIT

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
And he just without very kind of nonchalant

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Just said after the lectures

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
He kind of nodded me and said

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
You did great

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And before like one time he said

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
In a non creepy way

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I know this is going to come off as creepy

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
He said

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
You look great today

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Like he said that in a

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't know

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
In the way

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
So he's like 60, 70

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Whatever like he

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
In this

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't know

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
In a wise sage way

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Because I was wearing a suit and tie

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Like I look like

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You know when you dress up like a young kid

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
You dress him up

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
So he was just like

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
All right

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
You're all dressed up

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You look great

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
You got this

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't know

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
That has a lasting impact

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
That kind of pat on the back

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But I agree with you

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Cruelty towards other adults

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Is somehow understandable

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Because it's a world full of conflict

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But cruelty towards children

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Doesn't

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
It doesn't quite

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I can't

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I can't understand it

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I can't understand how you could

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Act in a way that directly causes suffering to a child

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
In front of you

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That is like the

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't think I've ever talked to you

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This might be a good time to ask you about this

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
What do you make

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
What lessons do you draw about human civilization

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
From Jeffrey Epstein

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
From just laying

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Everybody thinks about different things

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
When you talk to Eric Weinstein

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
He thinks about intelligence

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And like who

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Like Jeffrey Epstein is a front for something else

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
That's what he thinks about

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
I think about the weakness of grown men

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
In the face of charismatic evil

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Which is like

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
For me directly is MIT

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I didn't know

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I actually was

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
I guess I was at MIT

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
When Jeffrey Epstein was just at the very end

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
He must have been there

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I didn't know any of this

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
But it really bothers me

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
That nobody was able to see through this man

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Because he's obviously

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
What is also obvious to me

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Is that he was very charismatic

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Like

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
I mean I try to think about human nature

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
From this perspective is directly

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Like we said

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Help One Life

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Would I know a Jeffrey Epstein

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
If he was in my life

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Would I know evil when I saw evil

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Even if it's sitting across from you

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Even

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I mean you

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
So

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Exactly

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
The evil laugh

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Thank you

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
The thing

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's a necronomicon

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
The thing I

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm sure we'll talk about it

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Maybe not

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
It doesn't really matter

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
We see things

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
You and I

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Michael

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Very differently about a lot of things

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Politically and so on

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
The reason

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I like you a lot

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
The reason I like

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
The people I do in my life

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Is there's a

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
There's a warmth

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
There's a kindness

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
There's a humanity underneath it all

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I don't really care what you believe

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't care

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Like

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I don't care what your Twitter says

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
You know

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
It's easy to mistake your Twitter

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
To indicate that there's not a deeply human

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Love for humanity in there

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And that's why I'm detecting that

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I think

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I would be able to detect that

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Jeffrey Epstein

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Did you say detect?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
I'm just imagining the T1000

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Detected

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yes

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I imagine

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I hope I would be able to not

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Detect that

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Epstein

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Lacks that completely

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Even if he's charismatic

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
In the humor he has

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Even if he is

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Charismatic in the expression of curiosity for science

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Which he did

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
He was curious about

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Like

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Not just like

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Boring

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Minutia of science

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
He was interested about the big questions in science

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Which I could see that

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Become exciting to scientists

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Like

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh wow

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Here's a person

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Who's thinking big

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
That's always exciting

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
When somebody goes into a room

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And thinks about like

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
How do we solve intelligence?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
How do we travel faster than the speed of light?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
That's exciting to people

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Especially people with money

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Because it's like

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Alright

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
So we might be able to actually

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Do big things here

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
But you could see through the bullshit

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
The dead

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
The deadness in the eyes

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't know

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
So I think about that

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Because

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I feel like I have the responsibility

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
For me as an individual

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
To detect evil

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
So

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Do you know who Michael Allig is?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Okay

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
This is going to be a whole long

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
This is going to be a Lex Clips

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
But this is a whole long story

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
So there was a scene in New York

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
In the 90s called

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
The Club Kids

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
And they would go out

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
To different night clubs at night

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
They would all dress in really kind of crazy

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Costumes

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
And

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
But the costumes were all like

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Like goofy

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And like

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Just like an angel

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
This was dressed like a nurse

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
There was a juvenile aspect to it

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
They're all taking

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
You know

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Ketamine and ecstasy to all hours

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
This is kind of

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Raid culture was coming up in there

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
And the head of it

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And in fact there's a

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
A clip on YouTube

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I think it was the Jane Whitney show

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Of the Club Kids

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
And Gigi Allen

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Gigi Allen is a

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
You know

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Kind of punk rock performer

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Hard rock performer

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Who passed away

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And the audience

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
And Gigi Allen was very

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Aggressive

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
And like a crazy person

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
My friend once saw him

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
In a concert

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
And he took a dump on stage

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Smeared it all over his face

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Grabbed a girl from the audience

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Gave her a big kiss

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
And as she walked by him

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
She just went like this

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Like excuse me

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Like went to the bathroom

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So the audience is screaming at Gigi Allen

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Because he's very visibly over the top

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Whereas you've got a bunch of these kids

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Dressed in these silly costumes

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
You guys just having fun

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Well the head of the Club Kids

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Michael Allig ended up killing someone

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
There was a kid called Angel Menendez

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Who hung around with them

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
He would always have angel wings and boots

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
One time they were at Michael's condo

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
With another

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
With a drug dealer named Freeze

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
They got into a fight

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
So Angel got hit in the head with a hammer

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
They kill him

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
What are we going to do with the body?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
They put it on ice in the bathtub

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
They had a party

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
So everyone's going to the bathroom

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
While Angel's body's there

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Michael got

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
They're like all right

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
We got to take care of this

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Michael got extremely high in heroin

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Had like cutlery from Macy's

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Sawed the body in pieces

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Put it in a box

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
They took him in a cab

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
The cab driver helped them

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Throw the body into the river

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And then Michael starts walking around Manhattan

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Wearing Angel's boots

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And would tell people

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh I killed Angel

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Now because he was a super effeminate

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Over the top

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Like he would pee in people's beer

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Kind of guy

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Everyone's like

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Oh God Michael

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Like you and your stupid pranks

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But it was true

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
And he got caught

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And he got sent to jail

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
So I was in a store in Manhattan in SoHo

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
And it was one of those stores

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
You have like all sorts of things for sale

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
And I saw a painting

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
And it said Malice

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And I'm like wait what?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
And it was M. Allig

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
It was a Michael Allig painting

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
He had painted while in jail

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
So my mom bought it for me for my birthday

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't remember what birthday it was

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And I started writing to him in prison

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
He was going to write a memoir called

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Alligula

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Which is clever

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And then I actually went to visit him

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I'm like I want to see what this person's like

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Because on one hand

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
He's king of New York nightlife

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
This goofy person

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And it's also kind of ironic that Gigi Allen

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Is like maybe he's gross

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
He's not killing anyone

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
He's probably an accountant off the stage

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
And Michael Alligato

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Killed someone

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And then bragged about it tongue in cheek

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
So but meeting him

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And he passed away last December

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
On Christmas actually

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Christmas 2020

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
He was clearly a sociopath

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And I'd never met a sociopath before

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Now a lot of times we'll read these

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Like you'll take a BuzzFeed quiz

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Like are you a sociopath

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And it's like oh my feelings weren't hurt

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
When I was mean to someone

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
It's not a thin line between like

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Me and you and him

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's a thick thick line

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Because when you're talking to someone like that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
At least in this specific case

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
He was being very friendly

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And it's not like he was going to kill anyone

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Or as a threat to me

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
But there's that sense

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Like something's really off here

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And he was talking to me about how

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
After he had killed Angel

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
He would just talk about it

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because he felt so much guilt

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
He just wanted to get caught

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
It's like no no no

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
What he was describing wasn't guilt

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
He was describing just

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
He didn't like the knife over his head

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Like waiting to get caught

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm like you don't even know what guilt is

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
So it was kind of like oh wow

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
So as for Jeffrey Epstein

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But the thing is Michael Allig

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Was in a very low social position

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And the thing is when someone is powerful

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Very high status

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And they do something

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
We are as kind of hierarchical animals

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
We kind of defer to their norms

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So if you're at a party

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
With let's suppose

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Either of us

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And it's like a Jeffrey Epstein party

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And everyone at the party is doing some sort of

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Weird drug we've never heard of

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
We wouldn't really feel comfortable

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Judging them because like their norms

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Kind of become the norm for that space

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
The lesson for me about Jeffrey Epstein

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
There's a lot of them

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Because I think to me the biggest moment

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Was the Amy Rohrbach situation

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Amy Rohrbach was caught on a hot mic

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Saying that they had all the goods on him

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
They had all the names

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And that Buckingham Palace called them

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
They killed the story because they weren't going to

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Get a Meghan Markle interview out of it

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
So that the willingness of those in power

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
To do the wrong thing

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
For the flimsiest pretext

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I think was a big important lesson

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
Also the fact that no one at ABC

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Had any consequences for this

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
In fact the only person who got in trouble for all this

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Was someone who used to work at ABC

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Went to I believe CBS

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And they got fired from CBS

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Because apparently they had access to footage at one point

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Even though they weren't the ones who had leaked it

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
So whistleblowers are like the only

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
For example the case in Eric Garner

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
The guy who was selling Lucy cigarettes in New York City

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Who was arrested

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
He had a heart attack or whatever it was on the way to jail

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
He died

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
The only person

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
So the cops had a situation

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
The only person who had gotten in trouble because of that

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Was the guy filming it

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Like he went to jail

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
So I think there is

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
There's a lesson in terms of

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
We look at Julian Assange right

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
There's a huge amount of power exercised by elites

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
To make sure that what is done on the cover of darkness

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Remains on the cover of darkness

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And also Kevin McCarthy

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Who was currently the house minority leader

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Leader of the Republicans

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
He wrote a letter to ABC News

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Like you had this guy

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Maybe you couldn't call in the authorities

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
But you could have leaked it to somebody

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Why hasn't anything come forward

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Nothing happened as a result of this

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
We also have to keep in mind that

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The longest serving Republican speaker of the House in history

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Dennis Hastert went to jail

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Because of things related to pedophilia and things like that

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
So as Russians

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And this is something I think you and I have mentioned before

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Americans are very naive

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Often decreasingly so

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
About the nature of evil

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
They think an evil person is someone who is getting kickbacks

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Or you know

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The Cuomo's are colluding

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I would hardly even call that evil

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
No, no this is

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The sort of things that are so depraved

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That you would never think about it in a million years

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
In your own home

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
You don't think in these terms

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And I think they get off

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
On doing things that

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
If the average person heard about it

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The average person would be shocked

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Because that gives them this sense of we're above them

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
We're different from them

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
The rules don't apply to us

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
There's a lot to say here

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So one is the norm thing you said at a party

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
It's really interesting

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
For an NR cast to say that

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Well no

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm not sorry

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It came off as criticism

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I meant it as harsh criticism

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I think about that a lot

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I found myself in situations

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Where I'm invited

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
To these kinds of parties

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Where people have nice things

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And I find it deeply

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Uncomfortable for that reason

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't want to be sort of an activist

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
That goes in and ruins a party

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I think that's

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
That's not the courageous act

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Neither is the courageous

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
When everyone's doing some weird drug

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
That you mentioned to join in I think

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Courageous is more

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Remaining yourself

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Sticking to your principles

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Calmly in that room

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Where everybody is doing the drug

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And just don't do the drug

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Don't do it

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And I think

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That little act of courage

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Over time is the way you resist

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Exactly the thing you said

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Is probably the situation

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Where charisma works

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So one charismatic person gets a little crowd going

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And the crowd

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Is everybody

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Establishes a norm

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
At the little crowd

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And yes there could be some dynamics

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
That allow that norm to be established

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
That rich and powerful people might

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Enjoy

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Being rich and powerful

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And better than everybody else kind of

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Kind of thing

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Especially for scientists

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I thought they should have integrity

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And courage enough to

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
See through that

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Not again as an activist

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So you can tweet about it

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
How courageous you are

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
There's something off here

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm not going to participate in it

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I'm going to defend these scientists because

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Something off, first of all

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
You're always defending academia, it's disgusting

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It's my favorite thing

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I think that, first of all

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
This is going to sound like a joke and it's not

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I bet you 90%

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Of those MIT scientists are on the spectrum

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So everyone they're going to meet is going to be off

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Right? So I'm sure part of their brain

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Is like okay this person is weird

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
This is just them being on the spectrum

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Like the light spectrum, I couldn't even finish the joke

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Number two is

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Off

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
We tend to

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
There's this poem, I forget who wrote it

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
It was like Nick Cave or something

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And it was describing

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I think it was Goebbels

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Hair, normal, height, normal

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Weight, normal

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
What do you expect, horns, right?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
So when you meet someone

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You think something's off

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
There's going to be a bell curve of what that could be

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It could be that they're twitchy

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
They're completely asocial

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And then you have Jeffrey Epstein over here

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
You're going to need a lot of evidence

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
To be like oh I feel something off there

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
For this guy's the head of an international

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Sex trafficking ring

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
So yeah you might be like

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Okay, but at the same time if their extended

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Relationship is this guy is interested in

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
My work, he's going to fund my work

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And I don't have to give him anything in return

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
He's clearly intelligent, he's appreciating it

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And being a scientist is a

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Thankless job

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I know what it's like as an author

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
When I was writing Dear Reader, the North Korea book

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
My friends are sick of hearing all these North Korea

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Anecdotes because at a certain point it's like

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Okay we get it, just save it for the book

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And you know you've got to be in that lab

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
You're looking at the springtails, whatever it is you're looking at

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
No one knows what a springtail is

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I just disagree with you

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So that'd be interesting to draw the distinction

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Between science and writing

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Because the scientific process itself

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Is fun as fuck

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
You're solving little puzzles

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's rewarding

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
The reason you go into

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Science is you can continue

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Really without a boss to continue having

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Fun and solving puzzles

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
That's literally

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So like

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Unless you become cynical and tired

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Of the whole thing, so the people

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Of the administration or when you're running a large lab

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And what you get sick of

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Is the emails and the meetings and all that kind of stuff

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
The actual act

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Of being in the lab is still

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Fun as fuck

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
If you allow it to be

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Writing I feel like

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
There's more priority to publishing

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Like would you enjoy it

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
The tree falling in the forest, would you still enjoy

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Any of the books you've written

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
If they never got published

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Not to the same extent, not even close

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Right, I think that the thing about

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Science, it's almost like you get a

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Peak into the mysterious

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah but this is, okay, this is where I'm

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Coming from

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Just moving to Austin, I bought 150

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Over 150 plants

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Look how you're doing the politician thing

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Look, let me

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Let me be clear, alright

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It's not

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
You are running in 2024

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
This is very interesting

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I bought 150 succulents from my house

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
They're thriving here in Austin as they wouldn't have in Brooklyn

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
You have a great video about it

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah, one of those plants I have is

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
The photo I took on my Instagram, there's no other photos

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
On the whole internet, none of my friends

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Care, or they care like ostensibly

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
But like oh that's cool, like I have a better

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Plant collection in my house than

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Like almost any botanical succulent

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Collection than any botanical garden in America

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Than probably the Huntington, and no one cares

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
This is what ego looks like by the way

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I can prove it to you

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
No I know but you don't have to rub it in

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Well they have a big budget, I don't

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
So if I can put it together they should be

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Able to, so I can

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Only imagine that a scientist

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Who studied, you know

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Those spiders that look like ants

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Like at a certain

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Oh and this species does this

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
With the gender dimorphism

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Their friends are only going to care so much

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
So if you meet someone who has a lot of money

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Who now cares about ant spiders

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It's going to be exciting to you

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah it will be very exciting, but

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I just wanted to push back on the

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I think the act itself

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Should be the biggest reward

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I think you're always safe

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
We're talking about goodness

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Being a safe default

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I think a good default

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
For plants and for writing

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And for science

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Is to just enjoy the act

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Even if nobody cares

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Okay now I'm

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Wondering why I'm pushing back so hard

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And I realized what it was

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Because I've made this point

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Several times and I'm glad I can make it again

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
There's this window of time

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
That happened in my life

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And I know it happens to a lot of people

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
We're like 24 to 27

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
28, right?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
So 21 to 24, you still have your friends from college

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
So on and so forth, right?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
But then it's kind of like a poker game

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And every so often people cash out

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
They're like I'm out, I'm out, they get married

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
They get a job, they move

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And if you are someone who is a young, ambitious

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Creative, that window

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Is a very rough one

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Because you're doing the right thing

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And you're not being a drug addict

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
You're not being a philanderer

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You're playing by the rules

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
You're creating your stuff

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
What you want to be known for

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Contribution you want to make for the world

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
And no one cares and it gets very lonely

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And there's this very emotional

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Disconnect about how is it

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That I'm creating

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And I'm working hard

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
And I'm making something happen

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And it's just radio silence

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I don't think it's that easy

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You're the scientist, not me

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
When you don't have any kind

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Of external validation

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Humans only have so much fuel

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Nothing worth having

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Is easy, Michael

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
By the way, yesterday

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I talked on the phone with a person

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
He said he was deeply moved

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
The first time you mentioned this age group

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Of 24 to 27

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
He's 26, he said

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And he feels the full

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Responsibility of that and the excitement

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So he left his

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Corporate typey job

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
To pursue something that he's really passionate about

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And that was

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You were an inspiration to him

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Which I was deeply saddened by that

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I also inspired Michael Alex

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
The amount of mass murder

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Those that were inspired by you will eventually

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Lead to is truly

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Horrifying

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
What were we talking about

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
One thing I wanted to ask you

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Let's put scientists aside

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
What about

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
World leaders

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Bill Clinton

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Your favorite person

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Why would he fly with Jeffrey Epstein

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Why would he

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Interact with that guy

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I mean, don't you think

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
That's kind of the deal

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
That I'm the president

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
And I get big and powerful

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
People flying around their jets

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And that's the symbiotic relationship

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah, but don't you also have

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
A good BS detector

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Don't you have a good detector for

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
People who just want to be in your

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Presence

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I already understand that

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
There's people like this out there

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
There's people that kind of

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Want to use me for stuff

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
You mean Tim Dillon

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I love that guy

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
We haven't met yet here

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
We met before in New York

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
But we had not since I moved here

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You should be able to detect

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
That there's those people and there's the people

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
That have kindness in their heart

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Even if they can benefit from the interaction with you

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
But they're good human beings

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I feel like you want to

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You run into a lot of trouble if you surround yourself

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Or have any people that are

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Manipulative

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
But I think you make a bad example

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Let's look at Clinton and let's look at Obama

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
So Obama, even though their politics

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
They're very close I'd say in many ways

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Obama is

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Apparent, we don't know, I don't know either of them

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
But to me it seems very apparent that he's

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Very similar behind closed doors as he is

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
In front of the camera

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
He's baroque to me

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
He's good

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Clinton seems very clearly

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
To be much more of a performer

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
He's in front of the camera as he puts on a roll

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
But behind the camera he very much has a temper

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
He's known for that

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
He's much more of a lech

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Perfect

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Lech with an E?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
L-E-T-C-H, yeah

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
That's a cool term

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I can use that on the internet

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You're a lech

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
You're a dirty lech

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Dirty is implied

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
It's being redundant

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
It just feels like

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
He needs an adjective to give it more power

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I'm sorry

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Clinton is a lech

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
You can see how

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
There's people who want to meet

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
The surface, Bill Clinton

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
And I'm sure that gets old for him because he has to be on

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
But then there's the good old boys

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Where he could be a pervert

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And this guy's like, yeah, I know what it's like

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
And then he feels like he's himself

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
But we're all speculating

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't know what Bill Clinton is like

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
What was in it for him

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
He certainly could afford private chats if he wanted to

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
There's no shortage of people who want to fly around the world

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
To give speeches

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Can he satisfy

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
The lech within

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Without hanging out

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
With the Jeffrey Epstein's of the world

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
This is the Monica Lewinsky

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Question to me

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm confused by all of this

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Can't he get women

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
In a legitimate way

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Of not using his power

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Not hanging out with these

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Shady rich people

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But just having a

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Normal mistress like JFK

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Well, JFK had a lot

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I know, I understand that, but in a normal way

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Or I don't know enough about JFK

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I don't understand

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
The Clinton psychology

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
First of all, the fact that you're

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Hooking up with someone who's close to your daughter's age

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
To me, I think

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Is inherently disturbing

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
But she's an adult, so okay, that's not

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
That, that, you know, beyond the pale

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
But

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Also the idea that, oh, if I don't

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Physically fornicate with you

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It's not cheating

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Like that, whatever you tell yourself

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Or like if I don't ejaculate, it's not

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Cheating, like

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
These rules

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Maybe it leads to some kind of slippery slope

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Like you start not having the rules

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
But who you fool

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I mean, if you told your wife, like, listen

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
It wasn't cheating, she only, you know

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Performed on me

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
You're gonna say this with a straight face

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
At a certain point when something is so

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Brazen, you wonder if the person

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Has to believe it, because

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It's not fooling

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
But, like, we started this conversation

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
With, there is a line between

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Young women older than 18

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Young teens, like 12, 13

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Kids

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Have you, when's the last, oh, it's different for you

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Because you're at MIT

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I was hanging out with Blair White

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
And she had a couple of fans

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Of hers, and they were like 22, 23

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And they were like children to me

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Like, I'm like

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
To me, as someone who is in his late 60s

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
To look at these people

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
As adults

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Like, they look completely like kids

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
So

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Now, of course, there's exceptions, like

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I've interacted with young 20-year-olds

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
That are like

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
You're way more mature

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Than I'll ever be, like

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
The wisdom that comes out of them is quite fascinating

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Visually

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
The energy and the way they look

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
They looked so young to me

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And the way they carried themselves

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
It was, the idea that

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
My instinct

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Was, let's tuck you in and read you

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
A bedtime story, not let me

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Like, touch you or something, it was just like

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Like, it just wouldn't enter my head

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
So, there's

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
But the thing is, is it

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Possible that in order to want to be the president

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
You have to be a crazy person

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
That you have some kind of weird

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
View on power

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
It could be a power thing, too

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Like, you can get away with stuff

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Like, if I was Clinton's age

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Nothing about Monica Lewinsky

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
To me would be

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Attractive, and also I would just feel bad

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
For her, because I know she's going to catch feelings

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
And it's kind of like

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Catch feelings, yes, sure, this is very true

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It's just like, why would I do this to this kid

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
For what, just because I want to get some

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Momentary pleasure, come on

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I'm sure she looked

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Gorgeous to him in the moment

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Well, let me ask

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
We started talking about beauty

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Who are you wearing?

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
So, as a model

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
You usually

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Don't have a shirt on when you're modeling

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So, it's nice to see you

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Dressed up today

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Nice and warm

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
This is because, so, for those who don't know

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
For Russians, don't celebrate Christmas

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Christmas, obviously, with the Soviet Union

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Christmas was illegal, no Thanksgiving

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Basically, no major

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Holidays where everyone gets together

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
This is the one holiday, New Year

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Instead of, I remember as a kid

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Instead of Santa Claus, we have

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Who's the same thing, basically

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It's like Android and iPhone

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It's like a cheap version of Christmas

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
He's got this girl with him, she's like Snow White

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
And Russian kids

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
They go to sleep on December 31st

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And they wake up January, they have a present under their pillow

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And I remember as a kid

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
This happened once

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
And it just blew my mind

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It's just like, I went to bed

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And my dad's like, oh, you know, you're going to have

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Timur is going to bring your present if you've been a good kid

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I'm like, I think I was a good kid

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
But you don't even remember a year of your life when you're four

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You remember like two weeks

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And then I woke up

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
And there was a present under my pillow

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And it just blew my mind

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That building is still there

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
1461 Sherwood Parkway in Brooklyn

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
It's just also funny

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
What I really like about kids

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Being an uncle now is kid logic

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Because they have very little bit of data

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
But they're using logic to make sense of it

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And sometimes it gives them the completely wrong conclusions

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
For the completely right reasons

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I remember

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
My bedroom as a kid was right off the kitchen

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And I'd be scared of the dark a little bit

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
So they'd leave the light on the kitchen while I went to sleep

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And at the same time

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
My parents had told me

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
You don't leave the lights on the house

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
It costs money, it wastes electricity, right?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So I would be worried

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Because I'm like, oh my god, my parents leave the lights on the kitchen all night

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
And now it's costing them so much money

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Not realizing that five minutes after I'm out

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Obviously they're turning the lights off

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
But like in my kid logic, this was a concern of mine

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Yeah, and memories work that same way

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
A collection of memories that are stitched together logically somehow

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
But they also don't really make sense

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
There's a few defining things

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
So I grew up in Russia and experienced a lot of new years in Russia

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
There's a lot of incredible things about that tradition

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
That just warms my heart

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
So one, as a kid

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
You mentioned these kinds of stories

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
That's the one night of the year that kids are allowed to be adults

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
In the following way

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
In kid logic

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You're allowed to stay up all night

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
That was as late as you want

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Which actually ends up being

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You're not used to it

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
You crash

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
But no, you get to two, three, four at night

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You stay up

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
And you get to witness

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
It's almost like Alice in Wonderland goes into this world

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
You get to witness

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
What is the adult world really like

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Now, obviously it's not an actual adult world

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
A lot of drinking and fighting

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Marryment

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Like laughing, fighting, arguing

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
But also, in our case

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Singing

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Arguing

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Philosophical stuff

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
But also

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
If I may

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
How would I describe it?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
This is also probably a little bit Russian culture

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
But flirtation in all of its forms

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Meaning men and women

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Just being like

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Because they dress up

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It's joy

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
You get to show off

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Dresses

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Whatever you got

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
You show it off, this is fun

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Men too

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Friends laughing

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Arguing

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Showing off the best they got

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
With delicious food

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
There's a Thanksgiving element there

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Where there's just so many

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
You bring out all the traditional stuff

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Salad

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Everything

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
The full thing with the desserts

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Vodka, a lot of vodka

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
And at the time

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So this is the Soviet Union

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Like the biggest stuff

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And this is so sad that these are the things I remember

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Is like Coca-Cola

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Oh yeah

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Like American

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I would probably kill somebody

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
For a Dr. Pepper

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It's so fascinating that

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
You take it for granted

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Sort of the results of capitalist

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Society

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And the real things that are created

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
But that was the ultimate

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Happiness

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Is to experience this new thing

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Sugar

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I don't know

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
There's like communist Coca-Cola

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
In Czech Republic

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
So basically they tried to rip off Coke

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And it's just like

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
They just threw whatever they could together

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
And it was a very poor

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Knock off as you can imagine

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I forget what it's called and all the Czech people right now are getting very angry at me

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Because I can't think of it

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
But they have it now

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
And the slogan is good or weird

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
So it's like this

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
So they kind of reclaimed this kind of hipster soda

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh that's awesome

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
It's almost like a parody

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
But I think the

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Thing I really remember is the camaraderie

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Like the

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Love for each other

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And neighbors too

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Like

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Like you and I are neighbors now

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
We don't see each other that often

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I hope that changes but a lot of it is also me

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm just a deep introvert

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
You're also the hardest working person I know

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Yeah so it's time but you know

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Like

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
It's not like I'll go

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
In the middle of the night at like 4am

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And go to 7-Eleven and just sit there

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Sipping a slurpee

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
For an hour thinking about life

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
So it's not like I'm always

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Working

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah I don't know what I mean is like you get to meet your neighbors

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And you get to experience their

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Their highs and their lows

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
And you get to bitch about life

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
About government, about corruption

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
About the unfairness of life together

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Well it's also I think what people

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Don't appreciate as Americans is

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's very rare in Russia to have a safe space

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Yeah

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
So you know that January 1st

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
No one's going to snitch on you

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
You know they're not going to be informants

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Probably so you can vent

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
And you know that's the thing

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
With people in totalitarian countries

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
You have to have the public facing

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Persona and then behind closed doors

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Is very different

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I also remember the arguments and I've been

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Going on

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Clubhouse recently into Russian rooms

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh Jesus

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Well just to practice Russian

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And they it's so beautiful

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
To watch I mean clubhouse

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Is a very specific collection

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Of Russian people maybe it's a little bit

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Political but

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
And they're a little bit older

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And it's interesting

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
To watch how much they love

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
To argue

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And so like it will

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Be literally

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
You can think of it as a nonlinear

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Dynamical system okay from an engineering

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Perspective

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It whenever any

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Positive topic comes up

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
You could feel the skepticism

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And then wait a minute this is not good

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
And they'll start like

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Perturbing it until

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
You're like they'll find

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Some way to say like come on

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Now that is the dumbest thing I've ever

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Heard and then it goes back into argument

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
It's so fun to watch because

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
In one sense you could see it as

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Negative in another

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
You could see it as free to express yourself

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Because

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
It feels like you can solve a lot

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Of problems by allowing

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Yourself to just be emotional

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Both emotional

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
And say hard truth and all those kinds of things

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Without like

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Without patting yourself on the back

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
About it but also

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It just sort of those

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Russian rooms

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Make me realize how constrained American

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Speech is how careful people

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Are in the way they express it even

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
The Michael mouses in the world you're

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Constantly being like nuanced

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
There they just say crazy shit

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
And then they correct themselves and

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Make fun of themselves and they completely

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Shift opinions a minute later

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And it's chaos

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I mean it's beautiful

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So I love that that culture

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
It's funny given the current

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Regime in Russia like how

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That's coupled with how people

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Are talking and

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yeah I don't know and I have

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Those memories of childhood of

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Friends that I had of

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Just having that true freedom of

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Talking and somehow that leads to

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Deep bonds together

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
When the life

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
When you're poor when life

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Has a lot of elements that are

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Unfair when the government is

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Corrupted it's just

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Especially in the Soviet Union

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
There's uncertainty about the future all of it

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
You just get closer together like

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Penguins huddling together in the cold

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Like that march of the penguins movie

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
That I don't know

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
The friends I've gotten there

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Like

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I get

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Emotional every time I kind of

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Think about those friends because it was

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
So close that friendship was so

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Fucking close but I just really hate

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
The Russian cynicism I know

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You do and I actually disagree with you about

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
It you see it as cynicism

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I see it as

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Waves on top of the water like

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Surface cynicism and the

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Depths as I see the beauty of the

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Russian soul so we like

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Yes that cynicism can

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Negatively affect a lot of people like you

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I think you've talked about like as a parent

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Like

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Being cynical about the world

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And then you have dire

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Negative consequences on your children they become

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Cynical they don't ever take big risks

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
To take on bold things

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
And I have those arguments

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Because the cynicism is exhausting

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
It's destructive it's anti

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Creative but

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
So in their perspective is this

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
What the Russian folks would say well yes that's

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Our role like

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Being cynical is being

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Reasonable about the world but it's not

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It's completely unreasonable it's a complete

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Lie I know but

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Their argument is yes but

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
We're giving you this force

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
And it's your job to resist against it

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So it's a test

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I love the idea that if you're

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Going to be creative and innovative you don't

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Have enough up against you yeah exactly

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
This is exactly oh I don't I don't it's not hard

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Enough already that I want to be an author now you

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Gotta be like well what let me just put some fire ants

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
On top of it so

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I just want to separate

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I agree with you that the cynicism

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Is bad and destructive

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
But the idea

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
That life is suffering

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Thinking from that as a first principle

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I think there's a lot of beauty to be

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Discovered through that so there's a cynicism

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And then there's a horrible

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Message

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Life is suffering

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Not

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Well yeah I mean Camus

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Camus doesn't think that

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Now we're going into definitions

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Of suffering then

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Because absurd

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Life is absurd and life is suffering

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Are not even close to the same concept

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Well then you're just defining the terms differently

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Well that's because they're different terms

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
So is love and beauty

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
So let's define terms

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Wait you're telling if your baby's in the crib like with a fever

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
You're like oh that's absurd no it's the kid's suffering

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
It's not the same

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
So yes starvation you've been

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
For white pill researching a lot of actual

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Specifically defined suffering

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Sure but also a lot of

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Wonderful things

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Right yeah yeah but the

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
The word suffering can encompass

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
More than just specifically

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Starving and

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It can

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Like a lot of the philosophers

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Talk about it it encompasses

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Philosophical suffering the fact that there is

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
If you're not careful

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Life can appear meaningless

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
You can fall into a nihilistic

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
View like it's

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
It's difficult to have the responsibility

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Of freedom to act in this

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
World because you can fuck up in so many

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Different ways and then

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Life is seemingly unfair

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
In the sense that

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Good things happen

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
For no apparent

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Reason and terrible things happen for no

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Like what you know it's the old

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Religious question of why does evil

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Happen in the world

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Why do terrible things happen in the world

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
There's this book called Six Word Memoirs

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Right where all these different personalities

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Were you in it?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I'm in it with

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You had to basically write your autobiography in six words

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And mine was good things happen

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
To bad people

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
See there you go there's humor

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
That's your way of dealing with the suffering

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
But I don't think life is inherent

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
If life was suffering we wouldn't be able to have

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Happiness

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Out of suffering

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Happiness is born

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
It's the ups and downs of life

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
What it means like

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I don't agree at all

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
That you need to suffer

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
In order to be happy I agree you have to work hard

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
But that's not the same thing

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Yeah alright so the way I'm using suffering

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I think a lot of them use suffering

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Is the way you use like gravity

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
So in order for the roller coaster to work

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Working in gravity

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
There needs to be a force that brings you down

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
In that same way there's

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Like

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
You have to resist the natural

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Pole of nature

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
That wants to

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Destroy you

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Nature wants you

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Nature is indifferent

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But we have the capacity

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Because we're blessed with minds

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
And we're blessed with friends

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
To transcend nature

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I know but I think it's a word

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
That captures

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Something about life

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
That there's no

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Reason to it

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
That is absurd I think to me

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Oftentimes the way I think about the word suffering

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Is synonymous with absurdity

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
This is not suffering

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
But this is absurd

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I just noticed there's a box

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
With a big bow on it next to you

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
What's in the box Michael?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
It's your present so it's your present for new years

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Can we open it?

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Yeah sure

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
What's in the box?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
And you brought up suffering this is going to be very unpleasant

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I packed it myself

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Yeah there's a whole process in there

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
So there's three presents in there

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Lex

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I'll read the card first

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Something about opening presents

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Like tearing stuff

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Makes me feel like

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Because I just tore this sheet of paper

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
So it will never be the same again

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It's entropy

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
You've got a powerful voice

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
You've got a powerful voice

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
To Lex

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Thank you

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Maybe I should read the other card first

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
You've got a powerful voice

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I have to say always puts me in a hopeful place

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I feel like this is building up to something

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
You show me

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
How change can happen when you face the world

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
With pride, confidence

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
And a voice that can't be silenced

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Keep speaking up

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
The world is listening

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
There's no cynicism in this card

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
No this is about new years

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
This is all about hope and joy

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
To Lex

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
To Lex

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Thank you for setting the path

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
To move to Austin

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
0-1-0-0-1

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
0-0-1

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
0-1-1-0-1-1

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
0-0-0-1-1

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
1-0-1-0-1

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Michael Mouse

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Brings tears to my eyes

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Thank you brother

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
My pleasure

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Let's get to the present

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
It's a PC box

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
This is very promising

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It better not be sex toys

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
There's nothing

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
There's nothing inappropriate

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Why would it

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Why would sex toys be inappropriate

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Because you're a virgin

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You gotta bring a knife to a party

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
How clever is it to put it in a PC box

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Well I had it

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I just got a new PC

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
There's also a can

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Open the can first

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Do you wrap this yourself?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
That scared the shit out of me

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Get back in the can

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That actually stayed in there

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Just gotta cut the string

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
No

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
You're the most beautiful troll of all

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I love you so much

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
This is awesome

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Did it not work?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Pick it up

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh it didn't work

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
There's a terrifying springy

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Feeling to this thing

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I don't want to open this

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I need to move something aside

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I don't want to open this

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I need to move something aside

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I hate you so much

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
What

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Oh is it the other way

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
No just pick it up

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I can't believe I fell for that

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I hate you so much

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Wrenches are my favorite

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I can't believe I fell for that

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Okay

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And there's box number three

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
It's like a matryoshka

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I can't believe that worked

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I wanted the box to open

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
All these gears to fall out

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But you can't get any

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Does that really work

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I can't believe that worked

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I can't believe that worked

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I can't get any

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Does that really grind your

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You know what grinding is

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Why am I scared

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Okay

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
There's another box

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This leads to my death

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
No no this isn't

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
This is the story behind it

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I can't believe that worked

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Oh god that's so good

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Alright no springs

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
No weapons

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Okay so let me tell you

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
The story behind that toy

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Tonka robots that

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Turn into vehicles

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So when I was a kid

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You had transformers

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But for us poor people

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You had go bots

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So the go bots

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
There were four main characters for the good guys

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It was leader one, small foot turbo

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And scooter

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And what was annoying is when you had the action figures

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
You couldn't find the ones

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
That were on the TV show

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And I was a big go bots fan as a kid

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And I went once to the Toys R Us

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
In Caesars Bay in Brooklyn with my grandfather

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
My grandfather was always very lucky

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Like just good things happened to him every so often

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And I went there

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I remember very vividly

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They must have just unpacked

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Just loaded the shelves

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And how they had the shelving it would be like a grid

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It was like one, two, three, four, five

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Five rows

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And like five by five

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And I remember it was like two up

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And then you have to do it

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
You have to sit by the side and kind of sort through them

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And with the go bots each package had a picture of the different figures

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So the packaging wasn't uniform

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And they just had scooter there

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
She was just sitting there

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And I was like holy crap

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So that feeling

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
When you're a kid and you find that

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Just sitting on the shelf

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It was such the symbol

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Is this that scooter?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No, I have it though, but that one is for you

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I thought if you want to put it next to your other robots

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You can open it up

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah, yeah, it's for you

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's that symbol of joy when you have

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
When you're a kid, when you find something you really want

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I think it just is really

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So when people look at it they'll be like

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Don't be hopeless

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I'll open this carefully later

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Should I do it now?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
There's no way to open it carefully

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Kids don't open stuff carefully, you rip that crap open

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
But then you break it and then you cry

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's what happens when you're a kid

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I never did that

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Me neither, I never cried

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I never got presents either

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
That is so cool

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Alright, scooter

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You symbolize

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Child-like discovery

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Right?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The poor

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
The poor man's robot

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
The poor man's transformers

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I think there's instructions

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
On the back how to transform her

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
To her?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I only found out as an adult that it was supposed to be a girl

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
There's everything

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
No, give me here, let me show you

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It looks better when she's transformed

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
What?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
No, there's levels to that statement

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
How does it do like this?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Let me see if I remember how to do it

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Because I had this as a kid

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Arms out

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The thing is these are easy to break

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I remember

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Is it like this?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
No, the front comes out

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Let me see this

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Oh, this comes up, yeah

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So that's that

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The arms go

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I'm having visions of

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Baby Michael

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I can't do it

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I can't figure it out

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Wow, you're right, she looks so much better

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Transformed

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Alright

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I'm going to follow the instructions in a bit

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I'll leave this failed

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Project of yours

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
There's a wheel out

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I don't like this

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
In between form

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Well, this is how

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It's going to be

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Because we're going to be accepting of the

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Transformation

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That takes time

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I got

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I saw this

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Oh, it's this

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Congress

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It's a bracelet

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
The reason I got it

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Is because there's two bracelets

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
One said lucky fuck

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And the other one said resist

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Now I first saw resist

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And then I saw the lucky fuck

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And I realized I'm a lucky fuck

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
To find a relevant

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
It makes me think of you

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
This is very nice

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Resist the powerful

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
That's true

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I saw this somewhere

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Oh yeah

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
This has to do with

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
In terms of resist

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
You often bring up the book

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Machiavellians by James Burnham

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So I was looking through

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I was reading different parts

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It's a tricky read

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
It's a little bit

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But there is an ebook kindle version

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Now that I've been working through

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I think there's actually an audio book too

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Anyway

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So the Machiavellians is

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
James Burnham's analysis of four

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Thinkers that he regards

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
As the Machiavellians

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Gaetano Mascaux, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorrel

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm blanking on the

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Mascaux, Pareto, Sorrel

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And Georges Michel

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And I just got Pareto's

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Autograph in the mail this week

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
So

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
He talks about freedom

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And liberty

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
This interesting

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Line

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That I'd like to get your opinion on

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
In terms of resist and in terms of liberty

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
There's no one force

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
There's no one force, no group

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And no class that is the preserver

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Of liberty

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Liberty is preserved by those who are against

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
The existing chief power

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Oppositions

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That do not express genuine social forces

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Are as trivial

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
In relation to entrenched power

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
As the old court jesters

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I mean the question here is

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Are you comfortable with that

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Definition

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Or that view of liberty

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Of freedom

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That at its highest ideal is expressed

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Through the resistance to the powerful

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
As opposed to existing in its own

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I think his point

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Which I agree with

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Is the only thing that can work

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
To mitigate power

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Is other power

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That it's

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Talk is cheap

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And persuasion

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Has very limited efficacy

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It's like

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
If there's a burglar

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And one person will give you a speech

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
About property rights and you shouldn't be in this person's house

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And the other person has a gun

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It's clear which is

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Going to be more persuasive

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yeah but

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Can't you just be free without

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
This struggle

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Without this conflict

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What I'm uncomfortable with this view

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Is how closely

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It links

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Freedom and conflict

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Like why does this world

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Have to have conflict for you to be free

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I mean

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Part of it is just emphasis

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
When you're just saying suffering is what leads to joy

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
See and now you're in agreement

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Thank you

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I just did that just so you can come around and agree

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I win

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Next topic

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Wow I'm playing 3D

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Chess here

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Okay

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
This is New Years

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
This is now

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
December 31st

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I think that's how it works but in 1973

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
We recorded this before you were born

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Oh no

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Years after you were born

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You look great for 60

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Early 60s

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Sure

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
What

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Five things

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Or moments in 2021

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Are you grateful for

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Or people

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't know

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Moments, beautiful experiences

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Profound

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Essences of the year

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Like looking back

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What are the cool things

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Personally or socially

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Do you exist

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Like in a platonic way socially

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Oh in your personal life

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Anything

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
You're both

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You're now Michael Malice

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
You exist as a social entity

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And a personal human being

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
The whole thing

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
What stands out to you about 2021

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
The fact that for the first time in my life

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So in your city

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That was a very big one

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And there's no part of me that regrets it

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Or misses New York

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So that was a very big deal for me

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
What do you

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
About this move

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
About Austin itself

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But maybe the move itself

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Maybe just the act of moving

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
What's great about it to you

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The fact that

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I had forgotten

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
What it's like to have a huge

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
In New York, which I had in New York

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Before people started falling away

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And then it really escalated as a result of

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
De Blasio and the COVID restrictions

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So to have a big crew here

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Is something that was very

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Validating

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The thing that's also exciting about Austin

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Is that

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Boston is not a particularly big town

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It's not a particularly great town

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
But everyone here, at least in the circles I travel in

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Is kind of a refugee

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
From their towns

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
There's a sense of camaraderie

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
There's the sense of we're building something together

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Back in New York, when you meet someone

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It would be like, who is this person?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Why am I talking to them?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Are they going to be weird?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And here there's very little of that

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I think there's much more sense of trust with one another

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
When you meet new people

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
So that's something that's really exciting about

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I've been introducing all my friends to each other

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And everyone's been hitting it off

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Like gangbusters, it's really great

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
So I really enjoy that about Austin

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I'm enjoying the weather, the space

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You heard Kerouac

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Any of his stuff?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I have, on the road I read, and I read a biography of him

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I don't know if it was on

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I think it was on the road

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
He talked about that feeling

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
When you go into some place

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You're leaving a place

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And you're going somewhere else

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And the place you're leaving disappears

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Behind you

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And all the people

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
You just think about that life

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's gone, and there's some inkling of that

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Where

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You get to realize

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You're almost mortality

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Because, okay, that's a chapter

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And there's not many more

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I know it's a beautiful chapter

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
But now on to the next chapter

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Is there a melancholy feeling there?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
No, it's the opposite, I feel like I've been given a new lease on life

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Because I didn't realize to what extent

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
There was this subtext of hopelessness in New York

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And also people who

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
In New York you don't appreciate

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It consciously, but you can't escape it emotionally

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
How much the winters get to you

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Psychologically

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It's tough, it gets dark so early

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It gets cold, you can't walk around

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
That's the thing that's fun about, or was fun about New York

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Is that when the weather's warm you can walk for an hour

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And just enjoy the sunshine

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And there's a lot to see and do

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But in the winter you don't have any of that

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's brutal

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So that is something

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
There's no melancholy at all

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Well that's because there's

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
There's something beautiful about New York

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Not the way it is now, but the way it

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I could go on for days about how great New York was

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
What did you learn about

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Human civilization

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And just life that was beautiful from New York

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I learned

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That there's a lot

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Of

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Really

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Unique special people out there

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Who are doing their little part

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
To move the envelope and make the world a better place

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And that when you have

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
A

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
City

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Where they're all there together at the same time

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Then that really moves the world

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And I'm thinking of Paris in the 20s

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And Harlem in the 20s

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And New York in the 70s

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And LA in the late 60s

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And San Francisco especially in the late 60s

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Things like this

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
They really punch above Detroit certainly

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And it's heyday, they punch above their weight

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And just really kind of

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Philadelphia in 1700s

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Things really start happening

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And that ripples throughout the world

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You think Austin has a chance

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
To be a Paris

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
In some way

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because again it wasn't all of Paris

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
It was the left bank of Paris

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and all of them

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
In a little area

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So when you read these history books, these scenes

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It's like 50 people

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
In a 10 block radius

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
These aren't these huge Davos conventions

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Okay, so the move

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
The big move

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
What else? What else stands out to you?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Again, both personally and socially

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Zooming in and zooming out

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I did a book with the UFC fighter

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And I was making the point

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
That he was a nine time world champion

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
That I would never be as good

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
At my job as he was at his

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And then when I dropped Anarchist Handbook

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
In May

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And it was the top

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Non-fiction book on Amazon

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
For like most of a day

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I was like, oh I'm the top non-fiction writer in America

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Just for today

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I was like, oh crap, okay, so I guess I was wrong

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That was a major deal

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I was still shocked and delighted

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
By the way, congratulations

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I'm truly happy for you, man

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I'm so proud

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But it's also

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I'm proud

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Because these are people

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Who had points of view

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And they didn't have it easy

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And they fought for what they believed in

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And insofar as I get to

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Rescue them

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
To some extent from the dustbin of history

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And say these people really mattered

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And they really are worth hearing

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That I love

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I love stuff like that

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I was talking to a friend of mine

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Tofer, like a year ago

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Because we're in a weird position

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
With what kind of jobs we have

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So I'd be talking on my live streams

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
About people like Candy Darling or Wallace Thurman

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
These are not household names at all

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And then I'd be proud of myself

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That I'm the one who brings them to some sort of

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
More prominence

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And then you want to tell yourself, well get over yourself

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Who you think you are

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
But no one else is talking about these people

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Or very few

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
So to be able to give them

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Some kind of stature and platform that they deserve

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I love being able to do that

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So you have a strong voice yourself

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
To sort of join them in

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It's like John Lennon

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Joining in with the Beatles

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's like a

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Chorus of very different

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Views on anarchism

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It's celebrating the individuals

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
It's celebrating the idea

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And you are

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I think will be remembered as

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
A powerful philosophy yourself

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But like you're almost taking

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Just the humility

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Of being in a room with powerful minds

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Together in one book, it's cool

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yeah, and these people mattered

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And they had a unique perspective

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And as I said in the introduction

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
To the book, I remember I was in college

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And we were studying bioethics

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And there was like a graph

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
In the book

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And one part says antinomianism

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Which was the view that, one side said

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Legalism, right, the two extremes

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Legalism is what is

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Legal is defined by the government

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Or what is moral is defined by the government

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And one said, antinomianism, which is

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Legalism stands above moral law

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And then there was like, well, since no one believes in this

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The answer is something to the other side

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's like, well, why is it under charge

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
If it has a name, someone believes in it

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
You know, anarchism is a word

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's bandied about in a

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Dismissive way

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And it's like, you don't have to like me or agree with what I'm saying

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But you can't pretend that they weren't

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Tolstoy, you're going to tell me Tolstoy

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Because nobody's talking about him completely

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
He's in there, he was an anarchist

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So it was a big accomplishment

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It was really cool to get a chance to

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Do the audiobook

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
You did an incredible thing

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Which is got a bunch of really cool people

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
To read

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
A lot of interesting, varied people

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah, so what I did for the audiobook, which I

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't like the idea

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
That hard work is inherently good

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Because sometimes being lazy is actually the right choice

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So I'm like, wait a minute

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Why am I reading all 23 chapters

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
When it's 23 different authors? Does it make sense?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So I hit my Rolodex and I had

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Different people read different chapters

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
To make it sound literally

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Like you have the different

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Voices in the book

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Thank you very much, you did my

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Because I was going to read my chapter, wait a minute

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Like all the other authors are being read by somebody else

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Let's have Lex read mine

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The one chapter I am most moved by

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Is Lauren Chen

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
She's a podcast as well

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
She's expecting now

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So we wish nothing but the best for Lauren and Liam

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And the babby

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I have a book by this guy named Charles Roger Plunkett

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Called Dynamite

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And he's advocating for

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Making bombs and killing people

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Killing, you know, the forces of capitalism

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Emma Goldman

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
It was published in her essay while she was on a lecture tour

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And she was just like, why is this in here?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
This is just really going to make us look bad

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So on and so forth

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And when you're dealing with any kind of

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
H.L. Menken has that quote about

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Every rational man

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Must at times be tempted to

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Spit on his hands, hoist the black

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Flag and begin slitting throats

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So I wanted to

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Sound like the

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Seductive aspect of

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Violence, like that's the problem

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
When you're dealing with terrorism, when you're dealing with

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Political violence

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
To be able to understand how people can fall

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
For this, how people can be persuaded

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
To think, this is a good

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Idea that I'm going to make some

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Dynamite and throw it into this crowd

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And kill, you know, police officers

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And innocent people possibly

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
In service of violence

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It's easy to say, oh, they're all crazy

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But they're not, you know

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Most people who are crazy don't

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Do these things, you know

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So to have a woman read that chapter

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And I told her

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Kind of read it like a phone sex operator

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Because I wanted to have that siren

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Song of like, so you can understand

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Why this calls out to people

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And the rope, the people who are like

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Marginalized, and she did such

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
A superb job with that chapter

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
That's such a beautiful

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Vision, yeah, because violence

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That's, violence is part of

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Human history

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
To a degree

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
That it must be seductive

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It must be, there must

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Be a strong pull, like it's not

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Insane people

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
There's something probably deep within

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Our nature that craves

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Violence, and then when there is

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Charismatic leaders that inspire that

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And revolution

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Plus violence

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I can see that being extremely seductive

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
To us, like when you're truly suffering

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
In your current situation

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Whatever it is, you're being oppressed by governments

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Or being oppressed by the powerful

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Violent revolution is

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Probably there's something deep within us

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
That longs for that

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And also this kind of, the Jelaine Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
To be that woman to be like

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
No, no, this is okay, honey

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Come along, it's not a big deal

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Don't listen to what your parents told you

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
They're just prudes, it's a siren song

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
What do you, what do you think about

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Jelaine Maxwell and the

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Trial and so on

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Again, maybe the interesting story

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
There is

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
About the coverage

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Of the trial, so like the story

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Is more complex and interesting than

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The actual horrific acts themselves

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
So to me, I don't

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Maybe I'm not knowledgeable enough

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But to me, she's also

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Truly evil

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I don't know where to

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Maybe you can help me to figure out

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Who is more evil

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
The

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Just like you said now, the person

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
That says it's okay, it's okay, that

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Helps the evil

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Doer, or is it the evil doer themselves

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I don't know, but I think she's a

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
She scares me more than Jeffrey

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Epstein somehow

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
There's people like that in the world

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Like a Twitter poll, do you think it's more evil or

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Less evil to kill someone

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Because you've been paid to do it

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And people

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
The winning answer was

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
More evil and I said it was

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Less, because I think

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
In that case, you can kind of check out

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You can be like, this isn't my, I'm just

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Doing a job

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
You kind of can, I think in a sense

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
If you have a certain

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Mindset, like intellect to remove yourself

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
From the situation, I'm just a conduit

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
When you're talking

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I haven't been following her case

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
That that much

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Because you mostly watch CNN, CNN's not covering it

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Well, I think

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
My broader point would be

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
People who are

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Untouchable

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And who know they're untouchable

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Do much worse things

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Than those of us

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Who aren't that way can appreciate

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Like I was just talking about

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
On Twitter

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
About Rosemary Kennedy

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
She was one of JFK's sisters

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
It's not clear whether she

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Was developmentally disabled

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Or had like depressive

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Mental illness, there was something

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Clearly off with her to some capacity

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And at age

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
23, they

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Gave her a lobotomy

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And the thing with the lobotomy is you have to be conscious

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
They don't put you under

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You have to be counting backwards while their scalp

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Is in your brain and they stop

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But they stopped

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
They did too far, she became

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Mentally like a two year old, you know, never had

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Bladder control for the rest of her life, couldn't really talk

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Or walk

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And when that happened, they

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Just put her away to some

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Home and they never mentioned her again

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
They didn't tell the brothers or sisters where she went

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
The lobotomy was only revealed in 1987

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And they pretended, oh, she's

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
In this home for kids with

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Special needs, and it's just like

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
That to me is very, very scary

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
That someone could

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Do this to their, that people

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I saw people respond like, oh, that was

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Cutting edge technology at the time, haha

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But I'm like, I don't think that that

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Was really

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Done that frequently or be

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Hearing more about it, all these botched

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Lobotomies, and my understanding is lobotomies are

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Very hard to

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Like, they would want to do

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
With someone like a mass murderer or like

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Someone's really bad, like if the person's left an

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Invalid, like, who cares kind of situation

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But when you're dealing with something like this

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Like, she's not killing

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
People, she's not assaulting people

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
She's just difficult because she's making

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Your vaunted family look bad

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
To you, that's, what is it, like

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Psychopathy or something like that, like you don't care

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
About, you just, you do horrific

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Things and you don't really care

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I can't diagnose Joe Kennedy

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
But what I would say

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Like with Jolene Maxwell, I can't

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Empathize because I don't

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
First of all, even in a positive

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Sense, I don't know what it's like to be

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Grooming my son to be the president

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And lost, you know, the other son

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
In war, I don't know what that's like

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I don't know what it's like to be so wealthy

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Like, you have to give Joe Kennedy

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Credit because a lot of what he was fighting for

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Was to allow, you know, Irish people

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And Catholic people acceptance

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Into like high society

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And he was up against a lot of pressure with that

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And he's like, I'm gonna, you know, screw these

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
People, I'm gonna be recognized and we're gonna make

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
People recognized so that somebody's set for that

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
But I mean

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I can't relate to people like him

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yeah

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
But I mean that

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Like is just terrifying

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Like, I mean, one of the big reasons

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Of an anarchist is

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Like when you have someone who has that sense of

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Amount of power over somebody else

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
A lot of times they're gonna do bad things

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And have no consequences

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Do you think

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
In the Maxwell case

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And Epstein case

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Do you think they were

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Trying to blackmail people

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Like trying what the conspiracy theory

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Is kind of described

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That's probably not too far away from

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Reality

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
That they intentionally tried to

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Put powerful people in compromising

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Situations

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So that they can

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Basically get more and more power

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Yeah, I think that was a Vanity Fair piece

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That you're referring to

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I'm sorry, I'm just referring to general concept

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
So there was an article that

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Broke this down because this article is

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The Fortune Business Week Vanity Fair

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Major, major reputable outlet

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And they

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
The reporter made the point, they asked around

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And they go, this guy's a billionaire

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Or extremely wealthy at least

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
No one I know ever traded with him

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Where's his money coming from? There's no paper trail

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So they're like, okay

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
If it's not trading

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And trades are public often, you know

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Where's his money coming from? And it's also like

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Why are all these people

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Allowing Epstein to be their business manager

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
When he has no kind of track record

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
To show for it? So the hypothesis was

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
He would get people

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Into uncompromising situations

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
With underage girls, secretly film it

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And then he would

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Blackmail them accordingly

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Well I guess that's the question

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I know it makes sense but I also see

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
A lot of evidence that he's just very

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Charismatic in a room

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And I've also seen

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
You know that's how

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Human connections get made

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Like business deals get made

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Where's his money coming from?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Oh like they, rich people

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Without blackmailing

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Just like

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Him close

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Like him as a friend

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I like Jeff Epstein

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Make sure you pull that quote

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I'm a business person, I like Jeff Epstein

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I love Jeff

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
This escalated quickly

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I'm gonna hand over him

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
To be my money manager

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
To have 20% of my estate fine

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Where is he

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Making the money for that 20%

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
That's the thing that there's no paper trail

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Have him trading or anything

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So I can understand

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
What were your 20

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Favorite moments

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
You mean 2021?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Yeah 2021

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Clearly it's

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Just laying Maxwell at trial

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It just really stands out to me, it's very moving

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Which is why I bring it up

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Moving here

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
So moving here

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
But for me

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I think we actually didn't cover that with you

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And I'd love to get your comment

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Because you said it's the first time

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
In your life you moved

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
The place you go to

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
It's the actual act of moving

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Is also a leap

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
The decision was

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
That I'm going to

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Give away my salary at MIT

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So stop taking salary

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Give away the group

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So students, no more research

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
The grant funding

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And still keep an MIT affiliation

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Just because I have friends and colleagues there still doing research

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But giving away

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Primarily is the source of money

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And no salary

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And let it go to zero

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Let my bank account go to zero

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And take a leap

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
In San Francisco

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Or elsewhere

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
And as COVID broke out

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And a lot of people started talking to me

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
About San Francisco

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
About the cynicism there

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
And I'll go there

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So it's not all the woke stuff

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And all that kind of things

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Which is also a problem

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's less about dreaming about a big future

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
About building a big future

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And more about some kind of

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Identity, politics, battles

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That they're just

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
You could say some aspect in the positive light

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Is important

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
But in a place like Silicon Valley to me

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
The most important thing is to do big things

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And for that to be

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Most of the conversation

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And so that cynicism was there

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And then I went to look at Austin

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It was the opposite

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It was the optimism

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And you have people like

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Elon was the optimistic

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
About making this the capital

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Of artificial intelligence and technology

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And so on

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And Mr. Joe Rogan

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Now just the optimism

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
About making this the cultural capital

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Of the world

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Specifically comedy

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
It just radiates from them

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Just the excitement

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
There's not many people of that nature in my life

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And when I see that in their eyes

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That engine, that fire

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Of wanting to create something special about the place

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
First of all, those people rarely fail

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
That's first of all

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And second of all, that's contagious

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And so all that combined

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
For me

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
2021 was

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The actual leap

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Of taking the leap

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Saying alright, well

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I'm actually going to do this

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The salary, not giving away all that

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But the whole thing

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That's it, you just move to a place

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
There's an empty building

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And you're

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Moving into it

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
And this is a new life

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And that leap, I don't know

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It's a scary leap to take

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Because I've taken that leap many times in my life

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And this is where

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Parents and all those kinds of cynicism

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Is really destructive because

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
From a cynical perspective

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I work at Google

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So why leave Google?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It's a very high paying salary

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That you can have at Google

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Then MIT, why leave MIT?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's MIT

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
This is what you've always dreamed about

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Why do you get a PhD?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
You've loved MIT all your life

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Why leave MIT?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
This is the same process I've gone through

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
With a lot of things in life

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
You've been saying every single stage

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And you need friends

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
You need support groups and all those kinds of things

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That are extremely important

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
But in the end, it's about taking the leap

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And for me, 2021 was this leap

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And to me

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
One of the most beautiful things you can do in life

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Is to take those leaps

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And that's something that I think is no longer

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
A thing in New York

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
There's no sense of hope

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
You don't go to New York now

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
There's been such an assault

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Intentionally or otherwise

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Maybe it's inevitable, they didn't have a choice

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
There's been such an assault on creativity

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And small business in New York

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
That very few people

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Who are in New York right now think

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Things are going to get great soon

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Whereas here, I feel

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Everyday is just something exciting is going to happen

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And that's part of the culture

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
And how the conversation goes

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It's just invoked to be cynical

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
In New York and San Francisco

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I hope it changes

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Because what I love about New York

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And what I love about Austin also

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Is the weirdos, the characters

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Just the variety of personalities

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
That if you just walk around

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You get to meet them

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And I think New York still has that

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But it has the extra cynicism on top of it

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That's a negative

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I mean, just becoming friends with Joe

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
He inspired me to be nicer to people

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
To not take myself seriously

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
To be humble

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
To celebrate friends

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Not to be competitive

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Like all those things

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Since I started listening to this podcast

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
From the very beginning

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It just radiated from the guy

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
The thing that people don't appreciate

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Is Joe Rogan

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Likes it when you bust his chops

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I mean

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
A lot of people at that level

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
If it's, oh Mr. Rogan, you're laughing at everything they say

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
They don't want that

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
It's very phony and they feel uncomfortable

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Because they know everything they say is hilarious

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I remember I went with him

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Doing a performance here

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Yeah, you were there

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And he was doing his set

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And I'd reached the point now where I don't think of him as Joe Rogan

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
You know, it's just

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
My buddy's doing stand-up, you forget

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And then I looked at the audience

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And I remember, I'm like, oh, this is like a religious experience for these people

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But you forget who he is

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Because he doesn't carry himself

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Like a big shot

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And still, I mean, he gets competitive as fuck

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I argue with him a lot

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
When I talk to Francis Collins and

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Pfizer CEO, you better believe I heard from Joe

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And then we would just get super drunk

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And argue about it

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I mean, he's beautiful

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And he gets really passionate

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It's not easy to argue with him

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But that's great

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
When you don't take it personally

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
It's fun

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
As you and I discussed, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Us saying this, but like

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
That moment when you first

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Get a text from Joe Rogan

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And it's some boomer meme

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I finally felt like I've arrived as a person

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
A boomer meme?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
What kind of boomer meme are we talking about?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Like some silly meme, but this is the kind of thing

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
You can imagine someone's uncle posting on Facebook

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
It's Joe Rogan texting it to you

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yeah, I mean, for me also

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
With Elon, obviously

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
There's a few people, I'm just saying folks that people know

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Also Jim Keller

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Who's worked with Elon

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So I've had conversations with them

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
It's just my line of work

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
They're realizing that everything

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Is possible in this world

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Which is not the Russian mindset

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Well, okay

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Let's

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Style it down a notch

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Style it down a notch

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Yeah, it's what

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Elon calls first principles thinking

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But really it's just

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Not being limited by the constraints of the past

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
And so saying like

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Okay, this is how things have been done

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Can be done much, much better

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And that has to do with manufacture

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Like how do we

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
How do we do this 10 times cheaper?

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Like everyone says

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It's super expensive

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
But does it really need to be

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
This is more of a question about manufacture

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
About how to build a product

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
How to actually have a product that scale that

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Has an impact

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Just having a very serious engineering

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
To the level of physics

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Discussion about building a thing

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
And fucking doing it

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And just being around people that did it

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
You know

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Basically literally

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Or figuratively said fuck you to

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Everybody in the room that said they can't do it

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And that energy

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So that I've gotten to know Elon

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
A lot better in 2021 that to me

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's like everything the whole thing

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
That moving here and being

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Surrounded by the optimistic energy

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And then the individual interactions

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
With people that refuse

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
To be like

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Broad down by the

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yeah the cynicism of the world

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
The naysayers

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
That to me is what I'm going to remember

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
This year for and I hope it like

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Materializes

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Into a

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Something concrete here in Austin and I feel

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It's doing that

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I really am curious to be a fly

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
On the wall, I'm sure it will happen at some point

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Watching you and Elon talk to each other

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Because he's even more of a robot than you

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
He was on the Babylon Bee

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Podcast and I was honored to be able

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
To be in the room while this was happening

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
And with the guys at

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
The Bee do at the end of every

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Podcast they have like ten questions

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I don't think this is

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
No no and they go to Elon

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Would you rather

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Be Batman or Iron Man

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Because they're both like multi-million industrialists

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And Elon being Elon

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Is like well let's think this

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Through there's different kinds of bats

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
You've got fruit bats and you've got insect bats

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Why it's called Batman, Batman actually

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Will fly right, bats can fly

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And I'm just sitting there like holy

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Dude just answer the question

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
It was so literal

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I was like damn

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I guess by this point

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Release of the podcast with him

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
That's several hours and it's exactly

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
As you would imagine

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
It's exactly as you would imagine

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It's super technical

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
It's probably her

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So there's that one scene

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Who's the lead character

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah, Joaquin Phoenix

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Yeah, so he's the lead and he falls in love with Siri

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Basically who's played by Scarlett Johansson

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And there's another

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Artificial AI that she's talking to

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And she's like oh can I

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Permission to go into nonverbal communication

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
With this professor

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And the guy's like sure

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And they just start talking to each other in their robot

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
And I'm just imagining the two of you having this mind meld

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Well that

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So there's both the humor of that

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But also the practical

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Nature of the kind of conversations

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
You have, it's so great because it's

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Problem solving mode

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Okay, yeah, yeah

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
That is fun, that is exciting

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Because like you stop completing

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Sentences, I actually feel at home

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Because you don't need to say the full sentences

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Anymore, you can just like

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Say random words and you start

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
To understand what you're talking about

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And then you can have multiple conversations

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
At the same time and go on these tangents

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
One of the biggest problems

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I have with podcasting for me

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Talking, I have to finish my sentences

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I have to actually finish making

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
A point, which is a big problem

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Because there's like a listener

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
That needs to hear the point being finished

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
As opposed to completing your

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Sentences

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Inside your own mind

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And like the thing

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I find is useful to Elon does the exact

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Same thing is

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
When the line of thinking

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Is no longer useful

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
You just switch

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
To the next thing, you just leave that whole thing

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Behind, you don't need a nice transition

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
You don't need any of that

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And also just

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It's the first principles thing, it's like zooming in

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
On the

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Elephant in the room

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I love that, it's so energizing

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
That's what I love about engineers

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
It's not the maybe

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Most eloquent communication style

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
But I

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I love it, what about you? So you said

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Moving

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
The book

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
What else?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And you've been really excited about

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
So that's

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Anarchist Handbook, but you've also

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Been non-stop excited about

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
White Bill, that was most of this

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Year, you've actually made significant

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Progress. Yeah, I'm on page 40

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Of the second draft, and it's really kind of funny

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Because when you're doing your

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I think 10th book

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I lost track already

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
The first draft is actually pretty good

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Like I'm going back and like alright this is going to be a whole slog

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I'm like oh I just have to cut and paste this and basically tweak a few words

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
So

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I did a good job

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
With the first draft, it's

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Also funny when you're writing

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
How

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And I guess this is the mark of a

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Good professional writer

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
The

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
My personal feelings don't match

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
How the characters

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
In the book come off

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Like I have a lot of fondness

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
For people like

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And they're early on in the book

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But they're not good people

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And I'm writing it objectively and whatever

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And I'm reading it so I'm like they come off much worse

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Than my

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Personal appraisal

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Of them

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
So it's kind of interesting as a writer when you're watching it

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I guess kind of like an attorney right

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Like you can have a situation where you

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
As an attorney you have a lot of fondness

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
For your client but you realize

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
That they probably did this thing or you could

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Not, it could be other way

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Like they're innocent but it's hard for you

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
To make a good case for them because the data's not there

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Can you actually talk about your writing

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Process in several ways? Sure

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So one your writing process but two by way of advice

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Of how to write

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
You've talked about in the past like your first

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Draft is these kind of

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Kind of disparate or more chaotic

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And that you don't in the same way

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Maybe I was saying in the engineering discussion

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
You don't complete the sentences

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
The first

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Like real good writing advice

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I remember getting

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Was this book by Peggy Noonan

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Called What I Saw at the Revolution

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And she was Rhonda Reagan's speechwriter

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
She still writes for the Wall Street Journal

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
The book I

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Bought was at a used bookstore in

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Lewisburg Pennsylvania when I was in college

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
My spine is cocked I still have it

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It was 99 cents

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And she talked you know when you're writing for a

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
President this is no joke

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Especially for a president who's

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The great communicator Reagan you know so

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
And you have to be very

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Inspirational but also not come off as corny

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Which is very hard to do

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And she in the book talks about how she wrote

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Speeches for him how she

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
You know I'm paraphrasing her and

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I haven't read her book in a couple decades

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
But basically she would

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Write like a brain dump and it's just garbage

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And she's like that's okay just get it all out there

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And then you know

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
There's that expression all writing is editing

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So for the White Pill

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Specifically this is I don't know

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
If it's the most ambitious book I've ever done

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Your reader I think is more ambitious because

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
That's all of North Korea's history and it's written somebody

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Else's voice and that person's a Martian

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And you like you mentioned

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Had to read a giant number of books

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
As research yeah

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Maybe can we just pause can you say what White Pill

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Is about? Sure it's a tale

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
It's about hope and it's a tale

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Of good and evil and I think that's

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I don't want to tip my hand too much

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
But people are always like

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
How do you think why are you so hopeful

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level I'm hopeful

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Because looking at history

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I think there's certain things that

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Not

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Will certainly happen again but it's not

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
At all implausible to happen again and that

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
The good guys will win and this is one of

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Those cases so

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
You know I had

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
The book took on a life of its own

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It's very different from how I originally conceived it

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I originally conceived it as a

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Kind of retelling of Camus philosophy

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Ryan Holiday

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Who he used to be close friends with

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I've talked to him in a while he has a whole

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Kind of cottage industry based on the

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Stoics of the past I'm like okay can I ask

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Him once can I do this with Camus he said sure

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And then I reread Camus

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Recently and it wasn't

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
What I had remembered

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I was like can we pause on that I apologize

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
To interrupt so it's interesting

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So he kind of took ideas from stoics

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Started to kind of use

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It as a book

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
That gives you advice about how to live life

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
From the stoic perspectives and

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
You were thinking

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Is there something in existentialism

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Absurdism or something specifically

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
In Camus

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Thinking or I think you've mentioned

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
The mythosophist specifically

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Like his philosophical work

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
So you were trying to see like

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Is there can I resurrect this

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
That's actually

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I would think

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
That's an interesting project

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And it's sad to hear that

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
It was

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It didn't materialize in exactly that

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Form because I thought there would be a lot

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
In that so I had Douglas Murray on my

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Show and he also made the point like when you go back

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And read Camus there's not that much there

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
The mythosophist is

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Not at all how I remembered it

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
The vast bulk of that book

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Is like literary criticism

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
So he's talking about Dusty F's you know those different people who are

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Embodiment of the absurd but I'm like this isn't

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
There's not much to take from here

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
The actual title essay is

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Basically like a six chapter

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Essay at the back of the book

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Which you know it's

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
It's good for what it is but

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
There's not that much there to draw

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I'm extremely

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
He's a great hero of mine I think his life is just

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Enormously admirable

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
He fought very hard against the you know the

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Nazi occupation his book The Plague

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Which I find unreadable is

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
An allegory about you know

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Germany conquering France and so on and so forth

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Wait a minute why is The Plague

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Unreadable? It's the kind of book where

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Reading the book doesn't add anything to the plot

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
The plot is

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
A plague comes sweeps over the town

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Destroys a lot of life and

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Vanishes as quickly as it came you don't need to read the book

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Now like you get the point

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I deeply disagree

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Yes of course I've read The Plague

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
To me I mean The Plague is about the doctor

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
And it's about love

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
And it's about the different

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Roles that humans take

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
In time

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And tragedy like The Plague

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Also it's an allegory

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So you can start to think about like

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
What you know you could whether it's

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Nazi Germany whatever you think that is

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
To me though that was about

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Love and about like the role

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Like the highest ideal being the

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Doctor that like sacrifices themselves

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
For others and like

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Still has love and hope I mean

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
To me that the way

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
That story is told

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I think has a lot of meaning

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's like to me you're saying

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
That's interesting you say it this way

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But to me it's like saying Animal

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Farm doesn't need

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
To be read because

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
It's an obvious story

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I don't think there's much plot to The Plague

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I think Animal Farm

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Has a very long plot

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And a complex plot

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
But there's experiences

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Within so the situation is

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Set up in The Plague and there's experiences

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
That start to reveal a

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Philosophy so

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Yeah it's not very plot

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Driven yeah but

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
So I would say you still

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Should read it but the

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Plot doesn't like you

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You didn't give away anything currently

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Right that's

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
So some books are just I mean

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Ayn Rand is similar to that

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
In the sense like the plot is not as

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Important as the behavior of the

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Different people in that plot

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I think she's very plot heavy

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
No she has plot but I'm saying that's

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Not necessarily the important thing

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
To me the behavior of the people is

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
The important thing sure but you could

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You could like separate into a bunch of

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Blog posts and they stand

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
On their own I would have to

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Think about that with Ayn Rand

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
She does

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Through the plot create a world

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Where you start to understand different

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Values that people have

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
But yeah

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
But that's what the plot serves

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Yeah

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I would have to think but in The Plague

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Is the behavior of the people that's really important

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And the same

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I mean The Stranger too I mean these like

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I'm

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I'm trying to scramble here for

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Books I really appreciate that don't have

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
A plot I mean

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
No

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Notes from underground

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
So obviously Dostoevsky has a huge amount of plot

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
In most of his work

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Hermann Hesse has a huge

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Amount of plot Thomas Mann doesn't have

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
The plot he's the one who doesn't have plots

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Would you say Kafka has a plot?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I think Kafka's very heavy plot

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Driven yeah but I just don't

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
See that I guess I guess metamorphosis doesn't really

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Have a plot

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Yeah but there's like crawling

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Around but it's like a vignette it's not really like

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
This yeah

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
A hunger artist on my

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Probably favorite short stories is

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
That kind of short stories a pretty long short story

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Of Kafka's is really

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Interesting is a

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Is about a man I don't know if you read it

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
No I don't think so

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
It's about a man that

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Is like a freak in a sense that

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
His skill

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Is that he can fast for a long time

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
And then people gather on the cage

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And look at him as he

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
As he fasts I don't actually remember if he's in a cage

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Or not but the

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
And eventually he fasts

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So long that people don't even care anymore

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Like they just leave so

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
There's a

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
It has to do

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Something it makes me think about like

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Don't become

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
The way you live

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Don't become like a freak show

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
A circus act

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Like live for an ideal

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Live for

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Something that brings you joy

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Or don't live for the sake of attention

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
For the sake of attention that's what you put

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Yeah anyway so

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
I rudely interrupted because you were talking

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
About the plague and connecting it to the

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Writing process of White Pill

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah well anyway so

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You know how I was writing this one

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I just had a

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
First draft of notes and

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
It's not in chronological order

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It's like I read certain books as research

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And then I had the pull quotes that was necessary

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
There and now

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I'm basically rearranging everything and putting

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
It so the book started as

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Ryan Holliday's

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Right the equivalent of Ryan Holliday as Camus

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
The working title would have been The Point of Tears

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Because this is quick

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Camus a great

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Quote maker and he has

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
This line about man must live, live to the point of

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Tears which I think is just

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
What I love about him

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Is

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Camus he always comes off as

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Like he's clenching his teeth

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
He's clenching his teeth both in terms of

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Like barely mitigated

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Rage and injustice

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Like when he sees people suffering

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
It just really makes him

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Just upset to the core

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
But also this sense

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Of

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Not taking life for granted

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And kind of just pushing yourself

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And pushing the boundaries and

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
His point being that

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Life is inherently meaningless which gives a great opportunity

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
To impute meaning to it

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
To create our own meaning to life

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
So taking the main

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Essay from

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Mythosophist that was

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
The origin story for The White Pill

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
But then it became something completely different

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
So then it became

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
How are you so optimistic in the face of everything

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
That's going on in the world and I started writing it

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
When COVID started hitting

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
And I

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Because again I'm not optimistic because of

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Some temperament of mine

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I'm optimistic because

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
You know people talk about how if the US

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Didn't exist China would just

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Become an empire and take over everything

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Empires are expensive

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And they're

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Like look at the British Empire

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
You know look at the Soviet Union

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
It's not automatically

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Sustainable it costs a lot

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Of a lot of things

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
To make sure when you're

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Geographically you know all over

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
The world literally to keep

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Everyone in line it's not at all

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Like a super villain in a movie like once

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
It happens it's the happy ending for them

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah that was the start and I'm like alright

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Let me tell

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
One thing I'm good at is

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Telling stories so this is really

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
So this is

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Plot driven

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Story plot driven and also heavily

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Character driven but the characters are real

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yeah got it

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
So it's interesting

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
To kind of mention what kind of

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
What does the first draft kind of look like

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
In terms of what kind of

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Things do you plop down

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It'll be like let's suppose I just read

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Like you know some book called The Guillotine at

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Work which was an early book

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Attacking Lenin from the anarcho-communist

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Perspective so it'll just be like all

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
The different quotes like a paragraph here double

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Space another paragraph you know blah blah blah

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
So on and so forth

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Whereas for other sections where I

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Wasn't just using a book as research

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
There would be like

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Talking about McKinley getting shot like

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
It's just me writing the narrative

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And that I could just pretty much copy paste into the

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Second draft by way of advice

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Would you give

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
That as advice is that a good way

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
To do it is that a very peculiar

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Way your brain knows so this is this is actually

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Advice they feel comfortable giving to people who

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Are trying to write

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Because it's just like with the gym

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Right if you did

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Seven sets seven excuse me reps

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Last week and you did eight this

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Week it's psychologically motivating

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Because you're going the right direction and the human mind

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Extrapolates so

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Make sure tell yourself

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I'm going to get a page done today or two pages

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Done so you're asking for on the

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Computer you're not allowed to get up to get those two pages

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It doesn't matter if they look like garbage

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Because if you have a 300

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Page first draft and

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
It's crap at least you have

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Something to work with and that's a big number

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So if you're going to

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
The thing is since the first draft is going to be

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Crap if you're editing as you write

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
It's going to be extremely discouraging

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And it's also trying to drive and

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Doing reverse at the same time

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
It's a completely nonsensical way to

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Do it get it all out there don't

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Look it over if you have a great line

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Put on your phone and then add it to the

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Draft so it'll be a complete

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Slog but editing that slog is going to be a lot easier

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Than creating it to begin with

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And when you see those disparate lines

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
All laid out on the page

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
How difficult is it to

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Then start stitching it together

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Do you find that when you look at

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
A list of those things

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
The final product will look very

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Different or will you actually use those

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Lines no I will use those lines then I have

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
A file called scraps so like

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
If the lines no longer use I put in my scrap pile

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I'd love to see

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
What's in the scrap pile okay yeah sure

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
One of the things I've been

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Pulling scraps is a lot of times when I was

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Earlier writing I would

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Have contemporary references

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And I realized that that's

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Bad because I want the

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
The reader to be

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
In the past as the present

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
So if you're talking about let's say 1901

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And then you're referring to Obama that

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Screws people up so I had to pull all those

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Okay let's

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Talk about some new year's resolutions

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
You ever do new year's resolutions

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You ever think like that like take a special

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Day in the year

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
To think about how you're going to try

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
To change yourself or do you try

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
To transform yourself every single day when you wake up

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Well I usually have several

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Projects I'm working on at once so

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
There's always incremental progress on those

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Right you know it's nice to have

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
A deadline by the end of 2022

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I'll accomplish this kind of a

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Like to hold yourself responsible

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And then you could do that at the beginning

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Of the year to think about that

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Both philosophically like what kind

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Of big

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Not projects that you can quantify

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
But more like how can I change my life

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Or like I mentioned take the leap of different

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Kinds and then there's specific things

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Like finish the book

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I years ago

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And I'm

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I think on some level you much less

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Than me but I think you're increasing in this direction

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I realized

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
It's more I have to learn how to be a

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Surfer and not a driver

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Because when you reach the level we're

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
At in our careers or in our

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Place in the culture

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
A lot of this is luck and a

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Lot of this is just like

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Like I'm just going along for the ride

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Because it's kind of counter

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Intuitive like you know like the

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Success of the anarchist handbook was counter intuitive

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
So

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
All I'm

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Hoping for is you know

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Getting the book done

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I'm extremely

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Proud of it

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And just also

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
You know building

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
A you know we had Thanksgiving

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Together at Blair's house

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Just building a great

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Upcoming community here

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
In Austin which

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Has happened very quickly

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I was there was going to be another

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Surprise

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Here there's a girl named Natalie

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Side surf and she makes

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
These ultra realistic cakes like

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
If you've seen those cakes online where it looks like cutting

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
A puppy like she makes those kind of things

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
So she's here in Austin

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yeah you know so like moved

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Permanently I think she's been here for a while I've never

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I haven't met her yet but I just kind of

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Chatted with her so they

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Just it's just so many there's so many

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Scenes happening here

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
That are overlapping

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
So in general

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Finish the book

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Keep building a community I mean you've already

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Been doing that here you've been here several months

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I've been making a point to introduce people

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
To each other and everyone's just really getting along

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Very well that's great

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And the book is the focus

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
The book is the focus what about the

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Podcast that you're doing you're

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Welcome yes I mean

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I enjoy it and it's been growing a

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Lot I finally got a new computer

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Which my friend

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Jay installed so I can have a decent

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Camera because of my old

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
This is my mindset as a

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Hoarder like I was

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
More interested in spending money

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
On a Pareto autograph than actually getting

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
A computer that's from the

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
20th century

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
So

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
But I'm such

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
An old school person

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
In that in my head

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Podcasts are like so

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Ephemeral like I don't

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Like there's some episodes of my

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Podcast I'm really proud of and there's a

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Lot of friendships I've made as a result of it that really

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Mean a lot to me no question it's made my life

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Profoundly better place but it's not

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
The same as that book on the shelf

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Especially when the book is something

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
That I think matters

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Much more than I do yeah

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
There's a permanence to it there's a

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Seriousness to laying down the

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Words on paper yeah like really giving

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Them thought yeah

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
That's true but pocket

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I mean I'm a huge fan of podcasts you're just

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You don't listen to podcasts much it's

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Fascinating too

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah like at all like I don't know how mine

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Is so successful it's just

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Yeah

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Yeah yeah I just love

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
The medium yeah but you're

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I love the authenticity the

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Realness of the medium that's

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Really nice I just understood

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
For the it's starting to click

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Because like my

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Pal Blair White she was just on Rogan

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
And the first 10 minutes

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I was I was

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
So angry like I was sitting there

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Like yelling at the screen because

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Joe and Blair

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
You would think that they're going to start talking about

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
You know Trump or trans

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Issues or moving to Austin they

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Start talking about shark reproduction

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
And neither of these dumbasses knew anything

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
About it and I know a lot about it and

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
They're like oh is it like this or do the sharks lay eggs

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And I'm sitting there like if you don't know why you're talking

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
About this why

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Why are you talking and I could also

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
See why people like these shows

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Because they feel like they're friends with the people like they're sitting

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
In the room because I felt like I was in that room and I

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Wanted to shake both of them yeah in

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
The room so no what about transforming

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Yourself any resolutions

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Like that oh I'm doing a slight

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Bulk now so I'm almost

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
At my heaviest weight ever but I've

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Been I couldn't go to the gym this week because I'm a little

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Under weather so that's

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
A little frustrating but yeah

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
So are we going to get some more modeling

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Picks what are we what's what

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Is there goals there so my heaviest

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I'm 48

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
The heaviest I've ever been

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Was when and this is when I was like he's

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Exaggerating he's not that

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
That's the metric

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Oh sorry are you talking about your height 48

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Barely 46

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So the heaviest

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I've ever been when I was like really high

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Body fat because I was just because I learned

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Because I couldn't gain weight as a kid so when I

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Figured out I could actually gain weight I like

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Was 164.5

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So I want to hit 165

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And then see take it from there

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I have a friend who's been helping me

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
My buddy Trey Goff and this

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Kid's stronger his Jake his

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Username on Instagram is stronger both the

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Number five instead of letter

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
The number five instead of letter S but he

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Does I've never

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
It looks like it's photoshopped like your

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Brain can't process it you know the human flag

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
No oh

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Yeah yeah yeah sorry he does human flag

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Push ups

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Wow so he is horizontal

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Parallel to the ground right he's holding

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Himself up like a flag but he could

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Also do this while

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
So he's moving parallel to the earth

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Side to side while

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
It's just crazy that's really difficult

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
So you're interested in that kind of stuff

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
No but I'm saying like he's been helping me

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Out so like the guy knows what he's doing he's just

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
A really impressive kid I love that kind of stuff

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Like body weights also yeah my

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Primary mode of working

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Out it's very like the

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Profession you ever seen Leon like the professional

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
That with Natalie Portman

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
That movie

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Have a pull up thing as you push up

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Some pull ups it's very like

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I'm just missing the milk

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I like working out at home just like that

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And the body

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Weight stuff you can go so much with it and it's

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Super functional for everything else you live in

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
For life for living life

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Well I'm on the other

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Hand I don't care with functionality the thing that

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Really bothers me like I go I know

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Joe's thinking of opening up a gym like a

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Private gym there's only like one

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Power cage here at the Gold's I

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Go to yeah I don't know what source

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
That there's only one or that sometimes people aren't using

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It I'm like no one's doing deadlifts

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
In here no one just me yeah it's

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Gold's by the way

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I don't want to say where I'll tell you

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Off my but there's there's a few

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Really like ghetto

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Places around Austin there

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Are just like these shitty

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Gyms that nobody wants to go

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
To but they have a rack they have like if

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
You want to lift heavy that kind of stuff but are they 24 hours

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
That's the thing Gold's oh

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
But there are 24 hours

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
In the following way

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
There's a code okay and you

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Just go in okay and you turn on

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
The lights that's fine and then you work out

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I don't want to meet I don't want to meet people

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Exactly well that's just not true the people

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Sometimes there's people and they're great yeah

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Like and I've had fans come up to me at Gold's

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And they've all been called except

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Except

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Oh no except

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Except

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
If I have my headphones on

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And I'm doing deadlifts

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I don't need you to come over

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Tap my ear

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
And start giving me critiques about my form

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
This actually happened

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Yes

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I'm still angry about it

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I'm pulling my 150

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
In peace thank you

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Yeah people are hilarious

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I was recently in

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Had actually the wildest

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Day ever in my life

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
So many things happened in a row

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
So I went to a wedding

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
In LA Andrew

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Andrew Schultz's and

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
With Whitney Cummings

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
And Joe Rogan

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And a bunch of other fascinating

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
People it's just speaking

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Of weirdos there's the comedian

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Like the reason I find the comedians awesome

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
One they're authentic they're just cool

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
People yeah yeah but they're also

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Just weird like you don't become a comedian

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
For not being like fucked up

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
In all kinds of different ways

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Anyway so there's the wedding

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I'm you know me

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
It was only carbs at the wedding

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
So I didn't eat I didn't eat for a long time

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So I was like already fasted

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
20 hours 25 hours

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And so that this

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Whole story of

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Everything that happens is

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Lex like 40 hours fasted

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
With Joe Rogan

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Drinking a lot of whiskey

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And so you were drinking too

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Heavy on 40 oh my god

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
That's crazy so it is calories

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That was my only source of calories the whiskey

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
And I so I didn't trust

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Myself with carbs when I'm drunk I just

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Don't enjoy it because I'll forget

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
And I just enjoy eating

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Like a strict healthy diet when I'm

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Drunk because

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
I'd rather eat more food that's healthy

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Yeah versus not

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So anyway so then we went to

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Vegas together

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And then just

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Kept doing wild thing after another wild

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Thing Rogan opened up

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
For Whitney Cummings he just like

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Showed up at a random party that he wasn't invited

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And he did a thing he almost started

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
A fight because some guys said

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Stop spread yelled at him said

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Stop spreading misinformation

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And then

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
We run into David Goggins

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
This is my first time meeting David

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I've talked to David a lot

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Over the phone and we were supposed

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
To do a thing together and this is me trashed out

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Of my mind meeting

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
David for the first time with his incredible

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Wife Rogan's wife was there

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
By the way Joe Rogan's

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Wife David's wife made

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Me realize that I really want to

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Be married because

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
They're not

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
They make

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Their partners

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Better yeah like

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
That I was

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
There's a certain

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Aspect of marriage that I'm afraid of that

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Like your partner takes you away from life

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
You don't get to experience life as much

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
But this

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Was like they were enriching them

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I don't know it's like the world's most

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Powerful support group it was cool

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Anyway so then of course drunk Lex

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Challenges Goggins

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
To push us I saw this

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
On Instagram whatever we're in the middle

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Of the and you're in your suit in the

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Suit in the middle of casino there's a crowd

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Gathering like

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
It's Joe Rogan me

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
And David Goggins and I'm just doing pushups

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
With them and Rogan is like commentating

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
And yelling and screaming it was

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Surreal and just going on to the

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Next thing and next thing and next thing like this

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And then drove

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
All the way from Vegas

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Back to LA

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
With Joe and Whitney

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
And his wife and it was

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Like what is this and all of it

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Is done in 24 hours

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
The one valuable lesson is don't

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Fast and drink

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Like excessively

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
So I've learned that because

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
What happens is

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Liquor hits your mind

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
My mind sorry I'll speak about my

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Particular mind

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Like the intellectual part

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Of my brain got hit really hard really

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Fast so I was not able to

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Even more so than usual stitch

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Together sentences I understood every

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Really well so like

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Made you an immigrant again

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
So like meeting David

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
I want to say so many things

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
He's so inspiring to me right

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
But all I said was like hello

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
And I

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And I like I remember like opening

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
My mouth to like try to say more

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
And I was like

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And then I would just close my mouth and not

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Be able to say anymore

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
This is why this is one of the reasons I don't drink ever

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
It removes

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Certain barriers

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Like it allows you to maybe

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Have fun that you wouldn't otherwise

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
But yeah definitely for

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Person who values intellectual

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Elegance

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
I also hate being hungover

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
The hungover part yeah

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
And you also like I did this to myself

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Yeah

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
But it also teaches me that this too

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Shall pass because

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I've been hungover and I've quit drinking

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
So many times in my life

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
That it realizes it makes you realize that

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
All the unpleasant feelings

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
All you have to do is just wait it out and be fine

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
It took me a long time

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
To realize that that expression means

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
The other thing

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
If things are going great this too shall pass

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yeah

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Life is suffering

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I always thought about it as being more like don't worry if things are bad it'll pass

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
It's also like if something's going great

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It's not going to be this way forever

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
It's like Bukowski said

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Love is a fog that fades with the first

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Daylight of a reality

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Do you think love can last?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Oh yeah we're going to win

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Who's we?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
The good guys

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Didn't Hitler also think

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
He's the good guys?

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
He's wrong

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
You know why?

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
He didn't win

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
So you think it's permanent

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
So this one time the good guys

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Winning it'll last

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
It won't pass

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Because I think all of it

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Passes unfortunately

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I think we're going to

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Win and win big

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
In the not so distant future

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Do you have specific

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Things in mind or no?

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Or just a sense about human civilization

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
About society waking up

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I don't know about waking up

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
But I think the

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Increased

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Understanding on

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
All sides of the political spectrum

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
That

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Corporate America and

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Corporate news outlets

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Are self motivated actors

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And those motivations are often

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Inimical to what

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Others would regard as desirable

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Is something that I think is happening

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
With increasing frequency

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
So what do you think about

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
The political landscape

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
In general

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
You had a great conversation with Glenn Beck

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
And he said that

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
He talked to Trump and believes that

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Donald Trump is definitely running in 2024

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Or very likely running in 2024

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I think he said

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
He thinks he'll have a good chance of winning

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Or

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I don't remember that but

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
The fact that he was running was a surprise to you

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Do you think Donald Trump

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Would be running in 2024?

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Given that Glenn Beck

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Has a

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Much better relationship with Trump

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Than I do to put it mildly

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
If Glenn Beck is certain this is going to happen

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I would defer to Glenn Beck's judgment

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Do you think he has a chance of winning?

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Do you think he'll win?

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Anyone in a binary political system who's a nominee

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Has a chance

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Whoever the Republican and Democratic has a chance

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I think also it's a lot easier

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
To vote for someone that you have voted for

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
In the past

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
So that's why incumbents have a big advantage

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
There's not that psychological barrier to cover

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I think it's also useful for Trump

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
That he's banished from social media

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Because then

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
He doesn't have to have the responsibility of governing

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
And all the costs of that

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Because no matter what decisions you make

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
While governing some people aren't going to like that

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
So he gets to kind of be

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Above the radar or below the radar rather

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
To some extent

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I don't think it's at all a given

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
That he would get the nomination

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
When I say the good guys are going to win

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I certainly don't mean Donald Trump

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
I don't think

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Victory is going to come as a consequence of Washington

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Do you want to make America great again?

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I think America is great

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
So

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
This is my failed attempt at humor

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
One of many

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
There are also hats that Giuliani

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
And Jim Jeffords wore that said

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
People can look this up

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
They said, because they were south of the border

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Make Mexico great again also

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Like that to me

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It was like

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Just the syntax there

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Okay

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
So you don't even think

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
You might get the nomination

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Who else might?

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
I mean

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
If you had asked three years out

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Who the nominee in 2020 would be

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Donald Trump wasn't even

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
2016 rather

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Wasn't even on the radar screen

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
So we have a long way to go

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Even two years is a long way to go?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Especially because

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
There might be some governor

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Who becomes a rock star for some reason

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Maybe some congressman

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Might have some big moment

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Where they're screaming at somebody

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
And all of a sudden they become a rock star

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
In the Republican party

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
It could be one of the celebrities we don't

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Think about

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Donald Trump is essentially not a political figure

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Before he ran

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
So it could be any of the famous

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Like

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Right leaning

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Celebrities

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I don't even know which way

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
McConaughey leans

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I think he's the lefty

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
But he's not running

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
People like that just might step into the ring

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
I don't think they'd have that much of a chance

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Because I think the Republican party

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
There's an asymmetry

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
They'd be much more skeptical of an actor

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Than the Democrats would be

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Because they would regard that actor as coming

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
As an ensuring candidate

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
But there's other kinds of celebrities

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Jocko could run as a Republican

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
That's a good example

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
That would be interesting

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
So military person

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
But already like for example Dr. Oz

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Is thinking of running for

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Is going to run for the senate in Pennsylvania

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
And there's already been a lot of research

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
People slamming him on

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Twitter and social media

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
For past positions he's taken

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
DeSantis is the figure of the moment

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
But Scott Walker was the figure of the moment

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
And he didn't even make it to Iowa

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
And I wonder what role

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Does COVID play in all of this

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
In terms of

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I'm mostly optimistic and hopeful

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
About the world

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
When I look at the world I'm excited by most things

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
I've been a little bit

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Or a lot disappointed by

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
The lack of great leadership

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
In a time of trouble

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
To me one of the

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
One of the great things about

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
A difficult time

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Is it brings out

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
The great leaders

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Again it's the up and down things

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Like you don't want to ask for war

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
You don't want to ask for pandemics

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
But when they happen

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
It's a great opportunity

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
For the human spirit to flourish

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And the fact that it didn't quite

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
In the way that I hoped it would

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Is disappointing

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I think there's still time too

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
To figure out what to do

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
As we emerge from the fog

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Yeah

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
So I'm excited by 2020

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
For somebody said this

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Dark cynical thing

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I hope this is not true

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
But like that there was some doubt

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
About the results of the election in 2020

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
That in 2024

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Both sides

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Like it'll just start becoming

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Standard

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
To completely

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Reject the results of an election

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
No matter who wins

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Well that's my perspective

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I don't regard elections as legitimate

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
And I see what you're saying

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
That basically the process itself was illegitimate

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Yes there was like cheating or something

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Yeah but I think that that's pretty much

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
A given

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It has been a given

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
The Republicans often say

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
They got all these illegals to vote

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Or the Democrats will say the voting machines were hacked

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Or the media so on and so forth

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
All the people flapping their gums about democracy

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
They only like democracy

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
When it gives them the results that

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
They want

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Can I ask you about something else that Glombeck said

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
That I thought was really interesting

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I agree with him very much on this

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And it was refreshing to hear

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Although he kind of made it

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Turn into a point about why Trump is great

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Or whatever

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
But the point was the following

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Which is he doesn't want to talk

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
To anybody who can't say at least one

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Nice thing about

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Everyone

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
If you don't like Donald Trump

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
If you don't like Joe Biden

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
You should still be able to say one

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Nice thing like legitimate

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Not just like a dismissive nice thing

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
But legitimately say what is one nice

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Thing they did or

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Or who they are

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
As a person

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Not like saying Donald Trump

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Is funny sometimes

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
No like legitimate where you really

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Mean it and it's been really troubling

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
To me how few people are able to do

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
That about political figures

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I had a lot of people

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
I think I tweeted

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Something like this leading up to the election

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Saying like you should

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Be able to say something nice about

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
And I've had

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Old friends

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I don't

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Want to say specific I guess

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
To call them out but they

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Several people one in particular

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Wrote me this long like several

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Page email

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
It was Sam Harris

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
No

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
But

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I have a lot of conversations with

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Sam Harris now and Joe on both sides

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
It's like the devil and the angel

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
On both my I don't know which one is which

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
But

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
They're both devils

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
And they said how could you say

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
How could you even consider

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Like

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
That there's something positive about Donald Trump

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Here's an easy one

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
He has three wives

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
With three kids with each

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But the kids get along

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I think that's really commendable

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
That Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And Barron can all get along with each other

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Given the circumstances I think that speaks to

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Someone as a father

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
So on the family level

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
And I see the same thing with

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Actually one of the reasons

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I always found

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Joe Biden fascinating is

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
He's had a lot of really traumatic

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Things happen in his life

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
And if I shit my pants

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
In front of the Pope I'd be traumatized too

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
I'm talking to a master troll about

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Something sensitive and beautiful that is

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
A man suffering with a loss

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I kind of know what he feels like right now I'm pretending

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
To hit the Pope

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
This chair is ruined

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Sorry Elon

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
You're going to have to sit in it

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Why is this chair full

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Kind of like I'm sitting in a swamp

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Look you have stuff to show

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Can you afford a good chair

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I'll send you one from Tesla

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
That's a pretty good Elon impression

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But yeah I mean

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Like one criticism I told Joe

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Rogan is like

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
He has trouble finding one positive thing

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
To say about Joe Biden for example

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
And I just don't

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I don't like that

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I think

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I'm a big believer in the shit sandwich

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Sticking on topics

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
I think Joe Biden clearly is a very

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Amiable person

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
It gets along with people

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
It seems really clear that maybe before

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
President because it's different when you're the president

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
But that he could call a lot of these Republican senators

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Get them on the phone and have a conversation with them

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
It's not some kind of manipulation

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
It is because they're all politicians

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
He clearly seemed to be

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Wasn't like an ideologue

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
But there's

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Maybe I'm a sucker for that kind of thing

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
But the blue collar thing like riding the train

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
There's ways to connect

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
With people and not

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Seeing them as equals

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
No matter where their walks of life are

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I love it when presidents do that

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
To some degree

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Because of the wealth

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Under which Donald Trump existed

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
For a lot of his recent life

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
He's less able to do that

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Quite naturally

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Maybe sometimes Obama wasn't quite able

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
That's a good question

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Who's more blue collar Trump or Biden

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You can easily make the case for both I think

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
You could

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Not the blue collar but like

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Literally be able to fit in at a bar

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
At a local bar and just like

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I can see both of them

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I can see both of them

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Donald Trump doesn't quite

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
No because he's got that Ivy League

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Yeah the Ivy League thing

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
You're right

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Somehow Donald Trump can too

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
You can see him having a beer with the guys

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
And yelling at the screen

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
This is bullshit, change the channel

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I hope people do that

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
That's one of the most unpleasant

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Things to me

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Is they're not able

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
To empathize

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
With the fact that half the country voted

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Well it's also then it's just a bad strategy

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
If you can't figure out why

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Half the country is voting for someone you guard as like a demon

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Well then how are you going to

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Fight this demon

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
When I did your read of the North Korea book

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
It's like don't you want to understand

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
How these people

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Get to where they got

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
No one's saying that he's a good person

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But there's a logic to their

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
There's a method to their madness

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
You've talked about national divorce a few times

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I've seen a couple videos recently

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Responding to articles

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
It's kind of cool

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Can you

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Talk about this idea of national divorce

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
As it stands today

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Arguing for it maybe

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
And if you could

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Just out of curiosity in the context of those videos

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
If you can steal man and argument against

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
National divorce

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
I was the first one to kind of bring this

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Issue back into the national

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Conversation

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I wrote a piece for Observer in 2016

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Then Jesse Kelly had a piece

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
A few months after that, David Boy

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Just recently did a piece on his

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Stub Stack earlier this year

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
And it's become enough of a

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Mainstreamed idea that

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Paleontology outlets like the National

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Review have felt the need to respond to them

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
So the point being that America

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Has had at least two cultures since the beginning

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And that there's absolutely no reason

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
And these cultures in recent

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Years, and this was in 2016

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Not to mention 2021, have been increasingly

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Antagonistic toward one another and have

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Even lost the ability to

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Communicate, they're using language in different

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Ways, and that there's no reason for this

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
To continue any further

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
And

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
You live your life

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
We'll live ours and

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Goodbye and good luck

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
No harm, no ill will

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Now there's lots of arguments

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Against them, some of those are

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Completely, I think, stupid

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
The stupidest one

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Is, well that's what China wants

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Well, I mean, I'm not going to

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Live my life saying, I'm just going to do

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
The opposite of whatever China wants

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
That's not logic, that's not

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
A good pathway, now I'm not saying

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
That right or wrong, but that's not a reasonable way

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Yeah, you bring up China or Russia

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
That's exactly what

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
China or Russia want, but sort of

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
The strong way to phrase that

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Is

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
It weakens

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
America, like

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Not just the one America

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
But, like, both

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Sides in the divorce

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Will be much weaker

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Than they individually were together

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
So, in that sense, not that

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
You have to care about which kind of

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Things, but like, it's a step

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
It's a big step backwards

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Yes, I think in the short term, it is absolutely

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
A big step backwards in terms of power

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
There's no question that, you know

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
When you're trying to reestablish a society, there's going to be

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
A transition period, that transition period is going to be costly

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Each side starts wondering

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Wait a minute, why are we still doing this

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
We don't have to anymore, we're not living with them, so on and so forth

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
So that's going to be a concern

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I don't think

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
That the whole point of America

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Or even a large

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Or primary point of America is to be

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
A bulwark against Chinese power

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
And there's going to be very few people

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
On Earth, you know, given my work

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Who have as much informed

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Hatred and contempt for the

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Chinese government as I do

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Certainly, you know

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Next to the North Korean people, maybe

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
The people from Eritrea

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
There's few populations who I'm as

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Worried about as the people under the

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Rule of the Red Chinese

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
My steel man argument is

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
There's no way this is going to be peaceful

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Because the lines don't separate out well

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
So all you're doing is basically

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Just replicating the problem

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Because the disparity isn't between

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
You know, like during the Civil War, North and South

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
In New York City and upstate New York

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Or between Chicago, downstate Chicago

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Once you get outside of L.A.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And like Sacramento

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
California in many ways like Kentucky

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
So it doesn't make sense

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
So that's a strong argument

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
I mean, you've talked about that this process will be painful

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
It can be painful

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
And we're not just talking about violence

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
It could be just, even the Civil War

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
You could divide it somewhat cleanly

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Obviously, the kind of

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
National divorce you might be suggesting

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Is that people are living amongst each other

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
So you have to literally

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
It's complicated

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Right, so that is a very strong argument

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I think a cogent argument against it

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Two is

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
It's not just China

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
It's that there's a lot of

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Bad actors in the world who maybe aren't

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Like China certainly wants to carry itself

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
And have an appearance at least on the world stage

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
As civilized and

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
A leader

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
There's lots of smaller countries who

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Without us, are going to feel comfortable

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Doing some very nefarious things

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
And they're not going to be scared of us

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Anymore, so that would be a bigger

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Concern in many regards than China

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
So I think that's a reasonable one

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
It could be that both sides

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
If this happens

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Instead of work toward better

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
The things that make each side bad would get worse

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
And that's

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Having those pushed towards the malevolent

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Extremes is I think a very legitimate

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Criticism and a concern

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
As you suggested, there's no guarantee that won't happen

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Correct at all

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Also

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
I think a reasonable argument to make is like

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
America

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Just as a symbol and the myth of America

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And I don't mean myth in a negative sense

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Do you really want to throw that in the garbage?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Like this meant a lot for a lot of people

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And a lot for history, you're just going to be like

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Okay, good work

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
We're done here, let's shut the lights

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
So that's I think a reasonable argument

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
So those are the

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Biggest ones

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I would say

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
And still, what is the case for

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
National divorce and

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Along which lines

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
So like

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
In making the case for national divorce

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
If it is desired

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Based on which kind of ideas

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Do you think it should be carried through

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Honestly, I don't know that it has to be

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Idea based, like for example

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
When Czechoslovakia broke up

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
When Norway and Sweden

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Broke up, it wasn't really ideological

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
It was more cultural

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
So

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I always say divorce into two

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
But it would probably make more sense if it was like five

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Because the northeast

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Certainly New England has their own culture

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
The west coast has their own kind of culture

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I don't know

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
The thing is

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
In any kind of

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Persuasion technique, right

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Like once people are start

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
There's a difference between

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Convincing someone they want to buy a car

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
And what features you want

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
So if you're at the point where we're arguing about the features

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Then my work here is done

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I don't have a dog in the fight

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
In terms of what it's going to look like

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I just want to get to the point where you're at least considering

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Seriously the idea of breaking up America

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And I would encourage people to go look at my article

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
To see which I'm sure the

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Arguments still hold five years later

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Do you have a kind of vision

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Of which of the two

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Or which of the five

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Like do you actually have specific

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Cultures or ideas

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I'll tell you exactly

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
If I told you

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And everyone listening

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
In 2014

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
It was not long ago

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Which of these two things is more likely to happen

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
2014

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Texas secedes

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Or declares secession from America

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Or Donald Trump gets elected president

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Everyone's voting for Texas

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
In terms of prediction

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Which is more likely

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
How unlikely we're going to have this one

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I don't know if that logic carries through

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
You can't just say

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Here's an unlikely thing that happened

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Therefore anything can happen

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
You just earlier said anything can happen this episode

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Didn't you? Life is suffering

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
I wasn't listening to half the things you're saying

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
You said it! I said it

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Yes you said anything can happen

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I'm like you with podcasts

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
I do a podcast but I don't listen to it

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
That's why I'm talking

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
So yeah it can happen

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I guess I'm asking

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Would you stay in Texas? 100%

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
And I'd run for office probably

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
It'd be fun

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I'm going to be the first president of Texas

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I attended a debate between

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Yoram Brooks and

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Yoram

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Hazony, I don't know if you know who that is

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
The nationalist guy

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
He wrote a book called The Virtue of Nationalism

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I read that book

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And I actually did a podcast with him

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
They did a debate

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
It was quite interesting

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And I tried to wear my Michael Malice hat

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
So the

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
You're wearing it now

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
You borrowed that from me

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
It's funny because the metaphor

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Applies across

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
All of these levels of collectivism

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
So he was arguing

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
For the power of nation

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
So he would be arguing against national divorce

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
But he was also

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Arguing for marriage

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Actual marriage between

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Individuals

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
I think he's a conservative

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
What I really like about him is

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
There's a clear philosophy

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Of conservatism that he expresses

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And I think a lot of people

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Get behind that philosophy

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Because to me

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Conservatism and liberalism

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Often is very used

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Loosely

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
He has a clear philosophy that he's expressing there

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
And is grounded in tradition

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
There's a lot of value in tradition

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
So it's the thing you said about

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
America

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
One of the arguments against national divorce

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Is like

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
We've been at it for a while

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
There is a lot of value

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
In the fact that we've been at it

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
For a while

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Don't just throw it all away all the time

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
So he says philosophically

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
In a lot of walks of life

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Revolution should be

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Avoided as much as possible

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I agree

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
It's kind of interesting

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
He makes the case that there's something

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Fundamentally powerful about the nation

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
It's a nice way to group a culture

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
So national divorce

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I guess goes against that

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Do you find some aspect of the

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Virtue of nationalism as you will put it

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Powerful?

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Well powerful

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
In a good sense?

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
In a good sense

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
It brings out the best in humans

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
It certainly brings out good things

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
I have that line I always say

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I hate the government because I love my country

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
There is a love of country

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I don't know that

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I think

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
It's also the case because the country

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Happens to be America

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I don't know if I was living in

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Whatever, I don't want to insult someone's country

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Canada

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
If I was living in Canada

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I don't know that

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
This is a guy who calls basically every other country

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Shit hole country

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
That's the fact

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
There's two types of countries

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Texas or shit holes

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
You went full Texas

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
You're okay burning the

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Northeast of the ground at this point

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I'm hoping for it

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
What they've done to New York City

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I will never forgive these people

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
And I hope that they suffer

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Enormously consequences

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
For what they've done to New York

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
It's unconscionable

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
The assault that they've done

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
And no remorse

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Over how many creative

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Outlets that they've destroyed

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
It's the cultural hub, cultural center of the world

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
In many ways

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
New York, this was the place where you go

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
To put up your shingle

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And move the needle

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
And make things happen

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I would understand if it was like

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Okay, we've got to suffer through this for a year

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
But we're going to make sure all these businesses

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Have a kind of safety net

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
To make sure that they kind of get through

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
And survive this

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Which they did to the banks in 2008 for example

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
And I'm saying this is an anarchist

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
And there was none of that

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
So I burn it down

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
And salt the earth

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Because it's like watching a zombie

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
It's unnatural

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
It's an abomination

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
So I mean sort of on the

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
White pill side of things

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I don't know about you, maybe

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I have a sense that both Silicon Valley

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
For me personally

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Maybe I have the same intensity of feeling as you do

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
About New York

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
It's just disappointing to see it

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Be consumed with cynicism

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
And a lot of other paralyzing

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Forces, but I still have hope for that place

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I think

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Maybe it's the

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Yoram

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Kind of tradition hope that through

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Momentum

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
The strong re-emerges

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
So like I have hope for New York

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
I think New York

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Will continue like

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Not maybe on the scale of years

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
But on the scale of decades

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
It'll be ups and downs where it re-emerges

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
As a cultural center

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I just can't imagine a place like

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
New York is like Paris

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
There's going to be long stretches

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Of time where it leads the

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
World

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Paris has not been a cultural hub for a very long time

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
You know

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
The days of Matisse and Picasso

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
And Gertrude Stein are long gone

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
It still

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Is a hub

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Even London isn't

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
But what is then?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
London is still London

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Paris is still Paris

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
London is still a place

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
It's a

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Black hub, it's a fashion hub

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
It's a music hub

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
It's still a pretty strong hub

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Not like during the Beatles era

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Or during the Sex Pistols era

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
It could be just us

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Romanticizing the past

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
What is a hub then?

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
We're not romanticizing the past

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Because a hub is

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
The place where everyone on earth

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Our eyes are on you

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
In the mid 60s

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
The British invasion

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Of Great Britain

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
They were the innovators

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
This was the place that was happening

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
In that sense

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
And Brooklyn 15 years ago

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
I guess maybe in that sense

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
In the 21st century

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Geographical hubs are becoming

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
A thing of the past

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
You can be a hub in the digital space now

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Maybe you'll never have

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I think there will always be

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
I mean what I'm saying

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Digital space makes it easier for

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Let's suppose Cleveland to be a hub

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Because all you need is 10 people

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Who happen to live in Cleveland

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Akron was a hub, a minor hub

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
All it takes is 10 to 50 people

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
And maybe even less

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Maybe just 2 or 3

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Or 4 people

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
There's been no shortage of articles

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Talking about Austin and what's happening here

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I know some of Joe's plans

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
And you and I and Blair

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
And my buddy Andrew Heaton moved here

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
He's just one of the best people I know

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I'm really really excited

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Can I ask you some weird thing about friendship?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Of course

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
You mentioned Sam

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
He's Mr. Harris to you

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Didn't that bother you how he went after Joe?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
He's like

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
In case you guys have brain damage

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
From watching Rogan's last episode

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Here's the answer

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I didn't like that

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I didn't like that either

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
About himself

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
He regrets those things

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Because it's very easy to say from his perspective

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Look

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
This isn't the full side

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Rogan didn't show you the full side of the story

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Here's the other side of the story

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Please watch this and be informed

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
That's a very reasonable thing to say

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I don't quite understand

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
They do this about each other now

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I'll put 3 people on the table

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Which is Joe Rogan, Sam Harris

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
And Brett Weinstein

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
And they have a way of talking

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Like the other person is creating a lot of harm

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Like

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Publicly would say things like that

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
And I understand

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
There's emotion in it

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
But like, these are human beings

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
That are

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Friends of yours

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
But I'll go the other way

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Let's suppose it is true that Joe is doing a lot of harm spreading misinformation

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Being sarcastic

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Isn't going to be persuasive

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Whereas if you're like

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I'm wrong, here's the facts

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Or be informed

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
To me, but then I'm not Sam Harris

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
He's got a bigger audience than me

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
So maybe he's the one who's right and I'm wrong

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
No, he's just human

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Well, I can relate

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Well, have you seen your Twitter lately?

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
You have a lot of fun on Twitter

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I feel like Twitter lets

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I've never done that with someone I'm friends with

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
I never would

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Okay, let's put that on record

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
It is on record

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I'm getting you on the phone

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Good

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Because then I'm not backing you into a corner publicly

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
It doesn't make any sense strategically

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Yeah, and actually

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Brett Weinstein

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Tweeted something

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Sort of criticizing something I did, I already forgot what

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
But he texted me first saying

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Like, is it okay if I tweet this?

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
And I said, yep

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Like, I was excited

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
But I think there's some level of just

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Be compassionate privately

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Be compassionate publicly

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Or be civil

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Civil

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
For some reason I don't like the word civility

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Because it's like

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Polite

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Or be cordial, is that better?

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
No, what I mean is like

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
It seems phony to you?

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
It seems phony, like you should radiate love

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
In whatever way

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
So even if you're rough with the other person

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
You should still show like

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Respect and love for that person

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
That gets back to the Russian rooms where they're yelling at each other

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
But there's still love underneath it

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I mean

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
The question I want to ask for you

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Is

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
I think you and I have a different view

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
On some things

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
We have a different approach to things

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
On the surface level, but also a different view

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
On some things like

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
I have a lot of hope for institutions

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I have

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Maybe it's a gut instinct

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Your gut instinct is like

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Or like

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Burn them down first and then let's figure it out

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Maybe that's a funny

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Rough way of saying it

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
And then for me it's like

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
No, let's understand the institution

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And slowly

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Revolutions from within

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Versus revolutions from the doubt

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
And

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
But like we can have those disagreements

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
And there may be times when those disagreements

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Will be, I could see in the future

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I could see I'll be attacked

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
By my friend Michael

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Which I look forward to

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Not attacked, but you know what I mean

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
On the surface level, in the idea space

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Anyway, you're shaking your head now

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
You won't

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Maybe this also goes to

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Sam Harrison

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Joe Rogan

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
I would love to be able to disagree

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Disagree in big ways

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
On important things and still be close friends

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And I don't understand why those

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Should be contradictions

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
That's the tension, that's been the most heartbreaking

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Thing to me about

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Sam and Brett

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And Joe

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
In the case of Brett, it's me, I don't know

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Brett, so I'm just like looking as a

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Somebody who just enjoys having these voices out

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
There and it seems like COVID just brought out

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
The worst than some

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Many folks

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
And it just feels like it's so sad to me

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
To see their friendship

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Somewhat deteriorating

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Or maybe I'm just being

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
No, it seems clearly

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
It's deteriorated enormously

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
It's sad that that's the case

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Yeah, so my, like I've had people

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Come at me because I'm friends with you

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
And they were like, oh Lex authored some

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Paper about masks, I don't even know what the hell they're referring to, I don't care

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
I always say

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
And mean, I don't

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Care whether someone agrees

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
With me, I care how they treat me

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
And it goes the other way, because I'll have a lot

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Of people on Twitter who are like, oh I'm on your team

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
And blah blah blah, I'm like, I don't know you, you're not my team

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
And just because you happen to agree with me

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
It's of no value to me

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Like I don't know you and I'm interested in knowing you

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Many of my friends

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I don't know what their politics are, I don't care

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Like I care how we hang out, have a good time

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
We watch dumb movies, watch YouTube

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Go to the store, whatever

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I don't know what your politics are, I don't care what your politics are

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Chris

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Williamson, who you know, he's just here

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
He's going to be moving to Austin

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
I only learned what his politics are in the last

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
We chat like almost every day

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Like the world's smallest political quiz

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And he figured out what his answers were

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
He's communist

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Marxist

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Let's be honest

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
So

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Stuff like that, like it never

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
And people, I think

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Because politics is often so

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Tribal, especially now

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
They'll be like, oh I could never be friends

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
With someone who voted for X

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Really? What if their grandma worked in that campaign?

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
What if, you know, blah blah blah

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
You can't think of one

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Steelman argument why this would happen

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
But if they just want to spite their boss

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
So I don't

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Like that approach at all, it makes no

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Sense to me

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
We could still have debates

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
I would still like to have those conversations

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
And still have disagreements

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Like

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
I disagree with Joe on COVID

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
A lot on a bunch of different things

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
But it's never like

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
It's not tense at all

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
It's just

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
It doesn't have that

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Arrogance that a lot of

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
COVID conversations seems to have

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Like

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Talking down to people from both directions

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
So I would love to have those

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Because I love to debate

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
It takes a lot to get me triggered

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
And when the Babylon B were

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Interviewing Elon

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
And he had this thing, he goes

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
I don't know anyone who wants to

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Abolish the FDA and the FAA

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
And I'm standing there

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
And I'm shaking and the guys look at me

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
And they're like, oh, we actually have an anarchist here

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
And the example he used was

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Look, if you're playing football

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
You're going to have a referee there

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
You want the referee

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
But the referee started playing the game

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
And I'm sitting there like

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
The referee doesn't work for the state

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
The referee is a private

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Individual working for this organization

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And there's no reason

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
At all that food

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Quality, which is something crucially important

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Has to be or can only be

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Delivered through the state and a government monopoly

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
That's actually really interesting

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Just the link on that

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Just a little bit

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
With the vaccine and stuff like that

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
With the antiviral drugs, the FDA

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Who should be

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
The referee?

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Do you have an idea

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
What's the best referee for the vaccine

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
It's just the market

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
This is tricky

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Because the thing that

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
I have not been following COVID as closely

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
As Joe and Sam

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
As Mr. Harris, excuse me, and Mr. Musk

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
The point is

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
When anything like this is developing

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
There's going to be a lot of misinformation

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Out there, even from the scientists

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Because it's a dynamic process

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
They don't know what they're dealing with

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
A lot of it has to be speculative

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
They don't know long-term effects

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Because it hasn't been around for a long time

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
The point is very

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Dangerous

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
When Joe was

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Mocked for taking a laundry list of things

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Under his doctor's advice

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
And they kind of latched on

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
To the ivermectin

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And then they specifically said it was horse paste

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Although it's veterinary medicine

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Why didn't they say dog paste or cat paste

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
It's like, well, he's not dead

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
And he's also taking

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Drugs which are used

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
In other circumstances, the very least

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
They're pointless, but

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
If the drug is being allowed

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
For pharmaceutical reasons, the odds are quite low

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
That they're going to have deleterious side effects

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
In general

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I think this kind of

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Insistence

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
That there has to be one

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
A officially approved

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Outcome

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
That we're all doing, that is kind of

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Dangerous thinking in general

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
By the way, I don't know if you saw

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I got a chance to talk to the Pfizer CEO

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
I had help collecting questions

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Because I got a lot of questions and people put

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
At the top a question for Michael Malus

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
No, the

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Ask him

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
What he likes best

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
About me

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
So I actually had that in my list of questions

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I was going to ask him, and my plan was

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I'll ask him

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Michael Malus wants to know what you like best

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
About him, and then my guess was

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
He'd be like, who? And I'd be like, exactly

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
And then go on to the next one

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
But I thought

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
It was such a tense conversation

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
That I thought there would be no

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Of course, room for levity. The question I would ask him

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Is, can you acknowledge

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
That there is an enormous incentive

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
For your company

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
To force everyone in

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
America or everyone on earth

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
To be a consumer of your product?

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
That's my question

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
So I danced around that question quite a lot

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I phrased it differently

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I phrased it differently, which is

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
A conflict of interest and attention

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Between making a lot of money

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
And actually helping people

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
And

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
I've asked a lot of really heavy questions

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And I still

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
A lot of people wrote to me with support

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Saying like

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
That was a really great conversation

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
And a lot of people wrote

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Saying that

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Saying that it was just

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Too soft

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
And it

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
I don't know, I think about that a lot

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Like, how do you have that conversation?

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
I don't think it was too soft

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
And actually, just for the record, I want to say

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
That they

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Didn't see any of the questions I'm asking

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
They didn't

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
See the final interview. I can ask

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Anything I want

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
So any questions

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
That I asked

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
And failed to ask

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Is my own

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Shortcomings

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Also

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Not being a coward, I was afraid of nothing

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Like, what do I have to

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Gain or lose, exactly

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Well, you have something to lose because if you're

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I only do softballs

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Because if I'm going to make it

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Difficult for someone

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
To come to my show, a lot of

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
People will be disincentivized to do the show

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Because like, I don't need this

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Oh yeah, I wasn't thinking like that, but I was

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
I don't like to, what I think

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Some fraction of folks wanted me to do

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Is to yell at a person

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Like

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Criticize them, not even ask questions

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Yeah, how dare you

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
But to me

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
My goal, my hope is with these conversations

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Is not just to do

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
How great you are, all that kind of stuff

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Is to bring out some deeper truth

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Like, the beautiful things

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Is when you can together realize some

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Truth, like you mentioned

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
That

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
The incentive to

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
For everyone to take the vaccine

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Is obviously high for the

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Maker of a vaccine

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
And for them

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
To arrive at that truth together

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
That is a really difficult

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Truth to operate under

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Like, for example

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I had a whole exchange with him about

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
This is Jordan Peterson

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Asked this question, I used that as a kind of

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Springboard

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Which is the

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
The kind of open doors between

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
The FDA, the CDC, and Pfizer

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Right

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Like, some people work at Pfizer and then go to work at the FDA

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
And then vice versa

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
And I brought up

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
My safe space

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Maybe yours too

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Just going back to the Soviet Union

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
To look at the lessons of

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Human nature and corruption

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
I said like

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
There's two things

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
One, it looks bad

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
And two, this naturally leads to corruption

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
And I pushed this with several

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Questions, but polite and respectful

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
And he ultimately said, you know, there's

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Rules

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
There's the rule of law

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
And there's very strict rules about this

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
And we have to follow those rules

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Otherwise we get punished severely

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
So like, his responses

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
People reacted to them as like

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Okay, that's the CEO doing the political

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
But there's also truth to what he's saying

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
That one of the beautiful things about America

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Is that

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
You can criticize the rule of law currently

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
But it's still, it's better than

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
In Soviet

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
In the Soviet Union where

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
People bribed each other

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
But still

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
He made it seem like

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
There's no corruption

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
People often ask me

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Why I describe myself

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
As an anarchist and not a narco-capitalist

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Because they think my views are more in line

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
With that school of anarchism

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
And one of the other reasons

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
You just gave me a good one, is that

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
If I am talking to

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Someone who's a major CEO

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
I have that hardcore

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Left anarchist view that

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
This person is, if not the devil

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Certainly going to be

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Sinister, at the very least

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
And if you can't say

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Listen, this happens

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Inevitably with elites

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
It happens in universities, it happens in the food industry

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
There's only so many people at the top of these things

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
The field is small

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
And everyone's going to know each other

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Which is kind of just the dynamics of any market

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
That would kind of be more reasonable

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
And just say

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
It's easy to caricature us

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Because you're not in the boardroom

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
But we are trying to produce a product that people want

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
So

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Unlike the people

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Who criticize me

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
I wasn't bothered by most things

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
But I was bothered by the fact

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
That he didn't show more worry

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
About the corrupting nature

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Of money and power

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
If you say that

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
There's no corruption

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
You should show that

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Because we constantly worry about it

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Not because

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Look, there's rules

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Which are enforced by you

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Exactly, so I think the only

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Way to avoid

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
For time

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
The corrupting force of

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Power

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Is to freak out about it

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Non-stop

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
The impression I always get from people like him

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
And I haven't seen the interview and I won't be watching it

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Is

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
They're genuinely convinced they're the good guys

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Yeah

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
And if you're the good guy

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Sure corruption is a concern theoretically

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
But I know this guy at the FDA

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
I know this senator

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Sure we disagree, sure they do some things I don't like

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
But in terms of corrupt

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
I think it's a concern because

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
They're not going to sell a vaccine

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
That kills people in Georgia

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
So yeah it's a concern theoretically

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
But this is 21st century

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
The thought process I think writes itself

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
I think yeah

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Having the humility

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
I do this all the time maybe to a destructive level

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Thinking that I might be doing bad for the world

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
I might be wrong

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
I might be that kind of thinking

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
You should do at least some of that

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Not to a point being paralyzed but a little bit

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
For me to ask you then for advice

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Okay

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
You're in this compassionate thoughtful mood

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I like it

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
The compassionate thoughtful Michael

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
So for future conversations like that

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
So

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
The person that offered a conversation

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
That

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
First I avoided but might return to is Anthony Fauci

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
So there's Anthony Fauci

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
But then there's also Trump and Biden

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
People like that

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Like if you had them on your show

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Or just giving me advice

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Or how to talk to them

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
What do you think is the right way

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
To talk to them

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
And forget about future guests

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
But like to get at something

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
New

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Together

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Not for views or likes or clicks or any of that

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
But discover something new

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Through the mode of conversation

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Well like let's take those one at a time

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
So if I was talking to Trump

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I told Ruben to ask Trump this and he didn't

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
What I wanted to know is

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
What's the look on your face when you're sending these tweets

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Because I imagine him on the toilet

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
With his phone

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Are you cracking yourself up

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Are you just completely stoic

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
That Trump little smirk he does

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
So when you get someone to

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Open up about their emotion

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
About some of their passion

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
I think that breaks down some barriers

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
That's a really good question

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
But Ruben wouldn't be

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
That's not his style

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Well I told him to say Michael Malice

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Oh Michael Malice

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
For Biden

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
That would be a tough one

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Because Biden doesn't get enough credit

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
For what a good politician he is

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
There was this moment people can see on YouTube

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Where Biden is

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Addressing a room full of people

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
And he had someone there and he goes

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Why don't you stand up so everyone can

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Give you a hand

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
And the guy was in a wheelchair

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
And Biden's like oh

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Instantly he goes you know what

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
We're all going to stand up for you

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
And he made everyone get up and applaud the guy

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
And I'm like that's quick

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Like yeah you made a fool of yourself

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
So he is a glad hander

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
In many ways he's more of a schmoozer than Trump was

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Like Trump made the point that he knows all the good people

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
But Biden knows how to shake hands

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Well I think with both

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
With both Trump and Biden like you mentioned earlier

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
To me at least

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Their family is fascinating

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
The dynamic as a family man as a father

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Biden won't acknowledge his illegitimate grand kid

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Is a problem for me

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
But at the same time

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
I can see why he thinks it's off limits to ask

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
So that's the thing when you're dealing with people that powerful

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
They're not used to having to answer questions

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Which might be perfectly nice

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
But would cause them to freak the hell out

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
That's the tricky thing with talking to people

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
As you know like some topics

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Are off limit

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Not in that they draw lines

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
But they just shut down when you ask them

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Trust me

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
I think I've talked to Elon three times now

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
You better believe I brought up love

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And how far do you think that got

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
You can just imagine exactly

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
We did

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
We did exactly the kind of robot

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Back and forth

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Just shut down

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
So yeah I worry about that with personal

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
But that's the thing that makes it fascinating

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
With those two

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Because he had

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
With Hunter and losing his

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Like the dynamic of the complexities of all that

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Like just having

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
You know children fuck up in the way children do

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
And then with Trump

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
The interesting dynamic

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
With his very different kids

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
All kind of interesting in different ways

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
And maintaining connection

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
With all of them and also letting them flourish

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Individually is fascinating to me

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
I also want to ask Trump if he can name all the presidents

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
In order which there's no way he can

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
But I'd also want to know

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Do you think he knows who the second president

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Of the United States is?

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
John Adams he knows

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
I think when it gets between Ulysses S. Grant

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
And McKinley that's when we all screw up

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
That window it's tough

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
Yeah I'm sure that's the one

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Window where he

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
He's going to be able to get back to FDR

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
No question

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
I have to

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
My sense was with Donald Trump

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
And this is not I would say criticism

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Is he doesn't have a depth

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Of knowledge or more importantly curiosity

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
About history

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Yeah but if you're old enough you're going to at least remember

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
The presidents in your lifetime

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
In your lifetime

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Yeah so that's what I'm saying

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
He'll get us from president to FDR pretty easily

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Yeah yeah okay sure

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
I thought you meant FDR from the other direction

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
No no yeah from like current FDR

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Yeah

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
But yeah from a political perspective

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Having a conversation about politics

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
With those two

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
There is interesting topics

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Interaction between

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Donald Trump and Putin

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Not the interaction like not the stupid

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Journalistic stuff

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
But it's clear to me that he

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Is a student of power

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Oh for sure

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
And like he enjoys the game

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Of power

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
And so it's interesting because to me

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
The reason he admires Putin

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Is it's another player in the game of power

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
And I think why so many people

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Hate him Trump

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Is that he demonstrated to a lot of Americans

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
How much of a con job most of politics is

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Yeah

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
And how people just say what they need to do

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
But behind closed doors these people are buffoons

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
And he exposed them as that

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
I'd also

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
I think Biden would be

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
A tougher interview than Trump because I feel like

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Biden's more slippery in many ways

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
He's much more of a consummate politician

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
He's been in the senate since the early 70s

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Since he was like 30 or 35 whatever it was

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
So

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
You know he'd have his little kind of

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Pat answers

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
There was Larry King who was certainly a

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Softball interviewer and I don't begrudge

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
From that at all I remember very vividly

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
I think it was the 2008 cycle

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
He asked Hillary

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Why do you think so many people hate you

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
And she just goes like

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Oh well I take tough stances on the

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
And he cut her off he goes other people have taken those stances

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Why do they hate you

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
And I was really impressed with him

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
He didn't let her off the hook

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
That to me is great

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
But some people say that's still too softball

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Because you

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Like they would want him to start listing

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
I don't know

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Droning like all the

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
All the things that Hillary Clinton is criticized for

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Yeah but then what she's done this many times

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
She's very good at this she'll be like

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Look I've addressed all these in the past

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
If you want to start rehashing Republican talking points

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
You can go look up my interviews

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Yeah I think it's kind of productive

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
The more prescient

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
For me

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I can't believe I'm walking through this fire for no good

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Reason whatsoever but Anthony Fauci

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Let me tell you why I care about

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Anthony Fauci because

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
I care a lot about science

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
And the way science is viewed in society

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
And not to put it

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
At the feet of this one person

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
But I

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Him and

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Certain members of the scientific

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Community that was responsible

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
For managing the response to COVID

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
I think are

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Somewhat or entirely responsible

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
For a significant decrease

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
In trust in science

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Yes no question in the past couple years

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
There was a poll that just came out this week that said the

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Number has just collapsed

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
And if you don't blame

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Him for it I personally

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
At least blame him for not

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
Improving the problem

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
And so there's definitely

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
A harsh conversation

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
There to be had and I think I want to

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Have it

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
But how do you do it it's tough

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Because you know again

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Politicians there's political answers

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
If they get too frustrated too quickly

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
They will not explore these

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Difficult things with you they'll just shut down

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
But then if you say too many nice things

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
Because I should also say

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Anthony Fauci is an incredible career

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Like there's

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Several hours worth of conversation

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
To be had about how amazing of a person

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
He is well I would also be curious about the

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Aid stuff yes because that's something gets criticized

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
About and I wouldn't come at it aggressively I would

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Say let's set the record straight this is something criticism you

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Get blah blah blah you

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Roll in the AIDS crisis let's talk

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
About this and this is something that is important

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Part of American history there was a pandemic

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
And it was localized to certain populations

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
And that population at the first

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
At least was pretty much told

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Goodbye and good luck you're gonna have to deal with this

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
So how did you deal with that I mean were you scared

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
Of getting AIDS you know so on and so forth

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
But also there was that comment when

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
And correct me if I'm wrong

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
I'm not a Fauci expert

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
When he basically they told people

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Not to wear masks or they lied about it

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
To some extent because they said

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
Then people were gonna run out of them or something like that

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
And they admitted they were being inaccurate

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
I would nail him on that like let's

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Address this were you being dishonest

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
Is there sometimes when it's important to be dishonest

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
In service of whatever also I was

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Ask him how as someone who's not

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
A politician whether his level of fame

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
And adulation has gotten to his head

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
How do you have a perspective

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
When and how does it feel when

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
A sitting senator tells you that you should be

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Imprisoned do you think Ted Cruz means

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
It or you think Ted Cruz is just playing to his base

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Yeah I

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Like the fame one

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
I would love to sneak up

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
I mean that question applies to you too

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
That question applies to me

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
When you start getting more fame or money or

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Power are you

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Aware of how that changed you

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
And like explore that like

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
How has that changed you

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Like if you like in the

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Privacy of your mind Michael Malice

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Like how did you change

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Now that you've gotten

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
More attention let's say

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
You know or even the success of the book

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
Take yourself back to

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
You know you talk about the 20

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
The early 20s

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
The mid 20s person

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Are you different from that person

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
Are you the same person or are you totally different

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
That's an interesting thought is Putin the same person

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
In 2020 as he

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Was in 2010 and then in 2000

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
It's a non

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Trivial almost like

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
And then the other thing with

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
This is a dynamic system

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Like on the one hand he's going to want to

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Say we got it right every time

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
Right but then how is that even possible when you're dealing

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
With an evolving unknown

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Dynamic situation when did you guys

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Get it wrong did that result in lives

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Lost do you feel guilty about that

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
I mean the big problem with the masks

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
The changing mind on the mask

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Is the arrogance and how it was communicated

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
To me a lot of this goes

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
On to

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
How things are communicated

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
It's like it's obvious that you need to change your mind

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
When you get new information or sometimes yeah

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
You take policies that are like

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
We know the truth but we're

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
Going to lie for a particular reason

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Like you have good intentions but

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
If you're not able to communicate that

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
Later like we made a mistake

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Or even ask him can you understand

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
How

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
A rational person might

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
Choose not to get vaccinated

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Yes yes

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Yes

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
And if you can't steel man that then that's

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
A situation that's a good test and I've

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Tried and some people succeed and some people fail

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Is the ability to really steel man

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
The other understand that

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
Somebody would be hesitant about taking the vaccine

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Yeah

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
It's a giant mess man

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
This podcasting

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Is just a fun little conversation

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
But it also has a responsibility

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
I don't know I don't know how Joe does it

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
I don't think Joe cares as much as you do

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
It's more fun for him in a sense

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
And he's less concerned about the

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
I mean he's not unconcerned with the cultural impact

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
But for him it's just more growing out

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Like he doesn't do as much prep

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
He doesn't come in with three pages single spaced

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Of questions

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
That's why he's talking

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
To Blair White for ten minutes

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
About whether sharks lay eggs

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Without knowing

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
You're the one triggered person

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Maybe he trolled the troll

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Well it worked yeah he did

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Sharks lay eggs

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
I'd like to get an updated

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
2021 version of

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Michael Maus giving advice to young

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
People

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
So there's

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
God forbid

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
High school students, college students

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Listening to you

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
And

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Looking to you for advice

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
What advice would you give them about career

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
And about life

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
How to live a life that you can be proud of

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
This happens a lot because I have my

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Locals community malice.locals.com

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
There's a lot of young people in there

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
That's a great place

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
I'll give them a meta piece of advice

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
Friends for advice

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Because you're an idiot at your age

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
And they're all idiots

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
And they don't want to seem like idiots

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
So they're just going to give you advice they pulled from the TV

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
And no one knows what you're talking about

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
And it's just going to be counterintuitive

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
So seek out advice from people

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Who you seek to emulate

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
And ask them for advice

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
If you can't get a hold of them

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Figure out a way to get a hold of them

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
Incentivize them in some way

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
You'd be surprised how many people are responsive on Twitter

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
And ask them a basic life question

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Because then they can quote tweet and answer to a whole population

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
So that would be one mechanism

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
It's also very hard at that age

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
To realize your parents

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Might not be all that bright

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
And they might not be all that good people

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
So that's a hard one

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
At that age to kind of

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Wrap your head around

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Just because they love you doesn't mean they understand you

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
And that's okay

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
We thank everybody

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Shit, your Trump's pretty good too

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
I'd like your Trump to talk to Elon

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
To have a conversation

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
Well Mr. President

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
You know, look

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
Some things you did

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
Not so much

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
But for the most part

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
I think you did a kind of good thing

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
What are you talking about

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Hey guys

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
What are we talking about

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Fuck, I fucked up the Lex

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
The other piece of advice

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
I would say is join a gym

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Or have some kind

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Of

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
Quantifiable daily improvement

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
To keep you sane

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
So the reason I always say

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
Weightlifting, and it could be

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Running

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
It could be jump rope, I don't care what it is

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Because if you have those numbers

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
Moving in the positive direction

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
Psychologically if you're dealing with depression or anxiety

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
It's concrete proof to shut your brain up

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Because your brain

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
Knows how to talk to you

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
Your brain is often your enemy

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
And it'll say exactly the right thing to undermine you

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
So that's an issue

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
Be

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
This works for me, maybe it won't for most people

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
I'm very high on the openness metric

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Try new experiences

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Try things you don't like

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
It's okay to have a bad experience

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
You've learned something

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
So go to a restaurant of a cuisine you wouldn't like

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Or hadn't heard of

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Read a book that's popular but you have no interest in

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
Read a lot

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
For example, I didn't know anything about the

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Election, what was it, 1892

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
When there was like a split between the electors

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Read a book about it

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Oh, I don't know anything really about Malcolm X

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Read a book about him

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
You'll be amazed how much more

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Full you become as a person

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Do you see value in writing also

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Like writing down your ideas

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
No, I think there's very little value in that

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
I'm not joking

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Yeah, because you're probably not going to revisit what you've written down

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
But the act of writing

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
You don't see

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
It solidifies somehow thoughts in your mind

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Not for me

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Like a tweet will because then I have to have it narrowed down

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Into like a phrase

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Or the responsibility of there being an audience

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
No, I just meant in terms of

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
I've got 280 characters

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
Instead of having a meandering thought

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
I have to codify it in something that's

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
Catchy and short

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
That's a good, useful mental exercise

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
What face do you make when you tweet?

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
I wouldn't know

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
I don't know, that's a good point

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
Is it on the toilet? What percentage is on the toilet?

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Very little

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
On the toilet side, usually more reading

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
So even though my tweets are all literally shit

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
Very few of them are on the toilet

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
They're on a throne

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
That's some advice

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Don't compare yourself

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
To other people

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
That's a really dangerous one

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
All my friends are married

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
I should have a kid by now

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
Should, there's an expression in recovery

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Stop shoulding yourself

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Should, should, should

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
It's stupid

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
I also

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
And this could be my hoarder brain

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
I surround my house with talismans of joy

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
So if you have an accomplishment

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
Like when I did Rogan once

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
I went to the sock store

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
And I bought these orange socks

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
With black cherries on them

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
And whenever I wore those socks

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
I'm like, oh, this is because I was on Rogan

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
That was kind of a big deal

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
So if you have these little things throughout your house

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
It was good mental fuel

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Even like a toy, remember when I was a kid

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
Oh, you know what?

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
Little moments that inspire happiness

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
I think are visually very useful

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
So that's another one

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000
And

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
I by the way have

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
The watch

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
Because we were talking about 2021

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
We were talking about 2021

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
That was really

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
The guy in the lecture hall

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000
Giving you a pat in the back

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000
Joe giving me the watch

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Was

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
He has life changing

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
The fact that it was on a podcast

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
Or whatever, doesn't matter

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
Learn how to

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Form boundaries

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
That's probably the biggest, that's going to be number one on my list

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Because you're going to have people around you

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000
Who feel the need that they're entitled to your time

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Who feel the need to criticize you

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
And they're not coming from a good place

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
So it's very good for you to be like

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
I'm not interested in talking about this anymore right now

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Even if it's your parents

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Especially if it's your parents

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000
Like I need my space right now

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000
You're entitled to your space, you're entitled to your time

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
No one owes you, you don't owe anyone a response

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.000
If someone has a question, you owe them an answer

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
Especially if they're not coming at you in good faith

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000
Or they're coming at you in a hostile way

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000
That's a big one

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
And

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
And

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
Be valuable

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
To those

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
Who are around you

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
Be someone who people are

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
Happy to see

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
And if things are bad

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
You're the one that they can rely on

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
Like I was just, you know

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
A little bit under the weather and I thought to myself

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000
You know what, if things got really bad I'll call Blair

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
And she would take care of me

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
And that kind of was very reassuring

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
And you can always call me

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
If you need heavy stuff lifted

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:30.000
In a

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
In an urgent matter

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
Because of the robots?

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
No, just me, it's kind of like

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
That's those things I can help with

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Or you're actually literally bleeding

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
I'm not a good caretaker, I can save you though

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
I can murder, if you need somebody murdered

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
I can do this

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
Wait, what advice would you have

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
To kids that age?

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
And you're a lot younger than you think you are

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
That's the other one

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000
Yeah, there's time

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
I know, it's impossible to understand

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
When you're 26

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
That your 40s are better than your 30s

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
Because it's like, okay, old man, that's all cope

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
I promise you it is

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
Yeah, I think

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
He said so many beautiful things

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
I would say

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Another version of the openness

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
I would say, take big risks

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000
When you're young

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
Yeah, because if you fail, who cares

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
You sleep in a futon, who cares

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000
And take them often

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000
Yeah

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
Also, this is more

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
A little personal to me

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
I get pushback on this

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
But I think

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Take big risks and work really

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Hard

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
At whatever you do

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
I think you just have to give yourself

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
To a thing

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.000
It doesn't have to be in terms of time

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
You really give everything

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000
So it's not like, I'm going to try

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000
Doing this, I'll try

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000
I'll try

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.000
Try

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000
With all your heart

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000
Really commit yourself

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
That doesn't mean necessarily hours

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000
But if you fail

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000
At doing a thing that you commit to

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000
It should hurt

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000
So when I competed in jiu jitsu

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000
Or you do sports and so on

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:14.000
Don't just say, I'm going to have fun out there

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
No, try to win

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000
Because then if you don't

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000
It hurts and you learn from that

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:22.000
And then throughout

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000
I think it's the goodness thing

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
Be kind

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000
Some of it is also skill

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000
Allowing yourself to be kind

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
I found myself earlier in life

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
I still do this

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:36.000
I find when I hang out with people

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.000
People are often cynical and negative

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.000
Yeah, I try to avoid those people

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:42.000
I think everybody

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000
Falls into that

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
And sometimes it's the party norm thing

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000
There's a temptation to me

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:50.000
To kind of fit in by being

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:52.000
More negative than I'm comfortable being

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:54.000
And so

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000
Resist the pressure

03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000
I think especially when you're younger

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
It's not cool to care

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
The thing that drives, when you're young

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000
If you are a fan of

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000
A band, a writer

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000
A podcaster, an actor

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000
And people roll their eyes at you

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000
People are dangerous

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000
If you love Avril Lavigne

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000
With her terrible music

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
And she gives you joy

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000
And people crap on you, they're wrong and you're right

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000
So hold on to those things

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000
That make you happy

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000
And if people want to take that away from you

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
How could you like that?

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:30.000
Those people are not your friends

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000
Why do you have to

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:34.000
Go make life so complicated?

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:38.000
She's my favorite

03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:40.000
Favorite musician of all time

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.000
Jimi Hendrix, second Avril Lavigne, first

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:46.000
Thank you for almost bringing a tear to my eye

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000
You mentioned the shittos

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000
In terms of love and you should

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
Have kids by now

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000
I apologize if it's a personal one but I think

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000
At least I have this thought

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000
And not from society but from myself

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
Like I want to get married, I want to have kids

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
Do you feel the

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
Pressure of that? Do you want to have

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000
Kids? I don't want to have

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000
Kids. Do you want to get married?

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
I do want to get married

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
This was an issue that I

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
Had to kind of work out earlier this year

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000
In terms of

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
The possibility of having kids

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000
Because I was

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000
In a relationship with someone who would have been

03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000
In many ways literally a perfect

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000
Mom so I did

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000
My due diligence and I actually sat down

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000
With

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.000
Friends of mine who had kids and I say

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000
Give me the downside

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000
You did the pros and the cons

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000
The pros I knew, the pros for kids are very

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000
I love kids, I was just

03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000
With Frank Fleming, he writes for the Babylon Bee

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
And he had his four kids and his

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000
Youngest son has Down syndrome which is

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000
Adorable, Winchester

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000
Is so cute

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000
And I always get along with kids

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Like I remember

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
Very vividly what it was like

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:58.000
To be a kid, especially

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000
A precocious kid and I remember how

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000
Much it bothered me when my parents friends

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
Wouldn't give me attention

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000
So I always make it a point to

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Acknowledge kids, to talk to them and they're very

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000
Grateful and it's

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:12.000
Just really fun, especially

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
The people who I'm friends with, their kids are probably

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Going to be pretty cool, they're not going to be annoying and

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
Kind of ugly and overweight

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000
I love how you got that in there, okay good

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:26.000
Sorry, I'll go

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000
But the cons, the

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Negatives, what was the conversation like

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
About that?

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000
My sister has two kids, my nephews who I

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:36.000
Absolutely adore, whatever their names are

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000
And she

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000
Was saying certain

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.000
Things, it's like if I had kids, my kids are in my

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000
Top priority

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
It's not even a question and

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:48.000
I feel like the work I'm doing

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:50.000
And this sounds pompous but it's true

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:52.000
Is A,

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000
Valuable and important, but I'm also

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
The only one doing it, so this is

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000
A big cost

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000
And so it's like

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
It would be a major

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000
Lifestyle readjustment

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000
And I'm at the point where I'm kind of

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000
Selfish enough that

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:10.000
I wouldn't want to do that

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:12.000
And I also would have to do it with the right woman

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.000
Like you're making a commitment

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000
And since they're all crazy

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.000
You have to find one where you can handle the

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.000
Crazy

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000
All women are crazy?

03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:24.000
They're one and a halfs in a binary world

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:26.000
Oh boy, that's not comfortable for me

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.000
No sir

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:32.000
But do you feel the pressure in thinking of that?

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000
How much does that weigh on your heart?

03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:36.000
So Elon has kids

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000
I feel

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000
Like I love everything

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.000
And I love stuff I do

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000
I love the robot over there

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
Just working with robots

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000
But I do feel the pressure

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.000
Of like

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
Almost like

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.000
When there's amazing cuisines

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000
You never tried or something like that

03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000
Like go out there and try

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.000
Like you need to put in the work

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000
And I don't know

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
Like life will run away from you

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
Slip through your fingers before you truly get to

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000
Experience this other kind of love

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000
Which is like

03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.000
Long term

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.000
Love for another human being

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Which is like marriage

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.000
And then love for kids

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.000
Yeah

03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000
And it almost makes me sad

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.000
Like not

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000
Getting to experience that

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:28.000
You know

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
Because I'm also really scared of

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:32.000
I've seen so many bad stories

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.000
On the partner side

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:36.000
Like being with the wrong person

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.000
That to me is

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.000
I'm not worried I have kids all day

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
In fact I could probably just have kids without the

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000
Partner

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000
Kids I think are

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000
Incredible

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000
But the partner like a wife

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000
It seems like

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.000
She could then have the negative consequences

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000
For like you as a writer on your productivity

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000
On your mental ability to flourish

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000
Being a joy to others

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:02.000
You know what

03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.000
That couldn't happen because every relationship

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:06.000
I've had

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.000
They've been very

03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.000
Beyond supportive

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
Like

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:14.000
They'd rather do the

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000
Take an hour and do your work than spend time with me

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000
Like I believe in what you're doing

03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.000
So I couldn't even casually date someone

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000
Who didn't believe that yeah

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.000
So that's energizing

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:26.000
But over time you never know like how that evolves

03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000
And all those kinds of things

03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.000
And for me I think we're a little bit different

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:32.000
I mean that has to do with the engineering thing

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:34.000
I just have to pull insane hours

03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000
I work like two hours a day

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000
But that's what like creatives do

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.000
You can only work a couple hours

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000
Honestly to be

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:44.000
Productive and the rest of the time not

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.000
I have to do a lot of menial labor

03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:48.000
And so there there's legit

03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:50.000
Tension on terms of time

03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:52.000
And attention all those kinds of things

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:54.000
I don't know

03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:56.000
Do you think about this stuff a lot or do you just

03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:58.000
Love life and do cool stuff

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000
And whatever happens happens

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:02.000
I have been so blessed for so long

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000
Now that I'm at the point

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.000
Where I don't think about it and I'm like

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:08.000
You know

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:10.000
Just like miracles happen every day

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.000
So just be open to it

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:14.000
You

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:16.000
Think about your death, mortality

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000
Yes

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:20.000
Fear, what do you feel about it?

03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:22.000
I'm just worried I want to take as many people out with me

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000
As possible

03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:26.000
So suitcase nuke

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:28.000
I'm thinking

03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:30.000
In New York

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000
That would be kind of

03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000
Like ironic

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.000
As my other favorite artist would say

03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:38.000
I think about my legacy

03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.000
And that's why my books are so important to me

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.000
Do you think of it as a kind of

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:46.000
Immortality? It is though

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:48.000
Like that's who you are, it's those books

03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:50.000
It's not who I am, my legacy certainly

03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000
Is

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000
What do you hope your legacy is?

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
That I encourage

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.000
People to be

03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000
Hopeful and that I taught them

03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:04.000
How to be free

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000
And my favorite

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:08.000
I think the best show of all time

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:10.000
Was Dallas

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.000
Which often gets

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.000
It was like an 80s soap opera and people conflate it with

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.000
Dynasty and they think it's trashy

03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.000
And it was very Shakespearean because

03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:20.000
All the characters are motivated by different values

03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.000
And the writing is just

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.000
Masterful and the acting is masterful

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:26.000
And I'm not going to

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:28.000
Spoil anything, one season ended

03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:30.000
With

03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:32.000
One of the characters on their deathbed in the hospital

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.000
And the whole cast is there and the amount of acting talent

03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:36.000
In that room is just

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.000
Phenomenal

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.000
And as the

03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.000
Character is dying, they look around

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:44.000
And they go, like please

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000
Be kind to one another, be a family

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.000
And they're yelling at this character, don't you

03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000
Dare die on me, you know, and you can see

03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:52.000
The actors, you know, because they're losing their

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000
Cast mate who they've had from the beginning

03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000
And it would have been a perfect ending to the show but obviously

03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:58.000
It's a cash cow, they gotta keep milking it

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.000
And I think

03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:02.000
There's that kindness and tenderness

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:04.000
And this is Michael Malice talking

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.000
There's a lot of people

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000
Who want to make it

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000
That if you

03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:12.000
Are kind or tender, you're going to have consequences

03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.000
Bad consequences

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:16.000
And I think it's important for me at least

03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000
To create a space in my

03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:20.000
Life that if someone

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.000
Is going to be nice

03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.000
Or friendly or kind

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.000
That they're not going to have to feel stupid

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:28.000
Or bad about it

03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:30.000
We have such a, it's such a disincentive

03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:32.000
Like the set of structures are different, like

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000
If you want to be cynical and sneering

03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:36.000
Like round of applause, but if someone says

03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000
Oh this is great, like, okay simp

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.000
It's really bad

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.000
Well I think you do just this

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000
You do this today, you do this

03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:46.000
In our friendship

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.000
And you do it for a very large number of

03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:50.000
People is teach them how to be

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000
How to have hope
