00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The following is a conversation with Neil Ferguson,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.960
one of the great historians of our time,

00:04.960 --> 00:07.660
at times controversial and always brilliant,

00:07.660 --> 00:09.760
whether you agree with him or not.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.840
He's an author of 16 books on topics covering

00:13.840 --> 00:18.440
the history of money, power, war, pandemics, and empire.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.360
Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.920
and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas

00:25.920 --> 00:28.700
called the University of Austin,

00:28.700 --> 00:31.820
a new institution built from the ground up

00:31.820 --> 00:34.500
to encourage open inquiry and discourse

00:34.500 --> 00:36.260
by both thinkers and doers,

00:36.260 --> 00:38.100
from philosophers and historians

00:38.100 --> 00:40.220
to scientists and engineers,

00:40.220 --> 00:43.900
embracing debate, dissent, and self-examination,

00:43.900 --> 00:46.900
free to speak, to disagree, to think,

00:46.900 --> 00:49.740
to explore truly novel ideas.

00:49.740 --> 00:52.100
The advisory board includes Steven Pinker,

00:52.100 --> 00:55.180
Jonathan Haidt, and many other amazing people,

00:55.180 --> 00:58.580
with one exception, me.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.300
I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,

01:01.300 --> 01:04.380
which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part

01:04.380 --> 01:08.100
in helping build the future of education and open discourse,

01:08.100 --> 01:10.540
especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,

01:10.540 --> 01:12.260
robotics, and computing.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.500
We spend the first hour of this conversation

01:14.500 --> 01:16.620
talking about this new university

01:16.620 --> 01:18.940
before switching to talking about

01:18.940 --> 01:21.140
some of the darkest moments in human history

01:21.140 --> 01:23.700
and what they reveal about human nature.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.540
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.700
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:28.700 --> 01:29.980
in the description.

01:29.980 --> 01:33.860
And now, here's my conversation with Neil Ferguson.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.300
You are one of the great historians of our time,

01:37.300 --> 01:40.140
respected, sometimes controversial.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.220
You have flourished in some of the best universities

01:42.220 --> 01:45.220
in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics

01:45.220 --> 01:49.500
to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.260
Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,

01:53.260 --> 01:55.780
let us talk about a new university.

01:55.780 --> 01:59.740
You're a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.

01:59.740 --> 02:04.740
It is called University of Austin, UATX.

02:04.940 --> 02:08.140
What is its mission, its goals, its plan?

02:09.340 --> 02:13.980
I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people

02:13.980 --> 02:17.660
in higher education that there's a problem.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.500
And that problem manifests itself

02:19.500 --> 02:22.100
in a great many different ways.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.820
But I would sum up the problem as being

02:25.820 --> 02:30.620
a drastic chilling of the atmosphere

02:30.620 --> 02:34.540
that constrains free speech, free exchange,

02:34.540 --> 02:35.740
even free thought.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.500
And I had never anticipated

02:38.500 --> 02:40.420
that this would happen in my lifetime.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.140
My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s

02:43.140 --> 02:45.580
when anything went.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.060
One sensed that a university was a place

02:48.060 --> 02:51.340
where one could risk saying the unsayable

02:52.180 --> 02:54.380
and debate the undebatable.

02:54.380 --> 02:58.660
So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,

02:58.660 --> 03:02.180
a variety of ideas, critical race theory or wokeism,

03:02.180 --> 03:03.020
whatever you want to call it,

03:03.020 --> 03:06.580
a variety of ideas have come along that seek to limit

03:06.580 --> 03:10.060
and quite drastically limit what we can talk about,

03:10.060 --> 03:12.620
strikes me as deeply unhealthy.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.540
And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this

03:14.540 --> 03:15.900
for a long time, you can fix it

03:15.900 --> 03:17.740
with the existing institutions.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.100
I think you need to create a new one.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.060
And so after much deliberation, we decided to do it.

03:24.060 --> 03:29.060
And I think it's a hugely timely opportunity

03:29.980 --> 03:33.100
to do what people used to do in this country,

03:33.100 --> 03:34.660
which was to create new institutions.

03:34.660 --> 03:37.540
I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.620
We sort of stopped doing that.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.620
I mean, I look back and I thought,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.860
why are there no new universities?

03:41.860 --> 03:42.980
Or at least if there are,

03:42.980 --> 03:45.100
why do they have so little impact?

03:45.100 --> 03:49.660
It seems like we have the billionaires, we have the need.

03:49.660 --> 03:50.500
Let's do it.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.940
So you still believe in institutions, in the university,

03:53.940 --> 03:56.020
in the ideal of the university?

03:56.020 --> 03:59.180
I believe passionately in that ideal.

03:59.180 --> 04:00.700
There's a reason they've been around

04:00.700 --> 04:02.740
for nearly a millennium.

04:02.740 --> 04:07.740
There is a unique thing that happens

04:08.380 --> 04:11.940
on a university campus when it's done right.

04:11.940 --> 04:16.540
And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.260
That is a very sacred activity.

04:18.260 --> 04:22.780
And it seems to withstand major changes in technology.

04:22.780 --> 04:25.140
So this form that we call the university

04:25.140 --> 04:29.580
predates the printing press, survived the printing press,

04:29.580 --> 04:32.060
continued to function through the scientific revolution,

04:32.060 --> 04:37.060
the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
And I think it's because,

04:39.300 --> 04:41.540
maybe because of evolutionary psychology,

04:41.540 --> 04:46.540
we need to be together in one relatively confined space

04:48.540 --> 04:51.820
when we're in our late teens and early twenties

04:51.820 --> 04:53.220
for the knowledge transfer

04:53.220 --> 04:56.340
between the generations to happen.

04:56.340 --> 04:58.180
That's my feeling about this.

04:58.180 --> 05:00.740
But in order for it to work well,

05:00.740 --> 05:03.660
there needs to be very few constraints.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.740
There needs to be a sense

05:05.740 --> 05:07.900
that one can take intellectual risk.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.740
Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties

05:10.740 --> 05:14.220
are adults, but they're inexperienced adults.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.700
And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,

05:17.700 --> 05:21.700
saying stupid things was my MO.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.980
My way to finding good ideas

05:24.980 --> 05:28.740
was through a minefield of bad ideas.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.260
I feel so sorry for people like me today.

05:33.260 --> 05:36.140
People age 18, 19, 20 today

05:36.140 --> 05:40.500
who are intellectually very curious,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.980
ambitious, but inexperienced

05:42.980 --> 05:47.900
because the minefields today are absolutely lethal.

05:47.900 --> 05:52.060
And one wrong food and it's cancellation.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.380
I said this to Peter Thiel the other day.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.020
Imagine being us now.

05:57.020 --> 06:01.180
I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.500
There's nothing that Peter did at Stanford

06:03.500 --> 06:06.380
that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.020
And perhaps we were even worse.

06:08.980 --> 06:11.700
But it was so not career ending

06:11.700 --> 06:15.580
to be an absolutely insufferable,

06:17.260 --> 06:21.060
obnoxious undergraduate then.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.540
Today, if people like us exist today,

06:24.540 --> 06:28.260
they must live in a state of constant anxiety

06:28.260 --> 06:30.620
that they're going to be outed

06:30.620 --> 06:32.900
for some heretical statement

06:32.900 --> 06:35.300
that they made five years ago on social media.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.540
So part of what motivates me is the desire

06:38.540 --> 06:43.540
to give the me's of today a shot at free thinking

06:44.500 --> 06:49.500
and really, I call it aggressive learning,

06:51.780 --> 06:54.300
learning where you're really pushed.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.340
And I just think that stopped happening

06:56.340 --> 06:59.420
on the major campuses because whether at Harvard

06:59.420 --> 07:02.660
where I used to teach or at Stanford where I'm now based,

07:02.660 --> 07:07.060
I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self-censorship

07:07.060 --> 07:09.540
that means people are afraid

07:09.540 --> 07:12.500
to take even minimal risk in class.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.700
I mean, just take, for example,

07:14.700 --> 07:17.740
a survey that was published earlier this year

07:17.740 --> 07:20.380
that revealed this is of undergraduates

07:20.380 --> 07:22.380
in four year programs in the US.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.620
85% of self-described liberal students

07:26.620 --> 07:28.780
said they would report a professor

07:28.780 --> 07:30.820
to the university administration

07:30.820 --> 07:33.780
if he or she said something they considered offensive

07:33.780 --> 07:36.540
and something like 75% said they'd do it

07:36.540 --> 07:38.100
to a fellow undergraduate.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.700
That's the kind of culture

07:39.700 --> 07:41.740
that's evolved in our universities.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.780
So we need a new university in which none of that is true,

07:44.780 --> 07:48.100
in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,

07:48.100 --> 07:52.460
get it completely wrong and live to tell the tale.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.300
There's a lot more going on, I think,

07:54.300 --> 07:56.820
because when you start thinking about what's wrong

07:56.820 --> 07:58.340
with a modern university,

07:58.340 --> 08:01.820
many, many more things suggest themselves.

08:01.820 --> 08:03.540
And I think there's an opportunity here

08:03.540 --> 08:06.980
to build something that's radically new in some ways

08:06.980 --> 08:10.140
and radically traditional in other ways.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.900
For example, I have a strong preference

08:11.900 --> 08:14.420
for the tutorial system that you see

08:14.420 --> 08:17.780
at Oxford and Cambridge, which is small group teaching

08:17.780 --> 08:21.340
and highly Socratic in its structure.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.660
I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States

08:23.660 --> 08:25.780
where it doesn't really exist.

08:25.780 --> 08:26.620
But at the same time,

08:26.620 --> 08:30.900
I think we should be doing some very 21st century things,

08:30.900 --> 08:33.140
making sure that while people are reading

08:33.140 --> 08:35.620
and studying classic works,

08:35.620 --> 08:39.580
they're also going to be immersed in the real world

08:39.580 --> 08:43.420
of technological innovation, a world that you know very well.

08:44.300 --> 08:49.300
And I'd love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical,

08:49.620 --> 08:52.300
which we're gradually letting fade away

08:52.300 --> 08:55.540
with the novel and technological.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.580
We wanna produce people who can simultaneously

08:58.580 --> 09:02.580
talk intelligently about Adam Smith,

09:02.580 --> 09:06.500
or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,

09:06.500 --> 09:11.500
and have a conversation with you about where AI is going

09:11.580 --> 09:14.940
and how long it will be before I can get driven here

09:14.940 --> 09:17.060
by a self-driving vehicle,

09:17.060 --> 09:18.860
allowing me to have my lunch and prepare

09:18.860 --> 09:22.340
rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.340
So that's the dream, that we can create something

09:25.340 --> 09:29.260
which is partly classical and partly 21st century,

09:29.260 --> 09:31.140
and we look around and we don't see it.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.020
If you don't see an institution

09:33.020 --> 09:35.100
that you really think should exist,

09:35.100 --> 09:38.140
I think you have a more responsibility to create it.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.380
So you're thinking,

09:39.380 --> 09:43.220
including something bigger than just liberal education,

09:43.220 --> 09:46.100
also including science, engineering, and technology.

09:46.100 --> 09:51.100
I should also comment that I mostly stay out of politics

09:51.500 --> 09:55.660
and out of some of these aspects of liberal education

09:55.660 --> 09:57.460
that's kind of been the most controversial

09:57.460 --> 09:59.540
and difficult within the university,

09:59.540 --> 10:04.500
but there is a kind of ripple effect of fear

10:04.500 --> 10:08.260
within that space into science

10:08.260 --> 10:10.540
and engineering and technology

10:10.540 --> 10:15.540
that I think has a nature that's difficult to describe.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.660
It doesn't have a controversial nature.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.380
It just has a nature of fear,

10:19.380 --> 10:21.060
where you're not,

10:21.060 --> 10:24.220
you're much as saying stupid stuff as a young 20-year-old.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.100
For example, deep learning, machine learning

10:30.100 --> 10:32.780
is really popular in the computer science now

10:32.780 --> 10:34.300
as an approach for creating

10:34.300 --> 10:36.060
artificial intelligence systems.

10:36.060 --> 10:40.060
It is controversial in that space

10:40.060 --> 10:43.700
to say that anything against machine learning,

10:43.700 --> 10:46.500
saying, sort of exploring ideas that saying,

10:46.500 --> 10:49.180
this is going to lead to a dead end.

10:50.140 --> 10:54.180
Now that takes some guts to do as a young 20-year-old

10:54.180 --> 10:57.380
within a classroom to think like that,

10:57.380 --> 10:59.740
to raise that question in a machine learning course.

10:59.740 --> 11:00.980
It sounds ridiculous

11:00.980 --> 11:03.860
because it's like who's going to complain about this,

11:03.860 --> 11:08.860
but the fear that starts in a course on history

11:10.180 --> 11:13.620
or on some course that covers society,

11:13.620 --> 11:16.980
the fear ripples and affects those students

11:16.980 --> 11:18.900
that are asking big out of the box questions

11:18.900 --> 11:22.140
about engineering, about computer science.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.340
And there's a lot,

11:23.340 --> 11:26.260
there's like linear algebra that's not going to change,

11:26.260 --> 11:29.180
but then there's like applied linear algebra,

11:29.180 --> 11:30.220
which is machine learning.

11:30.220 --> 11:34.980
And that's when robots and real systems touch human beings.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.860
And that's when you have to ask yourself

11:36.860 --> 11:40.020
these difficult questions about humanity,

11:40.020 --> 11:43.020
even in the engineering and science and technology courses.

11:43.020 --> 11:46.420
And these are not separate worlds in two senses.

11:46.420 --> 11:50.060
I've just taken delivery of my copy of the book

11:50.060 --> 11:53.700
that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger have co-authored

11:53.700 --> 11:55.020
on artificial intelligence.

11:55.020 --> 11:56.620
The central question of which is,

11:56.620 --> 11:59.660
what does this mean for us broadly?

11:59.660 --> 12:04.100
But they're not separate worlds in C.P. Snow's sense

12:04.100 --> 12:07.060
of the chasm between science and arts,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.820
because on a university campus,

12:09.820 --> 12:13.660
everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus

12:13.660 --> 12:16.380
to the behaviors that are occurring

12:16.380 --> 12:18.380
in the English department.

12:18.380 --> 12:23.380
Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,

12:23.380 --> 12:25.220
undergraduate denounces professor,

12:25.220 --> 12:27.100
teaching assistant denounces undergraduate,

12:27.100 --> 12:28.260
those behaviors are contagious

12:28.260 --> 12:31.020
and will spread inexorably first to social science

12:31.020 --> 12:32.500
and then to natural sciences.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.980
And I think that's part of the reason why

12:35.980 --> 12:37.380
when this started to happen,

12:37.380 --> 12:40.860
when we started to get the origins of disinvitation

12:40.860 --> 12:42.340
and cancel culture,

12:42.340 --> 12:45.500
it was not just a few conservative professors

12:45.500 --> 12:47.260
in the humanities who had to worry.

12:47.260 --> 12:50.060
Everybody had to worry because eventually

12:50.060 --> 12:54.180
it was going to come even to the most apparently

12:54.180 --> 12:57.700
hard stem part of the campus.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.900
It's contagious.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.860
This is something Nicholas Christakis should look at

13:00.860 --> 13:03.220
because he's very good at looking at the way

13:03.220 --> 13:06.100
in which social networks like the ones that exist

13:06.100 --> 13:08.740
in a university can spread everything.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.580
But I think when we look back and ask,

13:10.580 --> 13:13.580
why did wokeism spread so rapidly

13:13.580 --> 13:15.620
and rapidly out of humanities

13:15.620 --> 13:17.180
into other parts of universities?

13:17.180 --> 13:19.580
And why did it spread across the country

13:19.580 --> 13:21.620
and beyond the United States

13:21.620 --> 13:23.500
to the other English speaking universities?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.740
It's because it's a contagion.

13:25.740 --> 13:28.540
And these behaviors are contagious.

13:28.540 --> 13:32.700
The president of a university I won't name said to me

13:32.700 --> 13:37.540
that he receives every day at least one denunciation,

13:37.540 --> 13:40.900
one call for somebody or other to be fired

13:40.900 --> 13:43.100
for something that they said.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.900
That's the crazy kind of totalitarianism light

13:46.900 --> 13:50.620
that now exists in our universities.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.740
And of course, the people who want to downplay this say,

13:52.740 --> 13:54.780
oh, well, there only have been a hundred and something

13:54.780 --> 13:57.940
in disinvitations or oh, there really aren't that many cases.

13:57.940 --> 14:00.420
But the point is that the famous events,

14:00.420 --> 14:02.540
the events that get the attention

14:03.380 --> 14:05.020
are responsible for a general chilling

14:05.020 --> 14:07.860
that as you say, spreads to every part of the university

14:07.860 --> 14:10.820
and creates a very familiar culture

14:10.820 --> 14:13.420
in which people are afraid to say what they think.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.860
Self-censorship, look at the Heterodox Academy data on this,

14:16.860 --> 14:17.860
grows and grows.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.380
So now a majority of students will say,

14:20.380 --> 14:22.980
this is clear from the latest Heterodox Academy surveys,

14:22.980 --> 14:24.780
we are scared to say what we think

14:24.780 --> 14:28.540
in case we get denounced, in case we get canceled.

14:28.540 --> 14:31.340
But that's just not the correct atmosphere

14:31.340 --> 14:33.980
for a university in a free society.

14:33.980 --> 14:38.140
To me, what's really creepy is how many of the behaviors

14:38.140 --> 14:41.620
I see on university campuses today are reminiscent

14:41.620 --> 14:44.740
of the way that people used to behave in the Soviet Union

14:44.740 --> 14:47.300
or in the Soviet block or in Maoist China.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.780
The sort of totalitarianism light

14:49.780 --> 14:52.780
that I think we're contending with here,

14:52.780 --> 14:56.500
which manifests itself as denunciations,

14:56.500 --> 14:59.700
people informing on superiors.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.860
Some people using it for career advantage.

15:02.860 --> 15:07.140
Other people reduced to helpless, desperate apology

15:07.140 --> 15:09.020
to try to exonerate themselves.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.500
People disappearing metaphorically, if not literally.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.140
All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes

15:16.140 --> 15:17.780
that I studied earlier in my career

15:17.780 --> 15:20.140
that it makes me feel sick.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.500
And what makes me really feel sick

15:21.500 --> 15:23.700
is that the people doing this stuff,

15:23.700 --> 15:26.540
the people who write the letters of denunciation

15:26.540 --> 15:28.860
are apparently unaware that they're behaving

15:28.860 --> 15:31.220
exactly like people in Stalin's Soviet Union.

15:31.220 --> 15:32.580
They don't know that.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.700
So they clearly have,

15:33.700 --> 15:36.020
there's been a massive educational failure.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.700
If somebody can write an anonymous

15:37.700 --> 15:41.220
or non-anonymous letter of denunciation and not feel shame,

15:41.220 --> 15:44.580
I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated

15:44.580 --> 15:45.580
as you're doing that.

15:45.580 --> 15:47.540
But people haven't been taught

15:47.540 --> 15:49.740
the realities of totalitarianism.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.620
For all these reasons, I think you need to try,

15:52.620 --> 15:54.820
at least to create a new institution

15:54.860 --> 15:59.860
where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.100
So maybe a difficult question.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.060
Maybe you'll push back on this,

16:06.060 --> 16:09.180
but you're widely seen politically as a conservative.

16:09.180 --> 16:12.460
Hoover Institution is politically conservative.

16:12.460 --> 16:15.940
What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?

16:15.940 --> 16:18.780
Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,

16:18.780 --> 16:21.300
when they hear the ideas you're expressing,

16:21.300 --> 16:23.980
they may think there's a lean to these ideas.

16:23.980 --> 16:26.220
There's a conservative lean to these ideas.

16:26.220 --> 16:28.340
Is there such a lean?

16:28.340 --> 16:30.180
There will certainly be people who say that

16:30.180 --> 16:34.780
because the standard mode of trying to discredit

16:34.780 --> 16:36.620
any new initiative is to say,

16:36.620 --> 16:41.620
oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.

16:41.860 --> 16:44.820
But one of our co-founders,

16:44.820 --> 16:49.180
Heather Hying is definitely not a conservative.

16:49.180 --> 16:53.300
She's as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.700
But I think on political issues,

16:54.700 --> 16:57.340
we probably agree on almost nothing,

16:57.340 --> 16:59.980
and at least I would guess.

16:59.980 --> 17:04.780
But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,

17:04.780 --> 17:07.340
that politics really should stop at the threshold

17:07.340 --> 17:09.740
of the classroom, of the lecture hall.

17:09.740 --> 17:11.940
And in my career, I've always tried to make sure

17:11.940 --> 17:13.700
that when I'm teaching,

17:13.700 --> 17:17.980
it's not clear where I stand politically,

17:17.980 --> 17:19.660
though of course undergraduates

17:19.660 --> 17:22.140
insatiably curiously want to know,

17:22.140 --> 17:24.620
but it shouldn't be clear from what I say

17:24.620 --> 17:28.020
because indoctrination on a political basis

17:28.020 --> 17:30.860
is an abuse of the power of the professor,

17:30.860 --> 17:32.940
as Weber rightly said.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.940
So I think one of the key principles

17:35.940 --> 17:38.300
of the University of Austin will be

17:38.300 --> 17:42.020
that Weberian principle that politics is not

17:42.020 --> 17:46.900
an appropriate subject for the lecture hall,

17:46.900 --> 17:50.540
for the classroom, and we should pursue truth

17:51.420 --> 17:55.420
and enshrine liberty of thought.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.700
If that's a political issue, then I can't help you.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.060
I mean, if you're against freedom of thought,

18:01.060 --> 18:04.860
then we don't really have much of a discussion to have.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.020
And clearly there are some people

18:06.020 --> 18:08.260
who politically seem quite hostile to it.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.980
But my sense is that there are plenty of people

18:10.980 --> 18:12.420
on the left in academia.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.460
Think of that interesting partnership

18:14.460 --> 18:18.220
between Cornel West and Robbie George,

18:18.380 --> 18:20.500
which has been institutionalized

18:20.500 --> 18:22.380
in the Academic Freedom Alliance.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.020
It's bipartisan, this issue.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.380
It really, really is.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.380
After all, 50 years ago,

18:27.380 --> 18:30.460
it was the left that was in favor of free speech.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.940
The right still has an anti-free speech element to it.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.140
Look how quickly they're out to ban critical race theory.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.540
Critical race theory won't be banned

18:38.540 --> 18:39.980
at the University of Texas.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.940
Wokeism won't be banned.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.060
Everything will be up for discussion.

18:44.060 --> 18:46.100
But the rules of engagement will be clear.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.420
Chicago principles, those will be enforced.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.580
And if you have to give a lecture on,

18:53.580 --> 18:56.460
well, let's just take a recent example,

18:56.460 --> 18:57.860
the Dorian Abbott case.

18:57.860 --> 19:02.100
If you're giving a lecture on astrophysics,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.820
but it turns out that in some different venue,

19:04.820 --> 19:08.220
you express skepticism about affirmative action.

19:08.220 --> 19:09.340
Well, it doesn't matter.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.220
It's irrelevant.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.100
We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics

19:13.100 --> 19:16.180
because that's what you're supposed to be giving a lecture on.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.780
That used to be understood.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.380
I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,

19:19.380 --> 19:22.940
there were communists and there were ultra Tories.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.820
At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary

19:25.820 --> 19:28.260
that they celebrated Franco's birthday,

19:28.260 --> 19:30.260
but they were also out and out communists

19:30.260 --> 19:32.780
down the road at King's College.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.060
The understanding was that

19:34.060 --> 19:36.220
that kind of intellectual diversity

19:36.220 --> 19:38.900
was part and parcel of university life.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.060
And frankly, for an undergraduate,

19:40.060 --> 19:42.020
it was great fun to cross the road

19:42.060 --> 19:47.060
and go from outright conservatism, ultra-Torism to communism.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.940
One learns a lot that way.

19:49.940 --> 19:53.060
But the issue is when you're promoting or hiring

19:53.060 --> 19:57.460
or tenuring people, their politics is not relevant.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.060
It really isn't.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.540
And when it started to become relevant,

20:01.540 --> 20:03.340
and I remember this coming up

20:03.340 --> 20:06.820
at the Harvard history department late in my time there,

20:06.820 --> 20:09.100
I felt deeply, deeply uneasy

20:09.100 --> 20:11.580
that we were having conversations

20:11.580 --> 20:15.780
that amounted to, well, we can't hire X person

20:15.780 --> 20:19.980
despite their obvious academic qualifications

20:19.980 --> 20:24.420
because of some political issue.

20:24.420 --> 20:27.540
That's not what should happen at a healthy university.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.900
Some practical questions.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.820
Will University of Austin be a physical

20:34.820 --> 20:38.060
in-person university or virtual university?

20:38.100 --> 20:42.420
What are some, in that aspect, where the classroom is?

20:42.420 --> 20:45.780
It will be a real space institution.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.740
There may be an online dimension to it

20:50.740 --> 20:52.380
because there clearly are a lot of things

20:52.380 --> 20:56.420
that you can do via the internet.

20:56.420 --> 21:00.220
But the core activity of teaching and learning,

21:00.220 --> 21:02.060
I think, requires real space.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.940
And I've thought about this a long time,

21:03.940 --> 21:07.420
debated Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago

21:07.500 --> 21:09.540
and he was a complete believer in,

21:09.540 --> 21:11.980
let's call it the metaversity to go with the metaverse.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.020
I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn't it?

21:14.020 --> 21:16.940
But I never really believed in the metaversity.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.340
I didn't do MOOCs because I just didn't think

21:19.340 --> 21:22.260
you'd A, be able to retain the attention,

21:22.260 --> 21:27.020
B, be able to cope with the scaled grading that was involved.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.940
I think there's a reason universities have been around

21:29.940 --> 21:32.220
in their form for about a millennium.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.540
You kind of need to all be in the same place.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.900
So I think answer to that question,

21:36.900 --> 21:39.980
definitely a campus in the Austin area.

21:39.980 --> 21:41.780
That's where we'll start.

21:41.780 --> 21:45.140
And if we can allow some of our content

21:45.140 --> 21:48.580
to be available online, great, we'll certainly do that.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.940
Another question is what kind of courses

21:50.940 --> 21:52.540
and programming will it offer?

21:52.540 --> 21:54.140
Is that something you can speak to?

21:54.140 --> 21:55.740
What's your vision here?

21:55.740 --> 22:00.540
We think that we need to begin more like a startup

22:00.540 --> 22:05.140
than like a full service university from day one.

22:05.140 --> 22:08.260
So our vision is that we start with a summer school,

22:09.380 --> 22:12.540
which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.

22:12.540 --> 22:17.540
We want, I think, to begin by giving a platform

22:18.500 --> 22:21.940
to the professors who've been most subject

22:21.940 --> 22:24.020
to council culture and also to give an opportunity

22:24.020 --> 22:25.820
to students who want to hear them to come.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.220
So we'll start with a summer school

22:27.220 --> 22:30.100
that will be somewhat in the tradition

22:30.100 --> 22:33.380
of those institutions in the interwar period

22:33.380 --> 22:34.860
that were havens for refugees.

22:34.860 --> 22:37.420
So we're dealing here with the internal refugees

22:37.420 --> 22:39.820
of the woke era.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.460
We'll start there.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.540
It'll be an opportunity to test out some content,

22:45.540 --> 22:50.540
see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.700
So that's part A, that's the sort of,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.180
if you like, the launch product.

22:56.180 --> 23:00.380
And then we go straight to a master's program.

23:00.380 --> 23:03.420
I don't think you can go to undergraduate education

23:03.420 --> 23:06.700
right away because the established brands

23:06.700 --> 23:09.300
in undergraduate education are offering something

23:09.300 --> 23:11.060
it's impossible to compete with initially

23:11.060 --> 23:14.900
because they have the brand, Harvard, Yale, Stanford,

23:14.900 --> 23:18.060
and they offer also this peer network,

23:19.060 --> 23:21.740
which is part of the reason people want so badly

23:21.740 --> 23:24.140
to go to those places, not really the professors,

23:24.140 --> 23:25.580
it's the classmates.

23:25.580 --> 23:28.180
So we don't wanna compete there initially.

23:28.180 --> 23:31.260
Where there is, I think, room for new entrants

23:31.260 --> 23:35.020
is in a master's program.

23:35.020 --> 23:38.260
And the first one will be in entrepreneurship

23:38.260 --> 23:42.380
and leadership, because I think there is a huge hunger

23:42.380 --> 23:44.180
amongst people who want to get into,

23:44.180 --> 23:46.060
particularly the technology world,

23:46.060 --> 23:47.140
to learn about those things.

23:47.140 --> 23:48.900
And they know they're not really going to learn

23:48.900 --> 23:50.780
about them at business schools.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.180
The people who are not going to teach them leadership

23:53.180 --> 23:55.540
and entrepreneurship are professors.

23:55.540 --> 23:59.460
So we want to create something that will be a little like

23:59.460 --> 24:02.660
the very successful Schwarzman program in China,

24:02.660 --> 24:05.140
which was come and spend a year in China

24:05.140 --> 24:07.540
and find out about China.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.500
We'll be doing the same, essentially saying,

24:09.500 --> 24:12.260
come and spend a year and find out about technology.

24:12.260 --> 24:15.180
And there'll be a mix of academic content.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.940
We want people to understand some of the first principles

24:17.940 --> 24:19.460
of what they're studying.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.660
There are first principles of entrepreneurship

24:21.660 --> 24:23.580
and leadership, but we also want them to spend time

24:23.580 --> 24:26.420
with people like one of our co-founders, Joe Lonsdale,

24:26.420 --> 24:30.060
who's been a hugely successful venture capitalist

24:30.060 --> 24:33.260
and learned directly from people like him.

24:33.260 --> 24:35.820
So that's the kind of initial offering.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.740
I think there are other master's programs

24:37.740 --> 24:39.900
that we will look to roll out quite quickly.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.620
I have a particular passion for a master's

24:42.620 --> 24:45.540
in applied history or politics in applied history.

24:45.540 --> 24:48.740
I'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency

24:48.900 --> 24:52.140
of academic historians to drift away from what seemed

24:52.140 --> 24:55.100
to me the important questions and certainly to drift away

24:55.100 --> 24:57.860
from addressing policy relevant questions.

24:57.860 --> 25:01.100
So I would love to be involved in a master's

25:01.100 --> 25:02.780
in applied history.

25:02.780 --> 25:06.020
And we'll build some programs like that

25:06.020 --> 25:11.020
before we get to the full liberal arts experience

25:11.500 --> 25:15.020
that we envisage for an undergraduate program.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.100
And that undergraduate program is an exciting one

25:17.100 --> 25:19.700
because I think we can be innovative there too.

25:19.700 --> 25:22.700
I would say two years would be spent doing

25:22.700 --> 25:26.660
some very classical and difficult classical things,

25:26.660 --> 25:30.980
bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.

25:30.980 --> 25:34.940
But then there would also be in the second half

25:34.940 --> 25:37.540
in the junior and senior years,

25:37.540 --> 25:41.100
something somewhat more of an apprenticeship

25:41.100 --> 25:43.580
where we'll have centers including a center

25:43.580 --> 25:47.700
for technology, engineering, and mathematics

25:47.700 --> 25:51.780
that will be designed to help people make that transition

25:51.780 --> 25:54.820
from the theoretical to the practical.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.020
So that's the vision.

25:57.020 --> 26:02.020
And I think like any early stage idea

26:02.020 --> 26:04.260
we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along.

26:04.260 --> 26:07.380
We'll find things that work and things that don't work.

26:07.380 --> 26:10.420
But I have a very clear sense in my own mind

26:10.420 --> 26:14.060
of how this should look five years from now.

26:14.060 --> 26:14.900
And I don't know about you.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.820
I mean, I'm unusual as an academic

26:16.820 --> 26:18.820
because I quite like starting new institutions

26:18.820 --> 26:22.300
and I've done a bit of it in my career.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.180
You got to kind of know what it should look like

26:25.180 --> 26:27.180
after the first four or five years

26:27.180 --> 26:28.660
to get out of bed in the morning

26:28.660 --> 26:32.260
and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it,

26:32.260 --> 26:35.940
not least the inevitable flack that we were bound to take

26:35.940 --> 26:38.100
from the educational establishment.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.940
And I was graciously invited to be an advisor

26:41.940 --> 26:45.180
to this University of Austin.

26:45.180 --> 26:49.580
And the reason I would love to help

26:49.580 --> 26:52.860
in whatever way I can is several.

26:52.860 --> 26:56.780
So one, I would love to see Austin, the physical location,

26:56.780 --> 27:00.500
flourish intellectually and especially

27:00.500 --> 27:03.460
in the space of science and engineering.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
That's really exciting to me.

27:05.460 --> 27:09.860
Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.580
I still love MIT.

27:12.580 --> 27:16.780
And I see this effort that you're launching

27:16.780 --> 27:21.220
as a beacon that leads the way

27:21.220 --> 27:24.460
to the other elite institutions in the world.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.500
I think too many of my colleagues,

27:26.500 --> 27:28.860
and especially in robotics,

27:28.860 --> 27:33.860
kind of don't see robotics as a humanities problem.

27:35.900 --> 27:40.900
But to me, robotics and AI will define much of our world

27:43.860 --> 27:45.260
in the next century.

27:45.260 --> 27:49.660
And not to consider all the deep psychological,

27:49.660 --> 27:53.780
sociological, human problems associated with that,

27:54.900 --> 27:58.860
to have real open conversations, to say stupid things,

27:58.860 --> 28:03.860
to challenge the ideas of how companies are being run,

28:04.860 --> 28:07.980
for example, that is the safe space.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.380
It's very difficult to talk about the difficult questions

28:11.380 --> 28:14.220
about technology when you're employed by Facebook

28:14.220 --> 28:15.980
or Google and so on.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.260
The university is the place to have those conversations.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.100
That's right.

28:20.100 --> 28:20.940
And we're hugely excited

28:20.940 --> 28:23.140
that you want to be one of our advisors.

28:23.140 --> 28:28.260
We need a broad and an eclectic group of people.

28:28.260 --> 28:33.180
And I'm excited by the way that group has developed.

28:33.380 --> 28:37.540
It has some of my favorite intellectuals are there,

28:37.540 --> 28:40.260
Steve Pinker, for example.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.820
But we're also making sure that we have people

28:43.820 --> 28:48.100
with experience in academic leadership.

28:48.980 --> 28:53.980
And so it's a happy coalition of the willing

28:54.060 --> 28:56.620
looking to try to build something new,

28:56.620 --> 29:00.660
which as you say, will be complimentary to the existing

29:00.660 --> 29:02.260
and established institutions.

29:02.340 --> 29:06.260
I think of the academic world as a network.

29:06.260 --> 29:11.260
I've moved from some major hubs in the network to others,

29:12.140 --> 29:15.900
but I've always felt that we do our best work,

29:15.900 --> 29:18.420
not in a silo called Oxford,

29:18.420 --> 29:23.060
but in a silo that is really a hub connected to Stanford,

29:23.060 --> 29:26.540
connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.380
One of the reasons I moved to the United States

29:28.420 --> 29:32.340
was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action

29:32.340 --> 29:35.780
in my original field of expertise, financial history.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.300
And that was right.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.020
It was a good move.

29:39.020 --> 29:43.020
I think I'd have stagnated if I'd stayed at Oxford.

29:43.020 --> 29:46.420
But at the same time, I haven't lost connection with Oxford.

29:46.420 --> 29:48.780
I recently went and gave a lecture there

29:48.780 --> 29:50.500
in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,

29:50.500 --> 29:52.820
one of the great conservative philosophers.

29:52.820 --> 29:57.820
And the burden of my lecture was the idea of the Anglosphere,

29:58.060 --> 29:59.980
which appealed a lot to Roger,

29:59.980 --> 30:04.500
will go horribly wrong if illiberal ideas

30:04.500 --> 30:07.780
that inhibit academic freedom spread all over the Anglosphere

30:07.780 --> 30:11.860
and this network gets infected with these, I think,

30:11.860 --> 30:14.980
deeply damaging notions.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.540
So yeah, I think we're creating a new node.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.780
I hope it's a node that makes the network overall

30:21.780 --> 30:23.340
more resilient.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.820
And right now there's an urgent need for it.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.500
I mean, there are people whose academic careers

30:28.500 --> 30:30.300
have been terminated.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.660
I'll name two who are involved.

30:32.660 --> 30:37.660
Peter Boghossian, who was harassed out of Portland State

30:37.700 --> 30:42.700
for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures

30:43.020 --> 30:47.060
who carried out the grievance studies hoaxes,

30:47.060 --> 30:50.540
exposing the utter charlatanry going on

30:50.540 --> 30:53.020
in many supposedly academic journals

30:53.020 --> 30:56.940
by getting phony gender studies articles published.

30:56.940 --> 30:57.820
It was genius.

30:57.820 --> 31:00.900
And of course, so put the noses out of joint

31:00.900 --> 31:02.300
of the academic establishment

31:02.300 --> 31:05.260
that he began to be subject to disciplinary actions.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.300
So Peter is going to be involved.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.300
And in a recent shocking British case,

31:10.300 --> 31:12.900
the philosopher Kathleen Stock has essentially been run off

31:12.900 --> 31:15.500
the campus of Sussex University in England

31:18.140 --> 31:21.340
for violating the increasingly complex rules

31:21.340 --> 31:26.180
about discussing transgender issues and women's rights.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.260
She will be one of our advisors.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.740
And I think also one of our founding fellows

31:30.740 --> 31:35.020
actually teaching for us in our first iteration.

31:35.020 --> 31:38.820
So I think we're creating a node that's badly needed.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.820
Those people, I mean, I remember saying this

31:40.820 --> 31:44.100
to the other founders when we first began

31:44.100 --> 31:48.180
to talk about this idea to Barry Weiss

31:48.180 --> 31:52.660
and to Panou Kanellos as well as to Heather Hying.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.020
We need to do this urgently

31:55.020 --> 31:56.940
because there are people whose livelihoods

31:56.940 --> 31:58.820
are in fact being destroyed

31:58.820 --> 32:02.620
by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.060
And so there's no time to hang around

32:05.060 --> 32:07.340
and come up with the perfect design.

32:07.340 --> 32:10.140
This is an urgently needed lifeboat.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.580
And let's start with that.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.620
And then we can build something spectacular,

32:13.620 --> 32:16.700
taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,

32:16.700 --> 32:19.620
well, they now have very real skin in the game.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.140
They need to make this a success

32:22.140 --> 32:24.540
and I'm sure they will help us make it a success.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.660
So you mentioned some interesting names

32:27.660 --> 32:30.420
like Heather Hying, Barry Weiss and so on.

32:30.420 --> 32:32.180
Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire.

32:32.180 --> 32:35.220
He too was under a lot of, quite a lot of fire.

32:36.180 --> 32:37.860
Many reasons I admire him.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.580
One, because of his optimism about the future

32:40.580 --> 32:44.500
and two, how little of a damn he seems to give

32:45.460 --> 32:48.060
about the like walking through the fire.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.380
There's nobody more Zen about walking through the fire

32:50.380 --> 32:51.380
than Steven Pinker.

32:51.380 --> 32:54.260
But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.980
Jonathan Haidt is also interesting there.

32:56.980 --> 33:00.940
Who is involved with this venture at this early days?

33:00.940 --> 33:04.820
Well, one of the things that I'm excited about

33:04.820 --> 33:08.260
is that we're getting people from inside and outside

33:08.260 --> 33:09.260
the academic world.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.900
So we've got Arthur Brooks who for many years

33:12.900 --> 33:17.700
ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully

33:17.700 --> 33:20.020
has a Harvard role now teaching.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.380
And so he's somebody who brings,

33:23.380 --> 33:25.220
I think a different perspective.

33:27.140 --> 33:32.140
There's obviously a need to get experienced

33:33.460 --> 33:36.100
academic leaders involved,

33:36.100 --> 33:38.660
which is why I was talking to Larry Summers

33:38.660 --> 33:43.540
about whether he would join our board of advisors.

33:43.540 --> 33:46.940
The Chicago principals owe a debt

33:46.940 --> 33:50.260
to the former president of Chicago.

33:50.260 --> 33:54.180
And he's graciously agreed to be in the board of advisors.

33:54.180 --> 33:56.300
I could go on, it would become a long and tedious list.

33:56.300 --> 34:01.300
But my goal in trying to get this happy banter form

34:02.020 --> 34:06.060
has been to signal that it's a bipartisan endeavor.

34:06.060 --> 34:08.460
It is not a conservative institution

34:08.460 --> 34:09.380
that we're trying to build.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.300
It's an institution that's committed to academic freedom

34:12.300 --> 34:15.780
and the pursuit of truth that will mean it

34:15.780 --> 34:20.460
when it takes Robert Zimmer's Chicago principals

34:20.460 --> 34:22.940
and enshrines them in its founding charter.

34:22.940 --> 34:26.580
And we'll make those something other than honored

34:26.580 --> 34:29.700
in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.

34:29.700 --> 34:33.380
So the idea here is to grow this organically.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.660
We need, rather like the Academic Freedom Alliance

34:36.660 --> 34:39.100
that Robbie George created earlier this year,

34:39.100 --> 34:40.420
we need breadth.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.820
And we need to show that this is not some kind

34:42.820 --> 34:47.660
of institutionalization of the intellectual dark web,

34:47.660 --> 34:52.460
though we welcome founding members of that nebulous body.

34:52.460 --> 34:55.500
It's really something designed for all of academia

34:55.500 --> 34:57.340
to provide a kind of reboot

34:57.340 --> 35:00.300
that I think we all agree is needed.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.860
Is there a George Washington type figure who is,

35:02.860 --> 35:04.620
is there a president elected yet

35:04.620 --> 35:07.300
or who's going to lead this institution?

35:07.300 --> 35:10.220
Pano Canellos, the former president of St. John's,

35:10.220 --> 35:12.460
is the president of University of Austin.

35:12.460 --> 35:14.460
And so he is our George Washington.

35:15.420 --> 35:17.020
I don't know who Alexander Hamilton is.

35:17.020 --> 35:18.620
I'll leave you to guess.

35:18.620 --> 35:21.860
It's funny you mentioned IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.

35:21.860 --> 35:26.860
Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris about any of this?

35:26.940 --> 35:30.740
He is another person I really admire

35:30.740 --> 35:34.500
and I've talked to online and offline quite a bit

35:34.500 --> 35:39.180
for not belonging to any tribe.

35:39.180 --> 35:43.020
He stands boldly on his convictions

35:43.020 --> 35:46.060
when he knows they're not going to be popular.

35:46.060 --> 35:50.620
With like, he basically gets canceled by every group.

35:50.620 --> 35:54.260
He sort of, he doesn't shy away from controversy

35:54.260 --> 35:56.980
and not for the sake of controversy itself.

35:56.980 --> 36:00.220
He is one of the best examples to me

36:00.220 --> 36:02.620
of a person who thinks freely.

36:02.620 --> 36:06.020
I disagree with him on a few, quite a few things,

36:06.020 --> 36:10.820
but I deeply admire that he is what it looks like

36:10.820 --> 36:12.780
to think freely by himself.

36:12.780 --> 36:15.300
It feels to me like he represents a lot of the ideals

36:15.300 --> 36:16.540
of this kind of effort.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.500
Yes, he would be a natural fit.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.380
Sam, if you're listening, I hope you're in.

36:21.420 --> 36:25.700
I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,

36:25.700 --> 36:28.140
he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Hying.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.060
So we'll have to model civil disagreements

36:31.060 --> 36:32.660
at the University of Austin.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.580
It's extremely important that we should all disagree

36:35.580 --> 36:38.940
about many things, but do it amicably.

36:38.940 --> 36:41.220
One of the things that has been lost sight of,

36:41.220 --> 36:42.900
perhaps it's all the fault of Twitter

36:42.900 --> 36:44.380
or maybe it's something more profound,

36:44.380 --> 36:47.700
is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way

36:47.700 --> 36:49.700
and still be friends.

36:49.780 --> 36:52.100
I certainly had friends at Oxford

36:52.100 --> 36:54.540
who were far to the left of me politically

36:54.540 --> 36:56.580
and they are still among my best friends.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.660
So the University of Austin has to be a place

36:58.660 --> 37:03.380
where we can disagree vehemently,

37:03.380 --> 37:06.580
but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.

37:06.580 --> 37:09.820
That's, in my mind, a really important part

37:09.820 --> 37:12.860
of university life, learning the difference

37:12.860 --> 37:15.740
between the political and the personal.

37:15.740 --> 37:19.100
So Sam is, I think, a good example, as are you,

37:19.140 --> 37:24.140
of a certain kind of intellectual hero

37:24.180 --> 37:29.180
who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,

37:31.140 --> 37:36.140
the metaverse, and carve out an intellectual space,

37:37.940 --> 37:42.940
the podcast, and debate everything fearlessly.

37:42.980 --> 37:47.980
His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter

37:48.220 --> 37:50.780
and the question of police racism,

37:50.780 --> 37:54.300
was a masterpiece of 2020.

37:54.300 --> 37:59.300
And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in,

38:01.260 --> 38:03.660
but we can't save the world with podcasts,

38:03.660 --> 38:06.820
good though yours is,

38:06.820 --> 38:11.820
because there's a kind of solo element

38:11.820 --> 38:15.020
to this form of public intellectual activity.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.700
It's also there in Substack

38:16.740 --> 38:19.860
where all our best writers now seem to be,

38:19.860 --> 38:22.580
including our founder, Barry Weiss.

38:22.580 --> 38:26.860
The danger with this approach is ultimately

38:26.860 --> 38:30.380
your subscribers are the people who already agree with you

38:30.380 --> 38:34.060
and we are all therefore in danger of preaching

38:34.060 --> 38:35.740
to the choir.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.100
I think what makes an institution

38:37.100 --> 38:38.900
like University of Austin so attractive

38:38.900 --> 38:40.780
is that we get everybody together,

38:41.940 --> 38:44.420
at least part of the year,

38:44.460 --> 38:49.460
and we do that informal interaction at lunch,

38:49.860 --> 38:54.660
at dinner, that allows, in my experience,

38:54.660 --> 38:57.340
the best ideas to form.

38:57.340 --> 39:00.460
Intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.420
Historians often make it seem that way,

39:02.420 --> 39:06.020
but I've realized over time that I do my best work

39:06.020 --> 39:08.140
in a collaborative way,

39:08.140 --> 39:10.620
and scientists have been better at this

39:10.620 --> 39:12.420
than people in the humanities.

39:12.460 --> 39:14.060
But what really matters,

39:14.060 --> 39:16.100
what's magical about a good university

39:16.100 --> 39:19.500
is that interdisciplinary, serendipitous conversation

39:19.500 --> 39:21.460
that happens on campus.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.780
Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize-winning economist and I

39:24.780 --> 39:27.820
used to have these kind of random conversations

39:27.820 --> 39:31.540
in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford,

39:31.540 --> 39:34.700
and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations,

39:34.700 --> 39:38.060
but in that short, serendipitous exchange,

39:38.060 --> 39:40.540
I would have more intellectual stimulus

39:40.540 --> 39:44.420
than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.300
So I think we want to get the Sam Harris's

39:47.300 --> 39:51.460
and Lex Fridman's out of their darkened rooms

39:51.460 --> 39:54.020
and give them a chance to interact

39:54.020 --> 39:59.020
in a much less structured way than we've got used to.

39:59.380 --> 40:02.740
Again, it's that sense that sometimes

40:02.740 --> 40:05.620
you need some freewheeling, unstructured debate

40:05.620 --> 40:07.300
to get the really good ideas.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.940
I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,

40:08.940 --> 40:12.020
I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience

40:12.020 --> 40:14.700
and I wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes,

40:14.700 --> 40:18.220
but intellectually the most important thing I did

40:18.220 --> 40:22.420
was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Carl Krauss

40:22.420 --> 40:27.420
for an undergraduate discussion group called the Canon Club.

40:27.460 --> 40:30.020
And I probably put more work into that paper

40:30.020 --> 40:31.500
than I put into anything else,

40:31.500 --> 40:33.820
except maybe my final examinations.

40:33.820 --> 40:35.780
Even although there was only really

40:35.780 --> 40:38.820
one senior member present, the historian Jeremy Cato,

40:38.820 --> 40:41.940
I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.780
And that's the kind of thing we want.

40:45.780 --> 40:50.780
The great intellectuals leaps forward, occurred,

40:51.140 --> 40:54.220
often in somewhat unstructured settings.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.220
I'm from Scotland, you can tell from my accent

40:57.220 --> 40:58.340
a little at least.

40:59.620 --> 41:03.100
The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland

41:03.100 --> 41:07.300
in a very interesting interplay between the universities,

41:07.300 --> 41:09.060
which were very important,

41:09.060 --> 41:10.900
Glasgow, Edinburgh, St. Andrews,

41:10.900 --> 41:15.900
and the coffee houses and pubs of the Scottish cities

41:16.820 --> 41:19.780
where a lot of unstructured discussion

41:19.780 --> 41:24.100
often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.

41:24.100 --> 41:27.300
That's what I've missed over the last few years.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.380
Let's just think about how hard

41:29.380 --> 41:32.500
academic social life has become.

41:32.500 --> 41:37.500
That we've reached the point that Amy Chua

41:37.820 --> 41:41.620
becomes the object of a full-blown investigation

41:41.620 --> 41:46.620
and media storm for inviting two Yale Law School students

41:47.260 --> 41:50.020
over to her house to talk.

41:50.900 --> 41:51.900
I mean, when I was at Oxford,

41:51.900 --> 41:54.860
it was regarded as a tremendous honor to be asked

41:54.860 --> 41:58.100
to go to one of our tutors' homes.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.740
The social life of Oxford and Cambridge

41:59.740 --> 42:01.140
is one of their great strengths.

42:01.140 --> 42:05.180
There's a sort of requirement to sip unpleasant sherry

42:05.180 --> 42:06.580
with the dons.

42:06.580 --> 42:08.380
And we've kind of killed all that.

42:08.380 --> 42:09.620
We've killed all that in the US

42:09.620 --> 42:12.180
because nobody dares have a social interaction

42:12.180 --> 42:15.340
with an undergraduate or exchange an informal email

42:15.340 --> 42:17.380
in case the whole thing ends up on the front page

42:17.380 --> 42:19.540
of the local or student newspaper.

42:19.540 --> 42:22.060
So that's what we need to kind of restore

42:22.060 --> 42:25.620
the social life of academia.

42:25.620 --> 42:26.460
So there's magic.

42:26.460 --> 42:29.380
We didn't really address this sort of explicitly,

42:29.380 --> 42:33.540
but there's magic to the interaction between students.

42:33.540 --> 42:37.460
There's magic in the interaction between faculty,

42:37.460 --> 42:38.380
the people that teach.

42:38.380 --> 42:39.940
And there's the magic in the interaction

42:39.940 --> 42:41.660
between the students and the faculty.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.860
And it's an iterative process

42:43.860 --> 42:46.100
that changes everybody involved.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.980
So it's like world experts in a particular discipline

42:48.980 --> 42:52.740
are changed as much as the students,

42:52.740 --> 42:57.740
as the 20-year-olds with the wild ideas, each are changed.

42:58.180 --> 42:59.180
And that's the magic of it.

42:59.980 --> 43:01.260
And that applies in liberal education,

43:01.260 --> 43:03.620
that applies in the sciences too.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.660
That's probably, maybe you can speak to this,

43:05.660 --> 43:08.860
why so much scientific innovation

43:08.860 --> 43:10.740
has happened in universities.

43:10.740 --> 43:13.700
There's something about the youthful energy

43:13.700 --> 43:17.620
of young minds, graduate students, undergraduate students

43:17.620 --> 43:19.620
that inspire some of the world experts

43:19.620 --> 43:22.100
to do some of the best work of their lives.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.580
Well, the human brain, we know,

43:23.580 --> 43:27.380
is at its most dynamic when people are pretty young.

43:27.380 --> 43:29.700
You know this with your background in math.

43:29.700 --> 43:33.060
People don't get better at math after the age of 30.

43:33.060 --> 43:36.900
And this is important when you think about

43:36.900 --> 43:39.860
the intergenerational character of university.

43:39.860 --> 43:44.260
The older people, the professors have the experience,

43:44.260 --> 43:46.860
but they're fading intellectually

43:46.860 --> 43:50.300
from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.

43:50.300 --> 43:55.300
And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm

43:55.780 --> 43:59.420
from hanging out with people who are circa 20,

43:59.420 --> 44:03.500
don't know shit, but the brains are kind of like cooking.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.340
Yeah.

44:04.340 --> 44:07.420
I look back on the career I've had in teaching,

44:07.420 --> 44:10.660
which is over 25 years at where Cambridge, Oxford,

44:10.660 --> 44:15.540
NYU, Harvard, and I have extremely strong relationships

44:15.540 --> 44:19.460
with students from those institutions

44:19.460 --> 44:23.260
because they would show up,

44:23.260 --> 44:26.220
whether it was at office hours or in tutorials,

44:26.220 --> 44:28.220
and disagree with me.

44:28.220 --> 44:31.860
And for me, it's always been about encouraging

44:31.860 --> 44:35.940
some act of intellectual rebellion, telling people,

44:35.940 --> 44:38.820
I don't want your essay to echo my views.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.820
If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.

44:41.820 --> 44:45.420
Or if you can find something I missed that's new, fantastic.

44:45.420 --> 44:47.100
So there is definitely, as you said,

44:47.100 --> 44:49.900
a magic in that interaction across the generations.

44:49.900 --> 44:53.340
And it's extraordinarily difficult, I think,

44:53.340 --> 44:57.300
for an intellectual to make the same progress

44:57.300 --> 45:00.220
in a project, in isolation,

45:00.220 --> 45:03.340
compared with the progress that can be made

45:03.340 --> 45:05.940
in these very special communities.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.620
What does a university do?

45:07.620 --> 45:09.380
Amongst other things,

45:09.380 --> 45:13.220
it creates a somewhat artificial environment

45:13.220 --> 45:15.340
of abnormal job security,

45:15.340 --> 45:18.660
and that's the whole idea of giving people tenure,

45:18.660 --> 45:22.700
and then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year,

45:22.700 --> 45:27.140
and an institutionalization of thought experiments

45:27.140 --> 45:29.100
and actual experiments.

45:29.100 --> 45:30.420
And then you get everybody living

45:30.420 --> 45:31.660
in the same kind of vicinity

45:31.660 --> 45:34.780
so that it can spill over into 3 a.m. conversation.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.580
Well, that always seems to me

45:36.580 --> 45:39.260
to be a pretty potent combination.

45:39.260 --> 45:41.780
Let's ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.

45:41.780 --> 45:46.780
Let's imagine that the world wars happen,

45:47.580 --> 45:49.780
but there are no universities.

45:51.340 --> 45:53.900
I mean, how does the Manhattan Project happen

45:53.900 --> 45:58.220
with no academia, to take just one of many examples?

45:58.220 --> 46:01.220
In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war

46:01.220 --> 46:02.420
without Bletchley Park,

46:02.420 --> 46:07.420
without being able to crack the German cipher?

46:08.500 --> 46:11.700
The academics are unsung,

46:11.700 --> 46:14.380
partly sung heroes of these conflicts.

46:15.260 --> 46:16.940
The same is true in the Soviet Union.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.620
The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,

46:20.620 --> 46:24.900
but it was good at science, and that kept it in the game,

46:24.900 --> 46:28.860
not only in World War II, it kept it in the Cold War.

46:28.860 --> 46:33.860
So it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful

46:33.860 --> 46:36.540
intellectual force multipliers,

46:36.540 --> 46:41.180
and our history without them would look very different.

46:41.180 --> 46:43.300
Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.140
That's clear.

46:44.140 --> 46:46.060
The Industrial Revolution didn't need universities.

46:46.060 --> 46:48.380
In fact, they played a very marginal role

46:48.380 --> 46:49.900
in the key technological breakthroughs

46:49.900 --> 46:53.060
of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.020
But by the second Industrial Revolution

46:55.020 --> 46:56.620
in the late 19th century,

46:56.620 --> 46:58.860
German industry would not have leapt ahead

46:58.860 --> 47:00.660
of British industry if the universities

47:00.660 --> 47:02.460
had not been superior.

47:02.460 --> 47:03.940
And it was the fact that the Germans

47:03.940 --> 47:06.180
institutionalized scientific research

47:06.180 --> 47:07.900
in the way that they did

47:07.900 --> 47:12.220
that really produced a powerful, powerful advantage.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.060
The problem was that,

47:14.060 --> 47:15.820
and this is a really interesting point

47:15.820 --> 47:17.500
that Friedrich Meinerke makes

47:17.500 --> 47:20.540
in Die Deutsche Katastrophe for the German catastrophe,

47:20.540 --> 47:23.860
the German intellectuals became technocrats,

47:23.860 --> 47:25.580
homophobes, he says.

47:25.580 --> 47:28.740
They knew a great deal about their specialty,

47:28.740 --> 47:32.500
but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.700
And that is his explanation,

47:33.700 --> 47:35.740
or one of his explanations for why

47:35.740 --> 47:38.300
this very scientifically advanced Germany

47:38.300 --> 47:42.140
goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.940
So when I come back and ask myself,

47:43.940 --> 47:47.860
what is it that we want to do with a new university,

47:47.860 --> 47:52.820
we wanna make sure that we don't fall into that German pit

47:52.820 --> 47:54.980
where very high levels of technical

47:54.980 --> 47:57.860
and scientific expertise are decoupled

47:57.860 --> 48:02.860
from the fundamental foundations of a free society.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.820
So liberal arts are there, I think,

48:05.820 --> 48:09.740
to stop the scientists making Faustian pacts.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.420
And that's why it's really important

48:11.420 --> 48:15.500
that people working on AI reach Shakespeare.

48:15.500 --> 48:18.620
I think you said that academics

48:18.620 --> 48:21.740
are unsung heroes of the 20th century.

48:21.740 --> 48:25.220
I think there's kind of an intellectual,

48:25.220 --> 48:30.220
a lazy intellectual desire to kind of destroy the academics,

48:31.060 --> 48:32.700
that the academics are the source

48:32.700 --> 48:34.820
of all problems in the world.

48:34.820 --> 48:37.540
And I personally believe that exactly as you said,

48:37.540 --> 48:40.420
we need to recognize that the university

48:40.420 --> 48:45.100
is probably where the ideas that will protect us

48:45.100 --> 48:50.100
from the catastrophes that are looming ahead of us,

48:50.620 --> 48:52.820
that's where those ideas are going to come from.

48:52.820 --> 48:55.100
People who work on economics

48:55.100 --> 48:58.300
can argue back and forth about John Maynard Keynes,

48:59.620 --> 49:00.740
but I think it's pretty clear

49:00.740 --> 49:03.220
that he was the most important economist

49:03.220 --> 49:05.540
and certainly the most influential economist

49:05.540 --> 49:06.620
of the 20th century.

49:06.620 --> 49:11.340
And I think his ideas are looking better today

49:11.340 --> 49:12.980
in the wake of the financial crisis

49:12.980 --> 49:15.860
than they have at any time since the 1970s.

49:15.860 --> 49:19.940
But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge,

49:19.940 --> 49:22.860
you can't because someone like that

49:24.860 --> 49:29.540
doesn't actually exist without the incredible hot house

49:29.540 --> 49:31.940
that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes's life.

49:31.940 --> 49:35.500
He was a product of a kind of hereditary intellectual elite

49:36.460 --> 49:37.980
and had its vices,

49:37.980 --> 49:41.900
but you can't help but admire the sheer power of the mind.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.220
I've spent a lot of my career reading Keynes

49:44.220 --> 49:46.700
and I revere that intellect.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.540
It's so, so powerful,

49:49.540 --> 49:51.620
but you can't have people like that

49:51.620 --> 49:55.780
if you're not prepared to have King's College, Cambridge.

49:55.780 --> 49:57.060
And it comes with redundancy.

49:57.060 --> 49:57.900
I think that's the point.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.500
There are lots and lots of things

49:59.500 --> 50:02.340
that are very annoying about academic life

50:02.340 --> 50:05.300
that you just have to deal with.

50:06.140 --> 50:08.060
They're made fun of in that recent Netflix series,

50:08.060 --> 50:11.260
The Chair, and it is easy to make fun of academic life.

50:12.460 --> 50:14.780
Tom Sharpe's Porterhouse Blue did it.

50:14.780 --> 50:18.900
It's an inherently comical subject.

50:18.900 --> 50:22.300
Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric,

50:23.380 --> 50:27.060
but we've sort of killed off that side of academia

50:27.060 --> 50:32.060
by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire place

50:32.980 --> 50:35.860
where eccentricity is not tolerated.

50:35.860 --> 50:37.140
I'll give you an illustration of this.

50:37.140 --> 50:40.340
I had a call this morning from a British academic

50:41.420 --> 50:43.580
who said, can you give me some advice

50:43.580 --> 50:47.740
because they're trying to decolonize the curriculum.

50:48.620 --> 50:51.900
This is coming from the diversity, equity,

50:51.900 --> 50:53.660
and inclusion officers.

50:53.660 --> 50:56.980
And it seems to me that what they're requiring of us

50:56.980 --> 50:59.540
is a fundamental violation of academic freedom

50:59.540 --> 51:02.740
because it is determining ex ante

51:02.740 --> 51:04.580
what we should study and teach.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.060
That's what's going on.

51:07.060 --> 51:11.500
And that's the thing that we really, really have to resist

51:11.500 --> 51:13.420
because that kills the university.

51:13.420 --> 51:17.300
That's the moment that it stops being the magical place

51:17.300 --> 51:20.180
of intellectual creativity

51:20.180 --> 51:23.980
and simply becomes an adjunct of the Ministry of Propaganda.

51:23.980 --> 51:27.220
I've loved the time we've spent talking about this

51:27.220 --> 51:29.500
because it's such a hopeful message for the future

51:30.460 --> 51:33.420
that I still share with you

51:35.180 --> 51:37.820
the love of the ideal of the university.

51:37.820 --> 51:39.380
So very practical question.

51:39.380 --> 51:41.300
You mentioned summer.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.620
Which summer are we talking about?

51:44.620 --> 51:48.380
So I know we don't want to put hard dates here,

51:48.380 --> 51:51.140
but what year are we thinking about?

51:51.140 --> 51:52.540
When is this thing launching?

51:52.540 --> 51:53.740
What are your thoughts on this?

51:53.740 --> 51:57.540
We are moving as fast as our resources allow.

51:57.540 --> 52:01.780
The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses

52:01.780 --> 52:03.780
next summer, summer of 2022.

52:03.780 --> 52:06.660
And we hope to be able to launch an initial,

52:08.540 --> 52:12.260
albeit relatively small scale masters program

52:12.260 --> 52:14.460
in the fall of next year.

52:14.460 --> 52:17.140
That's as fast as is humanly possible.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.980
So yeah, we're really keen to get going.

52:20.980 --> 52:23.300
And I think the approach we're taking is

52:25.380 --> 52:27.060
somewhat imported from Silicon Valley.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.100
Don't think of this as a startup.

52:29.100 --> 52:31.100
Don't think of this as something that has to exist

52:31.100 --> 52:33.820
as a full service university on day one.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.220
We don't have the resources for that.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.740
You'd need billions and billions of dollars

52:36.740 --> 52:40.020
to build a university sort of as a facsimile

52:40.020 --> 52:41.100
of an existing university,

52:41.100 --> 52:42.260
but that's not what we want to do.

52:42.260 --> 52:45.620
I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford

52:45.620 --> 52:47.100
would be a futile thing to do.

52:47.100 --> 52:49.180
They would probably very quickly end up

52:49.180 --> 52:50.420
with the same pathologies.

52:50.420 --> 52:52.260
So we do have to come up with a different design.

52:52.260 --> 52:54.700
And one way of doing that is to grow it organically

52:54.700 --> 52:56.860
from something quite small.

52:57.700 --> 53:02.100
Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter

53:02.100 --> 53:03.620
that he wants to launch

53:03.620 --> 53:07.620
the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, TITS.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.380
Some people thought this was sexist

53:11.380 --> 53:13.940
because of the acronym TITS.

53:13.940 --> 53:16.580
So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,

53:16.580 --> 53:18.660
but I also think there needs to be a place

53:18.660 --> 53:21.540
for humor on the internet, even from CEO.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.820
So on this podcast, I've gotten a chance

53:23.820 --> 53:26.460
to talk to quite a few CEOs.

53:26.500 --> 53:29.580
And what I love to see is authenticity.

53:29.580 --> 53:33.140
And humor is often a sign of authenticity.

53:33.140 --> 53:36.940
The quirkiness that you mentioned

53:36.940 --> 53:39.580
is such a beautiful characteristic

53:39.580 --> 53:42.580
of professors and faculty in great universities

53:42.580 --> 53:46.380
is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.

53:46.380 --> 53:51.380
So anyway, the deeper point he was making

53:51.580 --> 53:54.460
is showing an excitement for the university

53:54.460 --> 53:58.500
as a place for big ideas in science,

53:58.500 --> 53:59.700
technology, engineering.

53:59.700 --> 54:03.060
So to me, if there's some kind of way,

54:03.060 --> 54:07.620
if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,

54:07.620 --> 54:11.020
not to analyze Elon Musk's Twitter like it's Shakespeare,

54:11.020 --> 54:12.900
but if there's a serious thought,

54:14.060 --> 54:17.820
I would love to see him supporting the flourishing

54:17.820 --> 54:20.420
of Austin as a place for science, technology,

54:20.420 --> 54:22.340
for these kinds of intellectual developments

54:22.340 --> 54:25.980
that we're talking about,

54:25.980 --> 54:30.980
like make a place for free inquiry, civil disagreements,

54:31.700 --> 54:35.900
coupled with great education and conversations

54:35.900 --> 54:37.140
about artificial intelligence,

54:37.140 --> 54:39.300
about technology, about engineering.

54:39.300 --> 54:41.820
So I'm actually gonna,

54:41.820 --> 54:43.900
I hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet

54:43.900 --> 54:46.380
and I'm gonna chat with him about it.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.580
I do too, I do too.

54:47.580 --> 54:52.580
Most of the biggest storms in teacups

54:55.500 --> 54:59.220
of my academic career have been caused by bad jokes

54:59.220 --> 55:00.900
that I've made.

55:00.900 --> 55:04.020
These days, if you wanna make bad jokes,

55:04.020 --> 55:06.900
being a billionaire is a great idea.

55:08.140 --> 55:12.420
I'm not here to defend Elon's Twitter style

55:12.420 --> 55:14.340
or sense of humor.

55:14.380 --> 55:18.340
He's not gonna be remembered for his tweets, I think.

55:18.340 --> 55:21.500
He's gonna be remembered for the astonishing companies

55:21.500 --> 55:24.540
that he's built and his contributions

55:24.540 --> 55:26.740
in a whole range of fields,

55:26.740 --> 55:31.740
from SpaceX to Tesla and solar energy.

55:32.060 --> 55:35.780
And I very much hope that we can interest Elon

55:35.780 --> 55:36.620
in this project.

55:36.620 --> 55:40.900
We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers

55:41.900 --> 55:45.420
because this takes resources.

55:45.420 --> 55:47.660
Universities are not cheap things to run,

55:47.660 --> 55:49.740
especially if, as I hope,

55:49.740 --> 55:54.740
we can make as much of the tuition

55:56.140 --> 55:57.860
covered by scholarships and bursaries.

55:57.860 --> 56:02.580
We want to attract the best intellectual talent

56:02.580 --> 56:04.740
to this institution.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.140
The best intellectual talent

56:06.140 --> 56:08.700
is somewhat randomly distributed through society

56:08.700 --> 56:10.300
and some of it is in the bottom quintile

56:10.300 --> 56:12.020
of the income distribution.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.140
And that makes it hard to get to elite education.

56:14.140 --> 56:16.420
So this will take resources.

56:17.460 --> 56:22.460
The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,

56:22.580 --> 56:26.220
the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,

56:26.220 --> 56:29.060
did a pretty good job of founding universities.

56:29.060 --> 56:33.380
Chicago wouldn't exist but for the money of that era.

56:33.380 --> 56:35.740
And so my message to not only to Elon,

56:35.740 --> 56:38.020
but to all of the peers,

56:38.020 --> 56:40.620
all of those people who made their billions

56:40.620 --> 56:42.940
out of technology over the last couple of decades

56:42.940 --> 56:44.740
is this is your time.

56:44.740 --> 56:46.140
I mean, and this is your opportunity

56:46.140 --> 56:47.500
to create something new.

56:47.500 --> 56:51.500
I can't really understand why the wealthy of our time

56:51.500 --> 56:54.060
are content to hand their money.

56:54.060 --> 56:56.900
I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg

56:56.900 --> 56:58.860
recently gave to Johns Hopkins

56:58.860 --> 57:01.980
to his established institutions.

57:01.980 --> 57:05.140
When on close inspection,

57:05.140 --> 57:08.780
those institutions don't seem to spend the money

57:08.780 --> 57:10.580
terribly well.

57:10.580 --> 57:13.220
And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time

57:13.220 --> 57:14.780
is the lack of due diligence

57:14.780 --> 57:17.300
that hard-nosed billionaires seem to do

57:17.300 --> 57:19.620
when it comes to philanthropy.

57:19.620 --> 57:22.100
So I think there's an opportunity here

57:22.100 --> 57:25.540
for this generation of very talented wealthy people

57:25.540 --> 57:28.660
to do what their counterparts did

57:28.660 --> 57:30.540
in the late 19th and early 20th century

57:30.540 --> 57:32.980
and create some new institutions.

57:32.980 --> 57:35.220
And they don't need to put their names on the buildings.

57:35.220 --> 57:37.740
They just need to do what the founders

57:37.740 --> 57:40.820
of University of Chicago did,

57:40.820 --> 57:43.660
create something new that will endure.

57:45.740 --> 57:49.500
Yeah, MIT is launching a College of Computing

57:49.500 --> 57:53.500
and Stephen Schwartzman has given

57:53.500 --> 57:54.620
quite a large sum of money,

57:54.620 --> 57:57.140
I think in total a billion dollars.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.660
And as somebody who loves computing,

57:59.700 --> 58:01.100
as somebody who loves MIT,

58:01.100 --> 58:02.580
I want some accountability

58:03.860 --> 58:07.380
for MIT becoming a better institution.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.140
And this is once again,

58:09.140 --> 58:11.060
why I'm excited about University of Austin

58:11.060 --> 58:12.580
because it serves as a beacon.

58:12.580 --> 58:14.740
Look, you can create something new

58:14.740 --> 58:16.780
and this is what the great institutions

58:16.780 --> 58:18.660
of the future should look like.

58:18.660 --> 58:22.740
And Steve Schwartzman is also an innovator.

58:22.740 --> 58:27.220
The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus

58:27.220 --> 58:29.020
and creating a kind of Rhodes program

58:29.020 --> 58:30.420
for students from the Western world

58:30.420 --> 58:33.740
to come study in China was Steve's idea.

58:33.740 --> 58:35.780
And I was somewhat involved,

58:35.780 --> 58:38.900
did some visiting, professing there.

58:38.900 --> 58:41.820
It taught me that you can create something new

58:42.780 --> 58:45.380
in that area of graduate education

58:45.380 --> 58:50.100
and quite quickly attract really strong applicants

58:50.100 --> 58:52.700
because the people who finished their four years

58:52.700 --> 58:54.580
at Harvard or Stanford know

58:55.500 --> 58:57.860
that they don't know a lot.

58:57.860 --> 59:02.620
And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,

59:02.620 --> 59:06.500
know how intellectually dissatisfied they often are

59:06.500 --> 59:08.300
at the end of four years.

59:08.300 --> 59:10.540
I mean, they may have beautifully gamed the system

59:10.540 --> 59:12.780
to graduate summa magna cum laude,

59:12.780 --> 59:16.020
but they kind of know they'll confess it

59:16.020 --> 59:17.060
after a drink or two.

59:17.060 --> 59:18.620
They know that they gamed the system

59:18.620 --> 59:20.700
and that intellectually it wasn't

59:20.700 --> 59:22.620
the fulfilling experience they wanted.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.780
And they also know that an MBA

59:24.780 --> 59:26.620
from a comparable institution

59:26.620 --> 59:29.660
would not be a massive intellectual step forward.

59:29.660 --> 59:32.060
So I think what we want to say

59:32.060 --> 59:35.540
is here's something really novel, exciting,

59:35.540 --> 59:38.180
that will be intellectually very challenging.

59:38.180 --> 59:41.220
I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.

59:42.660 --> 59:44.060
I'd like it to feel a little bit

59:44.060 --> 59:46.020
like surviving Navy SEAL training

59:46.020 --> 59:47.300
to come through this program

59:47.300 --> 59:49.700
because it will be intellectually demanding.

59:49.700 --> 59:51.620
That I think should be a magnet.

59:51.620 --> 59:54.580
So yeah, Steve, if you're listening,

59:54.580 --> 59:57.140
please join Elon in supporting this.

59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.060
And Peter Thiel, if you're listening,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.580
I know how skeptical you are

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.620
about the idea of creating a new university

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.980
because heaven knows,

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.860
Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.740
and he's always said, well, no, we thought about this

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.700
and it just isn't gonna work.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.700
But I really think we've got a responsibility to do this.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.340
Well, Steve's been on this podcast before.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.140
We've spoken a few times, so I'll send this to him.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.500
I hope he does actually get behind it as well.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.500
So I'm super excited by the ideas

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.900
that we've been talking about that this effort represents

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.140
and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980
So thank you.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.620
That was a time beautifully spent.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.620
And I'm really grateful for the fortune

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.980
of getting a chance to talk to you

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.700
at this moment in history

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.180
because I've been a big fan of your work

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.820
and the reason I wanted to talk to you today

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.300
is about all the excellent books you've written

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.180
about various aspects of history

01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:00.940
through money, war, power, pandemics, all of that.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.740
But I'm glad that we got a chance to talk about this,

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.300
which is not looking at history, it's looking at the future.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.780
That's a beautiful little fortuitous moment.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.620
I appreciate you talking about it.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.180
In the book, Ascent of Money,

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.940
you give a history of the world through the lens of money.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.060
If the financial system is evolutionary nature,

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.580
much like life on earth,

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.140
what is the origin of money on earth?

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.660
The origin of money predates coins.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.820
Most people kind of assume I'll talk about coins,

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.220
but coins are relatively late developments.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.020
Back in ancient Mesopotamia,

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.940
so I don't know, 5,000 years ago,

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.740
there were relations between creditors and debtors.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.100
There are even in the simplest economy

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.020
because of the way in which agriculture works.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.980
Hey, I need to plant these seeds,

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.620
but I'm not gonna have crops for X months.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.580
So we have clay tablets

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.620
in which simple debt transactions are inscribed.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.580
I remember looking at great numbers of these

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.500
in the British Museum

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.980
when I was writing The Ascent of Money.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:18.180
And that's really the beginning of money.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.940
The minute you start recording a relationship

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.180
between a creditor and a debtor,

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.740
you have something that is quasi money.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:29.740
And that is probably what these clay tablets mostly denoted.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.540
From that point on,

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.900
there's a great evolutionary experiment

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.740
to see what the most convenient way is

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:44.740
to record relations between creditors and debtors.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.980
And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.900
are coins, metal, tokens,

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.460
sometimes a valuable metal, sometimes not,

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.460
usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.260
And that's the sort of more familiar form of money

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.580
that we still use today for very, very small transactions.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.780
I expect coins will all be gone

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.820
by the time my youngest son is my age,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.220
but they're a last remnant of a very, very old way

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.460
of doing simple transactions.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.020
And when you say coins, you mean physical coins.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:28.860
I'm talking about-

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.860
Coins have been rebranded into digital space as well.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.300
Not coin-based coins, actual coin coins.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.580
You know, the ones that jangle in your pocket

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.700
and you kind of don't know quite what to do with

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.980
once you have some.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.980
So that became an incredibly pervasive form

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.420
of paying for things.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.060
Money's just a, it's just a crystallization

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.060
of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.140
And coins are just very fungible.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.860
Whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction,

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.380
coins are generic and fungible.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.260
They can be used in any transaction.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.100
So that was an important evolutionary advance.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.420
If you think of financial history,

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.300
and this was the point of the ascent of money,

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.580
as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.500
People get by with coins for a long time,

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.100
despite their defects as a means of payment,

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:23.180
such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:27.220
It's very hard to avoid fake or debased money

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.780
entering the system.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.860
But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.260
all the way through the Roman Empire,

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.940
the other end into the so-called dark ages.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.380
It's still how most things are settled

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:43.860
in cash transactions in the early 1300s.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.740
You don't get a big shift until after the Black Death,

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.900
when there's such a need to monetize the economy

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.420
because of chronic labor shortages

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.700
and feudalism begins to unravel,

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.860
that you just don't have a sufficient amount of coinage.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.220
And so you get bills of exchange.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.580
And I'm really into bills of exchange,

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.060
because, and this I hope will capture your listeners

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.340
and viewers' imaginations,

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.260
when they start using bills of exchange,

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.220
which are really just pieces of paper saying,

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.340
I owe you over a three-month period

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:23.900
while goods are in transit from Florence to London,

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.980
you get the first peer-to-peer payment system,

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.300
which is network verified, because they're not coins.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.500
They don't have a king's head on them.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.340
They're just pieces of paper.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.340
And the verification comes in the form of signatures.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.700
And you need ultimately some kind of guarantee

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.580
if I write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.340
I mean, you don't really know me that well.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.460
We only just met.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.140
So you might wanna get endorsed by, I don't know,

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.980
somebody really credit-worthy like Elon.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.260
And so we actually can see in the late 14th century

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.020
in Northern Italy and England and elsewhere,

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:06.020
the evolution of a peer-to-peer network system of payment.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.300
And that's actually how world trade grows,

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.220
because you just couldn't settle

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.100
long oceanic transactions with coinage.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.780
It just wasn't practical.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.380
All those treasure chests full of the balloons,

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.060
which were part of the way in which

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.700
the Spanish empire worked, were really inefficient.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.300
So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.580
And they illustrate something I should have made more clear

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.340
with the ascent of money,

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.580
that not everything used in payment needs to be money.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.940
Classically, economists will tell you,

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.740
oh, well, money, money has three different functions.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.420
You've heard this a zillion times, right?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.380
It's a unit of account, it's a store of value,

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.940
and it's a medium of exchange.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.620
Now, there are three or four things

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.900
that are worth saying about this, and I'll just say two.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.220
One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma,

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.540
and it's very difficult for anything to be all of them.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.980
This point was made by my Hoover colleague,

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.500
Manny Rincon-Cruz, last year,

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.820
and I still wish he would write this up as a paper

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.740
because it's a great insight.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.820
The second thing that's really interesting to me

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.900
is that payments don't need to be money.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.140
And if we go around, as economists love to do,

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.940
saying, well, Bitcoin's not money

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.700
because it doesn't fulfill these criteria,

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.660
we're missing the point that you could build

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:26.260
a system of payments, which I think is how we should think

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.180
about crypto, that isn't money, doesn't need to be money.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.620
It's like bills of exchange.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.820
It's network-based verification, peer-to-peer transactions

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.060
without third-party verification.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.300
When it hit me the other day

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.540
that we actually have this precedent for crypto,

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.620
I got quite excited and thought,

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.620
I wish I had written that in the ascent of money.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.980
Can you, sort of from a first principles,

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.820
almost like a physics perspective,

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.220
or maybe a human perspective,

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.780
describe where does the value of money come from?

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.580
Like, where is it actually, where is it?

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.740
So it's a sheet of paper or it's coins,

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.100
but it feels like in a platonic sense,

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.220
there's some kind of thing that's actually storing the value

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.820
as us a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.420
I come from a family of physicists.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.620
I'm the black sheep of the family.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.180
My mother's a physicist, my sister is.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.700
And so when you asked me to explain something

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.420
in physics terms, I get a kind of,

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.060
little part of me dies because I know I'll fail.

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.100
But in truth, it doesn't really matter

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.460
what we decide money is going to be.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:41.460
And anything can record, crystallize

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:44.700
the relationship between the creditor and the debtor.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.420
It can be a piece of paper, it can be a piece of metal.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.860
It can be nothing, it can just be a digital entry.

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:56.020
It's trust that we're really talking about here.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.460
We are not just trusting one another, we may not,

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.940
but we are trusting the money.

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.540
So whatever we use to represent

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.260
the creditor-debtor relationship,

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.220
whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever,

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.620
it does depend on us both trusting it.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.700
And that doesn't always pertain.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.140
What we see in episodes of inflation,

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.940
especially episodes of hyperinflation,

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.020
is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.100
in the means of payment.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.980
And this is very traumatic for the societies

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.940
to which it happens.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.060
By and large, human beings,

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.100
particularly once you have a rule of law system

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.740
of the sort that evolved in the West

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.620
and then became generalized,

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.700
are predisposed to trust one another,

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.620
and the default setting is to trust money.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.020
Even when it depreciates at a quite steady rate

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.100
as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:05.100
since the 1960s, it takes quite a big disruption

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.540
for money to lose that trust.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.780
But I think essentially what money should be thought of as

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.940
is a series of tokens that can take any form we like

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.220
and can be purely digital,

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.220
which represent our transactions as creditors and debtors.

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.780
And the whole thing depends

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.740
on our collective trust to work.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.980
I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.620
in the Colbert show, the old show that was actually funny.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:37.900
And it was a great moment when he said,

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.980
so Neil, could I be money?

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.980
And I said, yes, we could settle a debt with a human being

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.740
that was quite common in much of history,

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.780
but it's not the most convenient.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.300
Form of money.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.100
Money has to be convenient.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.060
That's why when they worked out

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.980
how to make payments with cell phones,

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:04.820
the Chinese simply went straight there from bank accounts.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.300
They skipped out credit cards.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.220
You won't see credit cards in China,

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.900
except in the hands of naive tourists.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:15.900
How much can this trust bear in terms of us humans

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.220
with our human nature testing it?

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.300
It seemed that I guess the surprising thing

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.100
is the thing works.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.700
A bunch of self-interested ants running around,

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.500
trading in trust.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.820
And it seems to work,

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.100
except for a bunch of moments in human history

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.500
when there's hyperinflation, like you mentioned.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.620
And it's just kind of amazing.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.580
It's kind of amazing that us humans,

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.900
if I were to be optimistic

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.260
and sort of hopeful about human nature,

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:49.260
it gives me a sense that people want to lean on each other.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.380
They want to trust.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.980
That's certainly, I would say probably now,

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.820
a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.100
network scientists.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.980
It's one of Nicholas Christakis's argument

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.940
in a recent book.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.100
And I think economic history broadly bears this out,

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.300
but you have to be cautious.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:18.180
The cases where the system works are familiar to us

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.620
because those are the states and the eras

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.540
that produce a lot of written records.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.380
But when the system of trust collapses

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.580
and the monetary system collapses with it,

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.100
there's generally quite a paucity of records.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.300
I found that when I was writing Doom.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:41.300
And so we slightly are biased in favor

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.500
of the periods when trust prevailed

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.140
and the system functioned.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.900
It's very easy to point to a great many episodes

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.540
of very, very intense monetary chaos,

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.060
even in the relatively recent past.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.820
In the wake of the First World War,

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.340
multiple currencies, not just the German currency,

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.660
multiple currencies were completely destroyed.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.980
The Russian currency, the Polish currency.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.820
There were currency disasters all over

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.540
Central and Eastern Europe in the early 1920s.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.540
And that was partly because over the course

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.820
of the 19th century, a system had evolved

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:22.740
in which trust was based on gold

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:27.140
and rules that were supposedly applied by central banks.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.260
That system, which produced relative price stability

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.260
over the 19th century, fell apart

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.780
as a result of the First World War.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.700
And as soon as it was gone,

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.540
as soon as there was no longer a clear link

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:45.020
between those banknotes and coins and gold,

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.300
the whole thing went completely haywire.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.060
And I think we should remember that the extent

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:54.260
of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.540
all the way through to the late 1940s.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.460
I mean, the German currency was destroyed not once,

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.140
but twice in that period.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.820
And that was one of the most advanced economies

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.820
in the world.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.220
In the United States, there were periods

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.660
of intensely deep deflation.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.980
Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.340
and then very serious price volatility

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.300
in the immediate post-World War II period.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.020
So it's a bit of an illusion.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.980
Maybe it's an illusion for people

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.580
who've spent most of their lives in the last 20 years.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.380
We've had a period of exceptional price stability

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.660
since this century began,

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:38.180
in which a regime of central bank independence

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:42.740
and inflation targeting appeared to generate steady

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.620
below 2% inflation in much of the developed world.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.420
It was a bit too low for the central bankers' liking.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.060
And that became a problem in the financial crisis.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.940
But we've avoided major price instability

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.820
for the better part of 20 years.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.180
In most of the world, there haven't really been

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.060
that many very high inflation episodes

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.780
and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:05.900
Venezuela's one of the very few, Zimbabwe's another.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.460
But if you take a 100-year view or a 200-year view,

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.540
or if you want to take a 500-year view,

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.660
you realize that quite often the system doesn't work.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.620
If you go back to the 17th century,

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.580
there were multiple competing systems of coinage.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.940
There had been a great inflation

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.980
that had begun the previous century.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.500
The price revolution caused mainly

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.940
by the arrival of New World Silver.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:31.780
I think financial history is a bit messier

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.780
than one might think.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.540
And the more one studies it,

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.380
the more one realizes the need for the evolution.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.980
The reason bills of exchange came along

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:45.020
was because the coinage systems had stopped working.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.740
The reason that banknotes started to become used

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.140
more generally, first in the American colonies

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.340
in the 17th century, then more widely in the 18th century,

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.460
was just that they were more convenient

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.340
than any other way of paying for things.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.500
We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.260
to cope with the problem of public debt,

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.820
which up until that point had been

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.940
a recurrent source of instability.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.020
And then we invented equity finance

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.860
because bonds were not enough.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.420
So I would prefer to think of the financial history

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.060
as a series of crises, really,

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.820
that are resolved by innovations.

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.700
And in the most recent episode,

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.100
very exciting episode of Financial History,

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.300
something called Bitcoin initiated a new financial

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.940
or monetary revolution in response, I think,

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:36.140
to the growing crisis of the fiat money system.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.700
Can you speak to that?

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.740
So what do you think about Bitcoin?

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.500
What do you think it is the response to?

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.460
What are the growing problems of the fiat system?

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:49.460
What is this moment in human history

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.180
that is full of challenges that Bitcoin

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.340
and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome?

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.260
I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.820
whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.420
of the fiat currencies.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.220
If it was, it was a very far-sighted enterprise

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.620
because certainly in 2008,

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.340
when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:18.140
it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation was coming.

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.380
If anything, there was more reason to fear deflation

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.260
at that point.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:26.380
I think it would be more accurate to say

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.860
that with the advent of the internet,

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:31.220
there was a need for a means of payment

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.300
native to the internet,

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.300
typing your credit card number into a random website.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.260
It's not the way to pay for things on the internet.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.620
And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.220
the first attempt to solve the problem

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.380
of how do we pay for things

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.820
in what we must learn to call the metaverse,

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.540
but let's just call it the internet for old time's sake.

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:56.060
And ever since that initial innovation,

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.620
the realization that you could use computing power

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.740
and cryptography to create peer-to-peer payments

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.140
without third-party verification,

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.140
a revolution has been gathering momentum

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.940
that poses a very profound threat

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.060
to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.580
Most money in the world today is made by banks,

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.740
not central banks, banks.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.820
That's what most money is, it's entries in bank accounts.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:26.380
And what Bitcoin represents is an alternative mode

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.260
of payment that really ought to render banks obsolete.

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:35.660
I think this financial revolution has got past the point

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.460
at which it can be killed.

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.700
It was vulnerable in the early years,

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.380
but it now has sufficient adoption

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.420
and has generated sufficient additional layers.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.340
I mean, Ethereum was in many ways

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.820
the more important innovation

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.260
because you can build a whole system of payments

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.940
and ultimately smart contracts on top of Ether.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.220
I think we've now reached the point

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.740
that it's pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.580
And it's just survived an amazing thing,

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.620
which was the Chinese shutting down mining

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.500
and shutting down everything.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.820
And still here we are.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.180
In fact, crypto is thriving.

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:14.020
What we don't know is how much damage

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.620
ill-judged regulatory interventions are going to do

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.740
to this financial revolution.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.420
Left to its own devices,

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.580
I think decentralized finance

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.140
provides the native monitoring financial system

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.820
for the internet.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.060
And the more time we spend in the metaverse,

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.180
the more use we will make of it.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.100
The next things that will happen, I think,

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.260
will be that tokens in game spaces

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.100
like Roblox will become fungible.

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.540
As my nine-year-old spends a lot more time

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.260
playing on computer games than I ever did,

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.140
I can see that entertainment

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.060
is becoming a game-driven phenomenon.

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:57.220
And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.620
The economics of the internet, it's evolving very fast.

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.180
And in parallel, you can see

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.500
this payments revolution happening.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.300
I think that all goes naturally very well

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.980
and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.700
The problem is there are people in Washington

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.580
with an overwhelming urge to intervene

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.660
and disrupt this evolutionary process.

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.860
Partly, I think, out of a muddled sense

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:32.260
that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.860
If we don't step in, many more will go on.

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.460
This, I think, greatly exaggerates

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:38.540
how much criminal activity is, in fact,

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.220
going on in the space.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:43.100
But there's also the vested interests at work.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.540
It was odd to me, maybe not odd,

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.660
perhaps it wasn't surprising,

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.380
that the Bank for International Settlements

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.580
earlier this year published a report,

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.220
one chapter of which said, this must all go, must all stop.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.100
It's all gotta be shut down

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.500
and it's gotta be replaced by central bank digital currency.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.980
And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.900
read this and said, I agree with this.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:07.820
And one suddenly realized that the banks are clever.

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.180
They achieved the intellectual counterattack

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:15.300
with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:19.460
I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.100
I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.700
that essentially takes all transactions

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.460
and puts them directly under the surveillance

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.780
of a central government institution.

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:33.780
But that suddenly is a serious counter proposal.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.780
So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:44.500
technologically innovative internet native system

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.340
of payments that has the possibility to evolve,

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:51.660
to produce a full set of smart contracts,

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.580
reducing enormously the transaction costs

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.580
that we currently encounter in the financial world

01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.260
because it gets rid of all those middlemen

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:01.140
who take their cut every time you take out a mortgage

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.260
or whatever it is.

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.100
That's one alternative.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.940
But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.940
in which transactions will by default

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:11.300
be under the surveillance of the central bank.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:12.900
Seems like an easy choice to me,

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.460
but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.300
So that's where we are.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.220
I don't think that the regulators can kill web three.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:24.580
I think we're supposed to call it web three

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.260
because crypto is now an obsolescent term.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:28.180
They can't kill it,

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.380
but they can definitely make it difficult

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.500
and throw a lot of sand into the machine.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.220
And I think worst of all,

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.660
they can spoil the evolutionary story

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.700
by creating central bank digital currency

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.020
that I don't think we really need,

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.500
or we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.740
So do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.340
to take over the world?

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:57.100
So become the primary,

01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.500
you mentioned the three things that make money, money,

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.780
become the primary methodology

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.940
by which we store wealth, we exchange.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.660
No, no, I think what Bitcoin is,

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:12.180
this was a phrase that I got from my friend,

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.820
Matt MacLennan, First Eagle, an option on digital gold.

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.540
So it's the gold of the system,

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.780
but currently it behaves like an option.

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.380
That's why it's quite volatile,

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.820
because we don't really know

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.820
if this brave new world of crypto is gonna work.

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.180
But if it does work,

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.500
then Bitcoin is the gold because of the finite supply.

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.460
What role we need gold to play

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.940
in the metaverse isn't quite clear.

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.780
I love that you're using the term metaverse.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.660
This is great.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.780
Well, I just like the metaversity

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:48.460
as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in Austin.

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:52.340
But can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.540
I come from Glasgow where all novel words

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.780
have to be used sarcastically.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.580
So the metaverse, sarcastic.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.380
But see, the beauty about humor and sarcasm

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.540
is that the joke becomes reality.

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.820
I mean, it's like using the word big bang

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.580
to describe the origins of the universe.

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.180
It becomes like it will,

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.860
after a while it's in the textbooks and nobody's laughing.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.340
Yeah, well, that's exactly right.

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:15.300
So sticky.

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.740
Yeah, I'm on the side of humor,

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:21.380
but it is a dangerous activity these days.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:25.340
Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:30.340
The role it plays is probably not so much story value.

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.820
Right now, it's just nicely not very correlated asset

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.220
in your portfolio.

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.820
When I updated the Ascent of Money,

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.100
which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.260
I wrote a new chapter in which I said,

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:48.180
Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble,

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.300
will rise again through adoption.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.220
Because if every millionaire in the world

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.860
has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.940
the price should be $15,000.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.380
If it's 1%, it's $75,000.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.100
And it might not even stay at 1%

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:08.220
because, I mean, look at its recent performance.

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:13.060
If your exposure to global stocks had been hedged

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:16.300
with a significant crypto holding,

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:19.260
you would have aced the last few months.

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.100
So I think the non-correlation property

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.260
is very, very important in driving adoption.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.300
And the volatility also drives adoption

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.940
if you're a sophisticated investor.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.500
So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.220
because it's the option of digital gold,

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.140
but it's also just this nicely not very correlated asset

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:42.660
that you wanna hold.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.900
In a world where, what the hell?

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.380
I mean, the central bank's gonna tighten.

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.580
We've come through this massively disruptive episode

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.740
of the pandemic.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.620
Public debt soared.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.540
Money printing soared.

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.580
You could hang around with your bonds

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.700
and wait for the euthanasia of the rentier.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.740
You can hang on to your tech stocks

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.940
and just hope there isn't a massive correction or dot, dot, dot.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.740
Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.540
to make sure that you have at least some crypto

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.540
for the coming year, given what we likely have to face.

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.740
I think what's really interesting is that on top of Ethereum,

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:25.740
a more elaborate financial system is being built.

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:31.580
Stablecoins are the interesting puzzle for me

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.940
because we need off ramps.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.980
Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:44.020
and there's no getting away from that.

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.140
The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.580
as long as we pay our taxes.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.740
And the only question in my mind

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:55.300
is what's the optimal off ramp to make those taxes,

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.740
make those tax payments?

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.820
Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.820
Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.980
Maybe it's some kind of Fed coin

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.380
or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stablecoins

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.820
does the job, but we clearly need some stable off ramp.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.940
So you don't think it's possible for the IRS

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.300
within the next decade to be accepting Bitcoin

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.860
as tax payments?

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:24.340
I doubt that.

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.780
Having dealt with the IRS now since,

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.900
when did I first come here, 2002?

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.540
It's hard to think of an institution less likely

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:37.540
to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:41.980
No, I think we'll be tolerated.

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.580
Crypto world will be tolerated as long as we pay our taxes.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.340
And it's important that we're already at that point.

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.620
And then the next question becomes,

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.980
well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.260
and do we then have to go through

01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.620
endless regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:03.740
There's a whole bunch of uncertainties

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.460
that the administrative state excels at creating

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.620
because that's just how the administrative state works.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.900
You're doing something new.

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.980
I'll decide whether that's a security,

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.100
but don't expect me to define it for you.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.420
I'll decide in an arbitrary way and then you'll owe me money.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.540
So all of this is going to be very annoying.

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.620
And for people who are trying to run exchanges

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.660
or innovate in the space, these regulations will be annoying.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.420
But the problem with fintech is it's different from tech,

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.220
broadly defined.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:37.020
When tech got into e-commerce with Amazon,

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.540
when it got into social networking with Facebook,

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.740
there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.700
But welcome to the world of finance,

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:48.860
which has always been a jungle of regulation

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.900
because the regulation is there

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.340
to basically entrench the incumbents.

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.140
That's what it's for.

01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:59.180
So it'll be a much tougher fight

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:03.060
than the fights we've seen of other aspects

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.860
of the tech revolution

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:09.620
because the incumbents are there and they see the threat.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.060
And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.740
It's peer-to-peer payment without third party verification.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.180
And all the third parties are going, wait, what?

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:19.460
We're the third parties.

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:24.820
So there is a connection between power and money.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:29.100
You've mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:34.100
So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.340
From the perspective of money,

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:42.140
do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:46.260
can help resist the negative effects

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.940
of authoritarian regimes?

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.420
Or is that a silly hope?

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:57.660
Wars happen because the people

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:03.140
who have the power to command armed forces miscalculate.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.460
That's generally what happens.

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.180
And we will have a big war in the near future

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.260
if both the Chinese government

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:17.060
and the US government miscalculates

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:20.380
and they unleash lethal force on one another.

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:23.700
And there's nothing that any financial institution can do

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.500
to stop that any more than the Rothschilds

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.420
could stop World War I.

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.820
And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:35.660
with massive international financial influence.

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:39.460
So let's accept that war is in a different domain.

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:45.140
War would impact the financial world massively

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.620
if it were a war between the United States and China

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:52.380
because there's still a huge China trade on.

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.540
Wall Street is long China.

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.940
Europe is long China.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:59.540
So the conflict that I could foresee in the future

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.900
is one that's highly financially disruptive.

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.260
Where does crypto fit in?

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.900
Crypto's obvious utility in the short run

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:13.860
is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.100
for people who live in dangerous places

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.580
with failing, not just failing money,

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.460
but failing rule of law.

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.780
That's why in Latin America,

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.500
there's so much interest in crypto

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.620
because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.820
to look back on and not much of it is good.

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:34.980
So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves is,

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:39.100
and this goes back to the digital gold point.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.540
If you are in a dangerous place

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.700
with weak rule of law and weak property rights,

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.300
here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:56.100
I think the next question to ask is,

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.900
would you want to be long crypto

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:00.860
in the event of World War III?

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.620
What's interesting about that question

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.300
is that World War III would likely have

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.500
a significant cyber dimension to it.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.940
And I don't wanna be 100% in crypto

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.020
if they crash the internet,

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.460
which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.980
That's a fascinating question,

01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.700
whether you want to be holding physical gold

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:26.020
or digital gold in the event of World War III.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.860
The smart person who studied history

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.460
definitely wants a bit of both.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.060
And so let's imagine World War III

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.940
has a very, very severe cyber component to it

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.300
with high levels of disruption.

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:44.100
Yeah, you'd be glad of the old shiny stuff at that point.

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.620
So diversification still seems like

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:52.620
the most important truth of financial history.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.100
And what is crypto?

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:57.260
It's just this wonderful new source of diversification,

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.420
but you'd be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:02.620
I mean, I have some friends

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.620
who are probably quite close to that.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.140
Close to 100%, yeah.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.380
I'd mar the bowls of steel,

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:16.900
yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.140
You mentioned smart contracts.

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.820
What are your thoughts about

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.660
in the context of the history of money,

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.660
about Ethereum, about smart contracts,

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.660
about kind of more systematic at scale

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:33.500
formalization of agreements between humans?

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:39.500
I think it must be the case

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.620
that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.860
That when we are confronted

01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.860
with pages and pages and pages and pages of small print,

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.100
we're seeing some manifestation

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.220
of the late stage regulatory state.

01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:03.340
The transaction itself is quite simple.

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:08.500
And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:11.380
So I think the smart contract,

01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:16.060
although I'm sure lawyers will email me

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.740
and tell me I'm wrong,

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.420
can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:24.100
and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.620
and eliminate yet more intermediaries.

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:31.940
That's my kind of working assumption.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.940
And given that a lot of financial transactions

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:41.740
have the potential at least to be simplified,

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:45.620
automated, turned into smart contracts,

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.380
that's probably where the future goes.

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.820
I can't see an obvious reason

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:54.100
why my range of different financial needs,

01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.540
let's think about insurance for example,

01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:00.940
will continue to be met with instruments

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.260
that in some ways are a hundred years old.

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.620
So I think we're still at an early stage

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.420
of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:17.100
how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:20.020
mortgages and insurance leap to mind.

01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:23.380
Most households are penalized

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.100
for being financially poorly educated

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.660
and confronted with oligopolistic

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.620
financial services providers.

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:35.740
So you kind of leave college already in debt.

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.340
So you start in debt servitude

01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.540
and then you got to somehow lever up to buy a home

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.580
if you can, because everybody's kind of telling you

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.500
you should do that.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.380
So you and your spouse,

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.100
you are getting even more leveraged

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:57.380
and you're long one asset class called real estate,

01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.540
which is super illiquid.

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:03.460
I mean, already I'm crying inside

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:06.620
at the thought of describing so many households

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:07.940
financial predicament in that way.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.660
And I'm not done with them yet because oh, by the way,

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.180
there's all this insurance you have to take out.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.380
And here are the providers that are willing to insure you

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:17.740
and here are the premiums you're gonna be paying,

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.260
which are kind of presented to you.

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.220
That's your car insurance, that's your home insurance.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.780
And if you're here, it's the earthquake insurance.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:26.460
And pretty soon you're just bleeding money

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:30.940
in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.620
to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:39.300
And let's look at your balance sheet, it sucks.

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.220
There's this great big chunk of real estate

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.660
and what else have you really got on there?

01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.340
And the other side is a bunch of debt,

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:48.340
which is probably paying too high interest.

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.460
The typical household in the median kind of ranges

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.060
is at the mercy of oligopolistic

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.620
financial services providers.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:01.220
Go down further in the social scale

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.780
and people are outside the financial system altogether.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.540
And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:10.940
and informal lending with huge punitive rates.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.100
We have to do better than this.

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:15.340
This has to be improved upon.

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.380
And I think what's exciting about our time

01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.540
is that technology now exists,

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.700
that didn't exist when I wrote The Ascent of Money,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.660
to solve these problems.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.260
When I wrote The Ascent of Money, which was in 2008,

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:30.380
you couldn't really solve the problem I've just described.

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.620
Certainly you couldn't solve it

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.980
with something like microfinance.

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.740
That was obviously not viable,

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:38.100
the interest rates were high,

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.700
the transaction costs were crazy.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.020
But now we have solutions

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.980
and the solutions are extremely exciting.

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.140
So FinTech is this great force for good

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.820
that brings people into the financial system

01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.900
and reduces transaction costs.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.220
Crypto is part of it, but it's just part of it.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:55.860
There's a much broader story of FinTech going on here

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:59.660
where you get, suddenly you get financial services

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.500
on your phone don't cost nearly as much as they did

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.100
when there had to be a bricks and mortar building

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.220
on Main Street that you kind of went humbly

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.420
and beseeched to lend you money.

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:11.620
I'm excited about that

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:14.740
because it seems to me very socially transformative.

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.660
I'll give you one other example of what's great.

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.580
The people who really get scalped in our financial system

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:25.780
are senders and receivers of remittances,

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:29.060
which are often amongst the poorest families in the world.

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:32.380
The people who are like my wife's family in East Africa

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:34.500
really kind of hand to mouth.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.460
And if you send money to East Africa

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:39.020
or the Philippines or Central America,

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.820
it's the transaction costs are awful.

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:46.100
I'm talking to you, Western Union.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.220
We're gonna solve that problem.

01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.180
So 10 years from now,

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.500
the transaction costs will just be negligible

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
and the money will go to the people who need it

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.100
rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.900
So I'm on the side of the revolution with this

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.660
because I think the incumbent financial institutions

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.780
globally are doing a pretty terrible job

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.340
and middle-class and lower-class families lose out.

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.900
And thankfully, technology allows us to fix this.

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.180
Yeah, so FinTech can remove a lot of inefficiencies

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.100
in the system.

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.940
I'm super excited myself,

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.060
maybe as a machine learning person in data oracles.

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:26.140
So converting a lot of our physical world into data

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:29.220
and have smart contracts on top of that

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.660
so that no longer is there's this fuzziness

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.620
about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.860
You can tie your agreement to weather.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.780
You can tie your agreement to the behavior

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.260
of certain kinds of financial systems.

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:49.740
You can tie your behavior to, I don't know,

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.740
I mean, all kinds of things.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.260
You can connect it to the body

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.980
in terms of human sensory information.

01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:58.380
Like you can make an agreement

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.180
that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month,

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.580
you're going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.420
I don't know.

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.140
It's a stupid example, but it's not

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:12.100
because you can create all kinds of services on top of that.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:15.100
You can just create all kinds of interesting applications

01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:18.780
that completely revolutionize how humans transact.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:24.740
I think, of course, we don't want to create a world

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.580
of Chinese-style social credit

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.420
in which our behavior becomes so transparent

01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:36.940
to providers of financial services,

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.100
particularly insurers,

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:42.140
that when I try to go into the pub,

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:44.900
I'm stopped from doing so.

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:48.220
Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.

01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:52.700
Right, or my credit card won't work in certain restaurants

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:56.140
because they serve, you know, ribeye steak.

01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.260
I fear that world because I see it being built in China.

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:02.420
And we must, at all costs,

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.860
make sure that the Western world

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:07.540
has something distinctive to offer.

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.900
It can't just be, oh, it's the same as in China,

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:13.620
only the data go to five tech companies

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.900
rather than to Xi Jinping.

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:21.740
So I think that the way we need to steer this world

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:26.740
is in the way that our data are by default

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.100
vaulted on our devices.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:35.340
And we choose when to release the data

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.260
rather than the default setting being

01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.140
that the data are available.

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:41.180
That's important, I think,

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.060
because it was one of the biggest mistakes

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.500
of the evolution of the internet

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.100
that in a way the default was to let our data be plundered.

01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.220
It's hard to undo that,

01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:56.140
but I think we can at least create a new regime

01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:59.740
that in future makes privacy default

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:02.180
rather than open access default.

01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:08.020
In the book, Doom, The Politics of Catastrophe,

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.940
your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics,

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:14.340
and the terrible disasters in human history,

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:17.940
which stands out to you as the worst

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:21.060
in terms of how much it shook the world

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.340
and the human spirit.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:28.780
I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century

01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:32.580
when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.340
As far as we can see, that was history's worst pandemic.

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.300
Maybe there was a comparably bad one

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.660
in the reign of the emperor Justinian,

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.860
but there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad.

01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.500
And the more we learn about the 14th century,

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:54.420
the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:58.820
and the mortality was 30% in some places,

01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:01.660
50% in some places higher.

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.700
There were whole towns that were just emptied.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.500
And when one reads about the Black Death,

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:12.500
it's an unimaginable nightmare of death

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:17.780
and madness in the death with flagellant orders

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.500
wandering from town to town,

01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:22.780
seeking to ward off divine retribution

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.860
by flogging themselves,

01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:27.020
people turning on the local Jewish communities

01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.980
as if it's somehow their fault.

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:32.460
That must have been a nightmarish time.

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:36.740
If you ask me for an also ran a runner up,

01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:41.740
it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.

01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:46.300
And in many ways it might have been worse

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:50.420
because for a medieval peasant,

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.980
the sense of being on the wrong side

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:55.380
of divine retribution must have been overpowering.

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.420
In the mid 20th century,

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:04.220
you knew that this was manmade murder

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.020
on a massive industrial scale.

01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.580
If one reads Broisman's life and fate,

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.940
just to take one example,

01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:15.380
one enters a hellscape

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:21.260
that it's extremely hard to imagine oneself in.

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:25.540
So these are two of the great disasters of human history.

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.140
And if we did have a time machine,

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:31.060
if one really were able to transport people back

01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:35.540
and give them a glimpse of these times,

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.140
I think the post-traumatic stress would be enormous.

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.380
People would come back from those trips,

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:45.100
even if it was a one-day excursion with guaranteed survival

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.180
in a state of utter shock.

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:51.180
You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.740
which is a fascinating thing to do,

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:55.900
sometimes to a controversial degree.

01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.780
And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:06.580
So let me ask maybe about World War II or in general,

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:12.380
what key moments in history of the 20th century

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.860
do you think if something else happened at those moments,

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.260
we could have avoided some of the big atrocities?

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.180
Stalin's Holodomor, Hitler's Holocaust,

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.860
Mao's great Chinese famine.

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.620
The great turning point in world history

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:32.900
is August the 2nd, 1914,

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:38.700
when the British cabinet decides to intervene.

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:43.660
And what would have been a European war

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:45.900
becomes a world war.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.380
And with British intervention,

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:50.700
it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.

01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.300
So very early in my career,

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.740
I became very preoccupied with the deliberations on that day

01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.780
and the surprising decision

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:04.580
that a liberal cabinet took to go to war,

01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:06.540
which you might not have bet on that morning

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:10.700
because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.980
who would be disinclined and only a minority,

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:15.300
including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.780
So that's one turning point.

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.180
I often wish I could get my time machine working

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:22.660
and go back and say, wait, stop,

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.340
just think about what you're going to do.

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.980
And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.820
So that's one.

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:31.540
Can we linger on that one?

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:36.540
That one, a lot of people push back on you

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.060
because it's so difficult.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.780
So the idea is if I could try to summarize

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.460
and you're the first person

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:50.420
made me think about this very uncomfortable thought,

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.380
which is the ideas in World War I,

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:55.780
it would be a better world

01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:00.540
if Britain stayed out of the war and Germany won.

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.380
Right.

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.980
Thinking now in retrospect

01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:08.020
at the whole story of the 20th century,

01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:11.980
thinking about Stalin's rule of 30 years,

01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:14.580
thinking about Hitler's rise to power

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:18.380
and the atrocities of the Holocaust,

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:21.380
but also like you said, on the Eastern front,

01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:25.980
the death of tens of millions of people through the war

01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:29.500
and also sort of the political prisoners and the suffering

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.940
connected to communism, connected to fascism,

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.180
all those kinds of things.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.900
Well, that's one heck of an example

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:42.020
of why you're just like fearless in this particular style

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.180
of exploring counterfactual history.

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.420
Can you elaborate on that idea

01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:50.220
and maybe why this was such an important day

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220
in human history?

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.460
This argument was central to my book, The Pity of War.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:58.420
I also did an essay in virtual history about this

01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:01.220
and it's always amused me that from around that time

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.300
I began to be called a conservative historian

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.580
because it's actually a very left-wing argument.

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:08.020
The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay out

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.580
of the war were the left of the Labour Party

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.980
who split to become the independent Labour Party.

01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:16.140
What would have happened?

01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:19.980
Well, first of all, Britain was not ready for war in 1914.

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:23.140
There had not been conscription, the army was tiny.

01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:25.620
So Britain had failed to deter Germany.

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.900
The Germans took the decision that they could risk

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:32.060
going through Belgium using the Schlieffen Plan

01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:34.540
to fight their two-front war.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:37.540
They calculated that Britain's intervention

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.540
would either not happen or not matter.

01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:45.540
If Britain had been strategically committed

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.980
to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,

01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:51.300
they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,

01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.500
had a meaningful land army

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.820
and that would have deterred the Germans.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.420
So the Liberal government provided the worst

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:01.980
of both worlds, a commitment that was more or less secret

01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:05.500
to intervene that the public didn't know about.

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:07.660
In fact, much of the Liberal Party didn't know about,

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.140
but without really the means to make

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.380
that intervention effective,

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.460
a tiny army with just a few divisions.

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.100
So it was perfectly reasonable to argue,

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.740
as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.620
that Britain should not intervene.

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.580
After all, Britain had not immediately intervened

01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:27.220
against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.

01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:30.500
It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.900
but not immediately intervening.

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:35.380
If Britain had stayed out,

01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:38.500
I don't think that France would have collapsed immediately

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.460
as it had in 1870.

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:42.460
The French held up remarkably well

01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:45.380
to catastrophic casualties in the first six months

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:47.820
of the First World War.

01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:52.420
But by 1916, I don't see how France could have kept going

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.900
if Britain had not joined the war.

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.980
And I think the war would have been over perhaps

01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.220
at some point in 1916.

01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:00.580
We know that Germany's aims

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.380
would have been significantly limited

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.540
because they would have needed to keep Britain out.

01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:06.220
If they'd succeeded in keeping Britain out,

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.740
they'd have had to keep Britain out.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.220
And the way to keep Britain out was obviously

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.940
not to make any annexation of Belgium,

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:14.140
to limit German war aims,

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.580
particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.

01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:19.180
And from Britain's point of view, what was not to like?

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:23.340
So the Russian Empire is defeated along with France.

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:27.580
What does that really change?

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.860
If the Germans are sensible,

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.900
and we can see what this might've looked like,

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.900
they focus on Eastern Europe.

01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:38.460
They take chunks of the Russian Empire,

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:40.620
perhaps they create as they did

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:44.420
in the piece of Brest-Litovsk,

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.180
an independent or quasi-independent Poland.

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:49.420
In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.

01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:51.140
In fact, it's a good thing.

01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:54.420
Britain never had had a particularly good relationship

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:56.020
with the Russian Empire after all.

01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.420
The key point here is that the Germany

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:02.220
that emerges from victory in 1916

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.980
has a kind of European Union.

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:09.100
It's the dominant power of an enlarged Germany

01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:12.860
with a significant middle Europa,

01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:13.820
whatever you want to call it,

01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.340
customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.220
including one suspects Austria-Hungary.

01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:27.140
That is a very different world from the world of 1917-18.

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:31.060
The protraction of the war for a further two years,

01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:34.700
it's globalization which Britain's intervention

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.620
made inevitable.

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.420
As Philip Zellico showed in his recent book

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:43.500
on the failure to make peace in 1916,

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:46.060
Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.740
and broker a peace in 1916.

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:50.780
So I'm not the only counterfactualist here.

01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:53.420
The extension of the war for a further two years

01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:56.100
with escalating slaughter, the death toll rose

01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:00.460
because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater.

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.420
That's what condemns us to the Bolshevik revolution.

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:08.020
And it's what condemns us ultimately to Nazism

01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:13.780
because it's out of the experience of defeat in 1918

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.580
as Hitler makes clear in Mein Kampf

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:19.340
that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.900
Take out those additional years of war

01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:26.180
and Hitler's just a failed artist.

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.660
It's the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:34.900
You asked what are the things

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.900
that avoid the totalitarian states?

01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:41.380
As I've said, British non-intervention for me

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.620
is the most plausible and it takes out all of that

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:48.260
malignant history that follows from the Bolshevik revolution.

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.020
It's very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere

01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.340
if the war is over.

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.300
That looks like the opportunity

01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:59.820
for the constitutional elements,

01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:02.580
the liberal elements in Russia.

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.780
There are other moments at which you can imagine history

01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.460
taking a different path.

01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.540
If the provisional government in Russia

01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:14.020
had been more ruthless,

01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:17.460
it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks,

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.060
but if it had just rounded them up

01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:20.740
and shot the Bolshevik leadership,

01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:25.020
that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik revolution off.

01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:29.180
One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:32.660
with the kind of despair at their failure to see

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.740
the scale of the threat that they faced

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:36.740
and the ruthlessness that the Bolshevik leadership

01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.580
would evince.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:42.100
There's a counterfactual in Germany, which is interesting.

01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.980
I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself

01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:49.780
in two disastrous economic calamities,

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.820
the inflation and then the deflation.

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.700
It's difficult for me to imagine Hitler

01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:58.140
getting to be Reich Chancellor

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:01.020
without those huge economic disasters.

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:03.740
So another part of my early work explored

01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.540
alternative policy options that the Weimar Republic

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.860
might have pursued.

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:14.140
There are other contingencies that spring to mind.

01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:17.780
In 1936 or 38, I think more plausibly 38,

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.140
Britain should have gone to war.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.140
The great mistake was Munich.

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:29.020
Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,

01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:31.460
because remember he didn't have Russia squared away

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:33.780
as he would in 1939.

01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.780
Chamberlain's mistake was to fold instead of going for war

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.060
as Churchill rightly saw.

01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:44.260
And there was a magical opportunity there

01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.420
that would have played into the hands

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:48.060
of the German military opposition and conservatives

01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:52.860
to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.700
I could go on.

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:58.940
The point is that history is not some inextricable narrative,

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.100
which can only end one way.

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.660
It's a garden of forking paths.

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:08.220
And at many, many junctions in the road,

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.820
there were choices that could have averted

01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:14.300
the calamities of the mid 20th century.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.340
I have to ask you about this moment

01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:18.060
before you said I could go on.

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.540
This moment of Chamberlain and Hitler,

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:24.260
snuff Hitler out in terms of Czechoslovakia.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:29.020
And we'll return to the book Doom on this point.

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:32.260
What does it take to be a great leader

01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:36.620
in the room with Hitler or in the same time

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:40.340
and space as Hitler to snuff them out,

01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.660
to make the right decisions?

01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:46.740
So it sounds like you put quite a bit of a blame

01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:51.220
on the man, Chamberlain, and give credit

01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:53.340
to somebody like a Churchill.

01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.260
So what is the difference?

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:55.420
Where's that line?

01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.900
You've also written a book about Henry Kissinger,

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:01.220
who's an interesting sort of person

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:04.820
that's been throughout many difficult decisions

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.180
in the games of power.

01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:08.540
So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?

01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.660
That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:12.260
is fascinating to me,

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:15.780
because it feels like it's man on man conversations

01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.700
that define history.

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:19.620
Well, Hitler was bluffing.

01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:21.780
He really wasn't ready for war in 1938.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:25.740
The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:30.740
And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation

01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:33.700
along with his advisors, because it wasn't all Chamberlain.

01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:38.700
He was in many ways articulating the establishment view.

01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.420
And I tried to show in a book called War of the World

01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.740
how that establishment worked.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:46.100
It extended through the BBC, into the aristocracy,

01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.940
to Oxford.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.020
There was an establishment view.

01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:49.740
Chamberlain personified it.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.020
Churchill was seen as a warmonger.

01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.260
He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.

01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:59.060
But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.780
Because it's conceptual.

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:03.700
Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.820
because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.

01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:09.820
He fails to see that the time that he gets,

01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.540
that he buys at Munich, is also available to Hitler.

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.220
Everybody gets the time.

01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.020
And Hitler's able to do much more with it

01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.900
because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin

01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.700
that guarantees that Germany can fight a war

01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.980
on one front in 1939.

01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:26.900
What does Chamberlain do?

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.820
Builds some more aircraft.

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:31.380
So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement

01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.860
was to play for time.

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.180
I mean, they knew war was coming,

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.180
but they were playing for time,

01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:39.220
not realizing that Hitler got the time too.

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:42.060
And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:43.820
he was in a much stronger position,

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:45.460
not least because of all the resources

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:50.460
that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.780
So that was the conceptual mistake.

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:57.780
Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out this mistake

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:01.020
and predicting accurately

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:04.140
that it would lead to war on worse terms.

01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:05.740
What does it take?

01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:10.740
It takes a distinct courage to be unpopular.

01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.700
And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:16.540
People would listen to him in the House of Commons

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:17.820
in silence.

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:21.980
On one occasion, Lady Aster shouted, rubbish.

01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:25.380
So he went through a period of being hated on.

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:29.140
The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:31.860
was that he always applied history to the problem.

01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.180
And that's why he gets it right.

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:37.420
He sees the historical problem

01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.940
much more clearly than Chamberlain.

01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:44.380
So I think if you go back to 1938,

01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.940
there's no realistic counterfactual

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:48.060
in which Churchill's in government in 1938.

01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:49.860
You have to have France collapse

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:51.940
for Churchill to come into government.

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.940
But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite

01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:02.260
that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:06.340
They haven't seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture

01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.900
to take a phrase from Kissinger,

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:13.820
which is that whatever they're doing in postponing the war

01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.940
has the potential to create a worse starting point

01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.780
for the war.

01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:21.900
It would have been risky in 1938,

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.660
but it was a way better situation

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:26.460
than they ended up with in 1939, a year later.

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:28.220
You asked about Kissinger,

01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:31.220
and I've learned a lot from reading Kissinger

01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:33.180
and talking to Kissinger

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.780
since I embarked on writing his biography

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:37.140
a great many years ago.

01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:40.740
I think one of the most important things I've learned

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:46.620
is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:49.740
It may be the most important tool that we have

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:52.820
in that kind of decision-making.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.460
You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:03.380
And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:08.380
So Kissinger often says in his early work,

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:12.260
the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,

02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.980
but ultimately the decision-making that we do

02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:18.460
under uncertainty can't be based on data.

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.260
The problem of conjecture is that you could take an action

02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:26.260
now and incur some cost, an overt disaster,

02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:28.700
but you'll get no thanks for it

02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.300
because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.500
And nobody goes around saying, wasn't it wonderful

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.260
how we didn't have another 9-11.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:40.780
On the other hand, you can do nothing,

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:44.140
incur no upfront costs and hope for the best.

02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:47.420
And you might get lucky, the disaster might not happen.

02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.460
That's in a democratic system, the much easier path to take.

02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:59.340
And I think the essence of leadership is to be ready

02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.060
to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster

02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:04.060
and accept that you won't get gratitude.

02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:10.380
If I may make a comment, an aside about Henry Kissinger.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:14.460
So he, I think at 98 years old currently,

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:16.340
has still got it.

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:17.740
He's brilliant.

02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.020
It's very, very impressive.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:23.300
I can only hope that my brain has the same durability

02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:26.100
that his does because it's a formidable intellect

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:31.100
and it's still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.

02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.300
So you mentioned Eric Schmitz and his book.

02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:37.060
They reached out to me, did they wanna do this podcast?

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:41.460
And I know Eric Schmitz, I've spoken to him before.

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:44.140
I like him a lot, obviously.

02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:48.260
So they said we could do a podcast for 40 minutes

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:52.740
with Eric, 40 minutes with Eric and Henry together

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:55.060
and 40 minutes with Henry.

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:58.140
So there's a three different conversations.

02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:01.020
And I had to like, I had to do some soul searching

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:02.900
because I said, fine, 40 minutes with Eric.

02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.860
We'll probably talk many times again.

02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:07.580
Fine, let's talk about this AI book together

02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.300
for 40 minutes.

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:12.860
But I said, what I wrote to them is that I would hate myself

02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:16.740
if I only have 40 minutes to talk to Henry Kissinger.

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:18.900
And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth

02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:21.220
and in the end decided to part ways over this.

02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:25.900
And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:32.940
in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?

02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:38.980
Because there's a particular world leader

02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:40.580
that I've mentioned in the past

02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:43.980
where the conversation is very likely to happen.

02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:48.980
And as it happens, those conversations can often be,

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.380
unfortunately, this person only has 30 minutes now.

02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.060
I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately,

02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:01.060
and you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?

02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.220
I suppose that's the thing that journalists

02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:04.580
have to think about, right?

02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:09.620
Like, do I hold on to my integrity

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:11.420
in whatever form that takes?

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.540
And do I stay my ground

02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:16.180
even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.980
Anyway, it's something I thought about

02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.780
and something I think about.

02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.180
And with Henry Kissinger,

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:24.860
I mean, he's had a million amazing conversations

02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:27.300
in your biography, so it's not like something is lost,

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.660
but it was still nevertheless

02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:30.820
to me some soul searching that I had to do

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.620
as a kind of practice for what to me

02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.860
is a higher stakes conversation.

02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:38.940
I'll just mention it is Vladimir Putin.

02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:41.780
I can have a conversation with him

02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:44.460
unlike any conversation he's ever had

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:47.860
partially because I'm a fluent Russian speaker,

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.660
partially because I'm messed up in the head

02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:50.940
in certain kinds of ways that make

02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:52.780
for an interesting dynamic,

02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.420
because we're both judo people,

02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:58.580
we're both are certain kinds of human beings

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.140
that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.

02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:05.900
I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.

02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.380
You've, in your book, Doom,

02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:12.380
have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history,

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:18.340
and in some sense saying that all of these disasters

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.900
are manmade, so humans have a role

02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:24.180
in terms of the magnitude of the effect

02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:25.980
that they have on human civilization.

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.540
Without taking cheap political shots,

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.420
can we talk about COVID-19?

02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:37.340
How will history remember the COVID-19 pandemic?

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.780
What were the successes?

02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:43.780
What were the failures of leadership of man, of humans?

02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:50.740
Doom was a book that I was planning to write

02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:53.580
before the pandemic struck.

02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:56.620
As a history of the future

02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:59.700
based in large measure on science fiction,

02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.580
it had occurred to me in 2019

02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:04.460
that I had spent too long not reading science fiction,

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:09.460
and so I decided I would liven up my intake

02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:12.700
by getting off history for a bit

02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:14.100
and reading science fiction.

02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:16.340
Because history is great at telling you

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:18.580
about the perennial problems of power.

02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:20.940
Putin is always interesting on history.

02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:23.140
He's become something of a historian recently

02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.780
with his essays and lectures.

02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:27.300
But what history's bad at telling you

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:28.540
is well, what will the effects

02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:31.740
of discontinuity of technology be?

02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.340
And so I thought I need some science fiction

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:34.420
to think more about this,

02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:38.340
because I'm tending to miss the importance

02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.100
of technological discontinuity.

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:43.020
If you read a lot of science fiction,

02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:45.580
you read a lot of plague books,

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:47.500
because science fiction writers

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:50.300
are really quite fond of the plague scenario.

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:52.500
So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.700
but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic.

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:58.540
So when the first email came to me,

02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.940
I think it was on January the 3rd

02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.940
from my medical friend, Justin Stebbing,

02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.780
funny pneumonia in Wuhan,

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.140
my antennae began to tingle,

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.300
because it was just like one of those science fiction books

02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:11.860
that begins in just that way.

02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.060
In a pandemic,

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.820
as Larry Brilliant, the epidemiologist,

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:20.860
said many years ago,

02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:25.460
the key is early detection and early action.

02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.500
That's how you deal with a novel pathogen.

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.780
And almost no Western country did that.

02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:32.900
We know it was doable,

02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:35.500
because the Taiwanese and the South Koreans did it,

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:36.860
and they did it very well.

02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:41.460
But really no Western country got this right.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.540
Some were unlucky,

02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:45.380
because super spreader events happened earlier

02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:46.220
than in other countries.

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.580
Italy was hit very hard very early.

02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:49.420
For other countries,

02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:51.700
the real disaster came quite late, Russia,

02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.020
which has only relatively recently

02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:56.060
had a really bad experience.

02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.540
The lesson for me is quite different from the one

02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:03.900
that most journalists thought they were learning last year.

02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.380
Most journalists last year thought,

02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:08.340
Trump is a terrible president.

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.740
He's saying a lot of crazy things.

02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:13.260
It's his fault that we have high excess mortality

02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:15.100
in the United States.

02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:18.060
The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain,

02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:19.900
Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot.

02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:22.260
Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot.

02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:24.540
Even India, Narendra Modi.

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.580
The same argument.

02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:30.740
And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.

02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:35.220
It's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things,

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.580
and broadly speaking,

02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:40.780
gave poor guidance to their populations.

02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:43.580
But I don't think it's true to say

02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.700
that with different leaders,

02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:47.020
these countries would have done significantly better

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:50.460
if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:52.420
I don't think the US would have done much better

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:55.620
because the things that caused excess mortality last year

02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:57.060
weren't presidential decisions.

02:07:57.060 --> 02:08:00.980
They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.

02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:03.020
That definitely wasn't Trump's fault.

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:04.940
Scott Gottlieb's book makes that very clear.

02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:06.900
It's just been published recently.

02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:10.220
We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,

02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:12.620
which the Koreans did very well.

02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:16.660
We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.140
There was no enforcement of quarantine.

02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:21.100
And we exposed the elderly to the virus

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.500
as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.

02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:25.740
And these things had very little to do

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.100
with presidential incompetence.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:33.100
So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance

02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:34.740
in a crisis like this

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:37.220
because what you really need is your public health bureaucracy

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:38.100
to get it right.

02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:42.180
And very few Western public health bureaucracies got it right.

02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:45.420
Could the president have given better leadership?

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:47.100
Yes.

02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.380
His correct strategy, however,

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:52.740
was to learn from Barack Obama's playbook

02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:55.220
with the opioid epidemic.

02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:59.420
The opioid epidemic killed as many people on Obama's watch

02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:01.860
as COVID did on Trump's watch.

02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:03.180
And it was worse in a sense

02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:05.060
because it only happened in the US.

02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:07.820
And each year, it killed more people than the year before,

02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.220
over eight years.

02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:10.300
Nobody, to my knowledge,

02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:14.780
has ever seriously blamed Obama for the opioid epidemic.

02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.620
Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center

02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:18.460
of the response,

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:22.180
to claim that he had some unique insight into the pandemic

02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:24.860
and to say, with every passing week,

02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:26.100
more and more foolish things,

02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:29.180
until even a significant portion of people

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:32.100
who'd voted for him in 2016 realized that he'd blown it,

02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.180
which was why he lost the election.

02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:37.940
The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence,

02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:41.020
the pandemic sire, and get the hell out of the way.

02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:42.780
That's what my advice to Trump would have been.

02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:45.740
In fact, it was in February of last year.

02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:49.060
So the mistake was to try to lead.

02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.580
But actually, leadership in a pandemic

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:54.100
is almost a contradiction in terms.

02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:56.740
What you really need is your public health bureaucracy

02:09:56.740 --> 02:09:58.420
not to fuck it up.

02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.500
And he really, really fucked it up.

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.980
And that was then all blamed on Trump.

02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:05.380
Jim Fallows writes a piece in The Atlantic that says,

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:07.820
well, being the president's like flying a light aircraft,

02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:09.060
it's pilot error.

02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:10.540
And I read that piece and I thought,

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.220
does he really, after all the years he spent writing,

02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:16.180
think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?

02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:19.180
I mean, it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft.

02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.380
Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:23.700
with how many different agencies?

02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.940
60, 70, we've all lost count.

02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:27.740
And you're surrounded by advisors,

02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:29.780
at least a quarter of whom are saying,

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:31.820
this is a disaster, we have to close the borders.

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:33.540
And the others are saying, no, no,

02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:34.740
we have to keep the economy going.

02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.140
That's what you're running on in November.

02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:39.220
So being a president in a pandemic

02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:41.100
is a very unenviable position.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.500
Because you actually can't really determine

02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:47.260
whether your public health bureaucracy

02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:48.380
will get it right or not.

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.580
You don't think to push back on that,

02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:53.180
just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.

02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:57.100
So leaving Trump and Biden aside,

02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:58.940
what I would love to see from a president

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:03.300
is somebody who makes great speeches

02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:06.460
and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,

02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.260
the public health bureaucracy,

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.780
to get their shit together,

02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:11.620
to fire certain kinds of people to do.

02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:12.700
I mean, I'm sorry,

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:15.220
but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,

02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.420
especially in the modern age with the internet.

02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:19.540
It can really move people.

02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:23.900
Instead, the lack of speeches resulted

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:28.900
in certain kinds of forces amplifying division

02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:31.500
over whether to wear masks or not.

02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:35.900
It's almost like the public picked some random topic

02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.700
over which to divide themselves.

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.860
And there was like a complete indecision,

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.420
which is really what it was,

02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:45.220
fear of uncertainty materializing itself

02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:46.460
in some kind of division.

02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:48.980
And then you almost like busy yourself

02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.980
with the red versus blue politics,

02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:52.500
as opposed to some, I don't know,

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:55.940
FDR type character just stands and say,

02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.900
fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing.

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:02.700
We're going to manufacture 5 billion tests.

02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:04.340
This is what America is great at.

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:06.340
We're going to build the greatest

02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:08.820
testing infrastructure ever built,

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:12.460
or something, or even with the vaccine development.

02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:15.300
But that was what I was about to interject.

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:18.420
In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.

02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:19.580
If you get that right,

02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:21.620
then you should be forgiven for much else.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:22.460
And that was the one thing

02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:23.900
the Trump administration got right,

02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.540
because they went around the bureaucracy

02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:28.860
with Operation Warp Speed

02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:32.260
and achieved a really major success.

02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:38.260
So I think the paradox of the 2020 story

02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:42.180
in the United States is that the one thing

02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.700
that mattered most, the Trump administration got right.

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:49.060
And it got so much else wrong that was sort of marginal

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:50.980
that we were left with the impression

02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.900
that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,

02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:55.460
which wasn't really quite right.

02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:57.500
Sure, it would have been great

02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.980
if we did Operation Warp Speed for testing,

02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:02.940
but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.

02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:06.980
And this brings me to the question

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.340
that you raised there of polarization

02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:11.740
and why that happened.

02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:13.980
Now, in a book called The Square and the Tower,

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:17.140
I argued that it would be very costly for the United States

02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:20.740
to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated

02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:22.460
by a handful of big tech companies,

02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:25.260
that this ultimately would have more adverse effects

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:27.420
than simply contested elections.

02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:31.300
And I think we saw over the past 18 months

02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:32.780
just how bad this could be,

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:37.740
because the odd thing about this country

02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:42.260
is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:44.900
and about 20% of people refused to get them

02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:49.900
and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:54.180
in terms of the anti-vax network,

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.900
which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,

02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:58.620
predating the pandemic.

02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:02.460
Rene de Resta wrote about this pre-2020.

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:04.740
And this anti-vax network has turned out

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:06.980
to kill maybe 200,000 Americans

02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:08.220
who could have been vaccinated,

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:11.060
but were persuaded through magical thinking

02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:14.020
that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.

02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:16.980
Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiologist,

02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:18.420
you don't need to be a medical scientist

02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:21.220
to know that the virus is about two orders of magnitude

02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:22.740
riskier than the vaccine.

02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:28.700
So again, leadership could definitely have been better,

02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:32.340
but the politicization of everything

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:35.220
was not Trump's doing alone.

02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:39.540
It happened because our public sphere has been dominated

02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:43.700
by a handful of platforms whose business model

02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:45.820
inherently promotes polarization,

02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:48.860
inherently promotes fake news and extreme views,

02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:51.180
because those are the things that get the eyeballs

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.180
and the screens and sell the ads.

02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:55.140
I mean, this is now a commonplace,

02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:57.300
but when one thinks about the cost

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.820
of allowing this kind of thing to happen,

02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:04.140
it's now a very high human cost.

02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:06.940
And we were foolish to leave uncorrected

02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:09.300
these structural problems in the public sphere

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:12.780
that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.060
And you described that, like you mentioned,

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:17.460
that there's these networks

02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.940
that are almost like laying dormant,

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:22.860
waiting for their time in the sun,

02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:25.380
and they stepped forward in this case.

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:27.860
And that those network effects just,

02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:32.580
they serve as catalyst for whatever

02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:34.500
the bad parts of human nature.

02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:36.380
I do hope that there's kinds of networks

02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:38.780
that emphasize the better angels of our nature,

02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.820
to quote Steven Pinker.

02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:43.540
It's just clearly, and we know this

02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:46.380
from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:49.780
there is clearly a very clear tension

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:54.140
between the business model of a company like Facebook

02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:56.380
and the public good.

02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:57.700
And they know that.

02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:00.300
I just talked to the founder of Instagram.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:02.460
Yes, that's the case,

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:05.980
but it's not, from a technology perspective,

02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:08.500
like absolutely true of any kind of social network.

02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:09.860
I think it's possible to build,

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:12.060
actually, I think it's not just possible.

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:15.020
I think it's pretty easy if you set that as the goal,

02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.820
to build social networks

02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:20.660
that don't have these negative effects.

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:25.660
Right, but if the business model is we sell ads

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:30.220
and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,

02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:32.100
then the algorithm is biased in favor

02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:33.860
of fake news and extreme views.

02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:34.820
So it's not the ads.

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:36.580
A lot of people blame the ads.

02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:40.380
The problem, I think, is the engagement,

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:42.020
and the engagement is just the easiest,

02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.900
the dumbest way to sell the ads.

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:46.140
I think there's much different metrics

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:48.780
that could be used to make a lot more money

02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:51.020
than the engagement in the long-term.

02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:53.460
It has more to do with planning for the long-term.

02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:56.740
So optimizing the selling of ads

02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:02.580
to make people happy with themselves in the long-term,

02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:07.380
as opposed to some kind of addicted, like dopamine feeling.

02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:09.980
And so that's, to me, that has to do with metrics

02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:11.380
and measuring things correctly

02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:13.540
and sort of also creating a culture

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:16.740
of what's valued to have difficult conversations

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:18.420
about what we're doing with society,

02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:19.580
all those kinds of things.

02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.980
And I think once you have those conversations,

02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:24.580
this takes us back to the University of Austin,

02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.060
once you have those difficult human conversations,

02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:29.980
you can design the technology that will actually make

02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:32.580
for help people grow,

02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:34.260
become the best version of themselves,

02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.860
help them be happy in the long-term.

02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:41.860
What gives you hope about the future?

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:44.540
As somebody who studied some of the darker moments

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.980
of human history, what gives you hope?

02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.220
A couple of things.

02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:56.540
First of all, the United States

02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:58.900
has a very unique operating system,

02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:02.220
which was very well-designed by the founders,

02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.660
who'd thought a lot about history

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:07.900
and realized it would take quite a novel design

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:10.900
to prevent the Republic going the way of all Republics,

02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:12.900
Republics tend to end up as tyrannies

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:14.940
for reasons that were well-established

02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:16.900
by the time of the Renaissance.

02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:20.660
And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well

02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:25.540
and withstood an enormous stress test in the last year.

02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:27.540
I became an American in 2018.

02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:32.860
I think one of the most important features

02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:37.620
of this operating system is that it is the magnet for talent.

02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:43.620
Here we sit, part of the immigration story

02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:49.940
in a darkened room with funny accents.

02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:53.980
Scott in a Russian walk into a recording studio

02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:57.780
and talk about America, it's very much like a joke.

02:18:57.780 --> 02:18:59.580
And Elon's a South African and so on,

02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:00.540
and Teal is a German.

02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.580
And we're extraordinarily fortunate

02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:05.820
that the natives let us come and play.

02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:09.780
And play in a way that we could not

02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:12.060
in our countries of birth.

02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:14.380
And as long as the United States continues

02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:18.780
to exploit that superpower, that it is the talent magnet,

02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:20.780
then it should out innovate

02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:24.340
the totalitarian competition every time.

02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:29.340
So that's one reason for being an optimist.

02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.260
Another reason, and it's quite a historical reason,

02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:34.780
as you would expect from me,

02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:39.060
another reason that I'm optimistic

02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:44.060
is that my kids give me a great deal of hope.

02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:48.740
They range in age from 27 down to four,

02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:52.780
but each of them in their different way

02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:57.780
seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours

02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:03.820
without losing contact with that cultural identity

02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:08.060
and civilization that I hold dear.

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:10.060
I don't want to live in the metaverse

02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:12.660
as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.

02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:14.960
To me, that's a kind of ghastly hell.

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:21.020
I think Western civilization is the best civilization.

02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:23.940
And I think that almost all the truths

02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:26.460
about the human condition can be found

02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:32.500
in Western literature, art, and music.

02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:37.060
And I think also that the civilization

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:39.060
that produced the scientific revolution

02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.940
has produced the great problem-solving tool

02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:44.740
that eluded the other civilizations

02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:47.580
that never really cracked science.

02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:50.740
And what gives me hope is that,

02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:53.640
despite all the temptations and distractions

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.460
that their generation had to contend with,

02:20:57.460 --> 02:20:58.940
my children and their different ways

02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:03.940
have found their way to literature and to art and to music.

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:08.220
And they are civilized.

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:14.080
And I don't claim much of the credit for that.

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.180
I've done my best.

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.940
But I think it's deeply encouraging

02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:21.620
that they found their way to the things

02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:25.220
that I think are indispensable for a happy life,

02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:26.580
a fulfilled life.

02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:29.180
Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled

02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:32.140
if they're cut off from the great body

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:34.340
of Western literature, for example.

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:38.300
I've thought a lot about Elon's argument

02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:40.260
that we might be in a simulation.

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.260
No, no, there is a simulation.

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:45.020
It's called literature.

02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:49.180
And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.

02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:53.380
I'm currently in the midst of the later stages

02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:57.340
of Proust's great A L'Encheur du Temps Perdus.

02:21:57.340 --> 02:22:01.500
And Proust's observation of human relationships

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:05.720
is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.

02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:09.540
And it's impossible not to find yourself identifying

02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:14.420
with Marcel and his obsessive, jealous relationships,

02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:16.100
particularly with Albertine.

02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:18.460
It's the simulation.

02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:23.460
And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,

02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:26.980
how far to, in your own life,

02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:30.500
reenact these more profound experiences

02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:31.980
that others have written down.

02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:34.340
One of my earliest literary simulations

02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:37.460
was to reenact Jack Kerouac's trip in On the Road

02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:40.660
when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted

02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:44.820
in the hanging gardens of Zocchi Milko, not to be missed.

02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:48.740
And it hit me, just as I was reading Proust,

02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:51.180
that that's really how to live a rich life,

02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.740
that one lives life, but one lives it

02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:56.300
juxtaposing one's own experience

02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:00.420
against the more refined experiences of the great writers.

02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:03.020
So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.

02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:09.380
Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?

02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:11.740
Yes, I don't read Russian,

02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:15.540
but I was entirely obsessed with Russian literature

02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.980
as a schoolboy.

02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:21.180
I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev,

02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:24.660
Chekhov.

02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:29.740
I think of all of those writers,

02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:31.380
Tolstoy had the biggest impact

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:33.140
because at the end of War and Peace,

02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:35.820
there's this great essay on historical determinism,

02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:38.420
which I think was the reason I became a historian.

02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:44.420
But I'm really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,

02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:48.180
oddly enough.

02:23:48.180 --> 02:23:51.100
I think if you haven't read those novelists,

02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.180
I mean, you can't really be a complete human being

02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:57.780
if you haven't read the Brothers Karamazov.

02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:01.180
You're not really, you're not grown up.

02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:02.860
And so I think in many ways,

02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:06.020
those are the greatest novels.

02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:09.460
Remember Raskolnikov's nightmare

02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:12.260
at the end of Crime and Punishment,

02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:15.300
in which he imagines in his dream

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:19.420
a world in which a terrible virus spreads.

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.620
Do you remember this?

02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:22.060
And this virus has the effect

02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:24.660
of making every individual think

02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.740
that what he believes is right.

02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:31.980
And in this self-righteousness,

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:36.940
people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.

02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:38.380
That's Raskolnikov's nightmare.

02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:39.580
And it's a prophecy.

02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:43.100
It's a terrible prophecy of Russia's future.

02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:47.780
Yeah, and coupled with that is probably the,

02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:50.740
I also like the French, the existentialist, all that.

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:53.820
The full spectrum in German's Hermann Hesse

02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:57.100
and just that range of human thought

02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:58.660
as expressed in the literature is fascinating.

02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:02.460
I really love your idea that the simulation,

02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:09.540
like one way to live life is to kind of explore

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:14.940
these other worlds and borrow from them wisdom

02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:17.580
that you then just map onto your own lives.

02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:20.140
You're almost like stitched together your life

02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:22.380
with these kind of pieces from literature.

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:27.380
The highly educated person is constantly struck by illusion.

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:32.420
Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.

02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:34.900
And that is the simulation.

02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:38.260
That's what the real metaverse is.

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:42.100
It's the imaginary world that we enter when we read,

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:45.820
empathize, and then recognize in our daily lives

02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:50.100
some scrap of the shared experience that literature gives us.

02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.340
Yeah, I think I've aspired to be the idiot

02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:57.300
from Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky

02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:02.420
and in aspiring to be that, I have become the idiot,

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:04.420
I feel, at least in part.

02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:09.260
What, you mentioned the human condition,

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:12.420
does love have to do?

02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:15.100
What role does it play in the human condition?

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:16.900
Friendship, love?

02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:24.700
Love is the drug.

02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:27.260
Be kind.

02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:31.020
Love is, this was a great Roxy music line

02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:33.980
that Brian Ferry wrote,

02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:38.500
and love is the most powerful and dangerous

02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.780
of all the drugs.

02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:46.100
The driving force that overrides our reason,

02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.420
and of course, it is the primal,

02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.540
it's the primal urge.

02:26:56.540 --> 02:27:00.580
So what a civilized society has to do

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:04.180
is to prevent that drug, that primal force

02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:07.180
from creating mayhem.

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:11.460
So there have to be rules like monogamy

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:16.460
and rituals like marriage that reign love in

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.500
and make the addicts at least more or less under control.

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:29.420
And I think that's part of why I'm a romantic

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:35.340
rather than a Steve Pinker enlightenment rationalist

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:40.820
because the romantics realized that love was the drug.

02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:45.700
It's like the difference in sensibility

02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:48.700
between Handel and Wagner.

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.940
And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate

02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:57.980
and I still remember thinking that in as old as Liebes toad,

02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:02.820
that Wagner had got the closest to sex

02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:07.820
that anybody had ever got in music or perhaps to love.

02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:14.340
I'm lucky that I love my wife and that we were,

02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:21.340
by the time we met, smart enough to understand

02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:25.980
that love is a drug that you have to kind of take

02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:30.980
in certain careful ways and that it works best

02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:36.580
in the context of a stable family.

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:38.180
That's the key thing.

02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:41.500
That one has to sort of take the drug and then submit

02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:46.500
to the conventions of marriage and family life.

02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:52.340
I think in that respect, I'm a kind of tamed romantic.

02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:56.660
Tamed romantic.

02:28:56.660 --> 02:28:57.780
That's how I'd like to think of myself.

02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:01.060
And the degree to which your romanticism is tamed

02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:03.300
can be then channeled into productive work.

02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:05.540
That's why you're a historian and a writer

02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:08.020
is the rest of that love is channeled through the writing.

02:29:08.020 --> 02:29:09.740
So if you're going to be addicted to anything,

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:11.140
be addicted to work.

02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:13.580
I mean, we're all addictive,

02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:15.700
but the thing about workaholism

02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:17.740
is it is the most productive addiction

02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:22.900
and rather that than drugs or booze.

02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:27.900
So yes, I'm always trying to channel my anxieties into work.

02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:31.380
I learned that at a relatively early age,

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:34.220
it's a sort of massively productive way of coping

02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:36.620
with the inner demons.

02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:39.420
And again, we should teach kids that

02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:43.020
because let's come back to our earlier conversation

02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:43.860
about universities.

02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.180
Part of what happens at university

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:49.420
is that adolescents have to overcome all the inner demons.

02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:52.780
And these include deep insecurity

02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:55.620
about one's appearance, about one's intellect,

02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:58.260
and then madly raging hormones

02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:00.580
that cause you to behave like a complete fool

02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:03.140
with the people to whom you're sexually attracted.

02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:05.580
All of this is going on in the university.

02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:07.100
How can it be a safe space?

02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:09.940
It's a completely dangerous space by definition.

02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:13.580
So yeah, I learned teaching young people

02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:16.940
how to manage these storms, you know,

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:18.140
that's part of the job.

02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:20.820
And we're really not allowed to do that anymore

02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:22.140
because we can't talk about these things

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:24.700
for fear of the Title IX officers kicking down the door

02:30:24.700 --> 02:30:26.740
and dragging us off in chains.

02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:28.780
And like you said, hard work

02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:32.940
and something you call work ethic in civilization

02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:39.340
is a pretty effective way to achieve, I think,

02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:42.140
a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety.

02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:45.220
Or at least exhaustion, so that you sleep well.

02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:49.380
Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion too.

02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:52.660
That's why running this manual work

02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:55.380
that some part of us is built for that.

02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:56.220
Right.

02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:59.620
I mean, we are products of evolution

02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:03.580
and our adaptation to a technological world

02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:04.820
is a very imperfect one.

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:09.260
So hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:14.180
I like outdoor exercise.

02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:16.300
I don't really like gyms.

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:21.300
So I'll go for long punishing runs in woodland,

02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:24.300
hike up hills.

02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:27.940
I like swimming in lakes and in the sea

02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:32.740
because that just has to be that physical activity

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.660
in order to do the good mental work.

02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:38.900
And so it's all about trying to do the best work.

02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:42.460
That's my sense that we have

02:31:43.740 --> 02:31:45.740
some random allocation of talent.

02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:47.340
You kind of figure out what it is

02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:48.980
that you're relatively good at

02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:51.260
and you try to do that well.

02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:55.140
I think my father encouraged me to think that way.

02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:58.540
And you don't mind about being average at the other stuff.

02:31:58.540 --> 02:31:59.700
The kind of sick thing

02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:01.340
is to try to be brilliant at everything.

02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:02.780
I hate those people.

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.980
You should really not worry too much

02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:07.820
if you're just an average double bass player,

02:32:07.820 --> 02:32:10.100
which I am, or kind of average skier,

02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:12.180
which I definitely am.

02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:14.020
Doing those things okay

02:32:14.020 --> 02:32:16.700
is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life.

02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:19.060
I was not a good actor,

02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:22.820
but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:25.700
Turned out after three years of experimentation at Oxford

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:30.220
that I was broadly speaking better at writing history essays

02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:32.940
than my peers.

02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:34.340
And that was my edge.

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:35.820
That was my comparative advantage.

02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.900
And so I've just tried to make a living

02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:40.340
from that slight edge.

02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.700
Yeah, that's a beautiful way to describe a life.

02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:46.500
Is there a meaning to this thing?

02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:47.980
Is there a meaning to life?

02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:49.900
What is the meaning of life?

02:32:49.900 --> 02:32:53.500
I was brought up by a physicist and a physician.

02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.620
They were more or less committed atheists

02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:58.380
who had left the Church of Scotland

02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:02.220
as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.

02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:05.620
And so my sister and I were told from an early age

02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:07.860
that life was a cosmic accident.

02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:10.740
And that was it.

02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:13.660
There was no great meaning to it.

02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:19.860
And I can't really get past that.

02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:24.460
Isn't there beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?

02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:27.820
Yes, I wasn't taught to feel negative about that.

02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:32.380
And if anything, it was a frivolous insight.

02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:34.860
The whole thing was a kind of joke.

02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:40.460
And I think that atheism isn't really a basis

02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:45.460
for ordering a society, but it's been all right for me.

02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:51.740
I don't have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:58.460
For me, however, there's clearly some embedded

02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:03.820
Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.

02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:08.380
And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists

02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:11.540
who had kind of deposed God but carried on behaving

02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:14.300
as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.

02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:19.300
So that's kind of the state of mind that I was left in.

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:26.180
And I think that we aren't really around long enough

02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:31.980
to claim that our individual lives have meaning.

02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:35.740
But what Edmund Burke said is true.

02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:38.620
The real social contract is between the generations,

02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:41.100
between the dead, the living, and the unborn.

02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:45.700
And the meaning of life is, for me at least,

02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:48.100
to live in a way that honors the dead,

02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:50.500
seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom

02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.100
because they do still outnumber us.

02:34:52.100 --> 02:34:55.940
They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.

02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:58.700
And then to be mindful of the unborn

02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:03.620
and our responsibility to them.

02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:07.820
Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.

02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:10.740
It may or may not succeed, and probably won't succeed

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:12.220
if my books are never assigned

02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:14.540
by woke professors in the future.

02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:16.820
So what we have to do is more than just write books

02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:18.340
and record podcasts.

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.580
There have to be institutions.

02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:22.300
I'm 57 now.

02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:25.220
I realized recently that succession planning

02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:29.020
had to be the main focus of the next 20 years

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:33.020
because there are things that I really care about

02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:36.780
that I want future generations to have access to.

02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:41.140
And so the meaning of life I do regard

02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:44.300
as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:50.460
Ultimately, the species will go extinct at some point.

02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:52.300
Even if we do colonize Mars,

02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:55.100
one senses that physics will catch up

02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:56.860
with this particular organism,

02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:59.860
but it's in the pretty far distant future.

02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:01.820
And so the meaning of life is to make sure

02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:05.020
that for as long as there are human beings,

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:10.020
they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives,

02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:14.380
ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,

02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:16.340
emotionally fulfilled lives

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:19.140
that civilization has made possible.

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:21.300
It would be easy for us to revert

02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:24.540
to the uncivilized world.

02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:29.540
There's a fantastic book that I'm going to misremember,

02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:35.020
Milos' The Captive Mind, which has a fantastic passage.

02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:43.060
He was a Polish intellectual who says,

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:46.060
Americans can never imagine what it's like

02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:49.380
for civilization to be completely destroyed

02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:52.620
as it was in Poland by the end of World War II,

02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:54.300
to have no rule of law,

02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:56.820
to have no security of even person,

02:36:56.820 --> 02:36:58.220
nevermind property rights.

02:36:58.220 --> 02:36:59.860
They can't imagine what that's like

02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:01.540
and what it will lead you to do.

02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:04.620
So one reason for teaching history

02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:09.620
is to remind the lucky Generation Z members of California

02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:15.860
that civilization is a thin film.

02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:18.700
And it can be destroyed remarkably easily.

02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:20.260
And to preserve civilization

02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:23.660
is a tremendous responsibility that we have.

02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:25.900
It's a huge responsibility.

02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:28.340
And we must not destroy ourselves,

02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:31.020
whether it's in the name of wokeism

02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:33.740
or the pursuit of the metaverse.

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:36.140
Preserving civilization and making it available,

02:37:36.140 --> 02:37:37.060
not just to our kids,

02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:40.260
but to people we'll never know generations ahead,

02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:41.260
that's the meaning.

02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:46.620
And do so by studying the lessons of history.

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:50.620
Right, not only studying them, but then acting on them.

02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:52.180
For me, the biggest problem is

02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:55.180
how do we apply history more effectively?

02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:58.500
It seems as if our institutions, including government,

02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:01.660
are very, very bad at applying history.

02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:04.460
Lessons of history are learned poorly if at all,

02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:06.220
analogies are drawn crudely,

02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:08.460
often the wrong inferences are drawn.

02:38:08.460 --> 02:38:10.260
One of the big intellectual challenges for me

02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:14.100
is how to make history more useful.

02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:17.020
And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,

02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.740
but really practically useful

02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:21.820
so that policymakers and citizens

02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.980
can think about the decisions that they face

02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:28.980
with a more historically informed body of knowledge,

02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:31.740
whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,

02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:33.540
what to do about Taiwan.

02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:38.540
I can't think of a better set of things to know

02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:41.060
before you make decisions about those things

02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:43.380
than the things that history has to offer.

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.500
Well, I love the discipline of applied history,

02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:47.660
basically going to history and saying,

02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:52.020
what are the key principles here

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.660
that are applicable to the problems of today?

02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:55.860
And how can we solve that?

02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:59.260
The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood,

02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:02.980
said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,

02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:05.020
that the purpose of history

02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:08.660
was to reconstitute past thought

02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:12.140
from whatever surviving remnants there were,

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:16.180
and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.

02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:18.980
And that's that juxtaposition of past experience

02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:21.420
with present experience that is so important.

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:23.740
We don't do that well.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:25.740
And indeed, we've flipped it

02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:28.180
so that academic historians now think their mission

02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:30.500
is to travel back to the past

02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:33.100
with the value system of 2021

02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:37.900
and castigate the dead for their racism and sexism

02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:40.100
and transphobia and whatnot.

02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:42.140
And that's exactly wrong.

02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:43.940
Our mission is to go back and try to understand

02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:46.580
what it was like to live in the 18th century,

02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:50.740
not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.

02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:52.860
And once we've had a better understanding,

02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:55.300
once we've seen into their lives, read their words,

02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:57.140
tried to reconstitute their experience,

02:39:57.140 --> 02:40:00.380
to come back and understand our own time better,

02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:01.980
that's what we should really be doing.

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:04.140
But academic history has gone completely haywire,

02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:05.780
and it does almost the exact opposite

02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:07.580
of what I think it should do.

02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:11.900
And by studying history, walk beautifully, gracefully

02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:14.460
through this simulation, as you described,

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:17.820
by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.

02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:20.580
We have virtual reality already in our heads.

02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:24.460
We do not need Oculus in the metaverse.

02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:27.100
This was an incredible, hopeful conversation

02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:29.580
in many ways that I did not expect.

02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.900
I thought our conversation would be much more about history

02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:35.100
than about the future, and it turned out to be the opposite.

02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:36.380
Thank you so much for talking today.

02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.740
It's a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.

02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:40.660
Thank you for your valuable time.

02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:43.500
Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.220
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:46.500
with Neil Ferguson.

And now, let me leave you with some words

02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.740
from Neil Ferguson himself.

02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:57.900
No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear

02:40:57.900 --> 02:41:00.460
to itself, is indestructible.

02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:05.300
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
