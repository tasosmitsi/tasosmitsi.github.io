00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
I would run outside and just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way, beautiful, right

00:07.400 --> 00:09.160
up there.

00:09.160 --> 00:14.320
And I would just lay there like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
through my brain.

00:15.320 --> 00:21.260
And this is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it, I belong here, rather

00:21.260 --> 00:22.680
than feeling kind of small.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.160
Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things and lots of small things make one big

00:27.320 --> 00:35.640
The following is a conversation with Anna Ferbell, an astrophysicist at MIT, studying

00:35.640 --> 00:40.840
the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical

00:40.840 --> 00:48.000
conditions of the early universe and how from that our galaxy formed and evolved to what

00:48.000 --> 00:52.440
it is today, the place we humans call home.

00:52.440 --> 00:57.040
This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description

00:57.640 --> 01:02.440
And now, dear friends, here's Anna Ferbell.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.040
Let's go back to the early days.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.560
What did the formation of the Milky Way galaxy look like?

01:07.560 --> 01:10.120
Or maybe we want to start even before that.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.080
What did the formation of the universe look like?

01:13.080 --> 01:19.200
Well, we scientists believe that was the Big Bang, some big beginning.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.400
But what is important for my work, and I think that's what we're going to talk about, is

01:24.400 --> 01:27.520
what kind of elements were present at that time.

01:27.520 --> 01:33.040
So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen and helium and tiny

01:33.040 --> 01:36.200
little sprinkles of lithium.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.980
And that was pretty much it.

01:38.980 --> 01:44.840
As it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from that.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.960
That's fairly hot gas.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.880
So the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were very massive stars,

01:54.880 --> 01:58.760
big stars, 100 times the mass of the sun.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
And they were made from just hydrogen and helium.

02:01.240 --> 02:05.760
So big stars explode pretty fast after a few million years only.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.840
That's very short on cosmic timescales.

02:08.840 --> 02:14.400
And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier elements to the universe because

02:14.400 --> 02:21.440
in their cores, all stars fuse lighter elements like hydrogen and helium into heavier ones.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.880
And then that goes all the way up to iron.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.960
And then all that material gets ejected in these massive supernova explosions.

02:28.960 --> 02:36.120
And that marked a really, really important transition in the universe because after that

02:36.120 --> 02:42.080
first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.960
And that set the stage for everything else to happen, including us here talking today.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.960
So what do you mean by pristine?

02:48.960 --> 02:56.360
So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen, helium, and

02:56.360 --> 02:57.840
a little bit of lithium.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.840
Yeah.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.120
So after the Big Bang, just hydrogen and helium, we don't really need to talk too much about

03:03.120 --> 03:06.800
lithium because the amount was so small.

03:06.800 --> 03:14.840
And after these very first stars formed and exploded, heavy elements like carbon, oxygen,

03:14.840 --> 03:22.720
magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly present in the gas clouds in tiny amounts

03:22.720 --> 03:25.640
only, very tiny amounts.

03:25.640 --> 03:31.720
And that actually helped, especially the carbon and the oxygen, to make the gas cool.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.820
These atoms are more complicated than hydrogen.

03:34.820 --> 03:35.820
That's just a proton.

03:35.820 --> 03:40.300
So it has cooling properties, can send out photons outside of the gas cloud so the gas

03:40.300 --> 03:41.440
can cool.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.620
And when you have gas that gets colder and colder, you can make smaller and smaller stars.

03:45.620 --> 03:50.540
So you can fragment it and clump it and turn it into stars like the sun.

03:50.540 --> 03:55.220
And the cool thing about that is that when you have small stars like the sun, they have

03:55.220 --> 03:57.380
a really long lifetime.

03:57.380 --> 04:02.700
So those first low mass stars that formed back then are still observable today.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.900
That is actually what I do.

04:03.900 --> 04:09.960
I try to find these early survivors because they tell us what the gas looked like back

04:09.960 --> 04:10.960
then.

04:10.960 --> 04:16.720
They have preserved that composition of these early gas clouds, the chemical compositions

04:16.720 --> 04:18.200
until today.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.760
So I don't need to look very far into the universe to study all the beginnings.

04:24.760 --> 04:32.400
I can just chemically analyze the oldest stars and it's like unpacking everything that happened

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
back then.

04:33.900 --> 04:39.960
So to just reiterate, so in the very early days, in the first few million years, there

04:39.960 --> 04:44.760
was giant stars that's mostly hydrogen and helium and then they exploded in these supernova

04:44.760 --> 04:54.680
explosions and then they made these clumps, non-pristine clumps.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.020
So it took a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then they exploded

04:59.020 --> 05:02.000
after a few million years, kaboom.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.420
And then it's like, I always consider the universe like a nice soup and then these first

05:09.420 --> 05:14.940
supernova explosions kind of provided the salt, just a little sprinkle of heavier elements

05:14.940 --> 05:20.020
and that made it really tasty, just changed it completely, right?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.900
And that changed the physics of the gas.

05:22.900 --> 05:29.860
So that meant that these gas clouds that were surrounding the former first stars, they

05:29.860 --> 05:35.360
could now cool down and clump and form the next generation of stars that now included

05:35.360 --> 05:38.060
also little stars.

05:38.060 --> 05:42.960
And as I just mentioned, the small stars have these really long lifetimes.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.980
The Sun has a lifetime of 10 billion years.

05:45.980 --> 05:50.500
Any star that is even less massive will have an even longer lifetime.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.640
So that gives us a chance to still observe some of the stars that formed back then.

05:55.640 --> 06:00.540
So we are testing the conditions, the chemical and physical conditions of the early universe

06:00.540 --> 06:03.260
even before the galaxy formed.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.300
So what's the timeline that we're talking about?

06:05.300 --> 06:09.660
What is the age of the universe and what is the earliest time we got those salty delicious

06:09.660 --> 06:13.860
soup, clump soups with heavier elements?

06:13.860 --> 06:16.260
Well the universe is 13.8 billion years old.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.260
Allegedly, yeah.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.260
Is it?

06:18.260 --> 06:19.260
Yes.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.260
Okay.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.100
When I was in high school, the universe was 20 billion years old.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.100
Oh yeah?

06:25.100 --> 06:26.100
So the estimate...

06:26.100 --> 06:27.100
Things have changed.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.220
Do you think that estimate will evolve in interesting ways or no?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.220
Is it pretty stable at this point?

06:30.220 --> 06:34.860
I think we have mostly converged, yes, because the techniques are very different now, much

06:34.860 --> 06:36.260
more precise.

06:36.260 --> 06:41.220
The whole business of precision cosmology by mapping out the cosmic microwave background,

06:41.220 --> 06:45.700
you know, that's a marvelous feat.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.820
Maybe the digits will still move around a little bit, but that's all right.

06:50.380 --> 06:55.100
The gravitational waves and all that, so all the different sources of data, kind of mapping

06:55.100 --> 06:57.500
out this detailed picture of the early universe.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
Totally.

06:58.500 --> 07:03.700
And so we think the earliest little stars formed, I don't know, maybe half a billion

07:03.700 --> 07:05.340
years after the Big Bang, right?

07:05.340 --> 07:09.700
Again, a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then, you know,

07:09.700 --> 07:14.620
took some time, so give or take half a billion years.

07:15.260 --> 07:22.460
That was the time when sort of the very first proto-galaxies formed, early stellar structures,

07:22.460 --> 07:27.260
stellar systems, from which the microwave eventually formed, right?

07:27.260 --> 07:33.620
The microwave was probably a slightly bigger one, and we know today that galaxies grow

07:33.620 --> 07:37.740
hierarchically, which means they eat their smaller neighbors, so if you're the bigger

07:37.740 --> 07:45.540
one and have a few friends around, you're just going to eat them, absorb them, and then

07:45.540 --> 07:48.100
you grow bigger.

07:48.100 --> 07:54.980
So all these little early stars kind of came into the Milky Way through that kind of process,

07:54.980 --> 07:59.380
and that's why we find them in the outer parts of the galaxy today, because they're just

07:59.380 --> 08:02.660
kind of deaf and just left there since.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.700
So the old stuff is on the outskirts of the galaxy, and the new stuff is closer to the

08:06.700 --> 08:07.700
middle?

08:07.700 --> 08:08.700
Roughly speaking.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.700
Okay.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.700
Yes.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.700
So that's where you would look for it.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.260
So maybe just to step back, what is a galaxy, what is a proto-galaxy?

08:15.260 --> 08:16.420
I love that question.

08:16.420 --> 08:23.540
So the galaxy is a huge assembly of stars.

08:23.540 --> 08:30.300
The Milky Way contains something like 200 to 400 billion stars, and most of the material

08:30.300 --> 08:36.700
and the stars are in the disk, and when we look at the night sky, what we see as the

08:36.740 --> 08:45.540
Milky Way band on the sky, that is actually the next inner spiral arm, because we actually

08:45.540 --> 08:52.420
live in a spiral disk galaxy, so the Milky Way is a spiral disk galaxy, and we're looking

08:52.420 --> 08:57.220
– actually, it depends a little bit – in the Northern Hemisphere, we're looking out

08:57.220 --> 09:03.060
of the galaxy, so we're seeing the next outer spiral arm.

09:03.180 --> 09:08.780
As you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that, so we don't see it all that

09:08.780 --> 09:14.820
nice on the sky, but if you travel to the Southern Hemisphere, let's say South America,

09:14.820 --> 09:19.260
you see the Milky Way, and it looks so different on the sky, because that's the next inner

09:19.260 --> 09:23.620
spiral arm, and that's backlit by the galactic center.

09:23.620 --> 09:31.940
The galactic center is a very big, puffy region of gas, there's a lot of star formation.

09:31.940 --> 09:35.740
The galactic party is happening there, so it's very bright, and it makes for this

09:35.740 --> 09:41.340
very beautiful Milky Way on the night sky that we see, so actually, if you ever get

09:41.340 --> 09:47.100
the chance to experience that, I encourage you to almost close your eyes while seeing

09:47.100 --> 09:51.940
this and imagining that you're sitting in this kind of disk, in this pancake, and you're

09:51.940 --> 09:59.020
just kind of looking right into it, and you can really feel that we're in this 2D disk,

09:59.020 --> 10:02.580
and then you can imagine that there's a top and a bottom, and that we're really part

10:02.580 --> 10:08.620
of the galaxy, you can really experience that, we're just not just lost in space somewhere,

10:08.620 --> 10:12.860
but we're really a part of it, and knowing a little bit about the structure of the Milky

10:12.860 --> 10:13.860
Way really helps.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.100
Do you feel small when you think about that?

10:17.100 --> 10:21.300
When you look on the spiral on the inside of the Milky Way, and then you look out to

10:21.300 --> 10:25.220
the outside, how are we supposed to feel?

10:25.220 --> 10:28.900
I don't know, I don't feel small necessarily.

10:28.900 --> 10:34.660
I feel in awe, and I feel I'm a part of it, because I can really feel that I'm a part

10:34.660 --> 10:36.420
of it.

10:36.420 --> 10:40.620
I think for many people, they think like, oh, there's just the planet, and then there's

10:40.620 --> 10:48.020
nothing, and that's almost a little bit sad, but that's really not the case, right?

10:48.020 --> 10:52.820
Because there's so much more, and I really like to imagine, wow, I'm sitting in this

10:52.820 --> 10:57.860
big galactic merry-go-round, and we're going around the center, and I can see the center

10:57.900 --> 10:58.900
above me, right?

10:58.900 --> 11:03.180
And I can almost feel like we're going there.

11:03.180 --> 11:09.460
Of course, we can't really feel that, but the sun does circle the galactic center.

11:09.460 --> 11:14.860
But there's a kind of sadness to looking pictures of a nice vacation place.

11:14.860 --> 11:19.740
All we get is that light, an old light.

11:19.740 --> 11:25.500
Do you feel sad that we don't get to travel, or you and I will not get to travel there,

11:25.500 --> 11:27.780
and maybe humans will never get to travel there?

11:28.020 --> 11:33.660
I always wanted to travel into space and see the Earth and other things from up there.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.780
There's certainly that, but I don't know.

11:37.780 --> 11:44.020
It's also okay to just be at our vantage point and see it from here.

11:44.020 --> 11:47.900
With the sensors, with the telescopes that we have, and explore the possibilities.

11:47.900 --> 11:52.580
There is a kind of wonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting

11:52.580 --> 11:54.780
things that we can't possibly imagine.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.580
There could be all kinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff.

11:58.580 --> 12:04.540
I tend to believe that, it depends on the day, I tend to believe there's just a lot

12:04.540 --> 12:09.380
of very primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they build their little things

12:09.380 --> 12:13.540
like bacteria-type organisms.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.500
Just to think what kind of worlds there are, because they're probably really creative

12:16.500 --> 12:19.500
living organisms.

12:19.500 --> 12:24.420
I guess the question I'm wondering to myself when I look out there to the stars, how different

12:24.420 --> 12:27.660
are the conditions on the different planets that orbit those stars?

12:27.660 --> 12:30.060
It will definitely be very different.

12:30.060 --> 12:33.660
The variety out there is huge.

12:33.660 --> 12:41.780
We know now that, I think, it's about every other star has at least one planet.

12:41.780 --> 12:48.820
I already mentioned the number of stars in the galaxy, it's a huge number of planets

12:48.820 --> 12:50.420
out there.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.180
Who knows what that looks like?

12:52.180 --> 12:56.020
All we know is that there is a lot of variety.

12:56.020 --> 13:02.420
We don't quite yet understand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.980
Why is it not all one size fits all?

13:04.980 --> 13:09.860
You mean the dynamics of planet formation, like exoplanet formation, or star formation,

13:09.860 --> 13:10.860
the whole survey?

13:10.860 --> 13:12.540
All of it, all of it.

13:12.540 --> 13:17.060
Star formation remains a much researched topic.

13:17.060 --> 13:21.620
We definitely know that it works, because all the stars are there.

13:21.620 --> 13:29.060
They come for the planets, but the details are so varied per gas cloud, right?

13:29.060 --> 13:33.900
It's very hard to come up with very detailed prescriptions.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.360
Broadly, we have figured it out.

13:35.360 --> 13:40.900
You need a gas cloud, you need to cool it, something clumps and fragments, and somehow

13:40.900 --> 13:44.340
it makes a star with planets or without.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.180
But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood.

13:47.180 --> 13:48.660
No, no.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.340
The local conditions are so varied, right?

13:51.340 --> 13:56.240
I mean, it's the same with, you know, all people look like people, but individually

13:56.240 --> 13:57.620
we look very different.

13:57.620 --> 14:02.300
So even the subtle diversity of the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.300
Yes.

14:03.300 --> 14:09.100
So we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case, and it's kind of hard

14:09.100 --> 14:14.420
to figure it all out and to take a look, certainly with planets, right?

14:14.420 --> 14:20.980
The chance to ever actually take a picture of a planet is minuscule, because they don't

14:20.980 --> 14:23.260
shine, so they're really dark.

14:23.260 --> 14:29.860
So I'd say there's a lot of possibility out there, but we have to be a little bit more

14:29.860 --> 14:31.740
patient before we...

14:31.740 --> 14:38.380
Or come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary by extending our lifetimes

14:38.380 --> 14:42.980
or increasing the speed of space travel, all that kind of stuff.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.740
Those are pretty intelligent.

14:44.740 --> 14:45.740
Sometimes, yeah.

14:45.740 --> 14:52.180
For the most part, I hope, when I'm on the optimistic days.

14:52.180 --> 14:58.740
Well, maybe just to linger on what a galaxy is.

14:58.740 --> 15:02.540
What should we know about our understanding of black holes in the formation?

15:02.540 --> 15:07.060
Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy?

15:07.060 --> 15:11.620
So all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand?

15:11.620 --> 15:13.540
All of the above.

15:13.540 --> 15:17.460
That's what makes astronomy really hard, but also really interesting, right?

15:17.460 --> 15:21.020
No day is like another, because we always find something new.

15:21.020 --> 15:26.860
I want to come back to the idea of the proto-galaxy, because it actually matches or relates to

15:26.860 --> 15:28.480
the black hole formation.

15:28.480 --> 15:37.140
So pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, and we don't really

15:37.140 --> 15:38.620
know where they come from.

15:38.620 --> 15:41.180
Again, we know that they are there.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.020
But how do we get there?

15:43.020 --> 15:46.220
So we go back to the early universe, right?

15:46.220 --> 15:54.220
We had a little galaxy that just sort of, I don't know, had some small number of stars.

15:54.220 --> 16:00.220
It was the first gravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter, because

16:00.220 --> 16:06.780
dark matter actually kind of structured up first before the luminous matter could, because

16:06.780 --> 16:08.740
that's what dark matter kind of does.

16:08.740 --> 16:16.820
And it started to hold gas and then stars sort of together in these first very shallow,

16:16.820 --> 16:21.100
what we call potential wells, so these gravitationally bound systems.

16:21.100 --> 16:27.260
And then the Milky Way grew from absorbing neighboring smaller, even smaller systems.

16:27.260 --> 16:34.980
And somewhere in that process, there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive

16:34.980 --> 16:35.980
black holes.

16:36.140 --> 16:42.300
I'm not actually sure that it's clear right now kind of what was there first, the supermassive

16:42.300 --> 16:45.540
black hole or the galaxy.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.860
So lots of people are trying to study that.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.780
And of course, the black hole wasn't as massive back then as it is these days.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.180
But it's a big area of research.

16:56.180 --> 17:04.780
And the new James Webb, the JWST, the infrared telescope in space, is working on, many people

17:04.860 --> 17:10.220
are working on that to figure out exactly what happened.

17:10.220 --> 17:15.060
And there are some surprising results that we really don't understand right now.

17:15.060 --> 17:20.460
So to solve the chicken or the egg problem of, do you need the supermassive black hole

17:20.460 --> 17:24.380
to form a galaxy or does the galaxy naturally create the supermassive black hole?

17:24.380 --> 17:25.380
Yeah.

17:25.380 --> 17:29.740
I mean, I think to some degree we can answer that because there are lots of little dwarf

17:29.740 --> 17:31.980
galaxies out there.

17:31.980 --> 17:37.860
The Milky Way remains surrounded by many dozens of small dwarf galaxies.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.620
I have studied a bunch of them.

17:40.620 --> 17:44.620
And to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain black holes.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.820
So there certainly were gravitationally bound structures.

17:47.820 --> 17:52.780
So either you can call them proto-galaxies or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.740
They were definitely there.

17:54.740 --> 18:01.300
But there must have been bigger things like the proto-Milky Way where something was different.

18:01.300 --> 18:06.980
It made them more massive so that they would gravitationally attract these smaller systems

18:06.980 --> 18:09.580
to integrate them.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.220
So we'll have to see.

18:11.220 --> 18:18.020
How do we look into that, into the dynamics of the formation, the evolution of the proto-galaxies?

18:18.020 --> 18:19.020
Is it possible?

18:19.020 --> 18:20.020
Do they shine?

18:20.020 --> 18:24.260
I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at?

18:24.260 --> 18:31.180
So we've got gravitational waves, which is really insane that we can even detect those.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.060
There's light.

18:33.060 --> 18:34.220
What else can we...

18:34.220 --> 18:38.580
So that would fall into the category of observational cosmology.

18:38.580 --> 18:47.220
And the JWST is the prime telescope right now and it promises big, big steps forward.

18:47.220 --> 18:53.220
This is in its early days because it's only been online like a year or so.

18:53.220 --> 19:01.260
But that collects the infrared light from the farthest, like literally proto-galaxies,

19:01.260 --> 19:02.820
earliest galaxies.

19:02.820 --> 19:06.500
That light has traveled some 13 billion years to us.

19:06.500 --> 19:11.020
And they're observing these faint little blobs.

19:11.020 --> 19:17.460
And folks are trying to, again, study the onset of these early supermassive black holes,

19:17.460 --> 19:18.940
how they shape galaxies.

19:18.940 --> 19:24.860
So they're seeing that they were there, you know, surrounded by already bigger galaxies.

19:24.860 --> 19:29.700
Ideally, I'd like for my colleagues to push a little bit further, hopefully that will

19:29.700 --> 19:30.700
eventually happen.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.460
In terms of looking towards the older and older ones?

19:33.460 --> 19:37.660
Yeah, more and more sort of primitive in terms of the structure.

19:37.660 --> 19:42.300
But of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system smaller and smaller, it becomes

19:42.300 --> 19:45.720
dimmer and dimmer and it's further and further away.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.900
So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical perspective pretty quickly.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.960
But it's dimmer and dimmer means older and older.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.560
Yes, in a sense, because it all started really small.

19:57.560 --> 20:01.040
Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older.

20:01.040 --> 20:05.880
In that phase of the universe, it would, otherwise it doesn't.

20:05.880 --> 20:12.680
Just to take a small attention about black holes, because you do quite a bit of observational

20:12.680 --> 20:19.920
cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.600
What's the difference to you between theoretical physics and experimental?

20:23.600 --> 20:29.080
So there's a lot of really interesting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all

20:29.080 --> 20:34.000
this kind of stuff, about black holes destroying information.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.460
Do those worlds intermix to you, especially when you step away from your work and kind

20:38.460 --> 20:41.040
of think about the mystery of it all?

20:41.400 --> 20:45.480
Well, at first glance, there isn't actually much crosstalk.

20:45.480 --> 20:53.160
Personally, I mostly observe stars, so I don't usually actually think too much about black

20:53.160 --> 20:54.160
holes.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.080
And stars is a fundamentally kind of chemical physical phenomena that doesn't...

20:58.080 --> 20:59.080
That's right.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.080
The physics is kind of different.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
It's not extreme.

21:01.080 --> 21:06.400
I mean, you know, you could consider a nuclear fusion sort of be perhaps extreme, you need

21:06.400 --> 21:07.400
to tunnel.

21:08.400 --> 21:14.200
There's some interesting physics there, but it's just a different flavor, and I don't

21:14.200 --> 21:19.680
do these kinds of calculations myself either.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.920
I very much like to talk with my theory colleagues about these things, though, because I find

21:23.920 --> 21:29.840
there's always an interesting intersection, and often it's just...

21:29.840 --> 21:37.040
I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do simulations about galaxies, and so

21:37.440 --> 21:42.640
they're not quite as far removed as, let's say, the black hole pen and paper folks.

21:42.640 --> 21:48.320
But even in those cases, we had the same interest in the same topics, but it was almost like

21:48.320 --> 21:52.880
we're speaking two different languages, and we weren't even that far removed, both astronomers

21:52.880 --> 21:54.960
and all.

21:54.960 --> 22:02.440
And it was really interesting just to take the time and really try to talk to each other.

22:02.440 --> 22:08.920
And it's amazing how hard that is.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.360
Even amongst scientists, we already have trouble talking to each other.

22:12.360 --> 22:18.840
Imagine how hard it is to talk to non-scientists and other people to try to...

22:18.840 --> 22:22.100
We're all interested in the same things as humans at the end of the day, right?

22:22.100 --> 22:27.040
But everyone has sort of a different angle about it and different questions and way of

22:27.040 --> 22:33.640
formulating things, and sometimes it really takes a while to converge and to get to the

22:33.640 --> 22:34.640
common ground.

22:34.640 --> 22:39.520
But if you take the time, it's so interesting to participate in that process, and it feels

22:39.520 --> 22:43.160
so good in the end to say like, yes, we tackled this together, right?

22:43.160 --> 22:48.560
We overcame our differences, not so much in opinion, but just in expressing ourselves

22:48.560 --> 22:51.920
about this and how we go about solving a problem.

22:51.920 --> 22:56.640
And these were some of my most successful papers, and I certainly enjoyed them the most.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.400
It can also lead to big discoveries.

22:58.400 --> 23:03.360
I mean, I think you put it really well in saying that we're all kind of studying the

23:03.360 --> 23:05.280
same kind of mysteries and problems.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.600
I mean, I see this in the space of artificial intelligence.

23:08.600 --> 23:14.480
You have a community, maybe it seems very far away, artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.800
You would think that they're studying very different things, but one is trying to engineer

23:17.800 --> 23:25.640
intelligence and in so doing try to understand intelligence, and the other is trying to understand

23:25.640 --> 23:28.280
intelligence and cognition in the human mind.

23:28.280 --> 23:32.080
And they're just doing it from a different set of data, a different set of backgrounds

23:32.080 --> 23:33.880
and the researchers that do that kind of work.

23:33.880 --> 23:41.520
And probably the same is true in observational cosmology and simulation.

23:41.520 --> 23:47.560
So it's like a fundamentally different approach to understanding the universe.

23:47.560 --> 23:53.480
Let me use for simulation, let me use the things I know to create a bunch of parameters

23:53.480 --> 23:56.440
and create some, just play with it.

23:56.440 --> 24:02.760
Play with the universe, play God, create a bunch of universes and see in a way that matches

24:02.760 --> 24:03.760
experimental data.

24:03.760 --> 24:11.600
It's a fun, it's like playing Sims, but at the cosmic level, and then probably the set

24:11.600 --> 24:15.480
of terminology used there is very different and maybe you're allowed to break the rules

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
a little bit more.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.000
Let's have, yeah, it's like the Drake equation, yeah, you don't really know, you kind of come

24:21.000 --> 24:23.360
up with a bunch of values here and there.

24:23.360 --> 24:28.000
And just see how it evolves and from that kind of intuit the different possibilities,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.200
the dynamics of the evolution of a galaxy, for example.

24:31.200 --> 24:36.560
Yeah, but it's cool to play between those two because it seems like we understand so

24:36.560 --> 24:38.640
little about our cosmos.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.640
So it's good to play.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.640
Yes.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.360
It's like a big sandbox, right?

24:42.360 --> 24:46.760
And everyone kind of has their little corner, they do things, but we're all in the same

24:46.760 --> 24:49.360
sandbox together at the end of the day.

24:49.600 --> 24:56.160
And that sandbox does have super powerful and super expensive telescopes.

24:56.160 --> 25:00.720
All the children are fighting for the resources to make sure they get to ask the right questions

25:00.720 --> 25:03.000
using that big cool tool.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.960
Well, can we actually step back on the big field of stellar archaeology?

25:09.960 --> 25:10.960
What is this process?

25:10.960 --> 25:11.960
Can you just speak to it again?

25:11.960 --> 25:16.800
You've been speaking to it, but what is this process of archaeology in the cosmos?

25:16.800 --> 25:19.360
Yeah, it's really fascinating.

25:19.360 --> 25:27.640
So I mentioned the lesser the mass of the star, the longer it lives.

25:27.640 --> 25:33.320
And again, for reference, for the next dinner party, the Sun's lifetime is 10 billion years.

25:33.320 --> 25:40.920
So if you have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar masses, then its lifetime is going to be 15

25:40.920 --> 25:42.920
to 20 billion years.

25:42.920 --> 25:48.320
And that's an important range for our conversation, because again, if you assume that such a small

25:48.320 --> 25:53.240
star formed soon after the Big Bang, then it is still observable today.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.120
You mentioned old light before.

25:55.120 --> 26:00.280
Yeah, that light is like a few thousand years old, but compared to the age of these stars

26:00.280 --> 26:02.080
is nothing.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.920
So to me, that's young.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.640
Comes straight from our galaxy.

26:09.640 --> 26:14.120
These stars are not far away, they're in our galaxy in the outskirts.

26:14.120 --> 26:21.560
They probably did not form in the galaxy, because again, the hierarchical assembly

26:21.560 --> 26:27.600
of a Milky Way meant exactly, they formed in a little other galaxy in the vicinity.

26:27.600 --> 26:32.240
And at some point, the Milky Way ate that, which means it absorbed all the stars, including

26:32.240 --> 26:35.880
these little old stars that are now in the outskirts of the Milky Way that I used to

26:35.880 --> 26:38.200
point my telescope to.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.640
So what can we learn from these stars?

26:41.640 --> 26:42.640
Why should we study them?

26:42.640 --> 26:48.680
Now, these little stars are really, really efficient with their energy consumption.

26:48.680 --> 26:53.280
They're still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to helium in their cores,

26:53.280 --> 26:58.800
and they have done so for the past 12, 13 billion years, however old they are.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.960
And they're going to keep doing that for another few billion years, same as the sun, the same

27:02.960 --> 27:07.800
sun also just does hydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while.

27:07.800 --> 27:15.520
Which means the outer parts of the star, well, pretty much actually most of the star, that

27:15.520 --> 27:19.180
gas doesn't talk to the core.

27:19.180 --> 27:28.640
So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas

27:28.640 --> 27:36.520
composition from which the star formed, which means it has perfectly preserved that information

27:36.520 --> 27:42.080
from way back then all the way to today and going forward.

27:42.080 --> 27:49.280
So I'm a stellar archaeologist because I don't dig in the dirt to find remnants of past civilizations

27:49.280 --> 27:51.640
and whatnot.

27:51.640 --> 27:57.840
I dig for the old stars in the sky because they have preserved that information from

27:57.840 --> 28:05.840
those first billion years in their outer stellar atmosphere, which is what I'm observing with

28:05.840 --> 28:06.840
telescopes.

28:06.840 --> 28:12.840
So I'm getting the best look at the chemical composition early on that you could possibly

28:12.840 --> 28:13.960
wish for.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.960
What kind of age are we talking about here?

28:15.960 --> 28:22.000
Are we talking about something that's close to that, you know, like a 13 billion, 12,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
13 billion age range?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
That's what we think.

28:25.000 --> 28:34.600
Now, as a small caveat here, we can not accurately date these stars, but we use a trick to say,

28:35.280 --> 28:39.960
these stars must have formed as some of the earliest generations of stars because we need

28:39.960 --> 28:44.560
to talk about the chemical evolution of the universe in the Milky Way for a second.

28:44.560 --> 28:51.600
So I already mentioned the pristineness of the universe after the Big Bang, right?

28:51.600 --> 28:53.160
Just hydrogen and helium.

28:53.160 --> 28:59.200
Then the first stars formed, they produced a sprinkle of heavier elements up to iron.

28:59.200 --> 29:04.440
Then the next generation of stars formed, that included again massive stars that they

29:04.440 --> 29:10.400
would explode again, but also the little ones that keep on living, right?

29:10.400 --> 29:14.880
And then the massive ones again explode as supernova, so they provide again another sprinkle

29:14.880 --> 29:16.920
of heavier elements.

29:16.920 --> 29:21.760
And so over time, all the elements in the periodic table have been built up.

29:21.760 --> 29:27.640
There have been other processes, for example, neutron star mergers and other exotic supernovae

29:27.640 --> 29:32.720
that have provided elements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium from very

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
early on.

29:33.720 --> 29:42.080
We're still trying to figure out those details, but I always say pretty much all the elements

29:42.080 --> 29:44.120
were done from like day three.

29:44.120 --> 29:50.160
So iron is where, like once you get to iron, you got all the fun you need, most of the

29:50.160 --> 29:51.160
fun.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
Yes, I know.

29:52.680 --> 29:58.800
I really like the heavier elements, you know, gold, silver, platinum, that kind of stuff.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.880
For personal reasons or for star formation?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.880
Well, both.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.680
What's the importance of these heavier metals in the evolution of the stars?

30:08.680 --> 30:13.060
So they're the spice of life, right?

30:13.060 --> 30:17.040
So every supernova gives you elements up to iron.

30:17.040 --> 30:22.480
That's cool, but at some point it gets a little bit boring because that always works.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.480
But that's the baseline.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.640
We need that.

30:25.640 --> 30:30.360
And that's certainly what came out of the first stars and then all the other supernova

30:30.360 --> 30:32.880
explosions that, you know, followed with every generation.

30:32.880 --> 30:38.280
And it took about a thousand generations, give or take, until the sun was made.

30:38.280 --> 30:44.120
So the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by roughly a thousand generations

30:44.120 --> 30:46.820
of supernova explosions.

30:46.820 --> 30:51.840
And that's where the sun has the chemical composition that it has, including, you know,

30:51.840 --> 30:54.980
and somehow the planets were made from that as well.

30:54.980 --> 30:59.700
So the supernova explosions, the many generations are creating more and more complex elements.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.580
No, it just goes all the way up to iron.

31:03.580 --> 31:07.100
And then it's a little bit more of all of these elements.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.100
Just more.

31:08.100 --> 31:12.440
Yeah, it's one sprinkle, then another, and it just kind of adds up, right?

31:12.440 --> 31:14.940
Now the heavy elements form in very different ways.

31:15.260 --> 31:17.060
They are not fusion-made.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.340
They are made typically through neutron capture processes.

31:20.340 --> 31:26.040
But for that you need seed nuclei, ideally, you know, iron or carbon or something.

31:26.040 --> 31:31.340
So the supernova-made elements are very good seed nuclei for other processes that then

31:31.340 --> 31:33.100
create heavy elements.

31:33.100 --> 31:38.900
And because they cannot be made everywhere, they, when you, when, you know, so I, my,

31:38.900 --> 31:42.940
some of my stars have huge amounts of these heavy elements in them.

31:42.940 --> 31:48.900
And they tell us in much more detail, something really interesting happened somewhere.

31:48.900 --> 31:53.260
Well, wait, I thought, I thought the really old ones we would not have.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.260
So what does that mean?

31:54.260 --> 31:55.260
If the old-

31:55.260 --> 31:57.660
Ah, yes, important clarification.

31:57.660 --> 32:05.560
So the stars that we are observing today, these old ones, they formed from the gas.

32:05.560 --> 32:09.980
And the question is, what enriched that gas?

32:09.980 --> 32:16.260
So it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into that gas all the way up

32:16.260 --> 32:19.100
to iron.

32:19.100 --> 32:23.200
And we have found some stars that we think are second-generation stars.

32:23.200 --> 32:28.340
So they formed from gas enriched by just one first star.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.580
That's super cool.

32:30.580 --> 32:38.080
Then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated heavy element signature.

32:38.080 --> 32:43.920
And that means, okay, they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going

32:43.920 --> 32:52.340
on such as maybe a first star, maybe another more normal supernova, and maybe some kind

32:52.340 --> 32:58.540
of special process like a neutron star merger that would make heavy elements.

32:58.540 --> 33:06.600
And so they created a local chemical signature from which the next-generation star then formed.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.740
And that is what we're observing today.

33:08.740 --> 33:16.940
So all these old stars basically carry the signature from all these progenitor events.

33:16.940 --> 33:23.520
And it's our job then to unravel, okay, which processes and which events and how many may

33:23.520 --> 33:28.340
have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observed

33:28.340 --> 33:29.940
13 billion years later.

33:29.940 --> 33:36.100
Is it possible to figure out the number of generations that resulted in these stars?

33:36.700 --> 33:42.400
Well, we think we can sort of say, okay, this was like second generation or third, because

33:42.400 --> 33:50.920
the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny.

33:50.920 --> 33:54.440
One normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.080
It would give us too much of it.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.120
And the thing is, you can never take away things in the universe.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.400
You can only add.

34:01.400 --> 34:08.140
There's no cosmic vacuum cleaner going around sucking things away.

34:08.140 --> 34:12.340
Black holes are probably the closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.820
Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just the whole thing.

34:13.820 --> 34:17.420
They wouldn't have taken stuff out of the gas.

34:17.420 --> 34:26.380
So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we are saying they contain so little of these

34:26.380 --> 34:32.700
heavy elements that there must be second generation, because how else would you have

34:32.700 --> 34:33.700
made them?

34:33.700 --> 34:38.220
And again, I want to stress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made

34:38.220 --> 34:41.060
by the stars themselves that we observe.

34:41.060 --> 34:42.780
That's just a reflection of the gas cloud.

34:42.780 --> 34:46.180
So we don't actually, I had to say that because I love stars.

34:46.180 --> 34:48.980
At the end of the day, we don't really care for the stars that we're observing.

34:48.980 --> 34:52.380
We care for the story that they're telling us about the early universe.

34:53.380 --> 34:59.380
So the stars are kind of a small mirror into the early universe.

34:59.380 --> 35:00.900
So what are you detecting about those stars?

35:00.900 --> 35:04.260
Can you tell me about the process of archaeology here?

35:04.260 --> 35:09.900
What kind of data can we possibly get to tell the story about these heavy elements on the

35:09.900 --> 35:10.900
stars?

35:10.900 --> 35:14.940
Yeah, it depends really on what star you find.

35:14.940 --> 35:19.620
There are many different chemical signatures.

35:19.620 --> 35:27.460
We actually pair up these days our element signatures with also kinematic information,

35:27.460 --> 35:30.020
how the star moves about the galaxy.

35:30.020 --> 35:35.900
That actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from.

35:35.900 --> 35:41.580
Because again, all these old stars are in the galaxy, but they are not off the galaxy.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.740
That's a small but important distinction.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.140
So they all came from somewhere else.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.660
So you can rewind back in time, kind of estimate where it came from.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.700
Yeah.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.980
So we can't really say, oh, it came from that and that dwarf galaxy.

35:51.980 --> 35:57.380
But interestingly enough, just a few days ago, I submitted a paper with three women

35:57.380 --> 35:58.380
undergrads.

35:58.380 --> 36:01.060
It was so good to work together.

36:01.060 --> 36:09.060
And we found a sample of stars that have very, very low abundances in strontium and barium.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.360
So very heavy elements.

36:11.360 --> 36:17.340
And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would probably be some of the oldest.

36:18.260 --> 36:23.620
As I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events.

36:23.620 --> 36:31.700
And again, finding something that's really low means that must have happened either really

36:31.700 --> 36:35.860
early on or in a very special environment, right?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.340
Because we can only ever add.

36:37.340 --> 36:42.540
So if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just

36:42.540 --> 36:45.680
one event contributed that max.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.760
So we looked at the kinematics.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.640
How are these stars moving?

36:50.640 --> 36:56.000
And they're all going the wrong way in the galaxy.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.120
How is that possible?

36:57.120 --> 37:02.160
Well, it is possible because consider, now we come back to the proto galaxy.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.800
The proto galaxy was like a beehive.

37:03.800 --> 37:08.960
It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to become when it grew up.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.680
And it was absorbing all these little galaxies to grow fast.

37:12.680 --> 37:19.480
Some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were thrown in going the main way and some came

37:19.480 --> 37:23.440
in the wrong way, happens.

37:23.440 --> 37:29.800
But this could only happen early on when there wasn't left and right and up and down.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.440
So stuff would come in from always.

37:31.440 --> 37:40.240
So now, 13 billion years later, we're still doing it and we just looked for stars that

37:40.240 --> 37:43.160
have low strothium and barium abundances.

37:43.160 --> 37:48.520
And then we look at the kinematics and lo and behold, they're all at hundreds of kilometers

37:48.520 --> 37:50.480
per second going the wrong way.

37:50.480 --> 37:55.400
It's like, dude, you must have come in really early on from somewhere else.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.280
So we call this retrograde motion.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.440
That's a clear sign of accretion.

38:00.440 --> 38:04.040
So something that has come in to the galaxy.

38:04.040 --> 38:10.560
And because they are so fast, and it's really all of them, that must have happened early

38:10.560 --> 38:11.560
on.

38:11.560 --> 38:15.560
You can't throw a galaxy into the Mickey Ray right now the wrong way, it eventually will

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
turn around.

38:16.560 --> 38:22.280
Can you actually just on a small tangent speak to the three women undergrads, like this little,

38:22.280 --> 38:29.520
it's pretty cool that you were able to use a hunch to find this really cool little star.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.320
Yeah, what's the process of like, especially with undergrads, I think that would be very

38:33.320 --> 38:34.960
interesting and inspiring to people.

38:34.960 --> 38:42.560
Yes, it was a wonderful little collaboration that actually emerged in the fall.

38:42.560 --> 38:48.040
So I really like working with undergrads and grad students, postdocs.

38:48.040 --> 38:55.000
And I came up with a new concept for a class at MIT where I wanted to integrate the research

38:55.000 --> 38:57.800
process into the classroom.

38:58.640 --> 39:05.840
Sometimes people find it really hard to call, email a professor, hey, I'm this and that

39:05.840 --> 39:10.520
person and I'm interested in your research, could I possibly come?

39:10.520 --> 39:19.560
And I wanted to streamline that and give a trial how it would work to provide a sort

39:19.560 --> 39:25.440
of the safe confines of a classroom where you just sign up and do research in a very

39:25.440 --> 39:27.760
structured way.

39:27.760 --> 39:34.760
And I developed it, it was a lot of work, a little bit more than I thought, to map up

39:34.760 --> 39:40.920
an entire research project basically from scratch in 10 worksheets so that they could

39:40.920 --> 39:43.920
do it again in a very structured and organized fashion.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.520
Oh, so you created this whole framework for them to do it.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.040
Yes, the whole thing.

39:49.040 --> 39:55.320
But the promise was you come sign up for my class in Teams of two, you each get your own

39:55.320 --> 39:58.080
old star that has not been analyzed before.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.720
I don't know what the solution is because in research, we don't look up the solution

40:02.720 --> 40:03.760
at the end of the book.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.920
We do not know what we're going to find.

40:05.920 --> 40:11.860
Our job is to do the work and then to interpret the numbers because our job as scientists

40:11.860 --> 40:15.400
is to find the story.

40:15.400 --> 40:23.920
Anyone can crunch numbers, anyone, it's complicated sometimes, but it's doable, right?

40:23.920 --> 40:28.620
But coming up with a story, when you only have three puzzle pieces, what does the puzzle

40:28.620 --> 40:31.020
look like?

40:31.020 --> 40:37.160
You have to be a little bit bold, you need to have some experience, and you need to kind

40:37.160 --> 40:38.880
of see the universe in 3D.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.520
You just need to kind of go for it.

40:40.520 --> 40:41.520
And that's the beautiful thing.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.520
I really love that.

40:42.520 --> 40:48.520
And so this was a story of weird kinematics going the wrong way combined with this particular

40:48.520 --> 40:52.960
weird signature in terms of the heavy elements, and you have to come up with a story.

40:52.960 --> 41:00.720
And so the story of that paper is now, usually I don't say I find the oldest stars.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.860
When I talk to my research colleagues, I talk to them about we find the chemically most

41:04.860 --> 41:09.280
pristine stars because that's actually what we measure, the chemical abundance that tells

41:09.280 --> 41:13.880
us, okay, it must have been second or third or fifth generation of stars, right?

41:13.880 --> 41:18.820
But these low strontium stars that go in the wrong way, like they're getting paid for it,

41:18.820 --> 41:25.580
they must be the oldest stars that came into the galaxy because they formed before the

41:25.580 --> 41:29.660
galaxy was the Milky Way, right?

41:29.660 --> 41:31.800
And it's so cool and it was so wonderful.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.020
So this class, it went so well in the fall.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.060
I had nine people sign up.

41:38.060 --> 41:42.460
That's not unusual for a class, a specialty class at MIT, so small number.

41:42.460 --> 41:50.340
There was eight women and they were so into it that I said, okay, let's use this opportunity.

41:50.340 --> 41:54.660
You're going to do some extra work with me and we're going to publish this.

41:54.660 --> 41:55.660
Try to publish.

41:55.660 --> 41:56.660
Yes.

41:56.660 --> 42:01.060
I also like that you're using the terminology of chemically more pristine.

42:01.060 --> 42:05.380
When I'm talking to younger people, I'll just say that I'm more chemically pristine than

42:05.380 --> 42:06.380
them.

42:06.380 --> 42:08.360
I like that description of age.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.580
So there's this term of metal poor stars.

42:11.580 --> 42:14.100
So most of these old stars are going to be metal poor.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.100
Yes.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.660
I search for the most metal poor stars.

42:16.660 --> 42:20.260
And what does that, can we just define what does that mean?

42:20.260 --> 42:22.380
I don't know who came up with this.

42:22.380 --> 42:27.620
I would love to know, but the universe is a complicated place.

42:27.620 --> 42:34.660
So many decades ago, someone clever came up with the idea to say, let's simplify things

42:34.660 --> 42:35.660
a little bit.

42:35.660 --> 42:46.260
For example, hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements combine metals, Z.

42:46.260 --> 42:50.180
When I give public talks, I always ask, is there a chemist in the audience?

42:50.180 --> 42:52.900
Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal.

42:52.900 --> 42:56.380
And they're like, oh my God, what's she saying?

42:56.380 --> 42:59.700
I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it.

42:59.700 --> 43:04.580
So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except hydrogen and helium

43:04.580 --> 43:06.620
are called metals.

43:06.620 --> 43:13.020
Now if we look again at the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more of all the

43:13.020 --> 43:18.220
elements, everything heavier than hydrogen and helium gets produced slowly but surely

43:18.220 --> 43:21.780
by different types of stars and events.

43:21.780 --> 43:27.680
So that's a monotonously increasing function.

43:27.680 --> 43:33.020
And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts of heavy elements in them, because

43:33.020 --> 43:39.220
that means we are going further and further back in this process, in that function, almost

43:39.220 --> 43:41.740
all the way to the very beginning.

43:41.740 --> 43:43.540
And that is the first stars, right?

43:43.540 --> 43:46.220
They started that process.

43:46.220 --> 43:51.940
That's why I said it was such an important transition phase, because things were, we

43:51.940 --> 43:56.900
call the post-Big Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium, and after that the

43:56.900 --> 43:57.900
mess started.

43:58.380 --> 44:04.020
As soon as you add elements to it, things kind of get a little out of hand.

44:04.020 --> 44:09.700
That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days.

44:09.700 --> 44:12.900
And you're looking at the very early days of the introduction of the variety.

44:12.900 --> 44:19.980
Yes, exactly, when it was still a little bit more organisable.

44:19.980 --> 44:24.700
But the variety of different types of metal-poor stars we have is stark.

44:24.700 --> 44:29.420
Many different types of stars, many patterns we have identified, but there are still crazy

44:29.420 --> 44:34.140
ones out there that we're still trying to fit in.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.620
So what kind of stars have been discovered?

44:35.620 --> 44:46.100
So you've, already a while ago, helped discover the star HE 1327 2326, great name.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.100
Yes.

44:47.100 --> 44:51.660
And HE 1523 0901.

44:51.660 --> 44:55.660
What can you say about these stars and others that have been found?

44:55.660 --> 44:56.660
I love them.

44:56.660 --> 44:59.180
They're my baby stars.

44:59.180 --> 45:01.420
What do you call your baby stars?

45:01.420 --> 45:06.020
Well, I'm probably the only one who can spit out these names without cheating.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.020
Are there nicknames?

45:07.020 --> 45:08.020
Are there nicknames?

45:08.020 --> 45:10.540
Well, no, that's not allowed.

45:10.540 --> 45:15.260
Well, some colleagues at conferences have just called them Anna Star or Freeble Star,

45:15.260 --> 45:18.860
because they didn't want to learn the phone number.

45:19.340 --> 45:21.340
The phone number.

45:21.340 --> 45:27.580
These numbers are actually based on older sets of coordinates for these stars.

45:27.580 --> 45:30.340
The minus in the middle means that they're in the southern hemisphere, so negative is

45:30.340 --> 45:33.860
in the southern hemisphere, positive is in the northern.

45:33.860 --> 45:37.380
And then 13 and 15 means they're sort of observable in the middle of the year.

45:37.380 --> 45:41.620
Okay, so it's to do with the observation and where it was observed and that kind of stuff.

45:41.940 --> 45:49.860
They have very different stars, both absolutely significant career defining actually for me,

45:49.860 --> 45:53.780
but really push the envelope in very different ways.

45:53.780 --> 45:59.940
So 1813 27, the first one that you mentioned, that was the second, second generation star

45:59.940 --> 46:00.660
that we found.

46:02.820 --> 46:07.220
Usually people say like, oh, the first one is a big one and the rest is nobody cares.

46:08.180 --> 46:12.660
But to us, it proved that yes, we can do it.

46:13.220 --> 46:19.700
Because one, astronomers live in a sort of way of, you know, there are a lot of serendipitous

46:19.700 --> 46:25.860
discoveries and that's really great, but we need to show that we can do it again.

46:26.980 --> 46:30.900
Because then we're onto something and it's not just some kind of weird quirk.

46:30.900 --> 46:33.060
And there are a lot of quirks in the universe.

46:33.060 --> 46:35.460
But we want to know, is that a real thing?

46:35.460 --> 46:36.820
Does that happen regularly?

46:36.820 --> 46:38.180
Is there something that we can learn?

46:38.660 --> 46:40.100
Is that a piece of the story?

46:41.540 --> 46:46.100
And so finding the second one that was even a little bit more extreme than the first one

46:46.100 --> 46:49.300
really showed, yes, our search techniques work.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.740
We can find these stars.

46:51.540 --> 46:59.620
They provide an important part to the story in the sense that if we had more than two stars,

46:59.620 --> 47:01.780
and by now we have about 10 or so.

47:01.940 --> 47:07.380
So what do they tell us about the nature of the very first stars?

47:09.140 --> 47:15.140
And what we found, again, working with the theorists, of course, who run these supernova

47:15.140 --> 47:22.820
models, is that, so actually, let me before I get into this, these two stars had huge

47:23.540 --> 47:26.740
amounts of carbon relative to iron.

47:26.740 --> 47:31.780
So we usually use iron as a reference element for what we call the metallicity.

47:31.780 --> 47:37.460
So the overall metal content, the overall amount of heavy elements in it.

47:38.020 --> 47:40.500
So that's why it's called iron deficient.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.060
That's right.

47:41.700 --> 47:47.060
So these stars are incredibly iron deficient, which means they must be of the second generation

47:47.060 --> 47:53.380
because there was, and interestingly enough, there was this discrepancy.

47:53.940 --> 48:03.940
A normal supernova until then we thought would get us so much iron, you would distribute that

48:03.940 --> 48:07.060
in the gas cloud, and then you would form this little star that we're observing.

48:07.060 --> 48:10.580
But the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that.

48:10.580 --> 48:12.740
And I already mentioned, you can't take things away.

48:13.300 --> 48:18.980
That must mean these early massive POP3, we call them population 3, the first stars,

48:19.780 --> 48:22.740
they must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought.

48:23.380 --> 48:28.100
They can't output as much iron because they just can't.

48:28.820 --> 48:30.660
Otherwise it wouldn't match our observations.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.160
Got it.

48:31.780 --> 48:39.860
And so that's when we started to work with several theory groups on supernova yields.

48:39.860 --> 48:41.460
So what comes out of...

48:41.460 --> 48:43.380
From the explosion of the supernova?

48:43.380 --> 48:43.860
That's cool.

48:43.860 --> 48:45.380
Supernova yields.

48:45.380 --> 48:48.020
And so this one was not yielding much iron.

48:48.020 --> 48:53.300
Well, we needed to concoct a theoretical supernova that made less.

48:54.580 --> 48:59.300
And it's actually surprisingly difficult because you can always add more in the universe,

48:59.300 --> 49:01.060
but you can't take stuff away.

49:01.940 --> 49:07.780
So Japanese colleagues kind of came up with the idea of a fainter supernova

49:08.580 --> 49:12.580
that just doesn't have enough oomph when it explodes.

49:13.220 --> 49:16.100
So somehow there's less iron coming out.

49:16.820 --> 49:21.620
But at the same time, then these stars showed huge overabundances of carbon,

49:21.620 --> 49:23.060
a thousand times more carbon.

49:24.020 --> 49:30.340
So how do you now get a thousand times more carbon out of these poor first supernovae?

49:30.340 --> 49:32.180
That was the theoretical challenge.

49:32.180 --> 49:40.020
And because we didn't have just one star, but two, that really spurred the field to think about

49:40.660 --> 49:42.740
what was the nature of the first stars?

49:42.740 --> 49:43.940
How did they explode?

49:44.900 --> 49:46.180
What are the implications?

49:46.180 --> 49:49.540
Because if they are not as luminous and bright and energetic,

49:50.100 --> 49:57.140
that has consequences for these early proto galaxies in which they must have been located

49:57.860 --> 50:02.340
in terms of blowing the gas out, let's say, and disrupting the system.

50:02.340 --> 50:07.380
So much higher chance for the earlier system to stay intact for longer.

50:07.380 --> 50:10.260
So there's a whole tale of consequences.

50:10.260 --> 50:13.140
And this is what I mean with we need to find the story

50:13.140 --> 50:17.540
because you do one thing and it's like the dominoes,

50:17.540 --> 50:20.580
there are consequences everywhere and suddenly you have a different universe, right?

50:20.580 --> 50:26.500
What could possibly be a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon

50:26.500 --> 50:28.180
and doesn't yield a lot of iron?

50:28.900 --> 50:33.940
Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like finding a mechanism for what happens

50:33.940 --> 50:39.860
in supernovae and the official term, what was sort of, as I said,

50:39.860 --> 50:42.340
cooked up in order to explain the observations.

50:42.340 --> 50:46.020
And we have, by the way, found a whole bunch more of these stars, so that holds.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.940
And it's called a fallback mechanism.

50:47.940 --> 50:54.580
So actually during the supernova explosion, a massive black hole emerges.

50:54.580 --> 50:58.180
And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole.

50:58.180 --> 51:02.980
So here is a vacuum cleaner now plopped into the middle, right?

51:02.980 --> 51:05.540
Like a temporary one that just cleans up some of the elements?

51:05.540 --> 51:06.100
Sort of, right?

51:06.100 --> 51:08.660
Because if you think of the, we haven't talked about this yet, but

51:09.300 --> 51:15.380
if you know what a star looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior

51:15.380 --> 51:19.540
before it explodes, you have hydrogen and helium still on the outskirts

51:19.540 --> 51:23.460
and then you have your layers of heavier and heavier elements all the way up to iron.

51:23.460 --> 51:25.380
So you have an iron core in the center.

51:27.620 --> 51:32.020
And because you can't get any energy out of iron when you want to fuse to iron atoms

51:32.020 --> 51:32.740
anymore, right?

51:32.740 --> 51:36.500
That's when the supernova explodes, what occurs really.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.100
It's actually an implosion first.

51:38.100 --> 51:45.220
And then you have a bounce of the sort of neutron star phase that occurs in the process.

51:45.220 --> 51:47.940
And then the star just gets disrupted.

51:47.940 --> 51:50.900
Yeah, it's like this giant basketball.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.300
And then it all goes out.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.980
Implosion first, explosion after.

51:54.980 --> 51:59.060
And so in the process, right, if you make your black hole basically big enough,

51:59.060 --> 52:03.780
it will suck away some of the iron because that's the closest in terms of the layers.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.500
You hold on to it.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.260
You don't let it escape.

52:08.260 --> 52:10.500
And carbon is much further out.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.540
You let it all go.

52:13.620 --> 52:17.460
So that explains why you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield.

52:17.460 --> 52:18.820
Yes, yes.

52:18.820 --> 52:22.580
So does this explain the HE 1327?

52:23.700 --> 52:25.060
And others like it?

52:25.060 --> 52:25.620
Yes.

52:25.620 --> 52:32.660
So there's a well-established now that the lower the iron abundance of the stars are,

52:32.660 --> 52:34.500
the higher the carbon sort of gets.

52:35.140 --> 52:38.340
And carbon is such an interesting element in that regard.

52:40.340 --> 52:44.580
If we come back to the formation of the first low mass stars, right?

52:44.580 --> 52:49.860
So we had the hotter gas, just hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars.

52:49.860 --> 52:53.780
There were 100 solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.700
So they were big and puffy.

52:56.660 --> 53:04.500
Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough cooling in these gas clouds

53:04.500 --> 53:07.300
that enabled the formation of the first low mass stars.

53:08.660 --> 53:11.940
So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon

53:11.940 --> 53:14.980
or the properties of the carbon atom would be different.

53:14.980 --> 53:20.020
It would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps.

53:20.020 --> 53:21.700
There wouldn't be any low mass stars.

53:23.060 --> 53:25.060
We wouldn't be here today, right?

53:25.540 --> 53:26.820
And we're carbon-based.

53:26.820 --> 53:30.740
And so I think carbon is really the most important element in the universe

53:30.740 --> 53:34.820
for a variety of reasons because it just enabled this whole evolution

53:34.820 --> 53:37.940
that we're now observing and literally seeing in the sky.

53:38.660 --> 53:40.020
And it's really fascinating.

53:40.020 --> 53:42.660
So combined with the fact that you have the iron deficient,

53:42.660 --> 53:47.140
so all of that is probably important to creating humans.

53:47.140 --> 53:49.060
Yeah, we need all the elements.

53:49.060 --> 53:54.260
But if you don't have stars like the sun, small stars that can actually host planets,

53:54.820 --> 53:57.380
that have long lifetimes, you need long, long lifetimes

53:57.380 --> 54:01.380
if you want to have a stable planet and develop humans.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.780
So carbon is kind of important in many ways.

54:03.780 --> 54:04.660
Yes, yes.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.700
This is perhaps an interesting tangent.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.460
If I could just mention that you interviewed

54:12.340 --> 54:18.980
Mildred Dresselhaus, carbon queen, the remarkable life of the nanoscience pioneer.

54:19.780 --> 54:23.140
Is there something you could say about the magic of carbon and the magic of Millie?

54:24.420 --> 54:27.220
Well, Millie was certainly magic.

54:28.420 --> 54:30.980
She was a professor at MIT for many decades.

54:32.180 --> 54:33.620
I met her a number of times.

54:34.660 --> 54:39.220
Her photograph, actually a young and an older Millie is still on the wall

54:39.220 --> 54:43.220
every time I step out of the elevator in one of the buildings I see it.

54:44.340 --> 54:49.540
She pioneered all sorts of carbon nanowork.

54:49.540 --> 54:52.180
So she was a material scientist,

54:53.780 --> 54:56.740
very far removed from what I do on a daily basis.

54:57.860 --> 55:01.620
But yes, carbon has amazing properties when you study it.

55:01.620 --> 55:07.060
And again, that's indeed another aspect of why carbon is so fascinating,

55:08.100 --> 55:11.380
not just in the cosmos, but also for us,

55:12.180 --> 55:16.020
making us, creating us in the way that we can use it.

55:17.540 --> 55:18.420
It's wonderful.

55:18.420 --> 55:23.460
Do you sometimes think about this chemical evolution in this big philosophical way

55:23.460 --> 55:27.780
that we're the results of that chemical evolution?

55:27.780 --> 55:28.820
Like we're made of this stuff.

55:29.540 --> 55:30.660
We're made of carbon.

55:30.660 --> 55:32.340
Yes, we're made of store stuff.

55:32.340 --> 55:32.660
Yeah.

55:32.660 --> 55:33.140
And it came-

55:33.140 --> 55:33.780
Cause they can go right.

55:34.820 --> 55:40.740
I mean, it's almost like a cliche statement, but it's also a materials,

55:40.740 --> 55:44.740
a chemical, a physics statement that came from hydrogen and helium.

55:45.700 --> 55:50.740
And then somehow this formations created this interesting complexity of soup that made us.

55:52.100 --> 55:53.460
What are we supposed to make of that?

55:54.580 --> 55:56.180
Like what, did we just get really lucky?

55:57.380 --> 55:58.740
Why did we get all this cool stuff?

55:59.780 --> 56:01.300
Yeah, that's a good question.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.860
I don't think it's a question as an answer.

56:03.860 --> 56:08.260
I keep just asking why, but it's just this incredible mystery.

56:08.900 --> 56:10.500
So much cool stuff had to happen.

56:11.300 --> 56:13.700
So much, sorry, hot stuff had to happen.

56:14.340 --> 56:15.380
Well, right.

56:15.380 --> 56:19.060
And so much could have gone wrong and there would have been another outcome.

56:20.180 --> 56:24.100
And it's actually amazing how many things kind of fell in place.

56:24.100 --> 56:28.980
I mean, maybe that's all sort of self-deterministic in some ways, right?

56:28.980 --> 56:31.620
We are who we are because that was the path.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.580
Maybe we would have ended up being robots.

56:34.580 --> 56:35.060
I don't know.

56:35.380 --> 56:45.060
But it's certainly wonderful as scientists for us to help contribute unraveling our cosmic history.

56:45.940 --> 56:53.380
I always say the biological evolution on earth was absolutely facilitated by the chemical

56:53.380 --> 56:54.580
evolution of the universe, right?

56:54.580 --> 56:59.300
And one doesn't go without the other from a human perspective.

56:59.300 --> 57:02.740
And that evolution seems to be creating more and more complexity.

57:03.300 --> 57:09.540
The kind of interesting clumping of cool stuff seems to be accelerating and increasing.

57:10.900 --> 57:14.900
It's hard not to see as humans that there's some kind of purpose to it,

57:14.900 --> 57:18.500
like a momentum towards complexity and beauty, you know?

57:20.100 --> 57:21.940
Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

57:23.700 --> 57:26.100
But yes, everything gets more complicated.

57:26.100 --> 57:29.700
But there's also a beauty to the chemically pristine universe in the early days.

57:30.180 --> 57:34.900
Yes, I love the desert with its nothingness.

57:35.700 --> 57:38.340
It has so much aesthetics and appeal.

57:39.060 --> 57:41.460
We came from nothing, we'll return to nothing.

57:41.460 --> 57:43.940
So what about H.E. 1523?

57:44.580 --> 57:45.700
What's exciting?

57:45.700 --> 57:48.260
A red giant star.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.700
That's another one of your babies.

57:51.700 --> 57:52.500
Yes.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.020
13.2 billion years old.

57:54.020 --> 57:59.780
Yeah, so that one isn't quite as iron deficient as the other one.

57:59.780 --> 58:06.420
So probably not a second generation star, but easily third, fourth, fifth or so.

58:06.420 --> 58:11.460
We can't really pin it down, but that's also not super important for us.

58:12.420 --> 58:18.740
What is important is that that star has a very different chemical composition,

58:18.740 --> 58:21.780
in a sense that yes, we have all the elements up to iron there.

58:22.580 --> 58:31.620
They have sort of normal ratios, which means kind of the same as most other old stars

58:31.620 --> 58:36.100
and not too different from the Sun or at least different in quantifiable ways.

58:38.900 --> 58:42.660
But it has this huge overload of very heavy elements.

58:43.540 --> 58:47.140
And what was so nice about that star in particular was that I could measure

58:47.140 --> 58:49.540
the thorium and the uranium abundance.

58:50.420 --> 58:56.420
And again, that was the second of its kind, but the uranium abundance

58:57.620 --> 59:01.380
could be more well-determined, so we had a better grasp on that.

59:01.380 --> 59:03.460
Now, why are thorium and uranium interesting?

59:05.460 --> 59:09.700
They are radioactive elements, they decay.

59:10.900 --> 59:16.420
Thorium has a half-life of 14 billion years, I believe, and uranium of 4.7.

59:17.300 --> 59:24.500
Which, you know, to focus on us on Earth is a really long time, but those kind of timelines

59:24.500 --> 59:27.860
are really good when you want to explore the early universe.

59:29.460 --> 59:33.620
So there are two questions now that kind of come to mind.

59:34.580 --> 59:39.540
Where do these elements come from and what do they tell us, right?

59:39.540 --> 59:46.500
And these, as we know, these heavy elements are made in a specific process.

59:46.500 --> 59:51.860
It's a neutron capture process, usually referred to as the R process for rapid

59:51.860 --> 59:53.300
neutron capture process.

59:53.860 --> 59:56.180
We talked about seed nuclei before, right?

59:56.180 --> 01:00:00.340
So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:06.900
So you have, let's say, a lone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:12.100
where you have a strong neutron flux, which means there must be lots of neutrons around.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:17.940
And again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder where that might be the case.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:24.020
But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons, and you do it incredibly fast.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.460
Now, what happens in the process?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:32.420
That iron atom, you know, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:40.020
So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay because it's not stable, it's way too big.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:47.700
And so let's say you add only one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:53.140
So it will then, it has a characteristic decay time that's called the beta decay time scale.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.060
So it will decay to a stable nucleus.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.260
So the neutron will convert to a proton, and that makes it stable.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:05.620
If you now bombard lots and lots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within that

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:11.940
time scale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge fat neutron-rich nucleus

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.660
that then wants to decay, right?

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.060
So the rapid processes, you have your seed nuclei, they get bombarded.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.020
You create these really heavy neutron-rich nuclei.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.660
They're heavier than uranium even.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.100
The neutron flux stops, and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:38.020
And they make all these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and uranium.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.740
So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the fun.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.180
Correct. And the whole thing is done within two seconds.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:55.540
So just to add to the rapid here, literally the snapping on my hand, it's all there.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.540
In my talks, I often have this nice simulation that illustrates

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:05.060
this creation of these heavy nuclei.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.780
And I always say, this is the only simulation you will ever see that's slower than real time.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.820
Because in astronomy, we show, oh, this is how a galaxy forms.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.820
13 billion years in 30 seconds.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.980
Really short, right?

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.940
This is the opposite.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.860
Me showing you this, the elements are long made.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.820
So where and when does this happen, does this process happen?

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.380
So you need the strong neutron flux.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.900
That's the clumping of the neutrons.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.220
That's right. And so there are not that many options, right?

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.780
So where do you find lots of neutrons in the universe?

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.460
So it's neutron stars, right?

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:47.380
Neutron stars form in the making of supernovae, of the explosions.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.740
Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making of the supernova

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.820
explosion and then gets expelled.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.660
Or you have neutron stars.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.940
So usually that's the leftover of a supernova.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:09.140
If you have two from a binary pair, so stars usually actually show up in pairs.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:17.700
And so it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.940
after both of their progenitor stars have exploded.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.740
And those two neutron stars will orbit each other diligently.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:29.620
But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the gravitational wave observatory,

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.860
we know already that before, but now it's been measured by LIGO,

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:40.180
is that these two neutron stars, they will orbit each other for like forever.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.300
But in the process, they will lose energy.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.980
So that orbit is what we call the orbit decays.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.900
And eventually the two neutron stars will merge.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:57.140
And that results in an explosive event that has roughly the energy of a supernova.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:00.820
But the process is completely different.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:07.220
And the cool thing is when these two neutron stars collide, they produce a gravitational wave

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.380
signature because neutron stars are super dense objects.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.420
They're like giant atomic nucleuses.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.980
So there's a lot of interesting physics happening already.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:23.060
And so if you basically form a super neutron star by smashing two into each other,

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.180
more interesting physics happens.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:34.180
And that means that there's this ripple sent out into the space time continuum.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.900
What do people say?

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.100
The ripples of space time.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.460
It's like you drop a rock into water.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.660
You see the waves coming.

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.500
So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.620
And this is neutrons galore.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:55.460
It's really violent to smash two neutron stars that are so dense already into each other.

01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:02.580
And in 2017, one of these events occurred.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:08.260
And the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories, they detected that.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.700
And then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in that direction.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.100
And they indeed observed what we call the electromagnetic counterpart.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.540
So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:29.540
And that light curve, that light was exactly what you get when you

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:34.020
create all these heavy neutron-rich nuclei in the R process.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.340
And then the neutron flux stops.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.380
And then it takes about two or three weeks for most of them,

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:42.100
of these nuclei to decay to stability.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.980
So we saw, the astronomers saw in this electromagnetic counterpart,

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:52.260
the nuclear synthesis of heavy elements occurring.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.860
And that's just awesome.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:01.140
That's an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational waves that were detected

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:07.540
with two neutron stars colliding aggressively violently to create a

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.260
super neutron star.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.620
And that's where you get all the neutrons and the neutron flux somehow.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.380
And then the whole shebang that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of...

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:21.860
So that confirmed that one of the sites for sure is,

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.780
for the R process to occur, is neutron star mergers.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:28.020
Interestingly enough, I have to mention this here.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.260
A year prior in 2016, my former grad student Alex G and I,

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:40.660
we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the Milky Way,

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:46.980
it's called reticulum 2, that was full of ancient iron-deficient stars

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.460
that also had a strong signature of these heavy elements, exactly like HE 1523.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.260
We weren't looking for that.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.580
I actually wanted to prove that they had really low levels of heavy elements,

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.700
because that's what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.860
And I was dead set on showing that that is yet the case again,

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.300
and that that is a typical signature of early star formation.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.780
We already talked about low strontium and barium abundances and the oldest stars, right?

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:23.060
This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies that are surrounding us.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.900
That's an ancient dwarf galaxy.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.220
That dwarf galaxy has a bunch of ancient stars in it.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.740
Yes, yes.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:36.020
And so now we find reticulum 2, and the stars show the signature of the rapid

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.740
neutron capture process, the R process, and we are like, okay,

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.180
these stars are located in a dwarf galaxy right now.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.180
We have environmental information.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.860
They are not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where they actually came from.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.540
We know these stars were formed in that galaxy because they're still in it.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:59.940
And we already deduced from that that it must have been a neutron star merger that went off

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:05.540
in reticulum 2 at early times that polluted the gas from which all our little stars formed.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.700
Can you speak to what a dwarf galaxy is?

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:12.580
Can you speak to what this reticulum 2 dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milky Way galaxy?

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:12.820
Yeah.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.580
It's going to be eaten by it, presumably?

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.100
It totally is going to be eaten.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.580
I can't tell you exactly when.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:24.820
When? Yeah, the Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small dwarf galaxies.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:32.100
They're collections of stars. Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:37.620
they now only contain, I don't know, a few thousand stars. Very, very faint.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.580
They're still detectable?

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.820
Yes, because they're fairly close, and we detect actual individual stars in them.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:50.500
I've observed some of the fainter stars. You possibly observe with current telescopes in

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.820
these dwarf galaxies because I was like, I need to know what the chemical composition is

01:08:54.820 --> 01:09:00.660
because there are leftovers from the early universe. They did not get eaten,

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.900
so they are still in their native surroundings. It's like getting the lions in the wild. I got

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:12.740
to study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are now in the Milky Way.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:18.980
So presumably, most of those stars, not all those stars in that dwarf galaxy are really ancient.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:24.020
They're all really ancient because, actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy,

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.820
there was a process early on in the universe called reionization that kind of heated up everything.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:38.980
Together with some supernova explosions in an early, shallow, bound system,

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:45.620
all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out, or it simply evaporated,

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:52.660
or both, probably both. And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:59.780
So it's the best for us stellar archaeologists that you could hope for

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.340
because it's a whole bunch of stars still sitting there. It's not just one. It's a whole bunch of

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:09.860
them still sitting there ever since, and literally nothing has happened to them.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.100
They have just been waiting there for us. So from the stellar archaeology perspective,

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:19.860
what is juicier and more interesting, the old stars in the outskirts that have been eaten,

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:27.620
the outskirts of Milky Way, or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? Of all the things you love about

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.260
the world. You said you love stars, so which do you love more?

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.460
That's a hard one. I mean, I love them all, of course. They serve different purposes.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:46.100
The stars in the Milky Way, I can get much, much, much better data for them because they're brighter.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:51.620
They're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.940
And they have interesting kinematics, presumably.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.300
Yes, and we can get that. And so HG 1523, for example, that one is really bright.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:06.500
It's a red giant, so it's intrinsically bright and it's fairly close. And so the data I got for

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.220
that was insanely good, and that yielded this uranium detection, and thorium detection.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.300
I can never get that kind of data for a dwarf galaxy star, so that's a big trade-off.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:21.860
But the environmental information that we get along with the basic information about these

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:28.900
stars in each dwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing, for example, the site

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:35.300
information, right? Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:42.100
So to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here and there,

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:47.780
but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just doesn't have enough oomph

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.540
to really get that R process going and doing it all.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.540
So you need these orbiting supernovae.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:59.140
We need probably the neutron star mergers, or we need a special kind of supernova that's

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:03.540
maybe extremely massive or heavily rotating or does something else funny, right, to really kind

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:08.660
of get that particular process going. But the normal supernovae don't do it, right? So only a

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:13.060
little bit comes out. But you could come along and say, you know, why don't you just take 100

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.260
supernovae together to build up the yield, right? But then I come along and say, like, look,

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:23.620
this dwarf galaxy is still intact today. If you would have plugged in 100 supernovae

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:28.100
into this little system early on, it would have blown apart. It would have blown apart past 5

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:33.780
supernovae or 10. So that's a really important constraint that we have, that these systems are

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:40.740
still alive, right? So it helps us to pin down where certain processes could have possibly

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.620
happened. And so it's just a different type of information that we get.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:50.260
It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:56.820
observation. So what telescopes have you used, do you use, and what does the data look like?

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.940
And I think I've read a few interesting stories about the actual process of day-to-day observation,

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.140
a bunch of probably late nights.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:11.300
Well, yeah, astronomers are doing it all night long, so we have lots of late nights.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.220
Can you explain the all-night-long aspect of it?

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:20.340
Well, let me start by saying I mostly these days use the Magellan telescopes in Chile. They are

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:27.460
6.5-meter telescope, which means the mirror diameter is 6.5-meter. That's not the largest

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:34.260
that is out there, but it's among the largest. And I use a spectrograph because I'm a

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:42.180
spectroscopist. I don't take pictures. And that particular spectrograph at that telescope is

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:48.820
actually unusually efficient. So it kind of makes up for the fact that the mirror isn't as large in,

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:54.020
let's say, the 8-meter telescopes from the Europeans or so. So I'm very happy with that.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.220
Efficiency meaning?

01:13:55.220 --> 01:14:02.980
How many photons get collected sort of per time unit, because that's always the limiting factor.

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.820
Prior to the pandemic, we would travel to Chile to do our observations.

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.900
Those telescopes are the… That's the last observatory where people were sort of supposed

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:22.900
to travel there and take their own observations. Most other observatories basically have staff

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:29.060
there by now who take the observations for you. So there's directly the scientists are

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.340
specifying where to point the telescope and sitting there and collecting the data,

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.660
making sure the data is collected well, the cleaning of the data, the offloading of the data,

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:44.500
all that kind of stuff. Yeah, so it's mostly done for them. Obviously, that's super convenient,

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:51.940
but it also takes away a central part of what the work of an astronomer is, which is

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:58.100
data collection. We don't have an experiment in the basement where we can go day and night

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:05.940
or whenever we please and ask a certain question of the apparatus. Let's turn this knob and see

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.820
what happens. Let's turn that knob and see what happens. We only have one experiment,

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:20.180
which is the universe, and what we see is what we get. I think it's so important to take an

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:26.740
active role in that. I really love going to the observatory. I've taken many students there over

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:36.020
the years to teach them and to just show them what it means to be an astronomer because you

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:44.500
go to these remote mountaintops and it's such a magical environment. You wait there for the sun

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:51.060
to go down and then you get ready and you look outside and it's such a serene environment.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:56.980
It's a little bit out of this world. You're sitting there, so the sun goes down,

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.940
it's evening, late evening, and what does it look like? What are some of the most magical

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:08.660
experiences of that process? Well, when you're on top of a mountain, climbers, I guess, get to

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:21.380
see that probably otherwise. It's very calm and the colors are so beautiful and I always become

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:26.820
much calmer when I'm there. I'm just A, because I'm just there for one purpose only,

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:32.660
that's data collection. I can say no to my emails. I can say no to everything else because

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:40.180
I'm observing. There's literally less distractions because you're just there to do one thing.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.140
Also, the emails somehow seem less significant.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:53.620
You can afford to focus on just one thing and it just does something to you. It's a little

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:59.620
hard to describe, but if you then fast forward, maybe I can speak a little bit about that.

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:07.060
I have done a lot of astrophotography there as well. Observing faint dwarf galaxy stars,

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:12.020
these are like 45 minutes, 55 minute exposures, so you actually have a lot of time. I would run

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:20.260
outside and just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way, beautiful, right up there.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:28.500
I would just lay there like the snow angel and just stare up there and just kind of

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:35.620
let my thoughts pass through my brain and just like I'm one of it. We talked about this in the

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:42.180
beginning. This is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it. I belong here

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:46.580
rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:50.420
and lots of small things make one big whole. We're part of that big whole.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:55.700
And so that's looking at the inner spirals of the Milky Way galaxy.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:04.980
And just this dark sky with the bright stars. I have described this in my book years ago.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.740
If the Milky Way is all bright above you, you don't need a moon or anything. You can walk

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:15.940
in the starlight and you will find your way. There are no trees there for safety reasons,

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:23.060
but you wouldn't even run into a tree. You can almost see the shadow from the starlight

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:28.900
because it's such a dark site and the stars are so bright. These are kind of moments that

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:34.100
change you a little bit. You see the unity of it all.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:41.940
Yeah. And it's just you and nature and with modern civilization and all of that,

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:48.420
I think we often try a little bit too hard to be removed from nature, to be independent of it and

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:56.100
figuring it all out. But at the end of the day, we're just a part of it. And that really helps

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:02.420
me to remember that we're one in the same. Well, that fills me with hope that

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.780
I tend to think of us humans in the very early days of whatever the heck we are.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:14.100
So that makes me think thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years from now

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:20.660
that we'll be reaching, whatever we become, we'll be traveling out there to explore more and more

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:26.020
and more. So what you're doing is the early days of exploration with the tools we have.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.620
Yes, the early seafarers looking at the sky for navigation.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:35.140
Coming up with different theories of what's on the other side, that the Earth is starting to

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.700
gain an intuition that the Earth may be round. And then we might be able to navigate all the

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:46.740
way around to get to the financial benefits of getting spices from India, whatever the grant

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:52.100
funding process is all about, but ultimately actually results in a deep understanding

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:59.700
of the mystery that's all around us. And I mean, it's just to travel out there. To me,

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:07.220
the discovery of life in the solar system, I really hope to see that in my lifetime,

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:14.180
some kind of life, bacteria, something, maybe dead, because that means there's life everywhere.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:20.180
And that's just the kind of stuff that might be out there. All the different

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:27.540
environmental conditions, chemically speaking, that are out there. And it just seems like when

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:34.900
you look at Earth, life finds a way to survive, to thrive in whatever conditions. And so

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.500
maybe that process just kind of humbles you and is super exciting to know that there is life out

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:49.300
there of different forms. And of course that raises the question of what is life even?

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:55.460
We tend to have a very human-centric perspective of what is a living organism and what is

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:59.700
intelligence and all this kind of stuff. And all the work in artificial intelligence now is starting

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:06.020
to challenge our ideas of what makes human beings special. And I think we're doing that

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:10.340
through all kinds of ways. And I think you're working some part doing that as well. Like the

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:17.220
unity you feel is realizing we're part of this big mechanism of nature, whatever that is,

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:23.300
that's creating all kinds of cool stuff from the humble, pristine origins to today.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:31.140
So if you could just kind of linger on the process of the data, what does the data look like?

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:38.340
And how does the raw data lead to a discovery of an ancient star?

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:45.620
Well, as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment about what a spectrum is.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:55.300
Everyone, I hope, has seen a rainbow in the sky. That is basically what we're

01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:01.060
doing. We don't send the starlight through a raindrop that then gets bounced around and

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:08.900
splits up the light into the rainbow colors. We do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:16.420
So we send the starlight through a prism of sorts, and that splits it up. And then we record exactly

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:26.020
that. So it's a little 2D picture, actually, of a spectrum. Now, it's not going to look colorful,

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:32.260
just black and white. Different colors have, of course, different energies. That's what we record.

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:40.100
More specifically, we record it as wavelengths, so wavelengths and frequency and energies,

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:48.660
all the same at the end of the day. We process that little image in the sense that we do a

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:56.740
crosscut and then sum up a few columns so that we get all the data that we recorded. And what we see

01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:03.620
is a – it's a bit funny to describe just with words – but a wiggly line with lots of dips.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:09.300
So the 2D process spectrum, we call it continuum. So it's just a flat line, basically,

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:14.980
and then there are dips. So the interesting things are the dips. If you think back of the rainbow,

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:20.100
what we actually see in our stars is not just a rainbow, but it would be a rainbow with lots of

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:28.340
black lines in it, which means certain little pieces of color have been eaten away by a certain

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:36.180
amount. And so we can no longer see it as well, or not at all. Why is that happening? So if we

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:39.780
come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface. We can

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:45.140
actually never appear with our telescopes inside. We only can go after the surface.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:56.820
And the surface layer contains different kinds of elements. Every one of those

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:03.700
types of atoms – so elements are just different types of atoms – they absorb different photons

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:09.140
that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is occurring. And so that means that if

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:16.340
you're the observer with a spectrograph or without, you will see the starlight, but certain

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:21.700
frequencies, certain energies of that light will have been absorbed by all the different

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:28.980
atoms in the gas. So you see less of them. And so those are the dips. And the strength of the dips

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:39.300
tell us which element was it and how much of that element was or is in the star.

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:46.420
So we have many, many, many dips. The solar spectrum for reference, all the dips are

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:51.380
overlapping because the abundance of all the elements is so high. It's actually a very

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:56.580
complicated spectrum. My spectra really looked like a straight line, and then there's a dip here,

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:59.860
and then you have the straight line. Again, there's a dip there. The Sun doesn't have straight

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:07.140
lines. I mean, that's just all absorbed in some form or another. But the old stars have so little

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:13.620
of all the elements that they're only occasionally these dips that then indicate, okay, that one at

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:18.820
that wavelength was iron, and here we have carbon, and there's magnesium and sodium, and oh, there's

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:27.620
a little strontium line here. So we have a much easier way to map out this barcode that the spectrum

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:33.620
pretty much is at the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these,

01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:39.860
we call it absorption lines, to then calculate with existing codes that mimic the physics of

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.140
the stellar atmosphere, like how much was absorbed, what kind of elements were present

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:51.380
in the stellar atmosphere. And so this is how we get to our abundance measurements, and then

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:57.940
all together that gives us the chemical composition and that particular signature in that star.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:05.140
If you, do you ever look at like the raw spectrograph and absorption line, and they're able to see

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:12.180
into it some interesting non-standard outlier kind of patterns,

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.700
or does this have to do heavy amount of processing?

01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:25.700
We actually process our, it's fairly straightforward to do our processing. We do it at the telescope. So

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:33.060
I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes. So mostly when I do discovery

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:38.660
work, we would just take a quick look spectrum, then we process it while we observe the next star.

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:44.900
Then we take a quick look. We have what I call the summary plot. It's a collection of little

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:52.500
areas in the spectrum that have the key positions, the positions of the key elements in it. And it's

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:58.740
kind of like reading the tea leaves. I have stared at so many spectra. I just need to know, I just

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:02.740
need to see our summary plot and I can tell you exactly what the numbers are going to be.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.580
And also to tell if it's going to be promising to look at further.

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:14.420
Exactly. And so that's a thumbs up, thumbs down. Are you worth my time or not? In most cases,

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.540
it's not, or it's good enough. We can do a basic analysis, maybe publish this as part of a larger

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:25.540
sample just so we output that we have observed the star and their basic nature, that's an important

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:33.700
part to publish as well. And yeah, I had a run. So now we do remote observing. I do all of this now

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:43.940
from my home, from my living room all night long. And I often work with colleagues. So we do it over

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:50.580
Zoom and we process the data. We look at it, same thing still. And we just found a star that

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:56.900
had a very low iron abundance. And then we decided, okay, that looks interesting. We're

01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:02.180
just going to keep exposing. So we took more data on it on the spot and we're writing up

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:07.140
the paper right now. How do you know where to point the telescope? It's not random. There's

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:16.500
a lot of work that goes into that. I began my career by trying to answer that question,

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:23.700
as in like doing the search process. That's why I called my book that I've written some time ago,

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:29.780
Searching for the Oldest Stars, because searching is one thing. It's very time consuming. And then

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:37.540
on top of that, not everyone finds. And I often don't find, but I keep searching because techniques

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:43.060
have established that, yes, we can do it if we're just patient enough and keep going because it's a

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:51.220
numbers game. And that's often the case in science. And that's something that not enough is talked

01:28:51.220 --> 01:29:00.820
about, how tedious it is and how long it takes to get to that one discovery that moves the field

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:07.300
further. And how difficult it is to believe that there is a thing to be discovered. Yes, yes.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:13.940
We have the saying, I learned this, I think from my supervisor, one star is a discovery,

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:23.540
two is a sample, and three is a population. So as soon as you found three of roughly the same kind,

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:28.900
you're done. But you need to get there. Yeah. Probably the first is the hardest, right?

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:36.900
Yes. But it kind of remains really hard. But the thing is that at past three, many of us are like,

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:42.900
okay, we solved that problem. We've done it three times, we can do it. That's a thing, right? That's

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:49.140
a population, three iron deficient stars, let's say, right? That's one puzzle piece. Now we can

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.140
move on to the next thing. That's an indicator that there's many more of them, potentially.

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:59.860
Yes, yes, yes. So to cut a long story short about the searching, we started early on with

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:06.180
what's called low resolution spectroscopy of many stars. So for example, my thesis work

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:13.460
almost 20 years ago was piggybacking off a quasar survey that had collected,

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:19.780
so quasars are basically giant supermassive black holes that are really far away. So you only see

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:25.220
one big bright light point. So it looks like a star, but it's actually just a giant supermassive

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:31.780
black hole that outshines its own galaxy. And people had been trying to study those and they

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:38.820
had taken little spectra of all things in the sky and it turns out, oh, you can fish out the

01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:46.020
actual stars from that and look for certain signatures that might indicate low metallicity

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:53.780
stars, so stars with low abundances. And so it was painstaking work to then take

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.100
medium resolution spectroscopy to get a little bit more information and to use approximations

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:02.900
and to kind of get candidates that we can then eventually take to the big class like Magellan

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:08.180
to get a high resolution spectrum. So we really see the dips of all the individual elements

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:16.020
that then give us the final answer. Is it yay or nay? These days with another grad student,

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:24.740
I developed a new technique to use images actually of all the stars in the sky taken with very

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:30.580
narrow filters. So it's like you're wearing very specific glasses that only let so much light

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:38.100
through. And so we can do similar things through having several narrow band filters, what we call

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:45.140
it, to fish out things that have no absorption over here, so just the straight line and then

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:52.660
a little dip here, so a little something there. And that has proven fairly successful in recent

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:57.940
years. So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space. That's right,

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:01.780
because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack, right? They're not that

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:08.260
many left over and certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between. We need to comb through

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:15.540
all of those to get to the goods. So we always start with millions and then work our way down

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:20.660
and in the end we have like three good candidates. I wonder how those ancient stars feel that they

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:26.820
were noticed. They probably know that nobody pays attention. I'm just kidding. We're all special,

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:30.660
right? So are the stars. It's good, it's inspiring, even if you're the outcast.

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:37.380
In your pristine nature, you still might nevertheless be noticed. I'm hoping the same

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:43.780
about humans if somebody's observing us. Is there something else you could say that's

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:49.460
about the challenges of this kind of high precision measurement that you're doing?

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:59.060
So this kind of collection of data looking, trying to pull out the signal from the noise out there.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:05.700
Well, that's literally what we're doing in multiple ways actually. We're trying to find the

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:11.700
needle in the haystack and then we find something and then it turns out it's just a little bit too

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:17.620
faint to actually get the kind of data quality on it that we would like or that would be warranted

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:24.740
given the potential of the star, right? So there's always noise. There's always a little

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:29.620
bit of noise and you have to try to say like, yeah, how special is this when you're looking

01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:36.340
at the absorption line? So the most iron poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:43.220
literally almost in the noise. So you need incredibly good data to make detections.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:49.380
And the funny thing is we're looking for the nothingness of let's say the iron lines,

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:53.940
but then we don't want nothing because if there's nothing in the spectrum, we can't measure anything.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:59.220
We can only get an upper limit, but we'd really like a measurement. So we are looking for the

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.940
last little bit that you could possibly detect. And that's the strong function of the brightness

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:09.060
of the star because the telescopes have the size that they do. That's not going to change for a

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.540
while. Hopefully eventually it will, but it's going to be at least 10 years out.

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:20.020
And so yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurement. So

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:25.220
actually the record holder for the most iron poor star only has an upper limit. We can't get enough

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:30.260
data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to our theory colleagues and say like,

01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:37.140
give me this little iron out of your first star. So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:42.820
at the same time. So let's go to both sides of that spectrum. What's like the most exciting

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:48.980
discovery to you personally? Is there a moment you remember that you saw a piece of data

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:58.820
and your heart skipped a bit? Yeah, of course. Is it HE 1327?

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:03.380
That was definitely one of those moments. I wasn't actually present at the telescope,

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:09.620
but we were sent the data immediately from our colleague and we just looked at it and our eyes

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:15.860
got really wide and was like, oh my God, is this really what we think it is? So we had to run some

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:26.500
numbers and it was, and these are magical little moments. The thing is, often we have false

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:33.620
positives and so there's always this kind of period and often it's, I don't know, 10,

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:38.100
15 minutes where you need to make some tests to kind of make a decision. Is this really something

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:42.580
I should keep observing now? Is this really as good as I think or am I being fooled by something?

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:49.380
So actually if you take a spectrum of a white dwarf, a white dwarf is the leftover core of a

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:56.100
star like the sun that has gone extinct. And white dwarfs have lost all their outer atmosphere,

01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:00.180
so it's just the hydrogen-helium core. So they look like a metal pore star because

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:05.540
that's only hydrogen-helium left, right? But the hydrogen lines that you can see in the spectrum

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:11.140
of our stars and of the white dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal. So you need to have a good

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:16.980
eye just to check, does this look a little bit wider than us? Is this a white dwarf who's

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:23.700
fooling me here? And so it's like this moment, it's like, oh my God. It's just minutes of nervousness.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:29.380
Yes, yes. And sometimes, you know, it's a dud and sometimes it's not.

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:35.940
What's been a big, that you remember, heartbreak? Like a painful low point? Is it all leading up to

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.780
the first, is it all about HE 1327 again? Just the leading up to it or has there been like a,

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.540
yeah, has there been like low points in the search?

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:53.940
Um, that's a good question. I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like,

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:59.860
you won your telescope time, you traveled there, and the weather is completely cloudy,

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:06.580
it rains, and you had three nights, which is a lot, and you go home empty-handed. So that's

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:13.220
definitely a low point. Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain occupational

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:20.020
hazard to it. Which requires a kind of resilience and a patience. Yeah, and you just got to learn

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:25.220
to live with it. Coming back to reticulum too, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy,

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:30.980
that was a run that we had and the weather was incredibly bad. And I had sent my student there,

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.460
and I was at home and he calls me at 2 a.m. and he was like, Anna,

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:43.540
I think I observed the wrong star. I'm so sorry. There is this line there, this European line,

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:50.020
and it looks like a metal rich star. And I was like, it's cool. We all make mistakes.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:56.420
Send me the data. Send me that summary plot. And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:04.500
It's like, I can't really tell. It doesn't look wrong, but I can't tell you right now that it's

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:10.500
right either. So why don't you go to the next target? And he calls me back an hour later,

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:17.460
you know, it looks just the same. What am I supposed to do? And then I joked, well,

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:24.260
maybe we found an R process galaxy. Let's go to the next one. And the weather was degrading.

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:33.140
And so to cut a long story short, we had to come. So he was observing the right stars. It

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:38.340
was an R process galaxy, the first one we had ever discovered, totally

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:44.260
and I mean, unpredicted. We had no idea that this was a thing. I mean, you know,

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:52.020
of course, we thought that, you know, such a thing might possibly exist because why not,

01:38:52.660 --> 01:39:00.580
right? Neutron summer just happened somewhere. Crazy supernovae probably too. But we were not

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:08.820
prepared in that moment to find this thing. And in the end, the weather was getting worse and worse

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:14.820
and we wanted to see how many R process stars are in this galaxy. So we managed

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:22.020
by a hairline to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality was atrocious.

01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.540
And the weather affects the data quality.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:30.980
Yes, absolutely. Because these were really faint stars. And so we were really lucky by

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:37.460
making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare minimum for all the stars so we

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:43.380
could at least take a very crude look. Is it a yay or a nay? We couldn't even say yes or no,

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:49.220
just to get an idea because we needed to know. Why was that important? Because

01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:53.940
we could only observe this system again nine months later.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.700
So there's always a window of observation.

01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:02.260
Yes. It was setting. This was our chance. And it was going away with the clouds, you know?

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.700
That was super high stakes.

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:14.260
But we just made it. Really, it was almost impossible. And it was just the thing is,

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:21.540
this is such a serendipitous moment. In a serendipitous moment, the enhancement of these

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:27.380
heavy elements was so strong that even in this really crappy data, we could still see the

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:33.700
enhancement. The absorption was so strong that it stuck out of the noise. If that enhancement

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:38.100
wouldn't have been as strong, we would not have been able to say anything because we wouldn't

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:44.660
have been able to tell. But because it was so extreme, it lent us a hand, despite the

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:50.900
weather and all, to say like, yes, this is it. So that was quite the night.

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:57.860
Luck. I mean, a lot of this is just luck. So that was the first our process galaxy discovered.

01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.940
Yes. I didn't sleep all that much.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:08.260
Do you have hope? Are you excited about James Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:14.020
future that increase the resolution and the precision of what can be detected out there?

01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:20.740
Absolutely. JWST is fantastic already. I am not planning to use it personally, although I think

01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:27.060
I'm on one or two observing proposals actually, because similar to what we already spoke about,

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:31.220
we're interested in the same thing. We're just kind of looking at different sides of the fence.

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:37.780
I have my old surviving stars, and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:44.100
galaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that contributed energy and elements and all

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:51.300
these things. And my JWST colleagues, they try to detect some of these earliest photons from these

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:57.700
earliest systems to look at the energetics and other things, what was there, how many,

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:03.700
these kinds of things. So together, we're trying to explore this first billion years,

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:10.580
but we do it in very complimentary ways. And so I'm very excited to see what they can come up with

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:16.500
and how that helps me to inform my stories better and more comprehensively.

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:23.540
What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archaeology? How much can we,

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:28.740
maybe what are the limits of our understanding of this first billion years of our universe?

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:36.900
Well, obviously lots of limitations in the sense that I always say I have a metal poor star for

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:43.940
any of your questions, because there are so many different kinds out there. And we still find new

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:48.420
patterns sometimes, right? And there needs to be an explanation. The question is, is it ultimately

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:53.460
just one quirky star or is it two, is it three, right? Is it a sample, is it a population? So

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:59.060
we haven't concluded that kind of work yet. So every metal poor star is a kind of data

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:03.780
point that you can use to improve the quality of your model of how is the evolution of the

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:11.220
early universe. Yes, yes. And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years. When

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:16.020
I joined that field, it was in its infancy and there was this serendipitous discovery of that

01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:23.780
first second generation star. And we have filled in the canvas a great deal since then. And this

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:29.780
is what I have greatly enjoyed about doing so, because there was so much discovery potential.

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:39.860
And it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress. It's on the up and coming

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:45.940
again because there's so many large spectroscopic surveys in the works now that will just provide

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:52.180
a different level of data that we haven't had before. I'm sort of of this older generation.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:57.220
I have only very few colleagues. I work in small teams and I observe every single star myself.

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:06.740
Whatever I can, I do myself. I don't generally take other people's data, at least certainly not

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:15.380
in the end stage. And I'm not a big data kind of person, although we all headed that way. I certainly

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:23.380
use data from the Gaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example. But that's personally

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:30.340
a new thing for me to use sort of big sky surveys that are available. So it's still a very sort of

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:37.540
hand-grown field where we do our individual observations. I have enjoyed that a lot,

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:42.100
but that's about to change. So one star at a time. Yes. I mean, there's power to that,

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:47.380
to build up intuition of the early universe by looking one star at a time. Yeah. And this is how

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:52.580
you can really drill down on the questions that you have because you control what data you get.

01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:58.420
Otherwise, you have the data that you have. You get what you get and you don't get upset.

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:04.500
I don't like that. I'm a little bit snobby. I really like to formulate my questions,

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.340
go to the telescope, and then come what may, I will try to get it. And also develop the intuition

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.660
of where the data can be relied upon and when it can't and all the different quirks of the data and

01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:20.580
all that kind of stuff. Sometimes a lot is lost in the aggregation of the noisy data.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:25.540
Yeah. And that's always the danger if you have someone else's data that you just don't really

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:32.340
understand the limitations, completeness things, how certain things were set up,

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.980
and you get out what you put in. So I'm really particular about that and it certainly paid off

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:45.540
for me. That's one of the main notions that I try to teach in my classes and to my students,

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:50.820
that you need to be able to formulate your question really well because otherwise you're

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:56.980
going to get an answer to a different question, but you won't notice that the goalpost has shifted

01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:02.100
in the meantime. So your interpretation can only be as good as the question. If you need to change

01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:09.220
your question, that's cool. Do it. But then it needs to pair up with your interpretation again.

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:16.980
And so really being in the know about every step of what happens, that leads to quality results,

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:23.220
that's why I have sometimes little trouble with big data and statistical analysis. Yes, on average

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:29.860
that's true. I'm not debating that, but I'm the kind of person I like to look at the outliers,

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:36.100
so not the bulk, but the special ones. And they just need to be treated in a different way and

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:40.020
there needs to be an acknowledgement of that, different ways for different things.

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:46.420
So big data can look at divorce rates and perhaps you and I are more interested in the

01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:54.900
individual love stories. Yes, that works for me. So I don't know if it's possible to say,

01:46:54.900 --> 01:47:02.340
but what do you think is the big discoveries that are waiting? Is it on the different dynamics of the

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:09.460
yield, the common narrative, the common story of how some of these metal poor stars are formed?

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:14.100
Where are the discoveries in this field that you think will come?

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:21.060
I think the individual discoveries are actually, we've made most of those,

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:28.500
certainly through individual stars. Finding yet another second generation star is incredibly

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:35.620
important for me, but isn't really going to move the needle. Finding 50 of them or 100 of them,

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:42.900
that would move the needle, but that's in order or two magnitudes up. And new search techniques

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:48.980
and new surveys may enable that, but would you still call that a discovery?

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.340
So that's just a scale. That's a scale.

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:57.780
Yes. So I think about it more like literally of the puzzle. Let's say you have a thousand piece

01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:05.540
puzzle and you have 900 pieces in there. If you're a person like me, I want to get to the last ones

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:09.620
I'm not going to leave it. It's like, okay, I see broadly what this is going to look like, right?

01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:16.900
I'm done now. No, I want to get to the last one. Is the picture globally going to change? No.

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:22.260
Are we going to figure out all the details and how it really works? Yes.

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:29.540
So really carefully getting into it. Getting a detailed map of the ancient stars of our

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:36.260
universe. Because I think that's what many of us scientists are a little bit detailed obsessed,

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:41.700
but I think that's our job too, right? To really kind of make it airtight, to really walk away

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:51.460
saying, I fully understand this. Not just broadly, but I really know. We really know now. And so

01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:58.500
more and more of that is going to happen. And so I think this is probably true across astronomy,

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:06.100
these individual 10 sigma discoveries become less and less. If they were easy, we would have

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:13.220
made them already, right? Which means we have made many of them. But really filling in the details

01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:19.140
is the next sort of level of discovery. Maybe we need to find a new word for that.

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:27.860
The hopes and expectations that go along with the word discovery are so enormous. We may not

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:34.180
always be able to live up to that. But it doesn't mean that we're not finding out new things. It's

01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:39.300
just a different kind of quality because the questions have shifted. You close one door,

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:45.860
suddenly there are 10 new open doors that we want to explore and march through. And that's finding

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:51.140
these last puzzle pieces here and there that really make it airtight. And so there's a lot of

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:57.140
value and a lot of power and beauty to the discovery in the big picture of our universe

01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:05.300
and in the details. We need both, absolutely. Perhaps drifting into the philosophical,

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:12.580
let me ask about the Big Bang as we kind of encroach onto it. So your work is kind of

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:19.940
taking steps back through time in a weird way. Do you think we'll get to deeper and deeper understand

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:27.220
the really, really early days of the Big Bang? And the philosophical question, do you think we'll be

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:32.180
able to understand what was before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened? Do you think about

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:40.580
that stuff? Not with stars, for better or for worse, because stars only probe the time when they were

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:47.380
formed and the Big Bang is surely before then. I mean, I often talk to my students about the

01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:53.940
difference between math and physics. Let me give you an example. We talked earlier about

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:59.940
HG 1523, and I was happy to share with you that I measure thorium and uranium, but I actually

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:06.420
didn't quite close that loop. So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age for these stars.

01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:15.540
But they rely on us knowing how the R process works, how these elements are created, where

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:21.060
it happens, and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in the next

01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:27.300
generation star. So quite a few question marks. So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:33.300
years. This is probably not accurate, but this is the best calculation we could do.

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:39.540
And the reason why I'm bringing this up is that that was actually the average of multiple

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:45.460
elemental ratios that each gave a certain age, and then we averaged that because

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:50.500
for better or for worse, this is the best we can do. So some of these numbers said,

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:56.260
oh, this star is 15 billion years old. And then others said, oh, this is 10 billion years old.

01:51:56.260 --> 01:52:03.300
And so I often use that in my class to say, what's the good news and what's the bad news here?

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:12.260
Some ratios say 15 something, 10, right? Is 15 correct? And then I asked them,

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:17.860
and some people will say something. And so the thing here is that it's an absolutely

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:22.500
correct calculation given the mathematical and physical model that we constructed.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:28.820
But does it make sense? No, it doesn't. If we believe the universe is 13.8 billion years old,

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:35.460
15 is ridiculous, yet it is correct. Isn't that interesting? Correct from a mathematics

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:40.500
perspective. Yes, it is not incorrect because this is what I calculated. Nobody made a mistake. Now,

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:44.660
we can question whether that's a good model, but that's a separate issue.

01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:48.020
So you're saying physicists are much closer to truth than mathematicians?

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:55.780
Well, it depends. Sometimes yes and sometimes no, right? So what our job as physicists is,

01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:01.060
is to take the mathematical model, calculate our numbers, and then ask the question,

01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:09.060
does this make sense, right? Now, in the case of 15, it doesn't, but we took the average anyway,

01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:15.700
because that was the best we could do, right? So, all right, let's put that aside. Let's apply the

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:21.220
same sort of thinking to the Big Bang, right? Math can tell us things that we, as physicists,

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:26.820
cannot grasp because it doesn't make sense to us. Now, in the case of the Big Bang, that's a special

01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:33.140
case because we don't actually know what's supposed to make sense. And this is where things get

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:38.420
interesting, but this is where math will ultimately be the winner because we can no longer say this

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:43.620
makes sense or this doesn't make sense because the physics is broken down. But math breaks down,

01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:48.340
too, in the singularity of things. Well, depending on who you ask.

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:55.700
Okay, sure, sure. This is the current question, right? How far, how much further can we push

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:59.540
math, let's say, to the front of the Big Bang if there is such a thing?

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.980
What's the front and the back? What's the front? The front is the-

01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.940
Before the Big Bang. Oh, before the Big Bang. The front, okay.

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.060
To clarify, all the doorways and the entrances.

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:17.700
So how far can we let the math go before that stops to make sense, right? And I don't know

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:23.620
what the answer is to that, but it's really cool that because math is not limited by our

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:28.740
physical nature, it can probably go a little bit further than the physics.

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:34.580
Yeah. And math can go into more dimensions than four dimensions comfortably.

01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:39.860
And it's judgment-free because it just calculates things on its own. As physicists,

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:44.820
we are so judgmental. This makes sense, this doesn't make sense, right? It doesn't get any

01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:54.100
worse. It's such a beautiful dance. It's so amazing that through this dance, you can explore

01:54:54.100 --> 01:55:00.900
the origins of the universe. Doesn't the Big Bang just blow your mind that this thing has just

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:05.300
started from a point and now we're here? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:12.500
Hydrogen and helium. And then all the stuff you're studying, I mean, this evolution of

01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:19.860
chemistry created humans and we're here talking and there's a lot more to the story.

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.300
It's amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:31.780
And this kind of march that you're doing is observing data. Is there,

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:39.140
you're looking at old light and old data. But only a few thousand years, right?

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:40.980
Just a few thousand years. That's the difference

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.780
between me and my JWST colleagues. Yes.

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:49.700
Their objects, that light has traveled 13 billion years or whatever it was to us and they're

01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:55.300
observing that now. My light has only traveled a few thousand years. It's nothing.

01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:57.780
So whatever you observe now is likely still going on.

01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.180
Yes. These stars are alive and kicking and having a blast.

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:07.460
A thousand years. Just a few thousand years, that's all it takes. If we can travel close

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.980
to the speed of light, maybe we can reach out there.

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.580
We wouldn't have any planets around those stars though.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:20.420
So that's, is that a definitive intuition? Well, what are planets made of? Elements,

01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:24.820
right? To take the earth. It was all heavy elements, right? The universe needed to

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:30.980
reach a certain stage first to have produced enough of all these elements to actually make

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:35.060
a planet. So on average you're, okay, right. So that took quite a few billion years.

01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:38.900
So they're not going to have a mechanism for forming planets. You could have visitors

01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:44.900
probably, but the kinematics of that are unlikely. Yeah, I would say so.

01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:51.700
So they're interesting in that they reveal the early chemical evolution of the universe.

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:52.980
Yes. Not that they're,

01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:58.260
they could be good vacation spots, but not... Well, it'd be like a worm.

01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:07.300
No planet islands to go to, to chill. In your book, you highlight the major

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:14.660
contributions in the field by many women. Some of these women were not, as you describe,

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.980
immediately credited for their discoveries. So for me, from a computer science perspective,

01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:26.980
the story you also tell is Harvard computers. Who were these women and what can you just

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.340
say about the nature of science and humanity?

01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:36.340
Discovering things is part of the human nature, right? And so it has happened for the longest time,

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:46.500
not just by men, but also by many women. The field of stellar astronomy, which is my field,

01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:52.740
has particularly benefited from many discoveries made by women. You mentioned the Harvard

01:57:52.740 --> 01:58:02.100
computers. That's a term used for women who worked about a hundred years ago at the Harvard

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:10.180
College Observatory, and they were hired for their low wages and willingness to do diligent

01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:19.060
and patient work to comb through the big data of the day. So the observatory director,

01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:28.980
they were carrying out large sky surveys at the time and that data needed to be processed and

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:36.900
looked at and analyzed. And so many women or several dozens, one or two dozen women over the

01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:45.380
years were hired to do this work. And in the process, because they were looking at the actual

01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:51.940
data and they were smart, even though they had often no formal education, they made a lot of

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:59.220
discoveries simply by being in tune with what they were doing. So they weren't robots as the

01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:10.340
term computer would perhaps lead on. So Annie Jump Cannon classified thousands and thousands of

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:18.900
spectra and found out that stars have different temperatures and their spectra look according.

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:27.700
We still use that classification sequence today. Cecilia Payne Gaposhkin later on in,

01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:39.780
I think 1925, was one of the first women to obtain a PhD in stellar astronomy. And she figured out,

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:47.060
she calculated that the sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. That seems normal

01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:54.420
to many of us these days, but at the time it was thought that celestial objects are made of the

01:59:54.420 --> 02:00:00.500
same thing as the earth. That's a gutsy, amazing discovery.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:07.540
Yes. It was later termed the most important thesis of humankind or something like that.

02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:16.340
What a revelation to realize that stars are made of hydrogen and helium. And this was exactly the

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:21.220
time when people figured out why stars are shining, namely because of nuclear fusion and that it's

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:29.140
protons and the tunneling effect that leads to the actual fusion. Otherwise, the protons repulse

02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:35.780
each other. They don't come together. And so what an incredible time it was back then. And so stars

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:42.020
and nuclear physics were very closely related and it remains. Now it's called nuclear astrophysics.

02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:48.100
And so many women had many contributions to that. Of course, prior to that Marie Curie

02:00:49.060 --> 02:01:01.940
discovered two new elements. Oh, so awesome. Radium and polonium. Lisa Meitner discovered

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:07.460
nuclear fission. That is the basis for understanding the R process. This is exactly

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:16.900
what happens in the R process. The heavy nuclei, let's say uranium, if you bombarded with a neutron,

02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:26.740
we talked at length about it, it will fission, it will split into barium and krypton, let's say.

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:31.780
So two lighter elements. That's exactly what we observe. I have always a higher abundance

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:36.420
of barium than the heavier elements because of this fission cycling that she calculated

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:47.940
in 1938, 1939. So many, many contributions. And it's just so remarkable if you just take that

02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:57.220
body of work, that changed how we do things, how we see the universe, how we understand things,

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:02.020
has led to so many subsequent discoveries, good ones and bad.

02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:08.020
Well, all of it is taken together. That's progress.

02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:14.980
Science is what it is. We have to decide what we do with that knowledge. We can always use things

02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:22.100
for good or for bad. That's part of the human endeavor as well. And also part of the human

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.300
endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption and credit assignment and all these

02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:33.380
kinds of things that make this whole ride so damn interesting about what's right and wrong and about

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.820
the nature of good and evil. And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places, all the

02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:44.900
time. Yes, yes. Lisa Meitner was nominated for the Nobel Prize 40 times, more than that even.

02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:51.620
It's amazing. She holds the record for that. She never received it. Case in point.

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.620
Yeah. And of course the Nobel Prize has its complexities. One is the credit assignment,

02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:04.660
but two, even in astronomy, sort of assigning credit to a handful of folks

02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:08.100
when so many more contributed. That's a complicated story also.

02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:09.060
Yeah, it's very complex.

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:15.300
Okay. Sorry for the romantic question, but what to you is the most beautiful idea in astronomy,

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.460
in stellar astronomy?

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:25.940
Well, so early on, when I was in high school, I was thinking like, okay, what do I want to do

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:31.460
when I grow up, right? I knew I wanted to do astronomy, but I was a little bit torn because

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:37.460
my interests were definitely stars, stellar astronomy, but also chemistry. I always had

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:44.740
a fascination about the elements, so Marie Curie was a big role model. My friend actually

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:55.700
produced a beautiful movie about the discovery of the elements. It's a theater play, but digitized,

02:03:56.660 --> 02:04:02.740
where when I saw it, I could actually kind of relive the sort of discovery moment that Marie

02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:09.700
Curie had. It sent shivers down my spine. It was fantastic. I mean, this is the kind of thing that

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:17.300
I wanted to experience. But yeah, so nuclear physics and element creation and formation was

02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:21.140
really interesting to me, chemistry, the elements, stars, and all of that. And I was like,

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:25.540
I don't know if I ever find something that combines all of these things.

02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:32.500
And then I ended up in Australia and I met this person and he was working on old stars. And as I

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:40.260
was sitting in his talk, hearing about this for the first time, it kind of clicked all over my

02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:47.060
head and was like, oh my God, it all fell in place because we can use these old stars to study the

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:53.060
elements, to learn how they're formed. We can get these clean signatures that help us inform the

02:04:53.060 --> 02:05:00.580
nuclear synthesis processes. And of course, I need to know a lot about stars too. So it's

02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:06.100
like all together. And that was sort of a moment of magic. And then the fact that

02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:11.140
I have now done that for 20 years, it's just like I won the lottery.

02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:13.060
It all clicked into place.

02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:18.900
So in some sense, it's an ongoing love story for me, if I could say it like that,

02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:28.100
where I found my stars, my thing. And I am fortunate enough to be able to keep doing that.

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:36.020
And I'm happy to see where it will take me. It's an evolution, as with every relationship.

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:42.420
If you don't march forward, you move backwards. I'm not interested in moving backwards.

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:47.460
So I'm letting the field and the discoveries and the findings lead me.

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:57.460
It's not hard for me to follow sort of my hunches. And sometimes even at the telescope,

02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:03.140
it's like, let's take a look at this one. I have a good feeling. And then usually something

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:14.100
good or not bad pops out at the end. And I really like that A, that I have the freedom to do that,

02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:19.220
that I'm allowed to follow my hunches. Too many people, I think, are sort of boxed in with their

02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:23.860
job or their life. They don't have that kind of freedom. That's really important to me. And I

02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:30.580
certainly try to make use of that. I also try to teach that to others to trust them, to learn.

02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:34.100
You need to learn your things, but then you need to also trust that knowledge and that

02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:41.940
you have a grasp on it. You get out what you put in. And being able to contribute in meaningful

02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:51.940
ways to our knowledge about our cosmic ancestry, our cosmic history, that's a wonderful thing.

02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:57.300
In this way, your personal love story with the stars evolves.

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:02.260
What advice, you've already spoken to it a little bit, but what advice would you give to young

02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:07.620
people that are trying to find the same kind of love story in their career, in their life?

02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:15.300
It seems increasingly hard for folks to find that. Sometimes I feel

02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:24.100
that young people have all the opportunities these days, and that's wonderful. But it's

02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:30.100
that's wonderful. But it's almost like that leads to some... What's the right word? They're

02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:35.940
a little bit too tired to make all the decisions because at some point, you need to put your eggs

02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:41.780
in a basket, and you need to be okay with that. We can't do all the things, even though we're

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:46.420
often told you can be president, too. And I think that's really important to convey.

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:50.980
But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one job or one type of profession.

02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:57.860
I'm not saying you need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees.

02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:07.060
And so lots of people, I think, are often afraid to really dig in, at least for some time,

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:11.380
and get their hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up.

02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:12.260
On one thing.

02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:16.900
On one thing, because they're afraid they're missing out on 99 other things.

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:23.620
But life is a little bit missing out on 99 other things because we only have 24 hours in a day.

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:29.300
I have that feeling very often. There are so many things I would like to do,

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:35.060
many things I would like to try to be good at. Sometimes I wish I had a different job,

02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:39.220
because I have other interests, too, but I realized, okay, I can only do one thing.

02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:47.460
So I have no regrets. But this is a general feeling that I think most of us have.

02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:55.060
But if it stops you from really drilling down on one thing, to become an expert on one thing,

02:08:55.060 --> 02:09:02.260
to become really good at one thing that you call your own, then it just makes it difficult.

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:09.300
And so a fulfilling life is in part likely to be discovered in the singular pursuit of a thing,

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:09.940
of one thing.

02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.500
At least for a time.

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:16.420
Yeah, for some time, with your heart and your hands.

02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:21.300
Because I think most people long to own something.

02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:29.940
We all, I think, want to leave some legacy of some sorts for our children, for humanity,

02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:37.220
for this planet. And I think it's really important for young people to strive for that

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:42.660
and not lose sight or trade that for all the opportunities, because an opportunity is nothing

02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:47.860
if you don't do anything. You need to do something at the end of the day.

02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:52.020
So I chat with lots of people about this, and I often start by just saying, hey,

02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:57.380
tell me what you don't like. Because it's often much easier to-

02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.180
Just narrow it down, narrow it down, narrow it down.

02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:06.100
Let out what's not on your plate. And then this way we get a little bit closer. And then it's like,

02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:10.900
well, why don't you take a risk and just sign up for something for three months?

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:12.580
But that's what it feels like.

02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:16.500
That's what it feels like. And it is that, is a risk. Commitment is a risk.

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:21.140
Because you're basically sacrificing all the other possible options.

02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:25.460
But then I guess you have to trust the magic you noticed in that thing.

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:30.500
If you notice one thing, just stick with it. And then maybe there's something there.

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:36.180
Right, right. And this moment of kind of feeling it in your entire body and mind,

02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:41.060
that this is the right thing. Getting there is probably really hard.

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:44.180
But if you don't try, you won't find out.

02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:47.460
The hard stuff is the fun stuff. That's also another thing to find out.

02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:48.740
And then there is that, yes.

02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:54.980
Somehow, it doesn't make sense. You also mentioned that you've taken a little

02:10:54.980 --> 02:11:01.220
stroll into the artistic representation of yourself. Can you speak to that for a little bit?

02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:09.380
Yes. Well, I already just mentioned, sometimes I wish I had more time to do other things.

02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:17.540
So I find little sideways, I guess, to pursue things that I like besides astronomy,

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:24.100
or at least I try to find connections. And so some years ago, I, again, with the help

02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:33.780
of my friend who made this Marie Curie movie, she and I wrote a one-woman play where I actually

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:41.460
portray Lise Meitner, who was an Austrian-German nuclear physicist. I'm from Germany, so I have

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:51.300
the right accent for that. And we wrote this play about this moment of discovery of nuclear fission.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:57.860
Again, this is an absolutely critical piece that explains my work today.

02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:04.820
And we all stand on the shoulder of giants. She was one of those giants. And in some ways,

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:11.540
it's, of course, a way for me to acknowledge other people's work that have come before me.

02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:17.620
It's a wonderful way to highlight the contribution by a prominent woman.

02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:28.660
And the way I do it, it's a 25-minute play in costume where I relive for people the

02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:37.060
moment of discovery. Then I turn into myself, and then I give a 30-minute presentation on

02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:42.980
the art process and the creation of heavy elements, because the audience can now perfectly

02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:49.060
understand that the public audience, given the historic backdrop of this discovery, that they

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:56.500
just lived through my presentation. And it's a wonderful compliment that almost spends a

02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:05.380
hundred years from one woman to the next passing on the torch. And when we write up our results

02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:09.860
in, let's say, in magazines like Nature and Science, it's always about the results

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:19.780
on the golden platter, perfectly prepared. The discovery is never described, only ever the results.

02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:25.780
You asked me beforehand, right, what does it feel to be at the telescope in this moment, right?

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:32.820
I'm happy to talk about this, but it's nowhere written, never. Nobody really talks about it.

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:42.260
And so having a form of, you know, theater, of the arts to bring this exciting moment,

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:49.300
that is what we all want to experience as scientists, to a wider audience is so profound

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:55.460
and so rewarding. And they all love it, because everyone can understand a moment of discovery.

02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:00.340
I was looking for something, and then I found it. It's like you misplace car keys, right?

02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.660
Mm-hmm. Or love.

02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:06.100
Yes, yes. Everyone can understand that.

02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:07.620
Both the glorious experiences, yes.

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:15.460
The implications and the findings, that is much harder to understand for anyone. This is where

02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:21.700
the scientist's work truly lies. This is our job. But the moment of discovery is easy,

02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:28.340
and it's beautiful, and it needs to be said. And so taking my audience on this journey,

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:34.980
what is the perils? What are my worries? And then, oh, here is the moment of discovery.

02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:42.980
Let me tell you about it. It profoundly transformed me. And here's how it went, right? It's so good.

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:47.220
And art is a way to reveal this fundamental human side of science.

02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:54.420
Yes. The problem with science is that's people doing it. Maybe not a problem, but that is it.

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:58.660
That's also what makes it beautiful, right? I mean, humans are fascinating in that we're

02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:02.340
able to come up with these ideas through all the struggle, through all the hardship,

02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:08.500
through all the hope, through all the search. And so the art's a great way to portray that

02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:14.340
and to broadcast that, right? I think this is how the audience really should be interacting with

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:20.020
scientists, much less about the findings, but really more about this yearning for answers,

02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:25.620
right? I need to find these khakis. I need it because I need to go, right? It's like now, now.

02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:34.100
And then, oh, God, here it is. Now I can go my merry ways. It's so relatable. We just need to

02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:40.820
find more and better ways to do that. So I hope to turn this into also a digitized version at

02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:46.260
some point to, again, make it more accessible. I hope so too. So far, I'm just doing it in person.

02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:53.620
I would love it. I think a lot of people would love to see it. So I hope you do just that.

02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:57.860
Let me ask you a big ridiculous question. You look up at the stars, you look up at the

02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:05.540
early, early, early stars. So let me ask the big question that we humans often ask

02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:10.820
and struggle to answer. What's the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here?

02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:18.500
We talked about the biological evolution requires the chemical evolution for all of this to kind of

02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:25.460
play out and carbon played this important role. And in some sense, we're just a consequence of

02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:32.340
all of these things being the way they are, right? So maybe this is just where we are supposed to be

02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:41.380
because the laws of physics sort of work the way they do. And we talked much about the variety of

02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:51.620
everything really in certainly from over here to over there and things in the vicinity of where

02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:57.940
the sun and the solar system formed, they were the way they were. And life maybe was a necessary

02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:03.220
consequence of that. In some sense, I like to believe that because then it becomes reproducible

02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:08.660
and we can apply that same argument elsewhere. If it's total chance, right, that makes it harder.

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:17.940
That's not truly satisfying to a scientist. So it's a consequence of psychological evolution,

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:22.020
which is a consequence of biological evolution, which is a consequence of chemical evolution,

02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:27.620
consequence of physical evolution, whatever disciplines. It's turtles on top of turtles.

02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:34.180
Turtles all the way down. Yes. You have studied some of the most ancient turtles.

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:39.540
Yes. At the very bottom of the thing. That's right. They live for quite a while.

02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:46.420
Yes, they do. Well, thank you for your incredible work. Thank you for highlighting both the human

02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:52.020
side and the deep scientific side. I'm a huge fan of your work and thank you for everything you do.

02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:55.860
And thank you for talking today. This is awesome. Of course. It was wonderful. Thank you.

02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:00.740
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Anifer Bell. To support this podcast,

02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:05.540
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:12.740
Douglas Adams in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Far out in the uncharted backwaters

02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:19.940
of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:27.060
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green

02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:33.540
planet whose Abe-descendant lifeforms are so amazingly primitive that they still think

02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:40.260
digital watches are a pretty neat idea. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
