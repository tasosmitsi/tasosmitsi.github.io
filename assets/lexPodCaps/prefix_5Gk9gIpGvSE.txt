00:00.000 --> 00:01.460
people all around the world,

00:01.460 --> 00:03.940
their lives are basically dependent on fossil fuels.

00:03.940 --> 00:06.740
And so the idea that we're gonna get people off

00:06.740 --> 00:08.420
by making it so expensive

00:08.420 --> 00:11.860
that it becomes impossible for them to live good lives

00:11.860 --> 00:13.900
is almost morally reprehensible.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.540
People who have the most basic science literacy,

00:16.540 --> 00:18.940
like who know the most about greenhouse effect,

00:18.940 --> 00:22.220
they're at both ends of the spectrum of views on climate,

00:22.220 --> 00:23.740
dismissives and alarmed.

00:23.740 --> 00:27.600
What is likely the worst effect of climate change?

00:28.580 --> 00:32.500
The following is a conversation with Bjorn Lomborg

00:32.500 --> 00:36.420
and Andrew Refkin on the topic of climate change.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.300
It is framed as a debate,

00:38.300 --> 00:41.380
but with the goal of having a nuanced conversation

00:41.380 --> 00:44.700
talking with each other, not at each other.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.060
I hope to continue having debates like these,

00:47.060 --> 00:49.660
including on controversial topics.

00:49.660 --> 00:51.860
I believe in the power of conversation

00:51.860 --> 00:53.640
to bring people together,

00:53.640 --> 00:56.380
not to convince one side or the other,

00:56.400 --> 00:57.880
but to enlighten both

00:57.880 --> 01:00.180
with the insights and wisdom that each hold.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.960
Bjorn Lomborg is the president

01:02.960 --> 01:05.280
of Copenhagen Consensus Think Tank

01:05.280 --> 01:09.040
and author of False Alarm, Cool It,

01:09.040 --> 01:12.120
and Skeptical Environmentalist.

Please check out his work at lomborg.com

01:14.600 --> 01:18.640
that includes his books, articles, and other writing.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.960
Andrew Refkin is one of the most respected journalists

01:21.960 --> 01:24.360
in the world on the topic of climate.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.860
He's been writing about global environmental change

01:26.860 --> 01:29.580
and risk for more than 30 years,

01:29.580 --> 01:32.300
20 of it at the New York Times.

Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.540
And now, dear friends,

01:46.540 --> 01:50.300
here's Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Refkin.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.900
There's a spectrum of belief

01:52.900 --> 01:54.720
on the topic of climate change,

01:54.720 --> 01:56.760
and the landscape of that spectrum

01:56.760 --> 01:59.640
has probably changed over several decades.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.000
On one extreme, there's a belief

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
that climate change is a hoax.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.560
It's not human-caused.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.140
To pile on top of that, there's a belief

02:07.140 --> 02:10.360
that institutions, scientific, political, the media,

02:10.360 --> 02:15.020
are corrupt and are kind of constructing this fabrication.

02:15.020 --> 02:15.860
That's one extreme.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.880
And then the other extreme,

02:17.880 --> 02:22.200
there's a level of alarmism

02:22.200 --> 02:25.260
about the catastrophic impacts of climate change

02:25.260 --> 02:29.860
that lead to the extinction of human civilization.

02:29.860 --> 02:33.740
So not just economic costs, hardship, suffering,

02:33.740 --> 02:35.260
but literally the destruction

02:35.260 --> 02:38.340
of the human species in the short term.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.860
Okay, so that's the spectrum.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.260
And I would love to find the center.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.440
And my sense is,

02:44.440 --> 02:46.840
and the reason I wanted to talk to the two of you,

02:46.840 --> 02:51.840
aside from the humility with which you approach this topic,

02:52.260 --> 02:54.500
is I feel like you're close to the center

02:54.500 --> 02:57.900
and are on different sides of that center,

02:57.900 --> 02:59.860
if it's possible to define the center.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.540
There is a political center

03:01.540 --> 03:03.720
for center left and center right.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.420
Of course, it's very difficult to define.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.180
But can you help me define what the extremes are again,

03:08.180 --> 03:10.620
as they have changed over the years, what they are today,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.160
and where's the center?

03:12.160 --> 03:13.100
Oh, boy.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.820
Well, in a way, on this issue,

03:14.820 --> 03:15.980
I think there is no center,

03:15.980 --> 03:19.020
except in this, if you're looking on social media

03:19.020 --> 03:21.380
or if you're looking on TV,

03:21.380 --> 03:23.080
there are people who are trying to fabricate the idea

03:23.080 --> 03:24.520
there's a single question.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.480
And that's the first mistake.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.380
We are developing a new relationship with the climate system

03:32.320 --> 03:35.400
and we're rethinking our energy systems.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.440
And those are very disconnected in so many ways

03:39.440 --> 03:40.960
that connect around climate change.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.080
But the first way to me to overcome this idea

03:44.080 --> 03:48.360
of there is this polarized universe around this issue

03:48.360 --> 03:50.440
is to step back and say,

03:50.500 --> 03:51.720
what is this actually?

03:51.720 --> 03:53.820
And when you do, you realize it's kind of

03:53.820 --> 03:56.900
an uncomfortable collision between old energy norms

03:56.900 --> 04:01.060
and a growing awareness of how the planet works,

04:01.060 --> 04:03.420
that if you keep adding gases that are invisible,

04:03.420 --> 04:05.100
it's the bubbles in beer.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.660
If you keep adding that to the atmosphere

04:06.660 --> 04:08.980
because it accumulates, that will change everything.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.740
It is changing everything for thousands of years.

04:10.740 --> 04:11.780
It's already happening.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.340
What do you mean by bubbles in beer?

04:13.340 --> 04:16.580
CO2, carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.860
Why beer?

04:17.860 --> 04:19.100
Look, because I like beer.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.280
It's also in Coca-Cola.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.040
We were talking about cola before.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.520
And so it's innocuous.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.080
We grew up with this idea is CO2,

04:27.080 --> 04:29.600
unless you're trapped in a room suffocating,

04:30.600 --> 04:31.880
is an innocuous gas.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.960
It's plant food, it's beer bubbles.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.600
And the idea we can swiftly transition to a world

04:39.600 --> 04:43.640
where that gas is a pollutant, regulated,

04:43.640 --> 04:48.280
tamped down from the top is fantastical.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.740
Having looked at this for 35 years,

04:50.740 --> 04:52.860
I brought along one of my tokens.

04:52.860 --> 04:56.660
This is my 1988 cover story on global warming.

04:56.660 --> 05:00.380
The greenhouse effect discovered in 1988.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.020
Jim Hansen, the famous American climate scientist,

05:03.020 --> 05:05.500
really he stimulated this article

05:05.500 --> 05:08.280
by doing this dramatic testimony

05:08.280 --> 05:10.100
in a Senate committee that summer,

05:10.100 --> 05:12.060
in May, actually spring, late spring.

05:12.060 --> 05:14.980
It was a hot day and he got headlines

05:14.980 --> 05:16.420
and this was the result.

05:16.420 --> 05:17.700
But it's complicated.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.960
Look what we were selling on the back cover.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.860
What you see is only tobacco.

05:21.860 --> 05:22.700
Cigarettes.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.000
Tobacco.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.840
Yeah.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.640
Looking back at my own career on the climate question,

05:27.640 --> 05:29.720
it's no longer a belief fight over

05:29.720 --> 05:30.960
is global warming real or not.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.840
You say, well, what kind of energy future do you want?

05:32.840 --> 05:36.460
That's a very different question than stop global warming.

05:36.460 --> 05:40.920
And when you look at climate, actually,

05:40.920 --> 05:43.120
I had this learning journey on my reporting

05:44.300 --> 05:45.960
where I started out with this

05:46.020 --> 05:47.620
as the definition of the problem.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.220
The 70s and 80s, pollution was changing things

05:52.220 --> 05:53.600
that were making things bad.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.740
So really focusing on the greenhouse effect

05:55.740 --> 05:56.580
and the pollution.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.580
But what I missed, the big thing that I missed

05:58.580 --> 06:02.340
of the first 15 years of my reporting from 1988

06:02.340 --> 06:04.140
through about 2007,

06:05.820 --> 06:10.580
when I was at the New York Times in the middle there,

06:10.580 --> 06:12.000
was that we're building vulnerability

06:12.000 --> 06:13.860
to climate hazards at the same time.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.480
So climate is changing, but we're changing too.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.600
And where we are here in Austin, Texas is a great example.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.520
Flash flood alley named in the 1920s, west of here.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.120
Everyone forgot about flash floods,

06:28.120 --> 06:32.240
built these huge developments along these river basins

06:32.240 --> 06:34.080
that in one side starts saying global warming,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.200
global warming.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.120
And the other side is not recognizing

06:38.120 --> 06:41.920
that we built willfully, greedily,

06:42.620 --> 06:45.860
the vulnerability in places of utter hazard.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.860
Same things played out in Pakistan

06:47.860 --> 06:49.300
and in Fort Myers, Florida.

06:50.420 --> 06:51.500
And you start to understand

06:51.500 --> 06:53.420
that we're creating a landscape of risk

06:54.820 --> 06:57.780
as climate is changing, then it feels,

06:57.780 --> 06:59.380
oh my God, that's more complex, right?

06:59.380 --> 07:01.020
But it also gives you more action points.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.780
It's like, okay, well, we know how to design better.

07:03.780 --> 07:07.900
We know that today's coasts won't be tomorrow's coasts.

07:07.900 --> 07:08.740
Work with that.

07:08.740 --> 07:11.700
And then let's chart an energy future at the same time.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.960
So the story became so different.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.920
It didn't become like a story you could package

07:16.920 --> 07:20.240
into a magazine article or the like.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.760
And it just led me to a whole different way

07:21.760 --> 07:24.440
of even my journalism changed over time.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.800
So I don't fight the belief, disbelief fight anymore.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.800
I think it's actually kind of a waste.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.880
It's a good way to start the discussion

07:32.880 --> 07:34.280
cause that's where we're at.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.200
But this isn't about to me going forward from where we're at,

07:38.200 --> 07:43.080
isn't about tipping that balance back toward the center

07:43.080 --> 07:44.860
so much as finding opportunities

07:44.860 --> 07:46.940
to just do something about this stuff.

07:46.940 --> 07:47.860
What do you think, Bjorn?

07:47.860 --> 07:49.600
Do you agree that it's multiple questions

07:49.600 --> 07:51.480
in one big question?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.060
Do you think it's possible to define the center?

07:53.060 --> 07:54.740
Where is the center?

07:54.740 --> 07:57.340
I think it's wonderful to hear Andy sort of

07:57.340 --> 07:59.460
unconstruct the whole conversation

07:59.460 --> 08:01.780
and say we should be worried about different things.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.060
And I think that's exactly,

08:03.060 --> 08:05.340
or we should be worried about things in a different way

08:05.360 --> 08:08.400
that makes it much more useful.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.240
I think that's exactly the right way to think about it.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.880
On the other hand, and that was also where you kind of ended,

08:13.880 --> 08:16.600
we are stuck in a place where this very much

08:16.600 --> 08:18.280
is the conversation right now.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.560
And so I think in one sense,

08:21.560 --> 08:23.700
certainly the people who used to say,

08:23.700 --> 08:24.840
oh, this is not happening,

08:24.840 --> 08:27.560
they're very, very small and diminishing crowd

08:27.560 --> 08:28.840
and certainly not right.

08:29.760 --> 08:34.760
But on the other hand, I think to an increasing extent,

08:34.760 --> 08:36.300
we've gotten into a world

08:36.300 --> 08:37.980
where a lot of people really think

08:37.980 --> 08:40.160
this is the end of the times.

08:41.820 --> 08:45.380
So the OECD did a new survey of all OECD countries

08:45.380 --> 08:46.460
and it's shocking.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.260
So it shows that 60% of all people in the OECD,

08:50.260 --> 08:51.820
so the rich world,

08:51.820 --> 08:53.780
believes that global warming will likely

08:53.780 --> 08:57.780
or very likely lead to the extinction of mankind.

08:57.780 --> 09:02.300
And that's scary in a very, very clear way

09:02.300 --> 09:04.500
because look, if this really is true,

09:04.840 --> 09:08.400
if global warming is this meter hurdling towards earth

09:08.400 --> 09:11.000
and we're gonna be destroyed in 12 years

09:11.000 --> 09:14.400
or whatever the number is today,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.560
then clearly we should care about nothing else.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.040
We should just be focusing on making sure

09:19.040 --> 09:20.800
that that asteroid gets,

09:20.800 --> 09:24.320
we should send up Bruce Willis and get this done with.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.280
But that's not the way it is.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.200
This is not actually what the UN climate panel tells us

09:29.200 --> 09:30.200
or anything else.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.000
So I think it's not so much about

09:33.020 --> 09:35.540
arcing against the people who are saying it's a hoax.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.860
That's not really where I am.

09:36.860 --> 09:37.940
I don't think that's where Andy

09:37.940 --> 09:39.980
or really where the conversation is.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.740
But it is a question of sort of pulling people back

09:42.740 --> 09:45.140
from this end of the world conversation

09:45.140 --> 09:47.340
because it really skews our way

09:47.340 --> 09:48.800
that we think about problems.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.340
Also, if you really think this is the end of time

09:51.340 --> 09:53.140
and you only have 12 years,

09:53.140 --> 09:57.820
nothing that can only work in 13 years can be considered.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.620
And the reality of most of what we're talking about

10:00.620 --> 10:02.500
on climate and certainly our vulnerability,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.240
certainly our energy system

10:04.240 --> 10:06.480
is gonna be half to a full century.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.720
And so when you talk to people and say,

10:08.720 --> 10:12.000
well, but we're really gonna go a lot more renewable

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
in the next half century,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.240
they look at you and like,

10:14.240 --> 10:17.200
but that's what 38 years too late.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
And I get that.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.280
But so I think in your question,

10:21.280 --> 10:22.320
what I'm trying to do,

10:22.320 --> 10:24.460
and I would imagine that's true for you as well,

10:24.460 --> 10:27.480
is to try to pull people away from this precipice

10:27.480 --> 10:30.540
and this end of the world and then open it up.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.360
And I think Andy did that really well

10:33.260 --> 10:36.180
by saying, look, there are so many different sub-conversations

10:36.180 --> 10:38.020
and we need to have all of them

10:38.020 --> 10:40.380
and we need to be respectful of,

10:40.380 --> 10:44.540
some of these are right in the standard media kind of way,

10:44.540 --> 10:46.320
but some of them are very, very wrong.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.880
And it actually means that we end up doing much less good,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.120
both on climate,

10:51.120 --> 10:53.140
but also on all the other problems the world face.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.580
Oh yeah, and it just empowers people too.

10:55.580 --> 10:58.740
Those who believe this then just sit back.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.820
Even in Adam McKay's movie, the Don't Look Up movie,

11:01.840 --> 11:03.480
there was that sort of nihilist crowd,

11:03.480 --> 11:06.060
for those who've seen it, who just say, fuck this.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.920
And a lot of people have that approach

11:08.920 --> 11:10.160
when something's too big.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.600
And it just paralyzes you

11:14.600 --> 11:16.920
as opposed to giving you these action points.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.880
And the other thing is,

11:18.880 --> 11:22.160
I hate it when economists are right about stuff like that.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.000
I...

11:23.000 --> 11:23.840
I...

11:23.840 --> 11:24.680
I...

11:24.680 --> 11:25.500
I...

11:25.500 --> 11:27.280
No, no, there are these phrases,

11:27.280 --> 11:30.240
like I never knew the words path dependency

11:30.240 --> 11:31.680
until probably 10 years ago

11:32.500 --> 11:33.340
in my reporting.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.460
And it basically says, you're in a system,

11:35.460 --> 11:38.020
the things around you, how we pass laws,

11:38.020 --> 11:40.420
the brokenness of the Senate, you know,

11:40.420 --> 11:42.340
that those are...

11:42.340 --> 11:44.020
We don't have a climate crisis in America.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.940
We have a decision crisis

11:45.940 --> 11:48.420
as it comes to how the government works or doesn't work.

11:48.420 --> 11:51.820
So, but those big features of our landscape are...

11:53.060 --> 11:54.540
It's path dependency.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.860
When you screw in a light bulb,

11:56.860 --> 11:58.180
even if it's an LED light bulb,

11:58.180 --> 12:02.360
it's going into 113, 120 year old fixture.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.200
Because, and actually that fixture is almost designed,

12:05.200 --> 12:07.640
if you look at like 19th century gas fixtures,

12:07.640 --> 12:09.120
they had the screw in thing.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.360
So we're like on this long path dependencies

12:11.360 --> 12:12.680
when it comes to energy and stuff like that,

12:12.680 --> 12:16.560
that you don't just quick magically transition a car fleet.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.560
A car built today will last 40 years.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.840
It'll end up in Mexico, sold on a used car, et cetera, et cetera.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.260
And so this, there is no quick fix,

12:26.260 --> 12:28.220
even if we're true,

12:28.220 --> 12:31.440
that things are coming to an end in 13 years,

12:31.440 --> 12:32.380
or 12 years, or eight years.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.720
So most people don't believe that climate change is a hoax.

12:35.720 --> 12:39.240
So they believe that there is an increase,

12:39.240 --> 12:41.360
there's a global warming of a few degrees

12:41.360 --> 12:43.000
in the next century.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.200
And then maybe debate about

12:44.200 --> 12:45.920
what the number of the degrees is.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.680
And do most people believe that it's human caused

12:50.680 --> 12:55.320
at this time in this history of discussion of climate change?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.100
So is that the center still?

12:57.100 --> 12:59.660
Like, is there still debate on this?

12:59.660 --> 13:02.580
Yale University, the climate communication group there

13:02.580 --> 13:06.920
for like 13 years has done this six Americas study

13:06.920 --> 13:09.700
where they've charted pretty carefully

13:09.700 --> 13:13.920
and ways that I really find useful what people believe.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.300
And we can talk about the word belief

13:15.300 --> 13:16.380
in the context of science too,

13:16.380 --> 13:19.460
but, and they've identified kind of six kinds of us.

13:19.460 --> 13:22.460
There's from dismissive to alarmed

13:22.460 --> 13:24.180
and with lots of bubbles in between.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.680
I think some of those bubbles in between

13:25.680 --> 13:27.760
are mostly disengaged people

13:27.760 --> 13:30.320
who don't really deal with the issue.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.640
And they've shown a drift for sure.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.440
There's much more majority now at the alarmed

13:36.440 --> 13:40.760
or engaged bubbles than the dismissive bubble.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.560
There's a durable, like with vaccination

13:42.560 --> 13:43.720
and lots of other issues,

13:43.720 --> 13:48.000
there's a durable never anything belief group.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.280
But on the reality that humans are contributing

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
to climate change, most Americans,

13:53.280 --> 13:55.020
when you ask them,

13:55.020 --> 13:57.860
and it also depends on how you write your survey,

13:57.860 --> 13:58.700
think there's a component.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.540
And this is also true globally.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.820
I mean, when you ask around, I mean,

14:01.820 --> 14:03.900
and this is, if you hear this story

14:03.900 --> 14:05.100
from the media of 20 years,

14:05.100 --> 14:06.780
of course that's what you will believe.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.260
And it also happens to be true.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.180
That is what the science,

14:10.180 --> 14:12.420
I think it's perhaps worth saying,

14:12.420 --> 14:15.020
and it's a little depressing that you always have to say,

14:15.020 --> 14:16.580
but I think it's worth saying that

14:16.580 --> 14:19.420
I think we both really do accept

14:19.420 --> 14:21.420
the human climate panel science.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.760
There's absolutely global warming.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.820
It is an issue and it's probably just worthwhile

14:26.820 --> 14:27.660
to get it out of the way.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.520
It's an issue and it's caused by humans.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.040
It's caused by humans, yeah.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.200
But vulnerability, the losses that are driven

14:36.200 --> 14:38.000
by climate related events,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.760
still predominantly are caused by humans,

14:40.760 --> 14:42.280
but on the ground.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.540
It's where we build stuff, where we settle.

14:45.540 --> 14:50.540
Pakistan, in 1960, I just looked these data up,

14:50.940 --> 14:52.760
there were 40 million people in Pakistan.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.980
Today there are 225 million

14:54.980 --> 14:56.840
and a big chunk of them are still rural.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.720
They live in the floodplain of the amazing Indus River,

14:59.720 --> 15:01.840
which comes down from the Himalayas.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.960
Extraordinary 5,000 year history of agriculture there.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.920
But when you put 200 million people in harm's way,

15:09.920 --> 15:12.120
and this doesn't say anything about the bigger questions

15:12.120 --> 15:15.640
about, oh, shame on Pakistan for having more people.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.240
It just says the reality is the losses that we see

15:19.240 --> 15:23.020
in the news are, and the science finds this,

15:23.020 --> 15:25.980
even though there's a new weather attribution group.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.920
It's a WX risk on Twitter.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.300
This does pretty good work on how much of what just happened

15:33.300 --> 15:36.100
was some tweak in the storm from global warming,

15:36.100 --> 15:38.280
from CO2 changing weather.

15:39.380 --> 15:42.460
But, and the media glom onto that,

15:42.460 --> 15:46.060
as I did in the 80s, 90s, 2000s.

15:47.020 --> 15:50.420
But the reports also have a section on, by the way,

15:50.420 --> 15:52.220
the vulnerability that was built in this region

15:52.220 --> 15:55.580
was a big driver of loss.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.980
So discriminating between loss,

15:59.340 --> 16:02.820
change in what's happening on the ground

16:02.820 --> 16:07.460
and change in the climate system is never solely about CO2.

16:07.460 --> 16:12.460
In fact, Lorenz Bauer, B-O-U-W-E-R,

16:13.260 --> 16:17.260
I first wrote on his work in 2010 in the New York Times.

16:17.260 --> 16:20.740
And basically, in 2010, there was no sign in the data

16:20.740 --> 16:23.380
of climate change driving disasters.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.100
Climate change is up here, disasters are on the ground.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.180
They depend on how many people are in the way,

16:29.180 --> 16:31.100
how much stuff you built in the way.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.500
And so far, we've done so much of that so fast

16:33.500 --> 16:35.900
in the 20th century, particularly,

16:35.900 --> 16:37.340
that it completely dominates.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.620
It makes it hard, impossible to discriminate

16:39.620 --> 16:41.420
how much of that disaster

16:42.620 --> 16:47.620
was from the change in weather from global warming.

16:48.140 --> 16:53.140
So a function of greenhouse gases

16:53.220 --> 16:57.900
to human suffering is unclear.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.500
And that's very much in our control, theoretically.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.540
I mean, the point, I think, is exactly right,

17:03.540 --> 17:06.460
that if you look at the Hurricane Ian

17:06.460 --> 17:08.100
that went through Florida,

17:08.100 --> 17:09.980
you have a situation where Florida went from,

17:09.980 --> 17:14.980
what, 600,000 houses in 1940 to 17 million houses.

17:17.820 --> 17:21.580
Sorry, 10 million houses, so 17 times more.

17:21.580 --> 17:24.220
Over, what, a period of 80 years?

17:24.220 --> 17:25.900
Of course you're gonna have, what?

17:25.900 --> 17:26.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.620
You're gonna have lots more damage.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.540
And many of these houses now have been built

17:30.540 --> 17:33.460
on places where you probably shouldn't be building.

17:33.460 --> 17:37.180
And so I think a lot of scientists are very focused

17:37.180 --> 17:40.300
on saying, can we measure whether global warming

17:40.300 --> 17:41.380
had an impact?

17:41.380 --> 17:43.340
Which is an interesting science question.

17:43.340 --> 17:46.140
I think it's very implausible

17:46.140 --> 17:48.980
that eventually we won't be able to say it has an impact.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.060
But the real question, it seems to me,

17:51.060 --> 17:52.780
is if we actually wanna make sure

17:52.780 --> 17:54.900
that people are less harmed in the future,

17:55.780 --> 17:58.260
what are the levers that we can control?

17:58.260 --> 18:01.020
And it turns out that the CO2 lever,

18:01.020 --> 18:02.100
doing something about climate,

18:02.100 --> 18:06.260
is an incredibly difficult and slightly inefficient way

18:06.260 --> 18:08.300
of trying to help these people in the future.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.220
Whereas of course, zoning,

18:10.220 --> 18:14.020
making sure that you have better housing rules,

18:14.020 --> 18:16.700
what is it, regulations,

18:16.700 --> 18:19.100
that you maybe don't have people building

18:19.100 --> 18:20.980
in the flash flood, what was it called?

18:20.980 --> 18:21.820
Flash flood alley.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.300
Flash flood alley.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.940
It's just simple stuff.

18:24.940 --> 18:28.580
And because we're so focused on this one issue,

18:28.580 --> 18:31.980
we sort of, it almost feels sacrilegious

18:31.980 --> 18:33.940
to talk about these other things

18:33.940 --> 18:35.900
that are much more in our power

18:36.540 --> 18:38.140
and that we can do something about much quicker

18:38.140 --> 18:39.660
and that would help a lot more people.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.460
So I think this is gonna be a large part

18:42.460 --> 18:44.380
of the whole conversation.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.060
Yes, climate is a problem, but it's not the only problem.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.260
And there are many other things

18:48.260 --> 18:50.780
where we can actually have a much, much bigger impact

18:50.780 --> 18:52.100
at much lower cost.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.780
Maybe we should also remember those.

18:53.780 --> 18:58.700
Can you still man the case of Greta,

19:00.060 --> 19:03.140
who's a representative of alarmism,

19:04.140 --> 19:08.180
that we need that kind of level of alarmism

19:08.180 --> 19:09.740
for people to pay attention

19:09.740 --> 19:11.820
and to think about climate change.

19:11.820 --> 19:14.260
So you said the singular view

19:16.540 --> 19:19.780
is not the correct way to look at climate change,

19:19.780 --> 19:21.420
just the emissions.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.060
But for us to have a discussion,

19:24.060 --> 19:26.420
shouldn't there be somebody

19:26.420 --> 19:30.700
who's really raising the concern?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.740
Can you still man the case for alarmism essentially,

19:33.740 --> 19:36.660
or is there a better term than alarmism?

19:38.580 --> 19:42.540
Communication of like, holy shit,

19:42.540 --> 19:44.780
we should be thinking about this.

19:44.780 --> 19:48.500
So I totally understand why Greta Thunberg

19:48.500 --> 19:49.340
is doing what she's doing.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.020
I have great respect for her

19:51.020 --> 19:54.540
because I look at a lot of kids growing up

19:54.540 --> 19:56.740
and they're basically being told,

19:56.740 --> 19:58.180
you're not gonna reach adulthood,

19:58.180 --> 20:01.780
or at least you're not gonna get very far into adulthood.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.420
And that, of course,

20:03.420 --> 20:05.700
this is the meteor hurtling towards earth,

20:05.700 --> 20:08.780
and then this is the only thing we should be focusing on.

20:08.780 --> 20:10.940
I understand why she's making that argument.

20:10.940 --> 20:14.380
I think at the end of the day, it's incorrect,

20:14.380 --> 20:16.740
and I'm sure we'll get around to talking about that.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.620
And one of the things is, of course,

20:18.620 --> 20:21.460
that her whole generation,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.500
I can understand why they're saying,

20:23.500 --> 20:25.060
if we're gonna be dead in 12 years,

20:25.060 --> 20:26.580
why would I wanna study?

20:26.580 --> 20:28.620
Why would I really care about anything?

20:28.620 --> 20:31.620
So I totally want to sort of pull Greta

20:31.620 --> 20:35.100
and many others out of this end of the world fear,

20:35.100 --> 20:37.180
but I totally get why she's doing it.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.620
I think she's done a service

20:38.620 --> 20:40.260
in the sense that she's gotten more people

20:40.260 --> 20:41.780
to talk about climate,

20:41.780 --> 20:44.980
and that's good because we need to have this discussion.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.860
I think it's unfortunate,

20:46.860 --> 20:48.460
and this is just what happens

20:48.460 --> 20:50.380
in almost all policy discussions

20:50.380 --> 20:53.140
that they end up being sort of discussions

20:53.140 --> 20:54.780
from the extreme groups

20:54.780 --> 20:57.140
because it's just more fun on media

20:57.140 --> 20:59.700
to have sort of the total deniers

20:59.700 --> 21:02.540
and the people who say, we're gonna die tomorrow,

21:02.540 --> 21:04.340
and it sort of becomes that discussion.

21:04.340 --> 21:06.900
It's more sort of a mud wrestling fight.

21:06.900 --> 21:07.740
So what do you think,

21:07.740 --> 21:09.620
the mud wrestling fight is not useful

21:09.620 --> 21:11.660
or is useful for communication,

21:11.660 --> 21:14.180
for effective science communication

21:14.180 --> 21:16.380
on one of the platforms that you're a fan of,

21:16.380 --> 21:17.740
which is Twitter?

21:17.740 --> 21:19.700
Yeah, I wrote a piece recently

21:19.700 --> 21:22.620
on my sustain what column saying,

21:22.620 --> 21:25.660
if you go on there for the entertainment value

21:25.660 --> 21:29.060
of seeing those knockdown fights,

21:29.060 --> 21:31.860
I guess that's useful if that's what you're looking for.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.140
The thing I found Twitter invaluable for,

21:35.460 --> 21:37.220
but it's a practice.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.260
It's just like the workouts you do,

21:39.260 --> 21:44.100
or it's how do I put this tool to use today

21:44.100 --> 21:49.100
thinking about energy action in poor communities?

21:49.420 --> 21:51.020
How do I put this tool today

21:51.180 --> 21:52.980
learning about what really happened

21:52.980 --> 21:54.620
with E and the hurricane?

21:54.620 --> 21:56.660
Who was most at risk?

21:56.660 --> 21:59.540
And how would you build forward better?

21:59.540 --> 22:00.580
I hate build back.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.500
Or you can go there and just watch it

22:03.500 --> 22:04.620
as an entertainment value.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.060
That's not gonna get the world anywhere.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.180
You don't think entertainment,

22:10.180 --> 22:11.860
I wouldn't call it entertainment,

22:11.860 --> 22:14.500
but giving voice to the extremes

22:14.500 --> 22:16.700
isn't a productive way forward.

22:16.700 --> 22:20.660
It seems to push back against the main narrative,

22:20.660 --> 22:22.900
it seems to work pretty well in the American system.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.900
We think politics is totally broken,

22:25.900 --> 22:29.220
but maybe that works that like oscillation back and forth.

22:29.220 --> 22:32.460
You need a Greta and you need somebody that pushes back

22:32.460 --> 22:37.460
against a Greta to get everybody's attention.

22:38.140 --> 22:43.140
The fun of battle over time creates progress.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.420
Well, and this gets to the people

22:46.420 --> 22:48.180
who focus on communication science.

22:48.180 --> 22:51.380
I'm not a scientist, I write about this stuff.

22:51.380 --> 22:54.580
If you're gonna try to prod someone with a warning,

22:56.300 --> 22:59.020
this is three years apart, nuclear winter.

22:59.020 --> 23:00.620
Nuclear winter, we'll talk about that.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.340
Global warming, well, yeah, we'll talk about it.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.180
But look at that, this is three years apart

23:04.180 --> 23:05.820
in the covers of magazine.

23:05.820 --> 23:08.940
And, but then you have to say to what end,

23:08.940 --> 23:13.220
if you're not directing people to a basket of things to do.

23:13.220 --> 23:15.420
And if you want political change,

23:15.420 --> 23:18.020
then it would be to support a politician.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.900
If you want energy access, it would be to look

23:20.900 --> 23:25.900
at this $370 billion the American government

23:25.900 --> 23:27.700
just put into play on climate and say,

23:27.700 --> 23:30.100
well, how can my community benefit from that?

23:30.100 --> 23:31.660
And I've been told over and over again

23:31.660 --> 23:34.300
by people in government, Jigar Shah,

23:34.300 --> 23:37.620
who heads this giant loan program, the energy department.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.580
He says, what I need now is like 19,500 people

23:40.580 --> 23:42.460
who are worried about climate change.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.860
Maybe because Greta got them worried.

23:45.860 --> 23:46.940
But here's the thing you could do.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.780
You can connect your local government right now

23:48.780 --> 23:50.580
with these multimillion dollar loans.

23:50.580 --> 23:53.780
So you can have electric buses instead of diesel buses.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.220
And that's an action pathway.

23:56.300 --> 24:01.220
So without, so alarm for the sake of getting attention

24:01.220 --> 24:04.860
or clicks to me is not any more valuable

24:04.860 --> 24:07.660
than watching an action movie.

24:07.660 --> 24:10.620
And again, I think also it very easily ends up

24:10.620 --> 24:12.340
sort of skewing our conversation

24:12.340 --> 24:15.460
about what are the actual solutions.

24:15.460 --> 24:18.940
Because yes, it's great to get rid of the diesel bus,

24:18.940 --> 24:21.060
but probably not for the reason people think.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.820
It's because diesel buses are really polluting

24:23.820 --> 24:26.340
in the air pollution sense.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.980
And that is why you should get rid of them.

24:29.980 --> 24:32.540
And again, if you really want it to help people,

24:32.540 --> 24:36.780
for instance, with hurricanes, you should have better rules

24:36.780 --> 24:40.260
and zoning in Florida, which is a very different outcome.

24:40.260 --> 24:45.260
So the mud wrestling fight also gets our attention diverted

24:45.300 --> 24:50.300
towards solutions that seem easy, fun.

24:50.580 --> 24:53.140
Sort of the electric car is a great example of this.

24:53.140 --> 24:56.340
The electric car has somehow become almost the sign

24:56.340 --> 24:59.900
that I care and I'm really gonna do something about climate.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.900
Of course, electric cars are great

25:01.900 --> 25:03.980
and they're probably part of the solution.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.780
And they will actually cut carbon emissions somewhat,

25:06.780 --> 25:09.500
but they're an incredibly ineffective way

25:09.500 --> 25:11.660
of cutting carbon emissions right now.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.020
They're fairly expensive.

25:13.020 --> 25:14.700
You have to subsidize them a lot.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.020
And they still emit quite a bit of CO2,

25:17.020 --> 25:18.940
both because the batteries get produced

25:18.940 --> 25:21.300
and because they usually run off of power

25:21.300 --> 25:22.140
that's not totally clean.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.620
Strong words from your love.

25:23.620 --> 25:24.540
Okay, let's go there.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.620
Let's go electric cars.

25:25.620 --> 25:30.380
Okay, educate us on the pros and cons of electric cars

25:30.380 --> 25:33.540
in this complex picture of climate change.

25:33.540 --> 25:36.580
What do you think of the efforts of Tesla and Elon Musk

25:36.580 --> 25:40.780
on pushing forward the electric car revolution?

25:40.780 --> 25:43.060
So look, electric cars are great.

25:43.060 --> 25:47.220
I don't own a car, but I've been driving a Tesla.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.860
There you go, socially signaling.

25:48.860 --> 25:51.420
Yeah, but yeah, I've-

25:51.420 --> 25:52.260
We're in Texas, it's okay.

25:52.260 --> 25:55.060
I flew in here, so it's not like I'm in any way

25:55.060 --> 25:57.540
a virtuous guy on that path.

25:57.540 --> 26:00.540
But look, they're great cars

26:00.540 --> 26:03.300
and eventually electric cars will take over

26:03.300 --> 26:06.300
a significant part of our driving.

26:06.300 --> 26:10.060
And that's good because they're more effective.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.300
They're probably also gonna be cheaper.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.980
There's a lot of good opportunities with them,

26:14.980 --> 26:16.940
but it's because they've become reified

26:16.940 --> 26:19.860
as this thing that you do to fix climate.

26:19.860 --> 26:24.300
And right now, they're not really all that great for climate.

26:24.300 --> 26:28.660
You need a lot of extra material into the batteries,

26:28.660 --> 26:31.260
which is very polluting and it's also,

26:31.260 --> 26:32.860
it emits a lot of CO2.

26:32.860 --> 26:37.100
A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.820
So we used to think that they were driven

26:38.820 --> 26:41.420
almost as much as a regular car.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.820
It turns out that they're more likely driven

26:43.820 --> 26:47.140
less than half as much as regular cars.

26:47.140 --> 26:50.460
So 89% of all Americans who have an electric car

26:50.460 --> 26:53.980
also have a real car that they use for the long trips

26:53.980 --> 26:56.220
and then they use the electric car for short trips.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.060
That's true, 89%.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.060
89, yeah.

26:58.060 --> 27:02.500
So the point here is that it's one of these things

27:02.500 --> 27:05.140
that become more sort of a virtuous signaling thing.

27:05.140 --> 27:09.060
And again, look, once electric cars are sufficiently cheap

27:09.060 --> 27:11.180
that people will want to buy them, that's great.

27:11.740 --> 27:14.540
And they will do some good for the environment.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.780
But in reality, what we should be focusing on

27:16.780 --> 27:20.020
is instead of getting people electric cars

27:20.020 --> 27:22.820
in rich countries, where because we're subsidizing,

27:22.820 --> 27:25.340
typically in many countries,

27:25.340 --> 27:28.220
you actually get a sort of sliding scale.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.900
You get more subsidy the more expensive it is.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.180
We sort of subsidize this to very rich people

27:33.180 --> 27:37.340
to buy very large Teslas to drive around in.

27:37.340 --> 27:39.420
Whereas what we should be focusing on

27:39.420 --> 27:42.460
is perhaps getting electric motorcycles

27:42.460 --> 27:44.860
in third world developing cities

27:44.860 --> 27:46.980
where they would do a lot more good.

27:46.980 --> 27:49.060
They can actually go as far as you need.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.780
There's no worry about running out of them.

27:51.780 --> 27:55.100
And they would obviously, they're much, much more polluting

27:55.100 --> 27:58.140
just air pollution wise, and they're much cheaper

27:58.140 --> 27:59.500
and they use very little battery.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.500
So it's about getting our senses right.

28:01.500 --> 28:06.100
But the electric car is not a conversation about

28:06.140 --> 28:08.140
is it technically a really good

28:08.140 --> 28:10.780
or is it a somewhat good insight?

28:10.780 --> 28:12.500
It's more like it's a virtual signal.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.180
So just, I work with economists.

28:15.180 --> 28:16.540
I'm actually not an economist,

28:16.540 --> 28:19.100
but I like to say I claim I kind of am.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.900
But the fundamental point is we would say,

28:21.900 --> 28:26.060
well, how much does it cost to cut a ton of CO2?

28:26.060 --> 28:28.460
And the answer is for most electric cars,

28:28.460 --> 28:32.060
we're paying in the order of 1,000, 2,000.

28:32.060 --> 28:37.060
In Norway, they pay up to $5,000 or thereabouts,

28:37.420 --> 28:40.100
huge amount for one ton of CO2.

28:40.100 --> 28:43.220
You can right now cut a ton of CO2 for about, what is it?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.460
$14 on the Reggie or something.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.980
That's a regional greenhouse gas initiative.

28:48.980 --> 28:51.460
So you can basically cut it really, really cheaply.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.540
Why would we not want to cut dozens and dozens

28:54.540 --> 28:56.660
of tons of CO2 for the same price

28:56.660 --> 28:58.620
instead of just cutting one ton?

28:58.620 --> 29:00.500
And the simple answer is we only do that

29:00.500 --> 29:02.140
because we're so focused on electricity.

29:02.140 --> 29:02.980
I may interrupt.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.300
Typically European, come here in Texas,

29:05.300 --> 29:09.180
tell them that I can't have my Ford F-150, but I'll-

29:09.180 --> 29:10.940
Now you can have your F-150 Lightning.

29:10.940 --> 29:12.780
Yes, that's true.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.620
I'm just joking, yes.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.540
But what do you think about electric cars?

29:16.540 --> 29:17.980
If you could just link on that moment

29:17.980 --> 29:22.980
and this particular element of helping reduce emissions.

29:24.940 --> 29:26.740
Well, you talked about the middle in the beginning

29:26.740 --> 29:29.540
and I loved moving through the hybrid.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.820
Prius was fantastic.

29:30.820 --> 29:33.140
It did everything our other sedan did,

29:33.140 --> 29:36.660
but it was 60 miles per gallon performance

29:36.660 --> 29:39.300
and you don't have range anxiety

29:39.300 --> 29:42.260
because it has a regular engine too.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.620
We still have a Prius.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.460
We also inherited my dad,

29:45.460 --> 29:48.820
dear dad's year 2000 Toyota Sienna,

29:48.820 --> 29:53.260
which is an old 100,000 mile minivan.

29:53.260 --> 29:55.100
And we use it all the time to do the stuff

29:55.100 --> 29:57.780
we can't do in the Prius.

29:57.780 --> 29:58.620
Like what?

29:58.620 --> 30:00.020
Taking stuff to the dump.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.860
Oh, you mean in terms of the size of the vehicle?

30:01.860 --> 30:05.340
Yeah, a size and just convenience factor

30:05.340 --> 30:06.580
for a bigger vehicle.

30:07.700 --> 30:12.420
I would love a fully electrified transportation world.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.700
It's kind of exciting.

30:13.700 --> 30:16.220
I think what Elon did with Tesla,

30:16.220 --> 30:18.060
I remember way, way back in the day

30:18.060 --> 30:19.460
when the first models were coming out,

30:19.460 --> 30:22.860
they were very slick Ferrari style cars.

30:22.860 --> 30:24.340
And I thought, this is cool.

30:24.340 --> 30:27.220
And there's a history of privileged markets

30:27.220 --> 30:31.260
testing new technologies and I'm all for that.

30:31.260 --> 30:36.260
I think it's done a huge service prodding so much more R and D

30:36.460 --> 30:39.220
and once GM and Ford started to realize,

30:39.220 --> 30:42.340
oh my God, this is a real phenomenon,

30:42.340 --> 30:43.860
getting them in the game.

30:43.860 --> 30:47.940
There was that documentary who killed the electric car,

30:47.940 --> 30:52.380
which seemed to imply that there were fights

30:52.380 --> 30:54.180
to keep this tamp down.

30:54.180 --> 30:57.060
And it's fundamentally cleaner, fundamentally better.

30:58.060 --> 31:00.980
But then you have to manage these bigger questions.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.980
If we're gonna do a build out here,

31:02.980 --> 31:05.220
how do you make it fair?

31:05.220 --> 31:08.620
As you were saying, who actually uses transport cars?

31:08.620 --> 31:10.820
And Jagir Shah, that guy at the energy department

31:10.820 --> 31:13.380
I mentioned, who has all this money to give out,

31:13.380 --> 31:15.580
he wants to give loans to,

31:17.060 --> 31:20.500
if you had an Uber fleet, those Uber drivers,

31:20.500 --> 31:23.420
they're the ones who need electric cars.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.540
As his work, and there was a recent story in Grist also,

31:28.540 --> 31:30.620
said that most of the sales of Teslas

31:30.620 --> 31:31.820
are the high end of the market.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.820
They're 60, $80,000 vehicles.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.540
Like the Hummer, the electric Hummer,

31:37.540 --> 31:41.940
there was a data point on that astonishing data point.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.740
The battery in that Hummer weighs more than,

31:45.980 --> 31:46.980
I'd have to look it up.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.980
It weighs more than a car.

31:48.980 --> 31:51.100
Yeah, I think it might've been a Prius.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.020
And think of the material costs there.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.700
Think of where that battery, the Cobalt and the lithium,

31:55.700 --> 31:57.580
where does this stuff come from?

31:57.580 --> 32:00.340
To build this stuff out, I'm all for it,

32:00.340 --> 32:02.940
but we have to be honest and clear about

32:02.940 --> 32:04.940
that's a new resource rush,

32:04.940 --> 32:07.980
like the oil rush back in the early 20th century.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.420
And those impacts have to be figured out too.

32:10.420 --> 32:14.620
And if they're all big Hummers for rich people,

32:14.620 --> 32:16.500
there's so many contrary arguments to that

32:16.500 --> 32:19.620
that I think we have to figure out a way we,

32:19.620 --> 32:22.620
I don't like the word we, I use it too much, we all do.

32:23.060 --> 32:23.900
We all do.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.460
We usually refer when you say we, we humans.

32:26.460 --> 32:28.780
We society, we government, yeah.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.380
There has to be some thought and attention

32:31.380 --> 32:33.020
put to where you put these incentives

32:33.020 --> 32:35.220
so that you get the best use of this technology

32:35.220 --> 32:39.060
for the carbon benefit, for the conventional

32:39.060 --> 32:42.820
sooty pollution benefit, for the transportation benefit.

32:42.820 --> 32:45.620
Can I step back and ask a sort of big question?

32:45.620 --> 32:48.380
We mentioned economics, journalism.

32:49.340 --> 32:51.860
How does an economist and a climate scientist

32:51.860 --> 32:55.580
and a journalist that writes about climate

32:55.580 --> 32:56.980
see the world differently?

32:56.980 --> 32:59.220
What are the strengths and potential blind spots

32:59.220 --> 33:00.620
of each discipline?

33:00.620 --> 33:04.900
I mean, that's just sort of, just so people may be aware.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.860
I think you've fallen into the economics camp a bit.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.740
There's climate scientists

33:10.740 --> 33:13.660
and there's climate scientists, adjacent people,

33:13.660 --> 33:15.220
like who hang, some of my best friends

33:15.220 --> 33:16.940
are climate scientists, kind of,

33:17.100 --> 33:18.580
which is, I think, where you fall in

33:18.580 --> 33:20.780
because you're a journalist, you've been writing it,

33:20.780 --> 33:25.780
so you're not completely in the trenches

33:25.860 --> 33:27.180
of doing the work.

33:27.180 --> 33:30.380
You're just stuck into the trenches every once in a while.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.540
So can you speak to that, maybe, Bjorn?

33:32.540 --> 33:36.340
Like what does the world look like to an economist?

33:36.340 --> 33:40.180
Let's try to empathize with these beings that, you know.

33:40.180 --> 33:42.220
That unfortunately has fallen into the

33:42.220 --> 33:45.260
disreputable economics, yeah.

33:46.260 --> 33:50.940
So I think the main point that I've been trying

33:50.940 --> 33:52.820
for a long time, and I think that's also a little bit

33:52.820 --> 33:54.660
what Andy has been talking about,

33:54.660 --> 33:57.460
for a very long time, the whole conversation was about

33:57.460 --> 33:59.340
what does the science tell us?

33:59.340 --> 34:01.100
Is global warming real?

34:01.100 --> 34:05.700
And to me, it's much more, what can we actually do?

34:05.700 --> 34:08.460
What are the policies that we can take

34:08.460 --> 34:10.380
and how effective are they gonna be?

34:10.380 --> 34:12.860
So the conversation we just had about electric cars

34:12.860 --> 34:15.900
is a good example of how an economist think about,

34:15.900 --> 34:19.660
look, this is not a question about whether you feel

34:19.660 --> 34:22.620
morally virtuous or whether you can sort of display

34:22.620 --> 34:24.580
how much you care about the environment.

34:24.580 --> 34:27.420
This is about how much you actually ended up

34:27.420 --> 34:28.780
affecting the world.

34:28.780 --> 34:31.940
And the honest answer is that electric cars,

34:31.940 --> 34:34.660
right now in the next decade or so,

34:34.660 --> 34:36.260
will have a fairly small impact,

34:36.260 --> 34:38.300
and unfortunately right now at a very high cost

34:38.300 --> 34:40.660
because we're basically subsidizing these things

34:40.660 --> 34:44.580
at five or $10,000 around the world per car.

34:44.580 --> 34:47.300
That's just not, it's not really sustainable,

34:47.300 --> 34:49.020
but it's certainly not a very great way

34:49.020 --> 34:50.460
to cut carbon emissions.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.260
So I would be the kind of guy,

34:52.260 --> 34:55.620
and economists would be the types of people who would say,

34:55.620 --> 34:59.180
is there a smarter way where you, for less money,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.180
can, for instance, cut more CO2?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.980
And the obvious answer is yes.

35:03.980 --> 35:07.140
That's what we've seen, for instance, with fracking.

35:07.140 --> 35:10.380
The fact that the US went from a lot of coal

35:10.380 --> 35:13.380
to a lot of gas because gas became incredibly cheap,

35:13.380 --> 35:16.780
because gas emits about half as much as coal does

35:16.780 --> 35:20.060
when you use it for power,

35:20.060 --> 35:22.340
that basically cut more carbon emissions

35:22.340 --> 35:24.820
than pretty much any other single thing.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.980
And we should get the rest of the world, in some sense,

35:27.980 --> 35:30.580
to frack because it's really cheap.

35:30.580 --> 35:31.460
There are some problems,

35:31.460 --> 35:34.220
and absolutely we can also have that conversation.

35:34.220 --> 35:36.900
No technology is problem-free,

35:36.900 --> 35:39.820
but fundamentally it's an incredibly cheap way

35:39.820 --> 35:42.500
to get people to cut a lot of CO2.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.900
It's not the final solution

35:43.900 --> 35:45.220
because it's still a fossil fuel,

35:45.220 --> 35:47.820
but it's a much better fossil fuel, if you will,

35:47.820 --> 35:50.380
and it's much more realistic to do that.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.180
So that's one part of the thing.

35:52.180 --> 35:54.940
The other one is when we talked about, for instance,

35:54.940 --> 35:58.540
how do we help people in Florida who gets hit by a hurricane,

35:58.540 --> 36:02.940
or how do we help people that get damaged in flash floods,

36:02.940 --> 36:05.780
the people who are in heat waves,

36:05.780 --> 36:08.060
and the simple answer is

36:08.060 --> 36:11.260
there's a lot of very, very cheap and effective things

36:11.260 --> 36:12.460
that we could do first.

36:12.460 --> 36:15.420
So most climate people will tend to sort of say,

36:15.420 --> 36:18.820
we gotta get rid of all carbon emissions,

36:18.820 --> 36:23.620
we gotta change the engine that sort of powers the world

36:23.620 --> 36:26.100
and has powered us for the last 200 years.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.260
And that's all good and well,

36:27.260 --> 36:28.500
but it's really, really hard to do,

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
and it's probably not gonna do very much.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.980
And even if you succeed it,

36:31.980 --> 36:34.260
it would only help future victims

36:34.300 --> 36:38.340
of future hurricanes in Florida a tiny, tiny bit at best.

36:38.340 --> 36:41.420
So instead, let's try to focus on not getting people

36:41.420 --> 36:43.660
to build right on the waterfront

36:43.660 --> 36:45.260
where you're incredibly vulnerable

36:45.260 --> 36:47.180
and where you're very likely to get hit

36:47.180 --> 36:51.540
where we subsidize people with federal insurance again,

36:51.540 --> 36:53.540
which is just actually losing money.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.860
So we're much more about saying,

36:55.860 --> 36:57.260
it's not a science question.

36:57.260 --> 36:58.860
I just take the science for granted.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.700
Yes, there is a problem with climate change,

37:00.700 --> 37:02.060
but it's much more about saying,

37:02.060 --> 37:03.540
how can we make smart decisions?

37:03.540 --> 37:06.100
I can ask you about blind spots.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.860
When you reduce stuff to numbers, the cost and benefits,

37:09.860 --> 37:12.420
is there stuff you might miss

37:12.420 --> 37:16.940
that are important to the flourishing of the human species?

37:16.940 --> 37:18.940
So everyone will have to say,

37:18.940 --> 37:21.300
of course there must be blind spots.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.180
But I don't know what they are.

37:23.180 --> 37:26.420
Yeah, I'm sure Andy would probably be better

37:26.420 --> 37:28.580
at telling me what they are.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.540
So we try to incorporate all of it,

37:30.540 --> 37:32.660
but obviously we're not successful.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.260
You can't incorporate everything,

37:34.260 --> 37:36.340
for instance, in the cost benefit analysis.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.180
But the point is in some way,

37:39.220 --> 37:41.420
I would worry a lot about this

37:41.420 --> 37:45.060
if we were sort of close to perfection human race,

37:45.060 --> 37:47.060
we're doing almost everything right,

37:47.060 --> 37:48.260
but we're not quite right,

37:48.260 --> 37:50.340
then we need to get the last digits right.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.980
But I think it's much more that,

37:51.980 --> 37:54.780
and the point that I tried to make before,

37:54.780 --> 37:58.820
that we're all focused on going to an electric car

37:58.820 --> 38:01.700
or something else rather than fracking.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.340
We're all focused on cutting carbon emissions

38:04.340 --> 38:06.660
instead of reducing vulnerability.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.420
So we're similarly getting orders of magnitude wrong.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.420
And while I'm sure I have blind spots,

38:13.420 --> 38:15.060
I think they're probably not big enough

38:15.060 --> 38:16.620
to overturn that point.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.820
Andy, why is Bjorn and economists

38:18.820 --> 38:21.300
are all wrong about everything?

38:21.300 --> 38:25.820
Well, models, we could spend a whole day on models.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.860
There are economic models.

38:26.860 --> 38:29.380
There's this thing called optimization models.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.180
There were two big ones used to assess

38:31.180 --> 38:36.180
the US plan, this new big IRA inflation reduction package.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.300
And they're fine, they're a starting point

38:41.300 --> 38:44.020
for understanding what's possible.

38:44.020 --> 38:47.900
But as this gets to the journalism part or the public part,

38:47.900 --> 38:49.300
you have to look at the caveats.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.460
You have to look at what model,

38:51.460 --> 38:56.300
economists expressly exclude things that are not modelable.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.620
And if you look in the fine print on the repeat project,

38:59.620 --> 39:02.020
the Princeton version of the assessment

39:02.020 --> 39:04.100
of the recent giant legislation,

39:05.340 --> 39:09.340
the fine print is the front page for me

39:09.340 --> 39:11.220
as a deep diving journalist,

39:11.220 --> 39:16.220
because it says we didn't include any sources of friction,

39:16.420 --> 39:20.300
meaning resistance to putting new transmission lines

39:20.300 --> 39:21.620
through your community,

39:21.620 --> 39:26.620
or people who don't want mining in America,

39:27.020 --> 39:29.500
because we've exported all of our mining.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.860
We've mined our cobalt and Congo,

39:32.860 --> 39:35.340
and trying to get a new mine in Nevada

39:36.900 --> 39:40.260
was a fraught fight that took more than 10 years for lithium.

39:41.540 --> 39:46.540
So if you're excluding those elements from your model,

39:46.620 --> 39:51.420
which on the surface makes this $370 billion package

39:51.420 --> 39:53.500
have an emissions reduction trajectory

39:53.500 --> 39:54.820
that's really pretty good,

39:55.860 --> 39:58.060
and you're not saying in your first line,

39:58.060 --> 40:00.940
by the way, these are the things we're not considering.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.380
That's the job of a journalist.

40:02.380 --> 40:06.700
Summarize all of human history with that one word, friction.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.540
Yeah, yeah.

40:07.540 --> 40:10.300
Well, inertia, friction implies there's a force

40:10.300 --> 40:12.980
that's already being resisted, but there's also inertia,

40:12.980 --> 40:16.860
which is a huge part of our, you know,

40:16.860 --> 40:18.740
we have a status quo bias.

40:19.940 --> 40:24.460
The scientists that I, in grappling with the climate problem,

40:24.460 --> 40:26.580
as a journalist, I paid too much attention

40:26.580 --> 40:28.460
to the climate scientists.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.780
That's why all of my articles focused on climate change.

40:31.780 --> 40:35.380
And it was 2006, I remember now pretty clearly,

40:36.340 --> 40:38.100
I was asked by the Weekend Review section

40:38.100 --> 40:40.460
of the New York Times to write a sort of a weekend

40:40.460 --> 40:42.820
thumb sucker, we call them, on-

40:42.820 --> 40:43.660
Thumb sucker?

40:43.660 --> 40:45.380
You know, you sit and suck your thumb

40:45.380 --> 40:46.620
and think about something.

40:46.620 --> 40:48.540
Why is everybody so pissed off about climate change?

40:48.540 --> 40:49.780
It was after Al Gore's movie,

40:49.780 --> 40:51.780
the Al Gore movie came out in Convened to Truth,

40:51.780 --> 40:53.660
Hurricane Katrina, it was big.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.220
Senator Inhofe in the Senate from Oklahoma

40:56.220 --> 40:59.100
wasn't yet throwing snowballs, but it was close to that.

40:59.100 --> 41:02.060
And so I looked into what was going on.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.420
Why is this so heated?

41:03.420 --> 41:08.140
In 2006, the story's called Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet.

41:08.140 --> 41:10.020
And that was the first time,

41:10.020 --> 41:13.340
this is after 18 years of writing about global warming.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.700
That was the first time I interviewed a social scientist,

41:15.700 --> 41:16.900
not a climate scientist.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.620
Her name is Helen Ingram, she's at UC Irvine.

41:20.620 --> 41:25.460
And she laid out for me the factors that determine

41:25.460 --> 41:27.020
why people vote, what they vote for,

41:27.020 --> 41:29.140
what they think about politically.

41:29.140 --> 41:32.060
And they were the antithesis of the climate problem.

41:32.060 --> 41:33.340
She used the words, she said,

41:33.340 --> 41:37.060
people go in the voting booth thinking about things

41:37.060 --> 41:41.060
that are soon salient and certain.

41:41.060 --> 41:43.020
And climate change is complex, you know,

41:43.020 --> 41:44.620
has long time scales.

41:44.620 --> 41:46.740
And that really jogged me.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.380
And then I, between 2006, 2010,

41:50.420 --> 41:52.660
I started interviewing other social scientists

41:52.660 --> 41:56.820
and this was by far the scariest science of all.

41:56.820 --> 42:01.340
It's the climate in our heads, our inconvenient minds.

42:01.340 --> 42:04.580
And in how that translates into political norms and stuff

42:04.580 --> 42:07.780
really became the monster, not the climate system.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.860
Is there social dynamics to the scientists themselves?

42:10.860 --> 42:15.740
Because I've gotten to witness a kind of

42:15.740 --> 42:18.140
flocking behavior with scientists.

42:18.140 --> 42:19.860
So it's almost like a flock of birds.

42:19.860 --> 42:23.220
Within the flock, there's a lot of disagreement

42:23.220 --> 42:25.820
and fun debates and everybody trying to prove

42:25.820 --> 42:27.740
each other wrong, but they're all kind of headed

42:27.740 --> 42:29.300
in the same direction.

42:29.300 --> 42:30.780
And you don't want to be the bird

42:30.780 --> 42:32.980
that kind of leaves that flock.

42:32.980 --> 42:36.780
So like, there's an idea that science as a mechanism

42:36.780 --> 42:38.540
will get us towards the truth,

42:38.540 --> 42:41.380
but it'll definitely get us somewhere,

42:41.380 --> 42:45.100
but it could be not the truth in the short term.

42:45.100 --> 42:48.140
In the long term, a bigger flock will come along

42:48.140 --> 42:49.300
and it'll get us to the truth.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.340
But there's a sense that I don't know

42:51.340 --> 42:52.900
if there's a mechanism within science

42:52.900 --> 42:57.220
to like snap out of it if you're down the wrong track.

42:57.220 --> 43:01.140
Usually you get it right, but sometimes you don't.

43:01.140 --> 43:03.140
When you don't, it's very costly.

43:03.140 --> 43:05.340
And there's so many factors that line up

43:05.340 --> 43:09.380
to perpetuate that flocking behavior.

43:09.380 --> 43:12.900
One is media attention comes in.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.980
The other is funding comes in.

43:15.980 --> 43:17.740
National Science Foundation or whatever,

43:17.740 --> 43:19.820
European foundations pour a huge amount of money

43:19.820 --> 43:22.340
into things related to climate.

43:22.340 --> 43:25.140
And then your narrative in your head

43:25.140 --> 43:29.060
is shaped by that aspect of the climate problem

43:29.060 --> 43:30.580
that's in the spotlight.

43:30.580 --> 43:34.460
I started using this hashtag a few years back,

43:34.460 --> 43:38.500
narrative capture, like be wary of narrative capture

43:38.500 --> 43:42.980
where you're on a train and everyone's getting on the train.

43:42.980 --> 43:44.820
And this is in the media too, not just science.

43:44.820 --> 43:47.940
And it becomes self-sustaining

43:47.940 --> 43:52.700
and contrary indications are ignored or downplayed.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.540
No one does replication science

43:54.540 --> 43:56.700
because your career doesn't advance

43:56.700 --> 43:58.900
through replicating someone else's work.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.740
So those contrary indications

44:00.740 --> 44:05.020
are not necessarily really dug in on.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.420
And this is way beyond climate.

44:07.420 --> 44:08.700
This is of many fields.

44:08.700 --> 44:10.500
As you said, you might've seen this in AI.

44:10.500 --> 44:14.060
And it's really hard to find,

44:14.060 --> 44:16.340
it's another form of path dependency,

44:16.340 --> 44:18.860
the term I used before.

44:18.860 --> 44:21.340
The breaking narrative capture to me,

44:22.820 --> 44:26.420
for me has come mostly from stepping back

44:27.620 --> 44:30.860
and reminding myself of the basic principles of journalism.

44:30.860 --> 44:34.980
Journalism's basic principles are useful for anybody

44:34.980 --> 44:38.300
confronting a big enormous dynamic complex thing

44:38.300 --> 44:40.780
is who, what, where, when, why.

44:40.780 --> 44:44.380
Just be really rigorous about not assuming

44:44.380 --> 44:47.540
because there's a fire in Boulder County

44:47.540 --> 44:50.620
or a flood in Fort Myers, that climate,

44:50.620 --> 44:53.220
which is in your head because you're part of the climate team

44:53.220 --> 44:54.940
at the New York Times or whatever,

44:54.940 --> 44:59.100
is the foreground part of this problem.

44:59.100 --> 45:02.940
What's the psychological challenge of that

45:02.940 --> 45:04.980
if you incorporate the fact that

45:05.020 --> 45:08.580
if you try to step back and have nuance,

45:08.580 --> 45:12.300
you might get attacked by the others in the flock.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.140
Oh, I was.

45:13.140 --> 45:14.700
Well, you've certainly been.

45:14.700 --> 45:18.860
So both of you get attacked continuously

45:18.860 --> 45:20.260
from different sides.

45:20.260 --> 45:21.860
So let me just ask about that.

45:21.860 --> 45:23.420
How does that feel?

45:23.420 --> 45:26.300
And how do you continue thinking clearly

45:27.660 --> 45:31.620
and continuously try to have humility and step back

45:31.620 --> 45:36.420
and not get defensive in that as a communicator?

45:36.420 --> 45:38.740
I mean, there are other things happening

45:38.740 --> 45:39.580
at the same time, right?

45:39.580 --> 45:42.140
I'm now 35 years into,

45:42.140 --> 45:44.100
almost 40 years into my journalism career.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.260
So I have some independence.

45:45.260 --> 45:47.820
I'm free from the obligations of,

45:49.060 --> 45:50.700
don't really need my next paycheck.

45:50.700 --> 45:52.900
I live in Maine now in a house I love.

45:52.900 --> 45:53.820
I own it outright.

45:53.820 --> 45:55.540
It's a great privilege and honor.

45:55.540 --> 45:59.300
And as a result of a lot of hard work.

45:59.300 --> 46:03.100
And so I'm freer to think freely.

46:03.100 --> 46:04.940
And I know my colleagues in newsrooms

46:04.940 --> 46:06.460
when I was at the New York Times.

46:06.460 --> 46:10.980
In the newsroom, you become captive to a narrative,

46:10.980 --> 46:13.380
just as you do out in the world.

46:14.580 --> 46:18.100
The New York Times had a narrative about Saddam Hussein.

46:19.180 --> 46:21.780
Drove us into that war.

46:21.780 --> 46:26.460
The Times sucked right into that and helped perpetuate it.

46:26.460 --> 46:28.540
I think we're in a bit of a narrative.

46:28.540 --> 46:31.820
We, the media, my friends at the Times

46:31.820 --> 46:34.740
and others are on a train ride on climate change,

46:34.740 --> 46:36.980
depicting it in a certain way.

46:36.980 --> 46:40.300
That really, I saw problems with how they handled

46:40.300 --> 46:42.780
the Joe Manchin issue in America,

46:42.780 --> 46:45.020
the West Virginia Senator.

46:45.020 --> 46:46.740
They really kind of piled on

46:46.740 --> 46:49.700
and zoomed in on his investments.

46:49.700 --> 46:50.980
Which is really important to do,

46:50.980 --> 46:52.700
but they never pulled back and said,

46:52.700 --> 46:55.340
by the way, he's a rare species.

46:55.340 --> 46:57.660
He's a Democrat in West Virginia.

46:58.060 --> 47:00.900
Which seems to be otherwise occupied by a Republican.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.500
There'd be no talk of a climate deal

47:02.500 --> 47:04.540
or any of that stuff without him.

47:04.540 --> 47:07.340
And, but once you're starting to kind of frame a story

47:07.340 --> 47:08.860
in a certain way, you carry it along.

47:08.860 --> 47:11.180
And as you said, sometimes it breaks

47:11.180 --> 47:12.740
and a new norm arrives.

47:12.740 --> 47:17.260
But the climate train is still kind of rushing forward

47:17.260 --> 47:22.260
and missing the opportunity to cut it into its pieces

47:22.460 --> 47:25.540
and say, well, what's really wrong with Florida?

47:25.540 --> 47:28.100
And it's for me, when you ask you about how I handle

47:28.100 --> 47:30.660
the slings and arrows and stuff,

47:30.660 --> 47:34.580
it's partially because I'm past worrying about it too much.

47:36.140 --> 47:37.700
I mean, it was pretty intense.

47:37.700 --> 47:41.420
2009 Rush Limbaugh suggested I kill myself

47:41.420 --> 47:42.260
on his radio show.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.100
It's a really great time.

47:43.100 --> 47:44.220
What was that about?

47:44.220 --> 47:49.220
I had, actually, this was a meeting in Washington in 2009

47:49.900 --> 47:52.500
on population at the Wilson Center.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.380
I couldn't be there, so actually this is pre-COVID,

47:54.380 --> 47:57.700
but I was zooming in or something, like Skyping in.

47:57.700 --> 48:01.140
And I was talking about in a playful way, I said,

48:01.140 --> 48:04.220
well, if you really want to worry about carbon,

48:04.220 --> 48:08.340
this was during the debate over carbon tax model

48:08.340 --> 48:12.980
for a bill in America, we should probably have a carbon tax

48:12.980 --> 48:15.500
for kids because a bigger family in America

48:15.500 --> 48:18.100
is a big source of more emissions.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.140
It was kind of a playful thought bubble.

48:20.140 --> 48:22.220
Some right-wing blogger blogged about it.

48:22.220 --> 48:26.380
It got into Rush's pile of things to talk about.

48:26.380 --> 48:28.860
And the clip is really fun.

48:28.860 --> 48:30.020
Awesome meetings.

48:30.020 --> 48:35.020
So if humans are bad for the environment,

48:37.300 --> 48:41.580
I can imagine Rush, that's how you know you've made it.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.700
He said, Mr. Revkin of the New York Times,

48:44.700 --> 48:46.340
if you really think that people are the worst thing

48:46.340 --> 48:48.180
that ever happened to this planet,

48:48.180 --> 48:49.460
why don't you just kill yourself

48:49.460 --> 48:51.780
and save the planet by dying?

48:51.780 --> 48:53.380
That was tough for you.

48:53.380 --> 48:55.100
It was tough for my family.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.260
To me, it did generate some interesting calls

48:57.260 --> 48:58.900
and stuff in my voicemail.

49:01.020 --> 49:03.900
But on the left, I was also undercut.

49:03.900 --> 49:08.340
Roger Pilkey Jr., a prominent researcher of climate risk

49:08.340 --> 49:12.100
and climate policy, UC Boulder, was actively,

49:13.100 --> 49:16.940
his career track was derailed purposefully

49:16.940 --> 49:18.740
by people who just thought his message

49:18.740 --> 49:22.060
was too off the path.

49:22.060 --> 49:27.060
And you've been dealing with this for a very long time.

49:28.180 --> 49:31.380
So I just want to get back to the science.

49:31.380 --> 49:34.620
I don't think the science get it so much wrong

49:34.620 --> 49:38.460
as it just becomes accepted to make certain assumptions.

49:38.460 --> 49:40.740
As you just said, we assume no friction.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.900
So there's a way that you kind of model the world

49:43.900 --> 49:47.940
that ends up being also a convenient message in many ways.

49:47.940 --> 49:51.380
And I think the main convenient message in climate,

49:51.380 --> 49:54.300
and it's not surprising if you think about it,

49:54.300 --> 49:57.540
the main convenient message is that the best way

49:57.540 --> 50:00.340
to do something about all the things that we call climate

50:00.340 --> 50:02.260
is to cut CO2.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.020
And that turns out to only sometimes be true

50:05.020 --> 50:07.340
and with a lot of caveats.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.180
But that's sort of the message.

50:08.180 --> 50:09.820
And it takes a long time.

50:09.820 --> 50:12.180
Yes, it's really, really difficult to do

50:12.180 --> 50:15.060
in any meaningful sort of timeframe.

50:15.780 --> 50:18.180
And if you challenge that,

50:18.180 --> 50:20.740
yes, you're outside the flock and you get attacked.

50:20.740 --> 50:24.980
I've always, so somebody told me once, I think it's true.

50:24.980 --> 50:27.740
They say at the Harvard Law School,

50:27.740 --> 50:30.100
if you have a good case, pound the case.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.780
If you have a bad case, pound the table.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.940
And so I've always felt that when people go after me,

50:35.940 --> 50:37.220
they're kind of pounding the table.

50:37.220 --> 50:40.340
They're literally screaming, I don't have a good case.

50:40.340 --> 50:42.260
I'm really annoyed with what you're saying.

50:42.260 --> 50:46.060
And so to me, that actually means it's much more important

50:46.060 --> 50:47.660
to make this argument.

50:47.660 --> 50:50.860
Sure, I mean, I would love everyone just saying,

50:50.860 --> 50:52.020
oh, that's a really good point.

50:52.020 --> 50:53.140
I'm gonna use that.

50:53.140 --> 50:56.020
But we're stuck in a situation,

50:56.020 --> 50:59.260
certainly in a conversation where a lot of people

50:59.260 --> 51:02.620
have invested a lot of time and energy on saying,

51:02.620 --> 51:04.020
we should cut carbon emissions.

51:04.020 --> 51:06.420
This is the way to help humankind.

51:06.420 --> 51:09.260
And just be clear, I think we should cut carbon emissions

51:09.260 --> 51:11.620
as well, but we should also just be realistic

51:11.620 --> 51:13.020
about what we can achieve with that

51:13.020 --> 51:16.940
and what are all the other things that we could also do.

51:16.940 --> 51:18.740
And it turns out that a lot of these other things

51:18.740 --> 51:20.340
are much cheaper, much more effective,

51:20.340 --> 51:22.620
will help much more, much quicker.

51:22.620 --> 51:26.860
And so getting that point out is just incredibly important

51:26.860 --> 51:28.300
for us to get it right.

51:28.300 --> 51:32.140
So in some sense, to make sure that we don't do

51:32.140 --> 51:34.620
another Iraq and we don't do another,

51:35.620 --> 51:37.140
lots of stupid decisions.

51:37.140 --> 51:40.580
I mean, this is one of the things mankind is very good at.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.700
And I guess, I see my role,

51:43.700 --> 51:46.500
and I think that's probably also how you see yourself,

51:46.500 --> 51:50.380
is trying to get everyone to do it slightly less wrong.

51:50.380 --> 51:55.380
So let me ask you about a deep psychological effect for you.

51:55.940 --> 51:58.620
There's also a drug of martyrdom.

51:58.620 --> 52:00.980
So whenever you stand against the flock,

52:03.660 --> 52:08.660
you wrote a couple of really good books on the topic,

52:08.820 --> 52:11.020
The Most Recent False Alarm.

52:11.860 --> 52:14.980
I stand as the holder of truth

52:14.980 --> 52:18.180
that everybody who is alarmist is wrong.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.140
And here's just simple, calm way

52:20.140 --> 52:23.020
to express the facts of the matter.

52:23.020 --> 52:26.540
And that's very compelling to a very large number of people.

52:26.540 --> 52:28.380
They wanna make a martyr out of you.

52:29.260 --> 52:31.940
Is that, are you worried about your own mind

52:34.180 --> 52:35.460
being corrupted by that,

52:35.460 --> 52:39.100
by enjoying standing against the crowd?

52:39.100 --> 52:42.860
No, no, no, there's very little,

52:42.860 --> 52:45.020
I guess I can see what you're saying

52:45.020 --> 52:47.220
sort of in a literary way or something.

52:47.220 --> 52:48.860
Yeah, still being poetic here.

52:48.860 --> 52:53.180
Yeah, there's very little comfort or sort of usefulness

52:53.180 --> 52:55.700
in annoying a lot of people.

52:58.060 --> 53:00.100
Whenever I go to a party, for instance,

53:00.100 --> 53:01.740
I know that there's a good chance

53:01.740 --> 53:03.380
people are gonna be annoyed with me.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.140
And I would love that not to be the case.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.700
But what I try to do is,

53:08.620 --> 53:10.380
so I try to be very polite

53:10.380 --> 53:13.220
and sort of not push people's buttons

53:13.220 --> 53:15.140
unless they sort of actively say,

53:15.140 --> 53:18.780
so you're saying all kind of stupid stuff on the climate,

53:18.780 --> 53:19.660
right?

53:19.660 --> 53:21.380
And then try to engage with them and say,

53:21.380 --> 53:23.100
well, what is it you're thinking about?

53:23.100 --> 53:24.860
And hopefully, during that party,

53:24.860 --> 53:26.580
and then it ends up being a really bad party for me.

53:26.580 --> 53:31.220
But anyway, so I'll end up possibly convincing one person

53:31.220 --> 53:33.100
that I'm not totally stupid,

53:33.780 --> 53:35.220
but no, I'm not playing the martyr

53:35.220 --> 53:36.620
and I'm not enjoying that.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.100
It's so interesting.

53:40.820 --> 53:44.540
The martyr complex is all around the climate question.

53:44.540 --> 53:48.180
Michael Mann, at the far end of the spectrum of activism

53:48.180 --> 53:49.580
from where Bjorn is,

53:49.580 --> 53:51.660
was a climate scientist, is a climate scientist

53:51.660 --> 53:55.860
who was actively attacked by Inhofe

53:55.860 --> 54:00.620
and Virginia politicians and really abused in many ways.

54:00.660 --> 54:03.020
He had come up with a very prominent model

54:03.020 --> 54:06.460
of looking at long-term records of climate change

54:06.460 --> 54:08.980
and got this hockey stick for temperature.

54:09.820 --> 54:14.060
And he definitely sits there in a certain kind of spotlight

54:14.060 --> 54:15.900
because of that.

54:15.900 --> 54:19.540
So it's not unique at any particular vantage point

54:19.540 --> 54:23.980
in the spectrum of sort of prominent people on the debate.

54:23.980 --> 54:25.460
Andrew, you co-wrote the book,

54:25.460 --> 54:30.460
The Human Planet, Earth at the Dawn of the Anthropocene.

54:30.540 --> 54:33.300
Which is the new age when humans

54:33.300 --> 54:35.580
are actually having an impact on the environment.

54:35.580 --> 54:38.260
Let me ask the question of what do you find most beautiful

54:38.260 --> 54:41.540
and fascinating about our planet Earth?

54:41.540 --> 54:43.300
It'd be cheap to say everything,

54:43.300 --> 54:46.420
but just walking here this morning under the bridge

54:46.420 --> 54:48.740
over the Colorado River, seeing the birds,

54:48.740 --> 54:50.100
knowing there's bat colonies,

54:50.100 --> 54:51.500
massive bat colonies around here

54:51.500 --> 54:53.540
that I got to visit a few years ago.

54:53.540 --> 54:57.820
I experienced one of those bat explosions.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.500
It's mind-blowing.

54:59.500 --> 55:03.420
The, I've been really lucky as a journalist

55:03.420 --> 55:05.300
to have gone to the North Pole,

55:05.300 --> 55:08.900
the camp on the sea ice with Russian help.

55:08.900 --> 55:10.580
This is a camp that was set up for tourists

55:10.580 --> 55:12.380
coming from Europe every year.

55:12.380 --> 55:14.340
There were scientists on the sea ice

55:14.340 --> 55:18.020
floating on the 14,000 foot deep Arctic Ocean.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.340
And I was with them for several days.

55:19.340 --> 55:22.460
I wrote a book about that too, along with my reporting.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.620
Been in the depths of the Amazon rainforest.

55:24.620 --> 55:26.580
I've been, when I was very young,

55:27.420 --> 55:29.140
I was a crew on a sailboat that sailed

55:29.140 --> 55:30.460
two-thirds of the way around the world.

55:30.460 --> 55:33.140
I was halfway across the Indian Ocean,

55:33.140 --> 55:35.780
again, in 14,000 foot deep water.

55:35.780 --> 55:37.420
We were just, there was no wind.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.940
And we were, this was before, way before,

55:39.940 --> 55:42.820
I was a journalist, 22, 23 years old.

55:42.820 --> 55:46.060
And we went swimming, swimming in 14,000 foot deep water,

55:47.500 --> 55:49.860
500 miles from land, the Western Indian Ocean,

55:49.860 --> 55:54.780
halfway between Somalia and the Maldives.

55:54.820 --> 55:59.820
It's like so mind boggling, chillingly fantastical thing

55:59.820 --> 56:02.180
with a mask on, looking at your shadow,

56:02.180 --> 56:04.380
going to the vanishing point below you,

56:04.380 --> 56:06.820
looking over at the boat, which is a 60 foot boat,

56:06.820 --> 56:08.940
but it just looks like a toy.

56:08.940 --> 56:10.820
And then getting back on and being beholden

56:10.820 --> 56:13.740
to the elements, the sailboat, heading toward Djibouti.

56:13.740 --> 56:15.900
The immensity and the power of the elements.

56:15.900 --> 56:20.900
And then the human qualities are unbelievable.

56:21.620 --> 56:25.500
The Anthropocene, I played a bit of a role as a journalist

56:25.500 --> 56:29.060
in waking people up to the idea that this era

56:29.060 --> 56:32.460
called the Holocene, the last 11,000 years,

56:32.460 --> 56:35.380
since the last ice age, had ended.

56:35.380 --> 56:38.340
I wrote my 1992 book on global warming,

56:39.500 --> 56:41.140
thinking about all that we're just talking about,

56:41.140 --> 56:43.180
thinking about the wonders of the planet,

56:43.180 --> 56:45.660
thinking about the impact of humans so far

56:45.660 --> 56:49.900
in our explosive growth in the 20th century.

56:49.900 --> 56:53.140
I wrote that perhaps earth scientists of the future

56:53.140 --> 56:57.180
will name this post-Holocene era

56:57.180 --> 57:00.140
for its formative element for us,

57:01.500 --> 57:05.460
because we're kind of in charge in certain ways,

57:05.460 --> 57:08.020
you know, which is hubristic at the same time.

57:08.020 --> 57:11.620
It's like, you know, the variability of the climate system

57:11.620 --> 57:13.940
is still profound with or without global warming.

57:13.940 --> 57:16.820
So this immense, powerful, beautiful organism

57:16.820 --> 57:19.820
that is earth, all the different sub-organisms

57:20.620 --> 57:23.620
do you see humans as a kind of parasite on this earth?

57:23.620 --> 57:24.460
No, no.

57:24.460 --> 57:28.620
Or do you see it as something that helps

57:28.620 --> 57:31.180
the flourishing of the entire organism?

57:31.180 --> 57:32.340
That can.

57:32.340 --> 57:33.820
Can.

57:33.820 --> 57:35.100
Intelligence. That hasn't yet.

57:35.100 --> 57:35.940
Hasn't yet?

57:36.780 --> 57:39.220
I mean, aren't we on a,

57:39.220 --> 57:41.540
so the ability of the collective intelligence

57:41.540 --> 57:44.060
of the human species to develop all these kinds

57:44.060 --> 57:47.980
of technologies and to be able to have Twitter

57:47.980 --> 57:51.140
to introspect onto itself of who's.

57:51.140 --> 57:52.180
We should get Twitter to the animals.

57:52.180 --> 57:54.580
I think, you know, I think we're doing a,

57:54.580 --> 57:55.700
it's always been. In a way we are.

57:55.700 --> 57:56.540
It's catch up.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.900
We're always in catch up mode, you know.

57:58.900 --> 57:59.740
Right.

57:59.740 --> 58:03.140
I was at the Vatican for a big meeting in 2014

58:03.140 --> 58:05.500
on sustainable humanities, sustainable nature,

58:05.500 --> 58:06.980
our responsibility.

58:06.980 --> 58:11.380
And it was a week of presentations by like Martin Rees,

58:11.380 --> 58:14.900
who's this famed British scientist, a physicist who.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.380
Been on this podcast.

58:16.380 --> 58:17.220
Yeah, great.

58:17.620 --> 58:18.700
Well, he's, you know,

58:18.700 --> 58:21.420
he's fixated on existential risk, right?

58:21.420 --> 58:22.260
Yes, he is.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.500
So it was a week of this stuff.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.380
And the meeting was, was kicked off by,

58:28.540 --> 58:31.140
I wrote about it in the Cardinal Maradiaga,

58:31.140 --> 58:32.460
who is I think from El Salvador.

58:32.460 --> 58:34.060
He's one of the Pope's kind of posse.

58:34.060 --> 58:36.380
He gave one of the initial speeches and he said,

58:36.380 --> 58:41.380
nowadays, mankind looks like a technical giant

58:41.780 --> 58:46.460
and an ethical child, meaning our technological wizardry

58:46.460 --> 58:49.420
is unbelievable, but it's way out in front of our ability

58:49.420 --> 58:52.660
to step back and kind of like consider

58:52.660 --> 58:55.340
in the full dimensions we need to, is it helping everybody?

58:55.340 --> 58:59.460
Is it, what are the consequences of CRISPR?

58:59.460 --> 59:01.180
You know, genetics, technology.

59:01.180 --> 59:03.500
And there's no single answer to that.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.380
If I'm in the African Union,

59:06.380 --> 59:08.500
I'm just using this as an example.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.980
CRISPR has emerged so fast.

59:09.980 --> 59:13.860
It can do so much by changing the nature of nature.

59:14.500 --> 59:18.300
In a kind of a programming way, you know, building genes,

59:18.300 --> 59:21.500
not just transferring them from one organism to another.

59:21.500 --> 59:24.740
We've only just begun to taste the fruits of that, literally.

59:27.540 --> 59:29.460
And it can wipe out a mosquito species.

59:29.460 --> 59:30.300
We know how to do that now.

59:30.300 --> 59:35.340
You can like literally take out the dengue-causing mosquito.

59:35.340 --> 59:37.500
The scientists have done the work

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
and you think, okay, cool.

59:38.500 --> 59:39.900
Well, that's great.

59:39.900 --> 59:42.900
Now there's this big fight over whether that should happen.

59:43.780 --> 59:47.980
African Union, and I'm with their view, says,

59:47.980 --> 59:50.540
hey, if we can take out a mosquito species

59:50.540 --> 59:55.540
that's causing horrific, chronic loss through dengue,

59:55.540 --> 59:58.220
which I had once in Indonesia, it's not fun.

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.300
And we should do it, you know?

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.180
And Europe- What's the other side of the argument?

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.340
European Union, they're saying,

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.340
using their capital P precautionary principle,

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.100
says, no, we can't meddle with nature.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.980
And this is just like we were talking with climate.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.620
You know, there's the real-time question

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.940
and the long-term question.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:22.500
And there's the people who are just facing the need

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.980
to get through the day and be healthy and survive

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.460
and have enough food,

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.100
which is not integrated sufficiently at all

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.500
into the stop climate change debate.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.460
And those who are trying to cut CO2,

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.340
which will have a benefit in the future

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.420
limiting the fat tail outcomes of this journey we're on.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.580
So when I think about the Anthropocene,

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.500
I think about this planet.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.660
I love that we're here right now.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.980
I love that our species has these capacities.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.820
I would love for there to be a little bit more reflection

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.300
in where things come from and where they might go.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:05.300
Whether you're a student, a kid, what's your role?

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.620
The wonderful thing about the complexity of it

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.780
is everyone can play a role.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.660
If you're an artist or a designer or an architect

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.900
or an economist or a podcaster,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.180
whatever you do, just tweak a little bit

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.180
toward examining these questions,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.980
stepping back from the simplistic label throwing

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.980
toward what actually is the problem in front of me,

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.980
whether it's in Pakistan or in Boston or wherever,

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.900
you know, Florida.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.420
You know, what do you find beautiful

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.780
about this collective intelligence machine we have?

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.180
From an economics perspective,

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.900
it's kind of fascinating that we're able to,

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.380
there is a machine to it that we've built up

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.980
that's able to represent interests and desires and value

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.660
and hopes and dreams in sort of monetary ways

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.540
that we can trade with each other,

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.220
we can make agreements with each other,

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.260
we can represent our goals and build companies

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.540
that actually help and so on.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.700
Do you just step back every once in a while in Marvel

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.700
at the fact that a few billion of us

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.860
are able to somehow not create complete chaos

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.980
and actually collaborate

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:23.580
and have collaborative disagreements that ultimately

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.580
or so far have led to progress?

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.620
Yeah, I think fundamentally the point,

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.980
apart from the fact that we should just be joyful

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.740
of the fact that humans live here,

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.380
I think it's incredibly important to remember

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.460
how much progress we've had.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.260
Most people just don't stop to think about those stats.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.660
Yeah, I get that in the normal bustle of day,

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.060
but just, you know, in 1900,

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.460
the average person on the planet lived to be 32 years.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.780
32 years, that was our average life expectancy.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.180
Today, it's about 74.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.180
So we've literally got two lifetimes on this planet,

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.420
each one of us.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.060
And every year you live in the rich world,

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.180
you get to live three months longer

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.500
and the poor world is about four months longer.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.420
Because of medical advances,

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.500
because we get better at dealing both with cancer

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.460
and especially right now with heart disease,

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.100
these are amazing achievements.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.180
Of course, it's a very, very small part of it.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.700
We're much better fed, we're much better educated.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.260
We've gone from a world where virtually everyone

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.740
or 90% were illiterate

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.980
to a world where more than 90% illiterate.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.140
This is an astounding opportunity.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:44.140
And 200 years ago, 95%, 94% of the world

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:49.100
were extremely poor, that is less than a dollar a day.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.060
Today, for the first time in 2015,

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.380
it was down below 10%.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.180
And again, these are kind of boring statistics,

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.300
but they're also astounding testaments

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.420
of how well humanity has done.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.100
So just on the point of,

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.820
we've kind of just been focused

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.020
on making our own world better.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.740
And in many ways, so we've hunted a lot of big animals,

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.780
either to extinction or down to much, much smaller populations

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.380
as much smaller populations of fish in the ocean.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.740
So there's a lot of things

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.460
that sort of bear the brunt of our success.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.300
It's not because we're evil in that sense,

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.620
it's just because we didn't care all that much about them.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.980
I think it is important as one funnel of that,

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.340
I'm not going to make a big deal out of it,

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.180
but the fact that we're putting out more CO2

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:40.580
in the atmosphere, because CO2 as you also mentioned before,

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.300
it's actually plant food.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.220
If you're a greenhouse grower,

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.580
you know if you put in CO2 in your greenhouse,

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.460
you actually get bigger and plumper tomatoes.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.580
And that's essentially what we're doing in the world.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.380
This has overall bad consequences

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.340
and that's why we should be doing something about it.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.380
But one of the good side effects is actually

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.420
that the world is getting greener.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.300
So we get much more green stuff.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.300
Now, I don't know, and this is where I sort of show

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:12.500
my economist roots, because if you just measure

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.500
all living stuff in tons, so in weight,

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.740
there's actually more living stuff

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.700
than there were 100 years ago.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.460
Because elephants and all these other big fish and stuff

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.180
are actually really, really small fraction of the world.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.380
So yeah, the fact that we have, yes,

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.220
so we have an enormous amount of life stuff,

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.260
but that doesn't even measure it.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.700
It's mostly just wood, wood and green stuff

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.540
that has dramatically increased in the world.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.660
Now, we're still not there from what it was in 1500.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.460
So we've still cut down the world a lot,

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.660
but we're actually making a much greener world.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.740
Again, not because we really cared or thought about it,

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.100
but just sort of a side effect of what we're doing.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.660
I think the crucial bit to remember is when you're poor

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.180
and you worry about what's gonna happen the next day,

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.180
this is just not your main issue.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:12.780
Am I killing too many large animals in the world?

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.500
But when you're rich and you can actually sit

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.700
in a podcast in a convenient place in Austin,

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.340
you can also start thinking about this.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.780
So one of the crucial bits, I think,

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.980
if we want to get the rest of the world

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.820
to care about the environment, care about climate,

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.860
care about all these other issues,

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.700
we really need to get them out of poverty first.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.020
And it's a simple point that we often forget.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.580
And get them connected to all these gifts.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.420
I have these memories of,

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.460
well, I was reporting on the next big earthquake

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.420
that's gonna devastate Istanbul in 2009.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.380
I was in a slum, immigrant, poor neighborhood,

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.780
and walking around with an engineer

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.820
pointing out to the buildings that were gonna fall down.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.180
This is all known, there was an earthquake in 1999

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.900
and the next one's coming.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.700
One of my advantages in covering climate

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.260
is I've covered other kinds of disasters too,

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.780
so it keeps my context, you know,

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.980
me in touch with other things we could do.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.780
So I'm walking around and interviewing everybody,

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.700
went to the school that's being retrofit.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.300
They actually were getting ahead of it there.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.860
The World Bank provided some funding

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.700
to put in iron bars in the brick building.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:25.220
And I met these kids and they came,

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.140
when you're a journalist with a camera and stuff and a pad,

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.900
you get swarmed by kids, mostly in developing countries.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.740
And so these kids are running up to me.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.220
And they weren't going like, are you American?

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.740
Or just, they were saying Facebook, Facebook.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.780
And I went, that's interesting.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.740
And they led me to their little town,

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.420
a little community center that had a bank of eight or 10,

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.780
pretty flimsy computers.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.580
And they were all there playing a farm.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.540
There was a game that was hot at that time on Facebook.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.380
Farm.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.220
Farmville?

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.060
Farmville, yeah.

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.300
And you know, my son back in the Hudson Valley,

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:03.460
I remember him playing it and I thought, wow,

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.580
that is so fricking cool that these kids,

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.220
and actually I became Facebook friends

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.740
with a couple of them afterwards.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.900
We traded our, and I thought back to my youth

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.980
when we had pen pals, I would write a letter

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.140
to a kid in West Cameroon and he would write back.

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.620
And it took weeks and it was a crinkly letter

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.540
and I never met him.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.140
And now you can kind of connect with people.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.860
And that all through my blogging, you know,

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.980
at the New York Times, I was doing my regular reporting,

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.100
but I still launched a blog in 2007 called Dot Earth,

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.300
which was all about where you were just describing

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.700
the newest sphere, the connected world.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.900
That's a term from these two earliest 20,

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.660
a Russian guy, an early Vernadsky

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.260
and a French theologian and scientist,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.580
which is so interesting, Teilhard de Chardin.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.140
They had this idea in the early 20th century

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.820
that we're creating a planet of the mind,

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.740
that human intelligence can foster a better earth.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.980
And I just became smitten with that,

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.500
especially meeting kids in Istanbul slums

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.540
who are on Facebook looking at connectedness.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.260
What can you do with these tools?

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.940
Which is what drives me, you know, with my work now.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:22.700
And, but then there are these counterweights,

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.260
counter currents that if the connectedness can cut back,

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.580
you know, it allowed Al Qaeda to recruit,

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.980
use decapitation videos to recruit distributed,

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.740
disaffected young people into extremism.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.140
And, you know, there's lots of, these systems are not,

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.740
they're just like every other tool, right?

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.140
They're just for good or ill.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.780
And the efficiency thing, the economics of the world,

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.100
which I also wrote about a little bit,

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.180
you know, late 20th century, it was so cool

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.300
that everything became so efficient,

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:02.580
that our supply chains are just in time manufacturing,

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.540
you know, getting the stuff

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.700
from where the sources of the material are

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.220
to the car factory and to get the car to the floor

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.900
just in time for someone to buy it.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.820
And everyone got totally sucked in by that, including me.

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.580
It's great, you know, super efficient, cheaper.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.980
And then COVID hit

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.460
and the whole supply chain concept crumbled.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.900
And one of the big lessons there, hopefully,

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.100
and this is relevant to sustainability generally,

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.460
is efficiency matters, but resilience matters too.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.420
And resilience is inefficient.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.420
You need redundancy or a variety of options, right?

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.900
Which is not what corporate companies think about,

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.060
which is not what, if you're only focused

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.380
on a bottom line, short-term timeline,

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.580
those disruptions are not what you're thinking about.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.140
You're still thinking about, can we get that widget here

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.420
just in time for this thing to happen?

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.100
And then on we go.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.980
So it's kind of, I love the Noosphere,

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.900
this Nuosphere idea, the connectedness is fantastic.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.020
Oh, another thing, like in the early 90s,

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.660
when I wrote my first book on global warming,

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.140
it was for an exhibition at the Museum of Natural History.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.980
The Environmental Defense Fund was involved.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.580
They were like a partner,

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.100
one of these longstanding environmental groups.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.300
And they're very old fashioned, it's mostly lawyers really,

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.380
just using the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.220
to litigate against pollution.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.580
And now EDF is vastly bigger.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.940
And they're actually, this coming year,

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.540
they're launching a satellite.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.460
An environmental group is launching Methane Sat.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.700
And it's providing a view, an independent view

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.420
of where there's this gas.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.660
Same thing, natural gas is basically methane.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.220
So if you have a leak, whether it's in Siberia

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.980
or in Oklahoma, you can cross-reference,

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.180
you can ground truth, you can identify the hotspot,

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.540
you can know where the problem is to fix in so many ways.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.460
And that's just one example.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.780
I'm like, if someone had told me in 1993

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.860
that EDF was gonna launch a methane satellite,

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:02.940
I would have laughed out loud.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.340
So technology plays a huge role

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.460
if it's kind of employed

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.180
with the bigger vision and leadership.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.940
So Bjorn, you wrote, one of the books you wrote,

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.300
the most recent one called False Alarm,

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.900
How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions,

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.900
Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.500
Good title by the way, very intense,

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.020
makes me wanna read it.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:31.060
What is likely the worst effect of climate change?

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.660
First, let me just, my editor actually hated the subtitle

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.820
because it gives away the whole book.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.460
Basically, it tells you what the book tries to make.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.940
I think that's exactly what it should be.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.180
It's about getting this conversation out

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.180
in the public sphere.

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.220
So the worst thing that climate change can do

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.940
is like the worst thing that anything can do

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.700
is that it wipes out everything and we all die.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.020
So it's not like, you know,

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.140
if you're just looking for worst case outcomes,

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.980
you know, anything can get to the worst case outcome.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.860
Imagine if we, what's the worst thing

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.220
that could happen from HIV?

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:14.740
It breaks down one or more African states

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.100
because we don't fix it.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.300
And then you get sort of biological warfare and terrorism,

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.540
throw in that in the mix,

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.260
and then you get someone who makes a virus

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.740
and kills the whole world.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.580
You can make worst case scenarios for everything.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.620
But let's just call it, I get the point.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.100
Sorry for any interruption.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.260
And I appreciate worst case analysis

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.660
because I am fundamentally a computer scientist

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.420
and that was the thing that defined the discipline

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.980
of the measure of the quality of the algorithm.

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.340
You measure what is this worst case performance.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.540
That's the big O notation.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.940
That's how you discuss algorithms.

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:49.820
What is the worst possible thing

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.620
in terms of performance this thing can do?

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.340
But for climate change, let's even go crazy.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:01.220
What is exactly the worst case scenario for climate change?

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.420
Because I have to be honest and say,

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.020
I haven't really paid deep attention.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.100
I just have a lot of colleagues

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.140
who think about climate and so on.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.420
And there's a kind of, in the alarmism,

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.700
there was a sense why this is a very serious problem.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.940
And then the sentence would never finish.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.180
What exactly is the problem?

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.340
Well, the extinction of the human species, okay.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.740
With a virus, I understand how that can possibly happen.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.620
What is the mechanism by which the human species

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.420
becomes extinct because of climate change?

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.620
I'm not sure I would want to be able to argue that

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.820
because it really requires you to have sort of very,

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.740
very extreme parameter choices all down the line.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:46.860
So it's more, it's this kind of idea

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.620
that we hit some of these unexpected outcomes.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.620
So for instance, the Western Antarctic ice sheet

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.660
melts really, really quickly.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.100
It doesn't look like that can happen really, really quickly,

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.260
but let's just say that this could happen

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.140
within a hundred years or something.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.140
So we basically get what, seven meters,

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.940
what is that, 20 feet of sea level rise.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.460
That will be a real challenge

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:12.220
to a lot of places around the world.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.780
This would have significant costs.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.540
It's likely, and there's actually been a study

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.900
that's tried to estimate, could we deal with that?

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:24.900
And the short answer is yes, if you're fairly well off.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.340
If you're a Holland, you can definitely deal with it.

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:30.140
It's also likely that most developing countries

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.180
are gonna be much closer to Holland

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.420
towards the end of the century

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.900
because they'll be much richer.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.380
So they can probably handle it,

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.700
but it will be a real challenge.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.180
May I ask a dumb question?

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:43.180
What happens when the sea level rises exactly?

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.860
What is the painful aspect of that?

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.820
It is that all of your current infrastructure

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.420
in a lot of coastal cities around the world

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.260
that are literally built on,

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.740
Jakarta is a good example,

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.940
that are literally built on the just inches

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.460
above the sea level.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.460
If you then get a sea level rise,

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.300
they'll rise, say, what would, 20 feet,

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.820
that would be like a third or a fourth of a foot every year.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.020
Yeah, I see no evidence that that's even.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.420
Hold on a second, we're not talking about evidence.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.460
We're talking about worst case analysis and algorithm.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.180
So basically you would see your infrastructure,

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.460
all your stuff, very quickly being very, very challenged

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.660
and you'd basically have to put up huge sea walls

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.620
or migrate out of that area.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.820
Very quickly.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.340
Well, very quickly as in 50 years or something.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.340
Right, so like, is that as a human species,

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.140
we're not able to respond to that kind of thing?

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:42.980
Of course we are.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.420
And look, again, the point here is,

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.540
then there's a lot of other arguments

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.380
and I should just put the disclaimer,

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.140
this is not what I think is correct,

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:55.460
but you're asking me what's the worst case outcome

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.620
that you have.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.140
So most of global warming is really about

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.260
that we're used to one way of doing things.

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.700
So we live in Jakarta because it's right next to the sea.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.140
We're used to the sea being at this level.

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.860
We grow our crops because we're used to,

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.300
you grow corn here, you grow wheat here

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.900
because we're used to that's where the precipitation

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.420
and the temperature is the right for this kind of crop.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.780
If this changes, and this is the same thing with houses,

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.900
if it gets colder, if it gets warmer,

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.980
it's suddenly uncomfortable

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.100
because you've built your house wrong.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.780
So our infrastructure will be wrong if the world changes

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.860
and that's what climate change is.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.180
At a large scale.

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.100
Yes, and so this is a problem in most of these senses,

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.700
but if you then sort of take it to the extreme

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.700
and say, well, imagine that you're gonna get

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.100
a huge sea level rise.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.380
Imagine that you're gonna get a very different

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.020
sort of precipitation, for instance,

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.740
what is it, the rain season, monsoon

01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:00.740
and the Indian subcontinent changes dramatically.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.900
That could affect a lot of agriculture

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.820
and make it really hard to imagine

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:07.860
that you could feed India well.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.100
There are these kinds of things where you can imagine

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.860
and then that this would be very difficult to deal with.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.780
And then if you add all of it up,

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.260
you could possibly get sort of a system collapse

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.500
because you just have too many problems.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.420
It's impossible to model those kinds of things.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.420
So what I understand is the sea level rise itself

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.180
isn't the destructive thing.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:35.380
It's the fact that it creates migration patterns

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.460
and human tension, battle over resources.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:43.460
And so you start to get these human things, human conflict.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.980
So the big negative impact won't be necessarily

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.940
from the fact that you have to move your house.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.260
It's the fact that once you move your house,

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.020
that means something else down the line

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.460
and it's the secondary tertiary effects

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.260
that can have potentially towards military conflict,

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:02.380
can have destabilized entire economies,

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.740
all that kind of stuff because of the migration pattern.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.100
Is it possible to model those kinds of things?

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.820
So there are people who looked at this

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:12.380
and surprisingly again, most people will move

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.660
within their country for a lot of different reasons,

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.980
but mainly language and political structure.

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.700
You have your money, you have your relationships there.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.620
So it's not like we're gonna see these big moves

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:28.620
from the Southern Mexico and Central America

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.940
up to the US or from Africa up to the EU.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.740
That's not predominantly because of climate.

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:38.500
That's because there's a lot of welfare opportunity.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.580
You can make your life much, much better

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.980
and you can become much more productive

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.260
if you move into a richer country.

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.460
So yes, there are these issues.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.300
Again, you're asking me for sort of what is it

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.540
that could really sort of break down the world.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.660
I think the fundamental point is to recognize

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.740
that it's not like we haven't dealt

01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:00.460
with huge challenges in the past

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.220
and we've dealt with them really well.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.340
So just one fun thing, I encourage everyone

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:09.660
to just look that up on Wikipedia, the rising of Chicago.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:14.660
So in the 1850s, Chicago was a terribly dirty place

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.340
and they didn't have good sewers.

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.900
And so they decided, and we can't really make up all my,

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.380
they decided to raise Chicago one to two feet.

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.740
And so they simply took one block at a time.

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.420
They put like 50,000 jacks underneath a building

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:32.620
and they would just raise the building

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.220
and then they'd go on to the next building.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.340
They raised all of Chicago one to two feet.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.620
This is almost 200 years ago.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:42.180
Of course we will be able to deal with these things.

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.500
I'm not saying it'll be fun or that it'll be cheap.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.140
Of course we would rather not have to deal with this,

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.180
but we're a very inventive species

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.060
and so it's very unlikely that we'll not be able to

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:53.900
deal with these issues.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.220
What about COVID pandemic just said, hold my beer.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:03.780
The response of human civilization to the COVID pandemic

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.340
seems to have not, they didn't find the car jacks.

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.940
It seems to have not been as effective

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:15.940
as I would have hoped for as a human that believes

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.780
in the basic competence of leadership

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.260
and all that kind of stuff.

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.060
It seems that given the COVID pandemic,

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.100
luckily did not turn out to be a pandemic

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.500
that would eradicate most of the human species,

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.660
which is something you always have to consider

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.540
and worry about that I would have hoped

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.340
we would have less economic impact

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.700
and we would respond more effectively

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:44.260
and in terms of policy, in terms of socially,

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:45.620
medically, all that kind of stuff.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:49.900
So if the COVID pandemic brought the world to its knees,

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.460
then what does a sea level rise?

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.220
I think there's a different kind of thing

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.300
that happened in the COVID.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.740
So politicians and a lot of politicians,

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.980
I think made certainly suboptimal decisions,

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.500
but I also find the fact that we actually managed

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.220
to get a vaccine in a year.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.820
We should not be sort of unaware of the fact that yes,

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.740
we did a lot of stupid stuff and a lot of people

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:15.940
were really, really annoyed,

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.420
but fundamentally we fixed this.

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.540
We could have done it better and prettier.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.060
I mean, I rode through the COVID pandemic

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.980
in southern Sweden.

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:30.020
So, and yes, we can have that whole conversation.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.820
It was certainly much easier to live there

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.540
than many other places,

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.460
but the fundamental point was we actually fixed it.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:40.060
So yes, and we'll do that with climate.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.980
We'll make a lot of bad decisions

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.580
and we'll waste a lot of money

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.420
like we do with all other problems,

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.420
but are we gonna fix this?

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.500
Yeah.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.780
Can you add onto that uncomfortable discussion

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.060
of what's the worst thing that could possibly happen?

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.820
I'm not worried about the sea level rise component.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.180
Certainly not nearly as much as the heat

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:02.980
and disruption of agriculture patterns and water supplies.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.420
And a lot of it relates to, again,

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.980
path dependency and history.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.460
Farmers are the heroes of humanity all through history

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.940
because they're incredibly adaptable

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:18.260
if you give them access to resources.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.820
In some cases, it's just crop insurance,

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.260
which is really basically still impossible

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.020
to get in big chunks of Africa

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.580
to get you through those hard spots.

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.420
But the heat issue is the one that's most,

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.980
the most basic element related to global warming

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.980
from CO2 buildup is hotter heat waves.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.340
There's still some lack of evidence

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.420
of the intensification, but the duration

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.540
and that's what really matters for heat

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:51.060
is how many days seems to be very powerfully linked

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.620
to global warming.

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.860
And so how many people die as a result of that is important.

01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.140
So we're talking about, maybe you can also educate me,

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.900
what's the average projection for the next 100 years

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.060
as the temperature rises at two degrees Celsius?

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:11.300
Well, yeah, although this gets us into the modeling realm.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.940
You're assuming, you have to assume

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:16.820
the different emissions possibilities.

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.660
You have to assume we still don't know the basic physics

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:24.140
like how many clouds form in a warming climate

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:26.860
and how that relates to limiting warming.

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.020
There are aspects of the warming,

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.260
the fundamental warming question

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.860
that are still deeply uncertain.

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.900
But the debate is like two, three or four Celsius.

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:34.740
It's in that range.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.780
The thing is all of those are bad for,

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.540
this is an educational question.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.420
It doesn't seem like that much from a weather perspective

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.420
if you just turn up the AC and so on

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.620
in your own personal home,

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.740
but it is from a global perspective

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.980
a huge impact on agriculture.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:58.420
Well, yeah, and getting back to sea level and glaciers,

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.820
the melting point of ice is a number.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.020
And so if you pass that number, things start to change.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.740
What became known about Antarctica and Greenland more

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.860
is that it's ocean temperature,

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.180
the seawater in and around and under these ice sheets,

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.100
because it kind of gets under parts of Antarctica,

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.900
is what's driving the dynamics

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.260
that could lead to more abrupt change

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.420
more than air temperature.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.380
Glaciers, these big ice sheets live or die

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.700
based on how much snow falls

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.180
and how much ice leaves every year.

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.140
And I was up on the Greenland ice sheet in 2004

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.900
and written about it forever since then.

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.940
It's the same amount of water that's in the Gulf of Mexico

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.220
as if God or some great force came down

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.980
and fell ash flows the Gulf of Mexico

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.260
and plunked it up on land.

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260
That's the ice sheet.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.580
It's a lot of water.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.740
That's 23 feet of sea level rise if you,

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.660
but you were not gonna melt it all.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.700
And the pace at which that erosion begins

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.820
and becomes sort of a runaway train

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:09.180
is still not well understood.

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.140
That changed from like a manageable level

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.100
of sea level rise from these ice sheets

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.260
to something that becomes truly unstoppable

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.660
or that has these discontinuities

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.620
where you get a lot more all of a sudden.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.260
To me, it's in the realm of what I've taken to calling

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:30.740
unknowables, like don't count on another IPCC report

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.220
magically including science that says, aha, now we know

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.540
it's gonna be five feet by 2100.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.060
Because learning, there's a lot of negative learning

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.300
in science, this may be true in your body of science too.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.380
There's a guy named Jeremy Bassas, B-A-S-S-I-S

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:52.060
who wrote a paper about the idea

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.820
that you could get this sudden cliff

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.900
breakdown of these ice shelves around Antarctica

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.180
leading to rapid sea level rise.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.860
He did more modeling and physics

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.060
and it turns out that you end up with,

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.060
it's a much more progressive and self-limiting phenomenon.

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.980
But those papers don't get any attention in the media

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.420
because they're not scary.

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.380
They're not scary and they're sort of after the fact.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.660
Just this past year, there's been this cycle around collapse,

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:22.700
the word collapse and Antarctic ice.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:27.620
It started actually several years ago with the idea

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:31.060
that the West Antarctic ice sheet is particularly vulnerable

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.380
and some papers, everyone, the science community,

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.540
like the birds we were talking about flocks to it

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.020
and some high profile papers are written.

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.100
And then a deeper inquiry reveals,

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.060
eh, you know, it's more complicated than that.

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:45.780
And we, the journalists, the media,

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:49.380
pundits don't pay attention to that stuff.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.980
So, and actually, which is why I started to develop

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.380
kind of a dictionary, I call it watchwords, like words to,

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.260
if you're out there, you're, you know,

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:01.580
you're just a public person,

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.260
you're a person and you wanna know what's really going on.

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:08.500
You hear these words like collapse in the context of ice.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.860
What do you do with that?

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.540
And so I've created conversations around these words.

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.660
Geologists and ice scientists use the word collapse.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.980
They're talking about a centuries long process.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.900
They're not talking about the World Trade Center.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.900
And scientists would do well to be more careful

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.020
with words like that.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.460
Unless your focus is what we were saying earlier,

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:33.260
your idea that alarming people will spur them to act,

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.660
then you use that word carelessly.

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:38.900
Can I just follow up on the other point that you said,

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.700
you know, two, three, four degrees, you know,

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.060
that doesn't sound like much.

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.460
I can just crank up the air conditioning.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.460
I think that sort of touches on a really,

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.980
really important point that for most rich people,

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.020
much of climate change is not really gonna be

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.740
all that impactful, it still will have an impact.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.220
But fundamentally, if you're well off,

01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.660
you can mitigate a lot of these impacts.

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.820
And there's a young scientist at Carnegie Mellon,

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.740
Destiny Nock.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740
She just was lead author on a study,

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:12.140
what poor and prosperous households do in a heat wave

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.340
when they have access to air conditioning.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.780
In a poor household, you wait, they found through science.

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.900
They delay turning on the air conditioner

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.700
four to seven degrees more of heating

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.500
before they start to use the air conditioner.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.340
And that create adverse outcomes.

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.900
If you have an asthmatic in the house, an old person,

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.980
you're endangering their lives.

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:36.980
And that's just a little tiny microscopic fractal example,

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.780
this powerful real phenomenon

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:42.020
that there's a divide in vulnerability

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:44.780
and it's not just based on where you live.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.380
This is families in like Pittsburgh.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:48.820
We're not talking about, you know, Botswana.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.300
And so that divide in capacity to deal

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.580
with environmental stress

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.060
is something you can really work on.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.580
And it gets hidden in all this talk of climate crisis.

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:04.580
And that's one of the important parts is both to say,

01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:09.220
look, if seven billion people, sorry, eight billion people

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.660
will now have all experienced this,

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.100
even though for each one of them, it's manageable,

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.300
it's still a big problem because it's, you know,

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.220
eight billion people living through this.

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.380
And how do you air condition eight billion people?

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:24.380
Yes, and then it's the point of getting to realize

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:27.900
it's very, very much about how do you help the world's poor.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:31.260
And that's very much about making it more affordable,

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.460
you know, basically getting them out of poverty.

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.740
And remember, getting out of poverty doesn't just mean

01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:37.900
that they can now afford to air condition themselves,

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.340
but they get better education,

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.020
they get better opportunities,

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.900
they get better lives in so many other ways.

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.300
And then at the end of it, it's not just about making sure

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.540
that we focus on this one problem,

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.500
but it's recognizing that these families

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.260
and have lots of different issues

01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:00.220
that they would like us to focus on climate and heat waves,

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.740
just being one of them.

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.300
So, you know, it's sort of taking progressive steps back

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.420
and realizing, all right, okay, this is a problem,

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.260
not the end of the world.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.940
And one tiny little last example,

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.260
you mentioned Jakarta at the beginning.

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.900
It's really valuable to look around the world

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.620
at places that are sort of leading indicator places,

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.740
whether it's sea level rise or heat.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.220
And you could do that.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.740
Jakarta is sinking like a foot a year,

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.020
literally a foot a year.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.620
It's some insane number from withdrawing groundwater,

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.740
from gas withdrawal, from it's a Delta, you know,

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.580
it's sediment, it's built on sediment.

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.940
I wrote a piece ages ago at the New York Times

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.500
calling it Delta Blues, you know, the musicians.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.740
And in Jakarta, so what are they doing?

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:44.780
They're moving, they're moving the capital to another area.

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:49.220
So that says to me, there's a lot of plasticity too.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.620
It's a city that's going through this,

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.340
that rate of sea level, of their relationship

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.500
with the sea level through sinking is way faster

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.140
than what's happening with global warming.

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.940
So look there, look to those kinds of places

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.540
and you can start to build.

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:05.540
Tokyo had the same thing in the 1930s.

01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:09.140
They were also withdrawing lots of water way too fast.

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.100
And so, you know, one of the obvious things is

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.900
maybe you should stop withdrawing water so fast.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.780
Yeah, and again, we seem to almost be intent

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.540
on finding the most politically correct way

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.260
to fix a problem or, you know, the most,

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.580
the thing that sort of gets the most clicks

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.540
instead of the thing that actually works the best.

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.660
So a lot of these things are really, you know,

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.140
not rocket science solutions.

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.300
We'll get there.

01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.820
Let me add one more on top of the pile

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.260
of the worst case analysis.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.540
So what people talk about,

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.620
which is hurricanes and earthquakes,

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:43.180
does, is there a connection that's well understood

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:48.180
between climate change and the increased frequency

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.780
and intensity of hurricanes and earthquakes?

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:54.820
I've dug in on both a lot.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.500
The earthquake connection to climate change

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.900
I've not worried about compared to just the earthquake risk

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.340
that we live with in many parts of the world already.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:04.820
The Himalayas, even with that earthquake in 2015

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:09.820
in Kathmandu, that whole range is overdue

01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.500
for major earthquakes.

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.100
And what has happened in the last 50 years

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.980
since they last had big earthquakes,

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.940
huge development, big cities,

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.820
a lot of informal construction,

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:22.060
like the stuff I wrote about in Istanbul,

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.700
where the family builds another layer and another,

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.540
they put a floor on every time someone gets married

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.420
and has kids, they put another floor in the house.

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.420
And unfortunately that's, what was the term,

01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:37.420
this Turkish engineer, rubble in waiting.

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.300
Rubble in waiting.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.460
It's rubble in waiting and we're looking at it,

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.220
videotaping it and there are people playing there.

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.660
So I don't worry about the earthquake connection

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.940
to climate change.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.420
The hurricanes I've written about for decades

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.740
and the most illuminating body of science

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:58.580
that I've dug in on literally related to hurricanes

01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.140
is this field that's emerged,

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.820
gets a tiny bit of money compared to like climate modeling.

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.540
It's called paleotempestology.

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.460
It's like paleontology.

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.140
They look for evidence of past hurricanes

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.260
along coasts that we care about.

01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:16.900
And they dig down into the lagoons behind

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.220
like the barrier beaches along Florida or the Carolinas

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.340
or in Puerto Rico.

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:24.740
And what you have is a history book of past hurricanes.

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.100
So there's mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud,

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:28.980
you know, accumulating over centuries.

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.660
And then there's a layer of sand and seashells.

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:35.020
And what that indicates is that there was a great storm

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.060
that came across the beach,

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.300
pushed a lot of sediment into the mud.

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.380
And then there's mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud.

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.220
And when you look at that work,

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.580
I first wrote about this in 2001 in the Times,

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.340
a long story and then I've kept track

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:53.380
of these intrepid scientists putting these core tubes down.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:55.900
It shows you that we're in a landscape

01:34:55.900 --> 01:35:00.900
where big bad hurricanes are not, they're the norm.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.020
But something that's rare and big

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.980
is something that's extreme.

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.300
When you think about the word extreme, right?

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:10.580
It means it's at the end of the spectrum of what's possible.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.860
They're rare, rare in human timescales.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.980
Hurricane Michael, four years ago,

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.940
devastated, category five came ashore

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.780
in the panhandle of Florida,

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:24.620
leveled that much photographed town, Mexico Beach.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.980
And people, actually the Tallahassee

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:33.180
National Weather Service said unprecedented hurricane.

01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:35.620
And the damage was unprecedented

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:38.260
because there hadn't been a community there before.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.380
But the hurricane was not unprecedented at all.

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.700
If you look at the history, and this is published research,

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.860
it's just that no one bothers to,

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:49.300
we have this blind spot for the longer timescale

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.460
you need to examine if you're thinking

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.500
about big bad things that are rare

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.780
and hurricanes are still rare.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:59.780
I was recently covering Fort Myers, the awful devastation.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.700
There's a young climate scientist

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:06.380
at Florida Gulf Coast University, Joe Muller,

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.540
who's done that paleotempastology work there

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.460
right in Fort Myers.

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:11.660
She lives there and she was away in London

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:13.460
at a meeting of reinsurance companies

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.780
that reinsure all the world's big bad risks

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:17.460
when this was happening.

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.500
But she has done the work that shows

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.460
it's a thousand year record of past hurricanes

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.940
and it's super sobering.

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.500
When you consider how fast people have moved into Florida

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.460
and built vulnerably in an area

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.860
that hurricanes will hammer,

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.700
that part of the fundamental dynamics

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.140
of the Gulf of Mexico and the storms come off of Africa,

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.900
it's a place where they would come.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.460
Now the question of global warming impact is subtle.

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.500
There are aspects of hurricanes that haven't changed.

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.340
There's aspects like rainfall

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:53.420
that seem pretty powerfully linked to global warming.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.460
A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture

01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.700
so when you have a big disturbance

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.660
like the heat engine of a hurricane comes through it,

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.420
you get more rain.

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.580
There's rapid intensification,

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:08.580
how quickly these storms jump from category one

01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:13.820
to five or four before they hit is a new area of science.

01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.820
So I think it's still early days in knowing

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:19.100
because no one was looking for that.

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.860
There were no data back 300 years ago

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.540
when these big bad previous hurricanes came

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.060
to know whether they were rapidly intensified or not.

01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:30.820
So as a journalist, I try to keep track

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.660
of what we don't know, not be too constrained

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.740
and think about new science as being

01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.300
robust unless it's considering

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.660
and actually actively stating,

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.140
we don't really know what's going on

01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:46.860
with earlier hurricanes.

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.420
And all of that is swamped ultimately,

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.900
literally by the vulnerability,

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.580
building vulnerability in these areas.

01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.780
If there's a marginal change in a storm

01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:01.820
and you've quadrupled or sextupled how much stuff

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.820
and how many people are in the way,

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:06.420
and if some of those people are poor and vulnerable

01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.020
or elderly and can't swim,

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.340
you're creating a landscape of destruction.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:15.140
So a lot of the human suffering that has to do

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:19.020
with storms is about where and how you build

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.460
versus the frequency and the intensity of storms.

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.580
Still, you didn't quite answer the question.

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:30.020
When I'm having a beer with people at a bar

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.220
and they say, hey, why are you having a beer?

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.660
We're all going to die because of climate change,

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.060
that's usually what they bring up.

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.460
And I'm just trying to add some levity.

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.900
No, this is good.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:43.380
Usually what they bring up is the hurricanes

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:46.940
and the most recent hurricanes saying like this,

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:49.700
they're getting crazy, hurricanes all the time,

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.460
they're getting more intense, more frequent, and so on.

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.860
I'm sure there's incredible science going on

01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.020
trying to look at this.

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:04.300
Is there evidence, and is it possible to have evidence

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:09.060
that there's a connection between what we can call

01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.620
global warming and the increased frequency

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.940
and intensity of storms?

01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:13.780
No.

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.060
Okay, no, thank you.

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.420
Well, you added intensity.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.140
Let me just get into this a tiny bit more.

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:25.220
I mean, hurricanes, I grew up with them in Rhode Island

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:28.060
in my youth, and there was a very active period

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:32.900
of hurricanes in New England in the 50s and 60s, 70s.

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.460
And then in the North Atlantic, generally,

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:39.380
was very, very active in the 50s when I was a kid.

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:43.020
And the dynamics of them forming off of Africa

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.260
and coming here, circling up the coast was just prime time.

01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.260
Then there was like what Kerry Emanuel,

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:53.140
who's the most experienced hurricane climate scientist

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:57.860
around at MIT, he was in, he's in this story.

01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:59.940
He's in my 1988 article.

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:04.060
He and colleagues have found, and others,

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:07.500
that there's what they call the hurricane drought

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.340
from like the 70s through about 1994 in the Atlantic,

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.380
specifically the Atlantic basin.

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.460
And there's been a lot of questions about that.

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.260
People thought it was ocean circulation,

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.740
something about the currents.

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.940
There are these multi-decadal

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.620
variabilities in the oceans, right?

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:27.060
And then now it looks robustly,

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:30.340
I can't find a climate scientist who disagrees

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:34.980
that the thing that caused the drought was pollution, smog.

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.620
And significantly in Europe, and you're saying,

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.980
well, how does smog in Europe relate to hurricanes

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.380
crossing the Atlantic and getting to the United States?

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:49.700
It's because of the smog was changing the behavior

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:52.300
of the Sahara Desert, which is just south of Europe.

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:56.820
And the Sahara Desert kills hurricanes,

01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.500
sand and dust coming off the Sahara.

01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.860
You can see this every year.

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:03.380
And when that's active, it stifles these big storms

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:06.020
at the point right in their nursery, they all form,

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:09.020
there's this area for hurricanes off of West Africa.

01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.340
That's like the nursery zone.

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:12.140
And so if you're stifling those hurricanes

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:15.260
because of pollution in Europe

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.860
before the Clean Air Act's kind of cleanups,

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.740
and then that goes away,

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.900
none of that has anything to do with global warming.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.860
It's another kind of forcing in the climate system,

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.700
a local one that created a regional dynamic

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.740
that created a quiet period

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.340
when all these friends in the bar,

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:37.420
maybe they were born in the 90s or whatever,

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.180
they grew up in an area of hurricanes weren't a big deal.

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.220
And now we have an end to that drought

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:47.060
because we cleaned up the air pollution,

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:50.020
the sooty kind of air pollution, sulfury.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.340
And anyone who says global warming, global warming,

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.340
without saying, well, that's in there too,

01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:57.420
is kind of missing that.

01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.900
And when you look globally,

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.380
still, I think, was it 90 or so hurricanes a year,

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:05.740
cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons, globally,

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:06.580
that hasn't changed.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.020
The number of these tropical storms

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.380
that reach that ferocity has not changed.

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:14.620
It's just a fundamental dynamic of,

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.460
and by the way, on the long time scale,

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.460
the models still indicate as you warm the planet,

01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.820
and remember the Arctic warms quicker.

01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:26.300
This is something people probably understand.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300
You're actually evening out the imbalance

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.820
between the heat at the equator

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:35.260
and the cold in the northern part of the hemisphere.

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.860
And that calms the whole system down.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:40.020
So there could be fewer hurricanes later in the century

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.500
because of global warming.

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:44.780
And for me, that's a lot of information,

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:49.260
but if I'm in a bar, I start with, what do you care about?

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.500
You care about safety, you care about security,

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.220
you care about having everybody safe, not just you.

01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.820
You get in your car and you can evacuate.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.740
What about the old person or the poor family

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:01.580
who can't do that?

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.020
They're not gonna leave their house.

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.820
What are we doing to limit vulnerability now?

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.580
That, I circle back to that over and over again.

01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.740
I have like a pocket card,

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.900
I have this graphic card I created about risk.

01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.980
And what we really care about is climate risk.

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.420
Like, who's at risk?

01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:19.660
What's driving the risk?

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.500
How do you reduce that?

01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:21.980
You can almost pull it out in a bar.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.820
I should print them.

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.660
You should do that.

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.420
It's like, risk is the hazard.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:28.940
Risk is the hazard.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:33.020
Like, you know, the hazard is a storm,

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:38.020
times exposure, how many people, how much stuff,

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:43.780
and factoring in vulnerability or resilience.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:48.580
And climate change is changing the hazard for some things,

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:50.860
not for tornadoes, not for everything.

01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:54.660
Exposure is this expanding bullseye.

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:57.540
This is another hashtag, expanding bullseye.

01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:58.780
Get out there and look for that.

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:02.180
And you'll see, I'm pushing these two geographers

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.900
who do this for every hazard, wildfire, earthquake,

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.580
flood, coastal storm.

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:12.180
And we're building an expanding bullseye in an area

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.020
and nature's throwing darts.

01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:15.100
Some of the darts are getting bigger

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:15.980
because of global warming.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.780
Some of the darts we don't know.

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.620
What do you do?

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:19.540
Like, what do you do?

01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.300
Well, you get out of the way, right?

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.980
You don't want to be on the dartboard.

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.740
And that, it just simplifies the whole formula.

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:31.180
To me, it's kind of a transformational potential

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.660
to go in a bar.

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.220
Maybe I should print these things.

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.220
100%.

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.740
And I should go drink it with you more often.

01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:39.340
They should be coasters in bars.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.900
Because that was fascinating about smog.

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.620
And I mean, it's just, it's nice to be reminded

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.220
about how complicated and fascinating

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.420
the weather system is.

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:50.500
Let me try to answer the questions slightly quicker

01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:53.620
before your friends have drunk too much.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.460
But-

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:55.780
Never enough.

01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.620
Or not enough.

01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:02.620
So if you look at the amount of the number of hurricanes,

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.300
as Andy rightly pointed out,

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.460
it doesn't look like it's changing.

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:11.980
So we see more because we have now much better

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.060
detection systems with satellites.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:17.780
But if you look since 1980,

01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:19.740
when we have good satellite coverage,

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:22.420
for instance, last year was the year

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.980
that had the lowest number of hurricanes in the world.

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.820
And you're sort of like, that's odd

01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.300
because it's probably the year

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.500
where I heard the most about hurricanes.

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.540
And what that tells you is that just because you hear

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:36.660
a lot about hurricanes doesn't actually mean

01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.860
that there is a lot of hurricanes.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.420
You can't just go that way.

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:44.100
If you remember in the 1990s and 2000s,

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:47.260
there was an enormous amount of talk about how violence,

01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:49.620
how crime was getting worse in the US,

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:51.580
while all the objective indicators showed

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:52.900
that it was going down.

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.820
But there's sufficient amount of violence

01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:00.580
that you can fill every radio and TV show with a new crime.

01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.180
And so if you get more and more TV shows

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.660
that talk about crime,

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.340
actually most people end up thinking that there's more crime

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:09.900
while the real number is going down.

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:12.060
So the reality here is,

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:16.820
yes, climate change will probably affect hurricanes

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.420
in the sense that they'll be the same number

01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.740
or slightly fewer as Andy was mentioning,

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:24.620
but they will likely be somewhat stronger.

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.940
This seems to be the best outcome.

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:30.380
We're not sure, but this seems to be the outcome.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.100
And it's important to remember,

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.740
stronger is worse than fewer is better.

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:40.740
So overall, climate will make the world a little bit worse.

01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:43.460
So that's the sort of bottom line,

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.980
but, and that's the real issue here,

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:46.940
all the other things,

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:49.180
the fact that people are much more vulnerable

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.700
is just vastly outweigh this,

01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:55.860
which is why if you look at the impact of hurricanes

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.820
and impact of pretty much everything,

01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:00.100
it is typically going down.

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.380
If you look, for instance, in percent of GDP,

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:03.900
you have to look at percent of GDP,

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.700
because if you have twice as many houses,

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.620
obviously the same kind of impact

01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.300
will have twice the impact

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.020
or if they're worth twice as much.

01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:13.580
If you do that in percent of GDP,

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:16.220
and even the UN says that's how you should measure it,

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.300
it's going down.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:18.180
Why is that?

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.620
It's because we're becoming more resilient.

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:23.460
Just simply, if you look at what happens

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:24.660
when hurricanes come in,

01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.100
we have much better prediction in the long run.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:30.420
That means you now know two or three days out

01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.940
that there's a big hurricane that's likely to come here.

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.820
What does that mean?

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.660
All the things that can be moved,

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.940
typically all buses, all trucks,

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.180
everything that's not bolted down will leave this area,

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.660
and so you'll get less damage from that.

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.220
You will have more people knowing,

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.700
oh, this is gonna be a big one.

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.780
They moved to their relatives somewhere else.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.100
So you'll have fewer people being vulnerable.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:52.940
There's a lot-

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.940
If people are responsive and aware.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.300
Yeah, there's a lot of way you can do this.

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:57.540
So the outcome,

01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.660
and this is important for the whole conversation,

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:03.580
the outcome is that we're actually becoming less vulnerable

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:07.820
and that damages are becoming smaller, not bigger.

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:10.820
But had there not been global warming,

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:13.500
it would probably have gone down even faster.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.860
So we would have become even better off quicker

01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:18.380
had there been no global warming.

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:20.540
But this is a crucial difference,

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.060
and this is what I find really hard to communicate.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.740
Climate change is not this,

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:27.900
oh my God, everything is going off the charts

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.900
and we're all gonna be doomed kind of thing.

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.020
Climate change is a thing

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:36.420
that means we're gonna get better slightly slower.

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:39.660
And that's a very, very different kind of attitude.

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.180
It's one of the many problems

01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.780
rather than this is the end of all of us.

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:44.620
And by the way,

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:47.580
if you look at what's happening in the world,

01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:50.980
the data also show that in rich places and poor places,

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:54.140
we still are moving into zones of hazard faster

01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:55.620
than climate is changing.

01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.700
Beth Telman was at Columbia and she moved to Arizona.

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.340
She and colleagues at this outfit called Cloud to Street

01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:05.300
did an amazing study showing,

01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.740
this is a year or so ago I wrote about,

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.700
showing again, we're moving into zones of hazard,

01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:11.140
which it applies to me,

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:16.340
just what Bjorn was saying that people wouldn't be doing that

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.980
if they thought that was gonna lead to devastation.

01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:22.220
And this is today, we're doing this now.

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:25.820
And it's flood zones, wildfire zones.

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.620
So that means there's these things to do.

01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.140
There's so much plasticity in the human behavior

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.340
and how we build and where we build.

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:37.660
You can make a big, big change in the outcomes.

01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:39.540
I mean, one of the things to remember is,

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:41.620
people move to where hurricanes hit

01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:42.940
because when they're not there,

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.820
it's a really beautiful place to be.

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:45.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:49.620
So in many ways, we make the trade-offs and say,

01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:53.220
look, I'm happy to have an ocean view

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.300
and then maybe a hurricane is gonna hit.

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.820
And of course it becomes a lot easier

01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.980
than when the federal government

01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.940
is actually subsidizing your risk

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:02.620
by saying, we'll ensure you're really cheaply.

01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:05.740
And that's one of the things that we should stop doing.

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.900
We should actually tell people,

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.300
look, if you wanna live where hurricanes hit,

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.140
maybe you should be more careful.

01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.220
Yeah, by the way, what I was saying about past storms,

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.820
the paleotempestology, past fires, it's the same thing.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.820
We've suppressed fire in the United States

01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:23.060
for a hundred years through much of the West,

01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:26.420
through wanting to save the forests,

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.900
the whole smokey, the bear thing, don't stop.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.500
When these were landscapes that evolved to burn.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.260
And what happened in the last hundred years?

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.700
A lot of people love the West.

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.380
We love these environments.

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:39.060
We love to live with the trees.

01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:41.740
The Boulder County area, the explosive development

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:45.660
in zones of implicit hazard leads to big bad outcomes

01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.740
when conditions align and climate change

01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:49.740
is worsening some of those conditions.

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:52.060
And sometimes it's really counterintuitive.

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.980
A wet season builds more grass.

01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.780
A dry season comes along, parches the grass.

01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:59.460
Then comes a human ignition.

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.740
It's almost always human ignitions.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:02.980
And then you have this disaster

01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:05.260
where a thousand homes burn in Boulder County.

01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.820
And it's like, there's so many elements there

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.380
that can be worked on that give me confidence

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:15.460
that we can change these outcomes.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.740
You can, natural disasters are not natural.

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:21.020
Disasters are designed really, some people say.

01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:25.020
Can I take a quick aside and ask about terminology

01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:26.820
of climate change and global warming?

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:29.780
Because we use it interchangeably.

01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:33.300
It isn't a side, but it's one that's worthy of taking.

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:36.020
Do those carry different meanings?

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.660
And has that meaning changed over the years

01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:40.980
between those two terms?

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.140
Are they really equivalent?

01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.500
Well, some people say there was this industry

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:48.420
or propagandistic shift from,

01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.020
let's see, what was it?

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:51.860
Which came first?

01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.660
Oh no, they're going to climate change now.

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:56.860
Like it's a new thing, which is, it's ridiculous.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:01.020
The intergovernmental panel on climate change in 1988

01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.940
wasn't the intergovernmental panel on global warming.

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:05.980
It was on climate change.

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.980
So these terms have been there.

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:09.140
They've been sort of evolving.

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.780
When I wrote this cover story, it was the greenhouse effect.

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.500
So green, and that's fallen on a favor.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.340
Greenhouse effect is not often talked about.

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:18.180
Well, it's really, that's the physical effect

01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:19.420
that's holding in the heat.

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.900
But see, there's terms that mean stuff,

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.580
and there's terms that are actually used in public discourse

01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:28.500
to designate what your,

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.420
a whole umbrella of opinions you have.

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:34.380
And I guess as somebody, me,

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:38.460
who doesn't pay attention to this carefully,

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:40.580
you have to use terms carefully.

01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.420
Sure.

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.020
Because people will, you know,

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:47.740
a noob that rolls into a topic will often use terms

01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:50.300
to mean exactly what they mean, like literally.

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.420
But they actually have political implications

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.260
and all that kind of stuff.

01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:56.020
So I guess I'm asking, is there like,

01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:59.300
is there, are you signaling something

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:02.180
by using global warming versus climate change?

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:04.860
Or people have calmed down in terms of the use of these?

01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:08.580
No, no, but the Guardian newspapers made it worse.

01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.100
Now they have their style book, you know,

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:13.540
every newspaper has a, they prescribe,

01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:14.540
they don't want their reporters

01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.380
to use any of those terms anymore.

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:18.820
They call it climate crisis, climate emergency.

01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:19.660
Oh no.

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:20.660
Oh yeah. Global heating.

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.260
It's literally in their rule book.

01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:24.140
Global heating, that sounds more intense.

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.740
Global heating, and that was the point.

01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:28.580
Well, I wrote about the global heating thing

01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:30.300
more than a decade ago, that's been around.

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:33.260
But, you know, so they're doing the,

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:35.780
what was the movie where the comedy,

01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.220
the rock and roll comedy, where he sets his,

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.300
To 11, yeah, yeah.

01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:40.660
His amplifier goes to 11.

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:43.540
You know, the idea that you turn up the rhetorical volume

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.220
and that's gonna change people is ridiculous.

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.340
So for me, I mean, I use global warming

01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.900
and climate change interchangeably,

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.500
and I think it's fair.

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.140
There's, you know, there's some technical ways

01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:57.100
that you can differentiate them.

01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.540
But the reality is global warming

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:02.100
is probably a better way to describe a lot of it

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:04.780
because this is really what is the main driver

01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:06.300
of what we worry about.

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:08.300
Climate change seems a little diffuse,

01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:10.100
but, you know, it's convenient too

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.820
when you talk about climate all the time

01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.180
that you can call both of them.

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:14.820
But I think the climate crisis

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.420
and the climate catastrophe is really sort of,

01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.140
this is the amping up of a catastrophe.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.300
And again, as we've talked about before,

01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:26.420
if it really were true, we should tell people.

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:27.260
But if it's not true,

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.580
and I think there's a lot of reasons

01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:31.220
why this is not, you know, a climate catastrophe,

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.580
this is a problem,

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.700
we're actually doing everyone a disservice

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.260
because we end up making people so worried

01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.140
that they say, we gotta fix this in 12 years

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.660
or whatever the number is.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:43.140
And also that it makes it almost impossible

01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.460
to have a conversation of, you know,

01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.500
well, you know, maybe we should be focusing

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.620
on vulnerability first.

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.260
And a lot of people,

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.900
and I think a lot of well-meaning and well-intentioned people

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:57.260
feel that it's almost sacrilegious to do,

01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:00.300
you know, to say it's about vulnerability

01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:03.980
because you're taking away the guilt of climate change,

01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:07.420
you're taking away our focus on dealing with climate change.

01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.300
Whereas I think we would say,

01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.940
it's about stuff that actually works

01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.660
and, you know, doing that first.

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.220
Well, and by making it about carbon dioxide,

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:20.660
you're implicitly making it about fossil fuels,

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:23.540
which implicitly gives you another great narrative,

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:24.580
good guy, bad guy.

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:27.260
It's these big companies.

01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:30.020
Where's the source of alarmism?

01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:32.900
So is it the IPCC,

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:35.380
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.740
Like what, there's a chain here.

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:39.860
Is there somebody to blame along the chain

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:41.860
or is this some kind of weird complex

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.620
as to where everybody encourages each other?

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:45.900
Can you point to one place?

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:46.940
Is it the media?

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.020
Is it the scientists?

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:50.020
I think the UN Climate Panel is fundamentally

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:54.260
a really good climate research group.

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:56.220
You can have some quibbles with the way

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:57.860
that they sort of summarize it

01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:00.740
in politically coordinated documents and stuff.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.620
But, you know, fundamentally,

01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:04.780
I think they do a good job of putting together

01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:05.860
all the research.

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:08.220
This also means it's incredibly boring to read,

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.780
which is why virtually nobody does it.

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.660
I'm sure you have,

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.500
but I'm pretty sure a lot of climate journalists

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.780
have never sort of looked past the,

01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:19.380
at least the summary for policymakers.

01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:20.940
So the UN Climate Panel,

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.020
they do like a, they do predictions as well?

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:26.420
No, well, they pull together all the stuff

01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.100
that people have published in the period literature

01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:32.620
and then try to summarize it and basically tell you,

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.180
so what's up and down with climate change.

01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.860
They do that in four large volumes

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.940
every four to five to six, seven years or something.

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:44.380
And yes, it's, you know,

01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.380
I think it's the gold-plated version of what we know.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.100
There tends to be a lot of,

01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:52.700
well, this is what they say.

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:55.060
Actually, they say so many different places

01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.580
with so many different people

01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:59.380
that it's not quite clear exactly what they're saying often.

01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.420
You know, you can sort of find contradictions

01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:05.260
between one volume with one set of authors and another,

01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:09.780
but yeah, look, I think this is fundamentally the right way

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.660
that we know about climate,

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:17.020
but then it gets translated into how do you know about this?

01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.700
When most people don't read these 4,000 pages,

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:23.060
you read a new story in a newspaper

01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:27.580
and that new story will be very heavily slanted towards,

01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:28.980
you know, if you say,

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.860
so sea levels could rise somewhere between one and three foot.

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.140
What do you hear?

01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:35.860
Yeah, you obviously hear the three foot.

01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:38.380
Three foot is just, you know, more fun, more scary,

01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:40.860
more interesting than one foot.

01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:43.100
And it's that way with all of these, you know,

01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.980
so what was the prediction for temperature rises?

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:50.820
It's somewhere from not very scary to pretty damn scary.

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:53.860
And again, you hear the pretty damn scary all the time.

01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.380
And then there's obviously always researchers

01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.260
who are saying, well, but actually could be

01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:00.900
a little more scary than that.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.900
And then there are likewise researchers who say,

01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:05.820
well, you know, it's probably not gonna be as scary as that.

01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:09.500
And most of the journalists will, you know, interview.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:13.180
Do you really put the blame fundamentally on the journalist?

01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:15.740
I put it on the media setup.

01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:18.380
Look, media is simply trying to get clicks

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.660
or sell newspapers.

01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:23.820
And if you were just gonna say, this is not a big issue,

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.340
it just doesn't sell anything,

01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:28.180
but I think you're probably much better able to address this.

01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:32.260
Well, no, I, folks can Google for my name Revkin

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:37.260
and the words front page thought in the newsroom

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:38.780
every afternoon.

01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:41.660
Now we have a 24 seven news cycle, so it's different,

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:44.420
but back in the day, the New York Times,

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:46.860
when it was a flourishing print institution,

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:49.260
every afternoon there was a front page meeting

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.300
and the big poobah editors would go in there

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:54.620
and the desk editors come in with their pitches for the day.

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:57.220
And my friend, Corey Dean, who was the science editor

01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:59.460
for a chunk of my time, you know,

01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.220
I remember having a conversation with her

01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:04.300
about some new study of, I think it was Greenland,

01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.340
the ice sheet, and I laid it out for her and she said,

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:09.300
where's the front page thought in that?

01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:14.980
So we're all set up to look for the that.

01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:15.820
The scary bit, no.

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:19.260
And the news environment has gotten so much worse

01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:23.260
than 10 or 20 years ago, at least you had filters

01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.380
and limited number of outlets.

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.540
And there was some sense you could track with good or bad.

01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:31.500
There's lots of problems with that system too,

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:33.980
but now you have an information buffet.

01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:38.340
So if you want to be alarmed or you want to stay

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:40.820
in the tribe of those who think this is utter bull,

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.380
you can find your flow.

01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.620
And that has led, but getting back

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:50.580
to this specific question, the 2018 IPCC report,

01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.620
which was a special report commissioned

01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.780
to learn about the difference between 1.5 degrees

01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.500
of warming and two, which sounds so weird

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.780
and technocratic and complicated.

02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.100
That's the one that generated the whole meme

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:04.700
about eight years left.

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.540
12 years.

02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:06.380
Till doomsday.

02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.220
It was 2013.

02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:08.140
Can you explain the meme?

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.500
This was the idea that there's a point we're gonna,

02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:15.100
if we don't cut emissions in half by whatever it was,

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.100
2050, we're doomed.

02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.340
That emerged from that specific report.

02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:21.140
And it wasn't something that was in the report.

02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:22.980
It was in the spin around the report.

02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:25.420
And that's what captivated Greta appropriately

02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:27.660
as a young person going, you know,

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.380
and with her unique vantage point and stuff.

02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:33.100
And that report, I still need to dig in

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.940
and write something deeper about what happened

02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:39.100
with that particular dynamics, created this recent burst

02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:44.100
of we're doomed rhetoric that I think you're focusing on.

02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:48.020
And it's all in the external interpretations,

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:50.780
which journalism laps up

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.180
because we're looking for the front page thought.

02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:54.300
But it's not just the journalists.

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.060
It's the whole system, NGOs, environmental groups.

02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:00.860
If you're, and developing country,

02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:03.580
well-meaning leaders in developing countries,

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.660
because of the structure of this treaty

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.340
that goes back to 1992,

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.540
that's the Paris Agreement is part of,

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:15.740
they are now really looking for a way to portray this

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:17.940
as a CO2 problem.

02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:19.740
Not a vulnerability.

02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.180
Well, there's a vulnerability aspect,

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.540
but like in Pakistan, their climate minister,

02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.020
which they didn't even have a climate minister

02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:30.100
five years ago, is blaming everything that happened

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.860
in Pakistan on carbon dioxide,

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:33.380
warming the climate, creating this,

02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:36.420
when a lot of what was going on was also on the ground.

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:38.940
And you can blame colonialism, Pakistan's history,

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:40.380
all kinds of things.

02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:43.580
But under the treaty, you want it to be about CO2

02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:46.220
because that puts the onus on rich countries.

02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:47.740
You're not paying us.

02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:48.900
Where's our money?

02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:50.380
And they're right.

02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:52.740
In the context of what everyone agreed to,

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:55.340
there was supposed to be a hundred billion dollars a year

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.620
from rich countries to poor countries starting in 2020.

02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.460
It didn't happen.

02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.900
It's like basically some money is flowing,

02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.460
but it's not really made up money.

02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:06.140
Yeah, and so that whole dynamic,

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.140
they latch onto the climate science and they,

02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.940
so they're there and they're very handy, quotable people.

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:14.100
And you have a justice angle.

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.260
You have bad guys and good guys,

02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:18.020
which fits all of these narrative threads

02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:21.100
that come together into this information storm

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.060
we're still living with.

02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:25.100
And then of course, it's not Pakistan's fault either, right?

02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.540
I mean, it also actually, almost all leaders now say

02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:31.020
it's because of climate, because then it's not,

02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.780
we didn't do anything wrong.

02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:36.420
In Germany, for instance, when we had that flood last year,

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:40.580
it's not impossible that climate had a part in that,

02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:42.980
but it's very, very clear that the main reason why

02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.300
so many people died in Germany and Belgium

02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:48.220
was because the alarm systems didn't work.

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:52.140
And this was plainly the local leaders in Germany.

02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:54.620
Now, if I'm stuck here and basically have caused

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:57.900
the death of 200 people, would I rather say,

02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:00.540
yeah, that's on me, or would I say, climate?

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:01.380
It happens all the time.

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.540
It's just such an easy scapegoat.

02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.220
I don't want to place it all on the journalists, I think,

02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:09.420
because there's a lot of, if I were to think about,

02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.980
what did you call it, front page thought,

02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:15.020
there's a lot of really narratives

02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:22.140
that result in destruction of the human species.

02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:24.900
So nuclear war, pandemics, all that kind of stuff.

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:27.100
It seems that climate is a sticky one.

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:29.660
So the fact that it's sticky means there's other

02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:31.980
interests at play, like you guys are talking about

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.780
in terms of politics, all that kind of stuff.

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:35.500
So it's not just the journalists.

02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:37.380
I feel like journalists will try anything

02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:40.540
for the front page, but it won't stick

02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:43.380
unless there's bigger interests at play

02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:45.740
for which these narratives are useful.

02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.500
So journalists will just throw stuff out there

02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:49.460
and see if it gets clicks.

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:53.940
And it's like a first spark, maybe.

02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.860
It's maybe a tiny catalyst of the initial steps,

02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:00.420
but it has to be picked up by the politicians,

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:03.260
by interest groups, and all that kind of stuff.

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:08.180
Let me ask you, Bjorn, about the first part of the subtitle.

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:12.340
How climate change panic costs us trillions.

02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:14.860
How does climate change panic cost us trillions?

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:17.340
So we're basically deciding to make policies

02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:21.460
that'll have fairly little impact, even in 50 or 100 years,

02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:24.060
that literally cost trillions of dollars.

02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:26.540
So I'll give you two examples.

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:31.340
So the European Union is trying to go to net zero.

02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:35.140
So our attempt to go halfway there by 2030

02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:37.740
will cost about a trillion dollars a year.

02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:41.260
And yet the net impact will be almost unmeasurable

02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:42.740
by the end of the century.

02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:43.820
Why is that?

02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:46.180
That's because the EU and the rich countries

02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:48.260
is a fairly small part of the emissions

02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:50.140
that are gonna come out in the 21st century.

02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:51.980
Now, we used to be a big part of it.

02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.740
That's mainly because nobody else,

02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:56.460
it was just the US and Europe and a few others

02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:59.220
that put out CO2 in the 20th century.

02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:02.540
So we used to be big, but in the 21st century

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:04.500
we'll be a small bit player.

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:07.020
And so we're basically spending a lot of money,

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.740
and remember a trillion dollars is a lot of money

02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:11.700
that could have been spent on a lot of things

02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.580
that could have made humanity better,

02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:18.140
on something that will only make us tiny bit better.

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:20.420
Now, it will do some good,

02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:22.420
but the reasonable estimates is

02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:23.940
if you do a cost benefit analysis,

02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.780
and again, technically it's really, really complicated,

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.900
but the basic idea is very, very simple.

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:33.740
You just simply say, what are all the costs on one side

02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:35.260
and what are all the benefits?

02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:37.580
So the costs are mainly that we have to live

02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:39.060
with more expensive energy,

02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:41.580
you have to forego some opportunities,

02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.580
you have to have more complicated services,

02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:45.420
that kind of thing.

02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.460
The benefit is that you cut carbon emissions

02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.500
and that eventually means

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.340
that you'll have less climate damage,

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.180
you'll have lower temperature rises and so on.

02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:55.660
If you try to weigh up all of those,

02:05:55.660 --> 02:06:00.660
it's reasonable to assume that the EU policies will deliver

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:04.220
for every dollar you spend, it'll deliver less than a dollar,

02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:06.820
probably about 30 cents back on the dollar,

02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:08.860
which is a really bad way to spend dollars

02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:11.460
because there's lots of other things out in the world

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.380
where you could do multiple,

02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:15.420
so for instance, if you think about tuberculosis

02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:19.420
or education of small kids or nutrition for small kids

02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:20.580
and those kinds of things,

02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:24.180
every dollar you spend will do like 30 to $100 worth of good.

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.020
So they're much, much better places

02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:27.460
where you could spend this money.

02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:32.140
Likewise, the US is thinking of going net zero by 2050,

02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.700
it's not actually gonna happen,

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:36.180
but it's sort of a thing that everybody talks about,

02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.140
Biden is talking a lot about it.

02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:40.300
If you look at the models that indicate

02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:42.900
how much will that cost,

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:45.340
it's not implausible that this will cost somewhere

02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:49.940
between two and $4 trillion per year by mid-century.

02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:54.460
And remember, if the US went carbon neutral today,

02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:56.540
by the end of the century,

02:06:56.540 --> 02:07:00.420
that would reduce temperatures by about 0.3 degree Fahrenheit.

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:02.980
So you would just be able to measure it,

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:04.580
it probably wouldn't in real life,

02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:07.060
but you'd just be able to measure it.

02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:08.660
Again, this is not saying

02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.340
that there's not some good coming out of it,

02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:12.900
but you're basically spending an enormous amount of money

02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.740
on fairly small benefits.

02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:16.580
So that's my main point.

02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:18.860
Yeah, this reminds me of what we were saying earlier

02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:22.300
about the things that models don't integrate

02:07:22.300 --> 02:07:24.220
and the things that cost benefit leave out

02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.620
because you really can't go there.

02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:28.140
One of the issues facing the world right now

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:30.780
is the reality that we're reminded of,

02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:34.820
that energy availability is a geopolitical destabilizer.

02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:39.220
If you have uneven access to energy

02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:41.300
and you have Vladimir Putin coming into office

02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:45.020
or something else happening that disrupts that system,

02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:46.940
you're vastly increasing poverty.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:50.900
This is playing out across the world fertilizer prices,

02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:54.060
fertilizer comes from gas, natural gas.

02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:59.940
If you can envision a world later in the century

02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:01.700
where we're no longer beholden on this material

02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:04.660
in the ground, at least fossil fuels,

02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:08.700
cobalt and lithium for batteries, that's pretty cool

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:11.700
because you're taking away geopolitical instability.

02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.020
But that's not factored in, right?

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.020
That's like way outside of what you'd factor in.

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.860
But it does feel like to me,

02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:20.660
if I was gonna make the case for,

02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:23.340
you can choose your trillions,

02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:28.340
whatever that investing big isn't for these marginal things,

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.900
it's for looking at the big picture,

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:32.940
a world of abundant energy

02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:35.580
that doesn't come from a black rock

02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:38.300
or a gooey liquid that when you burn it creates.

02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:40.460
But isn't that what the proposals are,

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:44.620
is investing in different kinds of energy, renewable energy?

02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:45.460
So what's-

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:47.380
But I don't think most people aren't making that case.

02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:51.100
What's in the trillion in the T costs,

02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.340
what's in corporate, what are the big costs there?

02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.780
So the big cost is that you have

02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:58.260
slightly lower productivity gains.

02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.020
So basically again,

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:00.980
and this is sort of the opposite

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:03.460
of what we just talked about by climate change.

02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.380
We're gonna get richer and richer in the world.

02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:07.340
This is all models, also the UN,

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:08.580
this is really the only way

02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.260
that you can get big climate change

02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:11.940
is because everybody gets a lot richer,

02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.180
so also the developing world gets a lot richer.

02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:16.340
So we're likely to get richer.

02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:19.540
But one of the things that drive our wealth production

02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:22.180
is the fact that we have ample and cheap

02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:23.860
and available energy.

02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:25.820
If you make that slightly harder,

02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:28.300
which is what you do with climate legislation,

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.940
because you're basically telling people

02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.860
you have to use a source of energy

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:33.340
that you'd rather not have used.

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:35.980
Had, because if people wanted to do it,

02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.420
we'd already have solved the problem.

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.420
So you're basically telling me

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.180
you gotta use this wind turbine

02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:42.780
instead of this natural gas plant

02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:44.700
or that kind of thing.

02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:47.820
It makes, it's not that you suddenly become poor or anything,

02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.380
it simply makes production slightly harder.

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:53.020
What do you do when the wind is not blowing kind of thing?

02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:54.500
And of course we have lots of ways

02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.140
to somewhat mitigate that.

02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.820
But it's a little more costly, a little more complicated,

02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:00.100
a little less convenient.

02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:02.540
And that means you grow a little less.

02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:05.740
That's the main problem with these policies,

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:08.420
that it simply makes you somewhat less well-off.

02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.660
So energy becomes more inefficient.

02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:11.500
Yes.

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:14.180
So let me challenge you here.

02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.700
Try to steal man some critics.

02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:19.620
So you have critics.

02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:25.180
I would love you to take it seriously

02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:27.220
and sort of consider this criticism

02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.860
and try to steal man their case.

02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:34.860
There's a bunch, I could mention this list of criticisms

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:39.100
from Bob Ward in London School of Economics.

02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:40.620
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:42.260
But just on this point,

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:45.100
in terms of one of the big costs being an energy,

02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:50.260
he criticizes your recent book in saying,

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:53.780
you consider the 143 billion in annual support

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:54.900
for renewable energy,

02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:59.580
but ignore the 300 billion in fossil fuel subsidies.

02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:03.780
So a lot of the criticism has to do with,

02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:06.180
well, you're cherry picking the models,

02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:09.540
which the models are always cherry picking anyway.

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:12.700
But you wanna take those seriously.

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:16.620
So he claims that you ignore,

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:21.620
you're not fully modeling the costs,

02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:22.900
the trade-off here.

02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:26.060
How expensive is the renewable energy

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:28.140
and how expensive is the fossil fuel?

02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.580
Can you steal man his case?

02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:30.420
Sure.

02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:31.740
So two things.

02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:35.420
The first, the quote, it's absolutely true

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:39.340
that the world spends a large chunk of money

02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:41.460
on fossil fuels and that's just stupid

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.940
and we should stop doing it.

02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:45.740
We should also recognize that this is not rich countries.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:46.940
This is not the countries

02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:48.580
where we're talking about climate change.

02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.540
This is poor countries.

02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:51.380
This is Saudi Arabia.

02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:54.140
No, that's actually not a terribly poor country.

02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.260
It's China, it's Indonesia, it's Russia.

02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:01.060
It's places where you're basically paying off

02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:03.780
your population, just like your subsidized bread,

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:05.300
you make sure that they don't rebel

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:08.180
by making cheap fuels available.

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:10.660
That's dumb, but it's not like they,

02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.820
they don't know what they're doing.

02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:13.300
They're mostly doing this for things

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:15.060
that have nothing to do with climate.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:17.340
So I totally agree we should get rid of it.

02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:18.300
It's hard to do.

02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:22.060
Indonesia's actually somewhat managed to get rid of it

02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:23.820
because remember, if you spend a lot of money

02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:25.180
on fossil fuel subsidies,

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.020
you're basically subsidizing the rich

02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:29.220
because poor people don't have a car.

02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:32.820
It's the rich people who can now buy very cheap gasoline.

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:35.900
That's unjust as well.

02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:38.140
So it's dumb in so many different ways.

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:40.500
I would never argue that you shouldn't,

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:43.340
plenty of time said we should stop that,

02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:46.260
but we should also recognize these are mostly regimes

02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:48.220
that are not going to be taken over

02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:51.140
either by my argument or Bob Ward's or anyone else's.

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:53.540
They're doing this for totally different reasons.

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:58.540
Now, on the model side, there is virtually no model

02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:00.500
that don't show, economic model,

02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.220
that don't show this has a cost.

02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:05.180
And that's the fundamental point is that the,

02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:08.660
you know, this is sort of a basic point from economics.

02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:11.220
The system is already working most effectively

02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.580
because if it wasn't, you know,

02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:15.060
you could actually make money changing over.

02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:17.820
So if you want to have a change outside

02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:19.540
of what the system is already doing,

02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:21.580
it's because you're saying you have to do something

02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:23.340
that you'd rather not want to do,

02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:25.740
namely use an energy source that is less convenient

02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:28.420
or less cost effective and so on.

02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:30.540
And that will incur a cost.

02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:33.220
Now there's huge discussion about just exactly

02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:34.500
how much cost is that.

02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:36.220
So there's definitely a cost.

02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:38.780
Is the cost going to be one or five trillion?

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:40.740
That's absolutely a discussion about

02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:42.060
where do you take your models from?

02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:45.540
I try to do, and again, this is not possible everywhere.

02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.900
I try to actually take the average

02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:49.820
of all of the economic models.

02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:52.980
So there's a group called the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,

02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:56.220
which tries to pull together all these different groups

02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:57.140
that do the modeling.

02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:00.300
So some models, a lot of this cost actually comes down

02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:03.500
to the fact that we don't quite know

02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:06.740
how much more fossil fuels you're gonna need in the future.

02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:09.020
And so if you're not gonna, if your projections are,

02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:10.540
you're not gonna use that much,

02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:12.820
the cost of reducing it is gonna be very small.

02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:16.540
If you think you're gonna use a ton of extra fossil fuels

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:19.220
and you have to reduce that, the cost is gonna be bigger.

02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:20.060
So I think-

02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:21.500
That's just one of the variables.

02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.700
That's, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:24.700
And there's many, many, many more.

02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:26.780
I think the point here is to say

02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.540
that if you take the average

02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.620
of all the best models that's sort of aggregated,

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:34.180
for instance, at the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,

02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:37.140
you're pretty secure ground.

02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:41.500
And so again, I would argue that Bob Ward,

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.900
yes, I've had a lot of run-ins with Bob Ward

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:49.860
and he has a very different set of views on things,

02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:51.900
but I just don't think he's right

02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:53.380
in saying that I'm cherry picking.

02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:56.460
Well, yes, and I mean, he also has similar criticism

02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:59.900
about the estimate of the EU cost of climate action

02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:04.300
based on the NOP 2013 model.

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:06.420
But ultimately, these criticisms have to do

02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:09.620
is like, what are the sources for the different models?

02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.220
And just very briefly, I mean,

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:12.980
I'm laying it out very transparently

02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:16.380
where I get these estimates from in the book.

02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:18.180
I've really tried to document this.

02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:20.500
And yes, I mean, look, there's nobody

02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.980
who sort of has all the information

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.980
and gets everything right in all of these areas.

02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:29.740
I think most of Bob Ward's argument

02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:34.260
is not a good faith effort

02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.580
to sort of improve on these estimates.

02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.900
He's right in saying some of these estimates,

02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:42.860
we only have a few estimates.

02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:45.660
And yeah, I'd like to have more of them.

02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:47.660
One thing I should mention is

02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:50.060
that there is very little interest in general

02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:51.620
and there's very little funding

02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:55.380
in finding out how much do our climate policies cost?

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:58.180
Because that's just inconvenient to everyone

02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.540
in the whole game.

02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.420
Who wants to know that, for instance,

02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:06.340
would you want to fund something that says

02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:08.020
that the Inflation Reduction Act

02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:09.620
is not gonna be very effective?

02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:11.700
Of course you don't want to do that, right?

02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:15.500
So again, it's a little bit the flock of birds

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.540
will look at something else.

02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:20.780
And what I think is that given that we're paying for it

02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:22.980
at the end, this is public money.

02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:24.740
We're deciding we're gonna spend money here

02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:25.700
rather than there.

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:28.780
Let's at least look at what are the best estimates out there.

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.140
I would love to have more estimates.

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.420
More estimates is always better.

02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:35.780
And just a quick comment on the good faith part.

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:38.060
Me as a consumer looking for truth,

02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:40.420
it's hard to find who's good faith and not.

02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:41.940
So it's not only are you looking

02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:45.460
for sort of accurate information,

02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:48.260
you're also trying to infer

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:51.060
about the communicator of that information.

02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:52.180
It's very difficult.

02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:55.820
And you put me on the podcast,

02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:58.660
of course I'm gonna say I'm a trustworthy guy.

02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:02.980
Well, I mean, and we believe we're trustworthy too,

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:07.980
but I've been reading for various reasons,

02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:10.260
but mostly because I've been traveling to Ukraine

02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.260
and thinking just about the people suffering through war.

02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:17.260
I've been reading a lot about World War II

02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:19.220
and Stalin and Hitler.

02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.820
And from the perspective of Hitler,

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:28.500
he really believed he's doing good for the world.

02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:33.340
And he was communicating from his perspective in good faith.

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:37.380
He started to believe I think early on his own propaganda.

02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:40.180
So even your understanding

02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.820
and perception of the world completely shifted.

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:44.820
So it's very, very, very difficult

02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:46.540
to understand who to trust.

02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:50.860
And just because it's a consensus

02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:53.980
in a particular community doesn't necessarily mean

02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:54.820
it's a source of trust.

02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:58.020
So it's a, I mean, basically,

02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.260
I don't know how to operate in this world,

02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:02.660
except to have a humility

02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:05.780
and constantly question your assumptions.

02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:08.940
But not so much that you're completely out in the ocean,

02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:10.860
not knowing what is true and not.

02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:13.180
So it's this weird, weird world,

02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:16.580
because I ultimately, bigger than climate,

02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:22.460
my hope is to have institutions that can be trusted.

02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:25.180
And that's been very much under attack

02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:28.420
as part of the climate debate,

02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:31.220
as part of the COVID debate,

02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:33.220
as part of all of these discussions.

02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:37.780
And science, to me, is one of the sources of truth.

02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.820
And the fact that that's under question now

02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:44.100
is something that hurts me on many levels, deeply.

02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:46.620
You said something earlier that I took a note down here

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:48.620
and I can't find it, about cooperation.

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.220
It was like collaborative cooperation

02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.340
or something like that?

02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:52.460
Sure.

02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:56.220
To me, there was a point, like in 2013,

02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:57.980
after just dealing with all,

02:18:57.980 --> 02:18:59.860
everything you've been grappling with,

02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:05.380
if you know you don't know how this is gonna work out,

02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:06.380
what do you work on?

02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:09.780
And one morning, I made a list of words

02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:13.500
that kind of summarized, basically, system properties

02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:16.580
that give you confidence in a system, trust,

02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:20.140
and there are, transparency is one,

02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:21.700
just as you were saying earlier.

02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:27.980
Connectivity is another, so that everyone's connected.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:31.020
So on the subsidy issue, for example,

02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:35.100
there are young entrepreneurs in Nairobi

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.820
who are selling, ingeniously,

02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:41.460
using Nairobi's digital currency, propane,

02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:44.700
the fuel that's in our backyard barbecue grills,

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:48.460
which comes out of a gas wells, but it's a separate fuel,

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.420
in little increments that poor people can use

02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:51.540
instead of charcoal.

02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:56.660
And LPG subsidies are helping them

02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:01.100
get people off of charcoal, which is a horrific trade

02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:05.020
from the source through the warlords in Somalia

02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:07.420
and elsewhere who are getting the money

02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:08.900
to the pollution in houses.

02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:14.140
So having, being sure when we're having these big debates

02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:17.500
about who the World Bank is gonna give loans to

02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:20.860
and drawing a simple line, no more fossil fuel subsidies,

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:24.460
hurts a really good, valuable,

02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:30.300
small scale but scalable way to have people not die

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.100
from cooking smoke in their houses and take down forests.

02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:35.660
So, but that only is considered

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.020
if they're in the conversation.

02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:40.060
So connectivity, full connectivity, digital access.

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:42.900
So those entrepreneurs are in the mix of people.

02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:44.180
When you're thinking about subsidies,

02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.660
you're not just thinking about Big Bad Exxon,

02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.820
you're thinking about this little company

02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:51.260
in Nairobi, Pago LPG, I think is the name,

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:52.500
and India, the same thing.

02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:55.340
So you can list those properties of systems.

02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:59.140
And the IPCC wasn't originally transparent

02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:03.820
when I started writing about it in 1988, 1990.

02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.340
And now it's way more transparent.

02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:06.780
They have more public review.

02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:09.500
So it's even better than it was.

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.300
It's like a really good example of a science process

02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.980
of assessing the science,

02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:16.780
providing periodic output to the world

02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.100
and iteratively improving the model going forward

02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:23.580
because of critique, because of scrutiny

02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:26.580
and finding better ways for that to interface with people

02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:28.820
so they have information they can use from that big thing.

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:31.140
And the media are not doing a good job

02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:35.340
because of this front page thoughtism.

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:40.420
But we can all, I work partially in academia, in Columbia,

02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:43.540
on an initiative partially in communication innovation.

02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:45.940
How can we have an open landscape

02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:47.540
of access to information that matters?

02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:51.140
What can you do to foster better conversations

02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:52.340
so that words like collapse

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.620
aren't just thrown around like emblems?

02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:58.340
And so system properties give you confidence, I think.

02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:01.100
Then you don't have to be flailing around

02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:06.100
for Bjorn or Tom Fridman or Catherine Hayhoe.

02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:11.580
You can always right now find your character to follow.

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:13.580
But I think what would be better

02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:15.380
is if you actually develop some skills

02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:20.140
to just have a basic ability to know how to cut to the chase.

02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:21.620
Can I just follow up on that?

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:23.660
Because one of the things that I try to do,

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:26.860
and so my day job is actually something else I work with,

02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:29.700
I think called the Copenhagen Consensus,

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:32.500
where we work with more than 300 of the world's top economists

02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:35.260
and we've worked with seven Nobel laureates in economics.

02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:38.220
And the point there is really to talk about

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:40.140
where can you spend a dollar

02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:43.020
and do the most good for the world?

02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:46.260
That's basically the thing that we try to do.

02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:48.460
And as you rightly point out,

02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:50.420
look, there are lots of different estimates

02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:52.380
of what can you do, for instance, on climate?

02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:54.540
What can you do on tuberculosis?

02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:56.900
What can you do for vulnerability

02:22:56.900 --> 02:22:58.940
in all kinds of different ways?

02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:00.900
And if these were all sort of,

02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:04.620
well, you can spend a dollar here and do 2.36,

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:08.580
but you can spend a dollar here and do 2.34 over here,

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:09.500
I would worry a lot.

02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:11.260
But that's not how the world works

02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:13.820
because we're terribly inefficient.

02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:16.540
So there are literally lots and lots

02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:18.620
of amazing things you can do out there.

02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.060
There's a lot of low hanging fruit.

02:23:20.060 --> 02:23:22.980
And there's a lot of not terribly great things

02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:24.020
that you can do.

02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:25.820
And unfortunately, one of the things

02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:28.380
that I try to sort of battle is that,

02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:29.500
we get a lot of things, right?

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.180
That's why the world is a lot better

02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:32.740
than what it used to be.

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:35.340
But the things that are sort of left over

02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:37.780
are often the boring things

02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:39.540
that happen to be incredibly effective

02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:41.340
and the exciting things that are often

02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:43.660
not that terribly effective.

02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:46.580
And so I think one way to look at this

02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:49.180
is basically to have people do cost benefit

02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:50.700
across a wide range of areas.

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:53.180
And we try to get a lot of different economists to do this.

02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:54.780
And they come up with different numbers

02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:56.820
and different models and different results.

02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:58.540
But if you sort of consistently get

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.260
that some things give you in tens

02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:04.140
or maybe even hundreds of dollars back per dollar,

02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:06.020
remember, this is not actually you getting rich.

02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:07.220
It's the world getting rich.

02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:10.980
It's the world gets better worth $100

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:12.580
for every dollar you spend.

02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:14.260
And over here, you can spend a dollar

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:15.940
and do somewhere between 30 cents

02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:17.820
and maybe a couple of dollars.

02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:19.100
You should probably be focused

02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:20.820
on the other opportunity first.

02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:21.940
And that's really the point

02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:23.540
that I try to make with climate.

02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.060
There are some smart things we can do

02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:28.580
and I hope we get to talk about them in climate.

02:24:28.580 --> 02:24:29.900
But there's also a lot of sort of

02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:33.060
the standard approaches to fixing climate

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:36.900
turns out to be very likely below $1 back in dollar

02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.860
and certainly not terribly high.

02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:40.180
Even if you're very optimistic,

02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:41.660
it'll be like two or three.

02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.620
Whereas many of the things

02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:46.420
are just fantastically better investment.

02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:48.380
Like the thing I've been advocating,

02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:51.580
a modest proposal to eat the children,

02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:53.420
of the poor in England.

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.980
Was that the Jonathan Swift modest proposal

02:24:56.980 --> 02:24:58.700
from a few centuries ago?

02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:02.580
So it's not just cost benefit,

02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:05.460
it's also in the context of what is moral

02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:08.500
and all that, the full complexity of it.

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:10.140
You just hit on something really important.

02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:11.500
Having been on this beat for so long,

02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:14.420
and again, on the disaster beat as well, earthquakes,

02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:18.100
I can't tell you how many disaster science experts

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:20.140
keep telling me, like everyone says,

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:22.460
invest for preparedness.

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:24.780
A strict cost benefit analysis will always tell you

02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:27.820
a dollar invested in resilience

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:31.940
before a community gets hit by whatever is worth 10.

02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:33.700
You'll always have to spend 10 after.

02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:36.060
And so it's fine to do the cost benefit stuff,

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.060
but it's just the baseline.

02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:40.180
Then you have to look at the social science,

02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:42.060
which shows, or history,

02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:44.820
which shows you how few times we do it.

02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:46.260
It's like we just don't do it.

02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:49.180
Therefore, you can bang that drum.

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:52.260
Your work is valuable, but it's really constrained,

02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:56.820
because show me in the world where that does happen,

02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:59.540
and then how you turn that success,

02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:02.180
which is basically something not happening,

02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:03.580
into the story.

02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:06.020
Just very briefly, we try to,

02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:07.860
so we do this for a lot of countries.

02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:10.300
So we did it for Haiti, for instance,

02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:13.900
funded by the Canadian Development Ministry,

02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:15.340
because they're basically saying,

02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:17.860
we spent a billion dollars in Haiti since the earthquake,

02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:19.820
and we really can't tell the difference.

02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:21.260
So they want it to find,

02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:22.780
I mean, they actually say that, right?

02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:24.660
And so they said, we want to find out

02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:27.420
what are the really smart things you can do in Haiti.

02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:31.420
And so we, together with lots of people in Haiti

02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:34.340
and all the business community and the political community

02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:36.820
and the religious community and labor community

02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:39.500
and everybody else, what are the smart things to do?

02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:41.540
And then we had economists evaluate it,

02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:42.820
and there were a lot of these things

02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:45.420
that everybody wanted that were not all that smart.

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:47.460
There's actually a lot of smart things.

02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:50.300
And yes, the politicians didn't pick most of them.

02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:53.740
So our sense is, we try to give people,

02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:56.180
you're thinking about these 70 things,

02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:59.020
you should actually just think about these 20 things,

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.420
and then we consider ourselves incredibly lucky

02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:02.980
if they actually do one of them.

02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:04.100
So you wrote the book,

02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:06.220
How to Spend $75 Billion

02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:08.140
to Make the World a Better Place.

02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:11.460
So can we just list some of the things,

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:16.140
if you got $75 billion, how do you spend them?

02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:18.620
All right, so there's some incredibly good

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:20.500
and very, very well-documented things

02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:21.820
that you could spend money on.

02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:24.980
So we have two big infectious diseases

02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:27.100
that almost nobody think about,

02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:30.020
because we only think about COVID.

02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:32.180
But tuberculosis used to be

02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:34.820
the world's biggest infectious disease killer.

02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:37.580
It still kills about one and a half million people

02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:38.460
every year.

02:27:38.460 --> 02:27:41.580
The reason why we don't really worry about it

02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:44.580
is because we fixed it 100 years ago.

02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:46.260
We know how to fix it.

02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:49.260
It's just basically getting medication to people.

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.340
It's also about getting them to take it

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:53.060
when they're sort of been cured,

02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:55.260
because you need to take it for four to six months,

02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:56.780
and that's actually hard to do.

02:27:56.780 --> 02:27:59.540
So you also need to incentivize that in some kind of way.

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:01.820
It turns out it's incredibly cheap

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:05.460
to basically save almost all of the 1.5 million people.

02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:08.660
These are people that die in the prime of their lives.

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:09.660
They're typically parents,

02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:12.060
so it would also have a lot of knock-on effects.

02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:14.940
And basically we find for a couple billion dollars,

02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:16.860
you could save the vast number of these.

02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:19.020
Not all of them, but you could save the vast number of them.

02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:22.260
It would also improve outcomes in all kinds of other ways.

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:24.500
Likewise with malaria, another,

02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:27.580
it has some somewhat better PR.

02:28:27.580 --> 02:28:30.420
It's funny to think of malaria as PR

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:31.540
and tuberculosis not,

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:33.260
they need to improve their PR department.

02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:34.380
Well, but yeah.

02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:36.740
Those mosquitoes are the good PR.

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:39.780
By far the biggest infectious disease

02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:41.980
that got good PR, if you will,

02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:43.700
was HIV, right?

02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:46.460
And I'm not trying to compare it and say,

02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:49.100
oh, it's worse or better to have HIV

02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.260
than tuberculosis or anything,

02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.220
but I'm simply saying we are underfunding

02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:57.660
because it doesn't really get the public attention.

02:28:57.660 --> 02:28:59.500
We just, you know, we don't really care.

02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:00.820
But spending money on that has,

02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.900
in terms of benefit, a much bigger impact.

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:05.900
So every dollar you spend on TB

02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:08.980
will probably do about $43 worth of good.

02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:10.660
So it'll do an amazing amount of good,

02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:12.300
basically because it'll save lives,

02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:14.700
it'll make sure parents stay with their kids

02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:17.220
and be more productive in their communities

02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:19.540
and it'll have a lot of knock-on effects.

02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:21.980
And it's incredibly cheap to do.

02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:23.620
Same thing with malaria,

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:26.260
it's mostly mosquito nets that we need to get out.

02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:29.060
And you're saying just to contrast with climate change,

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:32.140
the dollar you spend on, no, not climate change,

02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:35.380
but decreasing emissions does not have,

02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:38.060
does not come close to the $43 benefit?

02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:40.420
No, nobody would ever argue that.

02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:44.500
So very, very enthusiastic climate advocates

02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:47.100
would probably say it'll do two or three dollars

02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:48.300
worth of good for every dollar.

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:50.220
So, you know, it's still worthwhile to do.

02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:51.500
That's what they would say.

02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:53.820
I would argue, and I think a lot of the evidence

02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.260
seems to side that way,

02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.940
that a lot of the things that we're doing

02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:59.380
deliver actually less than a dollar back.

02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:03.220
But it's certainly not in nearly the same kind of place.

02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:05.100
But there's many, many other things.

02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.420
And, you know, just if you'll allow me to-

02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:08.900
Yes, please, I love this.

02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:11.180
But, you know, there are lots of other things,

02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:13.740
for instance, e-procurement.

02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.500
So, you know, it's incredibly boring.

02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:18.580
So most developing countries,

02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:20.020
well, actually most governments,

02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:21.900
spend most of their money on procurement,

02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:24.340
as typically incredibly corrupt.

02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:27.300
So we did this project for Bangladesh, where-

02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:28.380
Can you explain procurement?

02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:31.900
Yes, so that's governments buying stuff.

02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:34.940
So a large part of the government revenue

02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:37.300
is spent on buying anything from, you know,

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.340
post-it notes to roads.

02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:42.420
And obviously, you know, roads are much, much more expensive.

02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:46.060
It's mostly infrastructure stuff, hugely corrupt.

02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:47.540
For instance, in Bangladesh,

02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:51.260
it would already have been decided among the ruling elite

02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:54.020
in that local area who's gonna get this.

02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:56.180
So they'll have this bidding competition

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:58.100
where you have to hand in an envelope,

02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:00.500
a seal envelope with your bid on it,

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:03.740
but you put a goon outside the office.

02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:06.100
So you literally physically can't get in

02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:08.420
with your bid.

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:11.060
Now, what we found, and this is, you know,

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:14.260
I'm not claiming any sort of ownership to this.

02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:16.460
A lot of smart people have done this way before.

02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:18.860
We're just simply proving that it's a good idea.

02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:22.500
It turns out that if you put this on eBay, essentially,

02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:24.780
so if you do an e-procurement system

02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:26.860
where bidders can come in,

02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:29.500
suddenly it becomes harder to put up the goon.

02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.060
You can still do it, but it's harder to do it.

02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:35.500
It also means you get bids from all over Bangladesh,

02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:38.740
and in general, you'll get bids from all over.

02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:40.980
Actually, turns out you get better quality,

02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:44.220
but most important is you get it much cheaper.

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:46.540
So basically, you can simply save money.

02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:49.340
So we did a scaled experiment in Bangladesh

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:53.220
where we had about 4% go to be e-procurement,

02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:55.420
and you could compare what it would have cost

02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:57.100
and then what it did cost,

02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:01.100
and the average reduction was, as I remember, it's 7%.

02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:03.500
And the finance minister loved it, you know,

02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:06.180
because that basically gives him a lot more money,

02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:08.740
or you can buy more stuff at the same cost.

02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:10.620
It reduces corruption.

02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:13.580
So it's basically you get rid of some corruption.

02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:16.060
There'll still be corruption, but less corruption.

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:18.220
Ukraine has actually been big on this.

02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:19.220
Yeah, I've talked to them.

02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:21.700
I talked to the digital transformation minister.

02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:22.780
It's kind of incredible.

02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:26.220
I mean, this is before the war, but still working.

02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:30.860
It's like the entirety of the government is in an app,

02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:33.820
and that, one of the big effects

02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:36.180
is the reduction of corruption,

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:39.500
and not like from, as politicians say,

02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.660
to say, we've reduced,

02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:42.420
we've taken these actions to reduce corruption.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:45.860
No, literally, it's just much more difficult to be corrupt.

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:46.860
Yeah.

02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:48.340
The incentives aren't quite there,

02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:51.260
and there's friction for corruption.

02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:52.100
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:55.580
So basically, you can spend a little bit of money,

02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:57.180
and you can make a huge benefit.

02:32:57.180 --> 02:32:58.540
There's still about 70 countries

02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.020
that haven't gone e-procurement.

02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:02.060
So obviously, they should do that.

02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.180
Food for small kids, another thing.

02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:09.140
So basically, it's morally wrong that people are starving,

02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:13.260
but it also turns out that it's a really, really dumb thing

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:15.140
not to get kids good food,

02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:17.020
because if you get them good food,

02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:18.620
their brains develop more,

02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:21.460
so that when they get into school, they learn more,

02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:23.780
and so when they come out in adult lives,

02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:25.260
they're much more productive.

02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:28.780
So we can actually make every kid,

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.340
especially in developing countries,

02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:33.220
much more productive by making sure they get good food.

02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:35.420
So getting good food is not cost-free,

02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:37.980
so it probably costs about $100,

02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:41.820
both in you need some directed advertisement,

02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:42.660
you need to make sure

02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:44.940
that you actually get some of the food out there,

02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.060
that you help the families,

02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:48.220
and you also make sure you don't just give it to everyone,

02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:50.420
because then it becomes a lot more expensive.

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:54.100
If you do that right, it costs about $100 per kid, but-

02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:56.020
Per kid, or what do you do it?

02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:56.860
For two years,

02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:58.900
for their first two years of life.

02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:03.740
And if you do that, you then get a benefit

02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:06.500
in that they become smarter and go longer to school,

02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.660
and they actually learn more

02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:11.260
and become more productive of $4,500.

02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:13.700
Remember, this is far out into the future,

02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:16.980
so this is discounted, the benefit is actually much higher,

02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:18.060
and this is one of the things

02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:20.740
that we also have a conversation about in climate change,

02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:23.500
because when you talk about climate change,

02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.500
cost and benefits, all the costs are now,

02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.180
and all the benefits are in the future,

02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.220
but it's just like that in education.

02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:30.780
All the costs are now,

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:33.180
all the benefits are far out into the future.

02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.740
And if you try to do that right,

02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:38.140
and that's a whole other conversation that we could have,

02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:40.620
then it turns out that for every dollar spent,

02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:42.740
you do $45 worth of good.

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:46.420
Again, remember, about a third of all kids

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:47.900
that go to school right now

02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:50.340
just don't learn pretty much anything,

02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.700
and if we could make them more productive

02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:54.540
in the school system,

02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:56.780
we have another proposal on how to do that

02:34:56.780 --> 02:34:57.900
in the school system.

02:34:57.900 --> 02:34:59.780
But by just simply making sure

02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:02.860
that they're smarter when they get into school,

02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:04.060
we've been focusing so much

02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:07.620
on making the education system better, which is really hard,

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:10.860
but it's actually really easy to make the kids smarter.

02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:13.820
Then when you say the education system is not working well,

02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:16.700
we're talking about not the American education system,

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:17.740
we're talking about globally.

02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:19.260
Yes, we're talking about globally.

02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:22.540
So about a third of the teachers in developing countries

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:24.620
have a hard time passing the tests

02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:27.220
of the things they have to teach their students, right?

02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:30.540
And all these students have lots of other issues.

02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:33.220
They need to do farm work,

02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:37.180
they're constantly considering,

02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:39.540
should I just go out and start working instead?

02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:42.300
There's constant disruption,

02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:44.780
there's a lot of teachers that don't show up in India.

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.380
You have this absurd situation

02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:50.460
where all the teachers are basically paid

02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:53.380
and hired for eternity for the rest of their lives.

02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:56.380
And so not surprisingly, a lot of them decide not to show up.

02:35:56.380 --> 02:36:00.180
So now they've hired assistant teachers

02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:01.540
that basically have taken over.

02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:04.980
So they're paying for, I think it's 7 million teachers

02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:08.260
that I'm not saying they're all not working,

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.860
but a lot of them are not working as much as they should.

02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:13.660
And we now hired another 7 million teachers

02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:16.660
that will eventually stop working as well.

02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:18.220
They're working much better right now

02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:21.580
because they're not on permanent contracts,

02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:23.500
but eventually they'll get on permanent contracts

02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:24.820
and then you have the same problem again.

02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:26.460
There's lots of these issues

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:28.340
and it's just simply about saying,

02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:29.900
we can't fix all problems,

02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:32.820
but there are some problems that are incredibly easy to solve

02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:35.180
and there are some that are incredibly hard to solve.

02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:38.620
Why don't we start with solving the easy and effective ones?

02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:39.500
And this of course,

02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.940
bears on that whole conversation on climate change,

02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:45.260
because in some ways, that's also Andy's point of saying,

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:48.820
look, if you wanna save people from the impacts of hurricanes,

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:52.700
let's fix this simple, easy things about vulnerability first.

02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:55.140
Whereas we have somehow latched onto this,

02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:57.620
let's fix the hardest thing to do,

02:36:57.620 --> 02:37:00.540
which is to get everyone to stop using fossil fuels,

02:37:00.540 --> 02:37:02.540
which is basically what's driven

02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:05.060
the last 200 years of development.

02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:07.140
That's gonna be, that's a tall order,

02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:08.980
no matter how you look at it.

02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:10.660
There's some really cool elements

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.780
that you guys just brought up.

02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:14.300
When you mentioned that word moral before,

02:37:14.300 --> 02:37:17.340
I wasn't latched on to it because it relates

02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:21.660
to these timescales that really are immeasurable.

02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:23.340
If you know it's gonna take decades

02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:27.980
to confirm the benefit of some investment now,

02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:30.020
that implies you're doing the investment

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:33.020
with some moral imperative,

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:36.820
not because you can do a spreadsheet

02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:38.580
and come up with a number.

02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:42.580
And that process, letting go of the need

02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:46.740
for kind of a mechanistic cost-benefit approach

02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:49.260
and thinking about kids' education in poor countries

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:51.860
or several things we talk about,

02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:52.900
seems to be really important

02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:55.020
and it's very hard for all of us to do.

02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:57.060
Philanthropists suck at it.

02:37:57.060 --> 02:37:59.100
I worked at National Geographic Society for a year,

02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:01.420
building some new programs when they got a big infusion

02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:03.260
of money, they have a whole department

02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:06.420
that's called M&E, it's measurement and evaluation,

02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:10.180
which is if you don't prove it, it goes away.

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.660
I mentioned Spotify earlier,

02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:13.700
Spotify killing a climate podcast

02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:16.740
because that podcast didn't measure out

02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:20.220
for their impact, what they wanna do.

02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:22.900
And if we're always making the judgments

02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:24.340
based on strict cost-benefit,

02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:27.980
we're gonna miss larger realities.

02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:30.820
Another thing is, another really exciting example

02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:33.300
of what you're talking about in terms of,

02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:36.780
in Ukraine with the trust and lack of less corruption

02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:38.060
and stuff was in India.

02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:44.060
For all of his issues, Modi recognized

02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:48.020
that middle-class people in India cook on LPG, propane,

02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:51.220
or on piped gas, natural gas if they're in cities,

02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:55.420
much cleaner, much healthier in so many ways.

02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:58.060
And actually compared to like chopping down trees

02:38:58.060 --> 02:39:00.780
and cooking on wood, it's actually better for the climate,

02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:02.700
even though it's a fossil fuel.

02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:06.020
So he and others, there was an American scientist,

02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.820
Kirk Smith, who worked this all out.

02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:12.220
If you find a way, they were getting a subsidy.

02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:13.740
They had that energy subsidy.

02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:15.900
You were talking about the many poor countries

02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:18.700
subsidize energy just to stay in office,

02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:21.500
to make something cheap that everyone wants.

02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:23.060
But they wanted to shift the subsidy away

02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:25.740
from the middle-class to the poor people

02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:29.460
who are cooking on firewood and dying young from pneumonia.

02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:35.020
And the critical factor was India's digital currency.

02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:37.700
India went through a digital economy.

02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:38.980
Very poor families there now.

02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:42.180
If you have a phone, you basically, that's your bank.

02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:44.700
And you could make the case to the public

02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:48.900
that we're gonna be starting to shift your LPG,

02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:51.660
your propane subsidy to poor people.

02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:53.020
But we know they're poor.

02:39:53.860 --> 02:39:55.700
We know they're not just gonna be using it

02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:58.100
behind their restaurant, which was, you know,

02:39:58.100 --> 02:39:59.860
when it was a general subsidy,

02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.700
people were hoarding the LPG.

02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:04.460
And the system has worked.

02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:07.980
They've shifted a lot of capacity to cook

02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:11.140
on a clean blue flame that turns off and on

02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:13.620
in homes that previously where the woman would spend hours

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:17.020
collecting firewood, smoky fire, cooking,

02:40:17.020 --> 02:40:19.620
clean the pots and start all over again.

02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:22.500
But it's all built on trust, all built on the digital economy

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:24.220
and the same thing in Nairobi.

02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:28.180
So that excites me every day, you know, with all the doomism.

02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:33.300
I just hope people can literally take a breath,

02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:37.060
look for these examples that show the potential

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:39.540
when you have a trustworthy system,

02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:42.620
when you have a clear path to making lives better.

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:47.220
And then knowing, you know, that kid having electric light

02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:49.300
as opposed to a kerosene lamp,

02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:52.780
you don't know how much that's gonna improve his homework

02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:54.340
and lead to a better outcome.

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:56.900
But we know from history that sometimes it does.

02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:58.620
Ban Ki-moon, former secretary general,

02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:01.860
told the most powerful story I ever heard from a UN

02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:04.100
secretary general, it was like 2012

02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:07.180
when they were rolling out this sustainable energy

02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:09.420
for all initiative, which is not just climate,

02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:10.980
it was just like getting people energy

02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:14.220
they need to survive and thrive.

02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:18.540
He was growing up in post-war Korea, everyone was poor,

02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:20.620
everything was broken, destroyed,

02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:24.580
sadly, like so much of many parts of Ukraine.

02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:28.020
And he would do his homework by kerosene lamp.

02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:30.780
He said when he was studying for his finals,

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.380
his mom would give him a candle

02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:36.500
because it was a brighter flame, you know,

02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:37.780
better grades, maybe.

02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:39.380
And he became secretary general.

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.060
That's a hell of a story.

02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:49.940
So which, for climate change,

02:41:49.980 --> 02:41:52.060
which policies work, which don't?

02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:58.340
Which are, when we look at this formula of $1 in, $45 out,

02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:03.020
for climate change, what $1 in,

02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:07.180
what policies for $1 in and $1 out are good

02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:08.020
and which are not?

02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:12.900
So we actually did a whole project back in 2009

02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:17.020
when the whole world circus was coming to Copenhagen

02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:19.420
and we were gonna save the world there.

02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:22.300
We brought together about 50 climate economists

02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:24.660
and three Nobel laureates to look at where can you spend

02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:26.780
a dollar and do the most good for climate?

02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:29.180
And what they found was a lot of these things

02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:30.860
as we've been talking about before,

02:42:30.860 --> 02:42:34.780
that basically investing in the current sort of technology

02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:39.780
that we're trying very hard is at best a pretty dicey outcome.

02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:44.260
Much of it is probably less than $1 back in the dollar.

02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:48.940
There's some investments on adaptation, for instance,

02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:50.380
that's pretty good, but it's, you know,

02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:52.420
sort of $2, $3 back in the dollar.

02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:53.700
Oh, what is adaptation?

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.700
The obvious thing is that you build a dike

02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:59.140
for a sea level rise or that you make people,

02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:01.180
you get some apps that people know

02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:04.100
that there's a hurricane coming or that, you know,

02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:04.940
so you can adapt to-

02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:05.940
Adapt the infrastructure, right?

02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:06.780
Yes.

02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:08.260
The physical and the digital infrastructure.

02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:10.620
Yes, the point is that people are really good

02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:12.220
at doing this already

02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:13.980
because they have a strong incentive to do it.

02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:16.860
So the extra thing that governments can do outside

02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:19.660
is somewhat good, but it's not amazing or anything.

02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:24.660
What we found by far the best investment in the long run

02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:28.020
was on investment in energy innovation.

02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:31.020
So, and I think this also sort of corresponds

02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:33.780
with what we would think in general.

02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:35.860
If we could innovate, so, you know, for instance,

02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:36.900
Bill Gates is arguing

02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:38.740
we should have fourth generation nuclear.

02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:41.340
So the next, the more advanced

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:44.380
than what we currently have in third generation nuclear,

02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:47.380
which would be industrial scale process.

02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:49.740
You'd just be building these, you know,

02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:51.940
modular nuclear power plants.

02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:54.540
They would be, instead of being these artwork

02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:57.340
that we design once for every different plant,

02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:59.460
which is one of the reasons why they're so expensive,

02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:02.380
they would just be mass produced and you'd have one,

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:05.620
you know, they all be recognized in one go.

02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:06.860
So it'd be much cheaper.

02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:08.620
They would also be passively safe.

02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:12.660
So if all the power goes, they'll shut down

02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:14.580
rather than go boom.

02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:16.700
So that's another very good thing.

02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:19.740
And then they'll also be very hard to transform

02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:22.020
into nuclear weapons.

02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:23.900
So you can actually imagine them being out

02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:24.980
in a lot of different places

02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:26.340
where we'd perhaps be a little worried

02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:28.740
about having, you know, plutonium lying around.

02:44:28.740 --> 02:44:31.020
Now, this is all still being worked out,

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:33.500
but imagine if that actually comes out.

02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:36.140
And again, remember the other three generations,

02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:38.380
we were also told that it'll be incredibly safe

02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:39.860
and it will be incredibly cheap.

02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:41.060
And it didn't turn out that way.

02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:43.860
So let's wait, but it could be.

02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:47.940
And so the argument is invest in these ideas,

02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:49.860
for instance, fourth generation nuclear.

02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:51.460
And if fourth generation nuclear

02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.620
becomes cheaper than fossil fuels,

02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:54.700
we're done.

02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:56.140
Everyone will just switch,

02:44:56.140 --> 02:44:59.580
not just rich, well-meaning Americans or Europeans,

02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:02.460
but also the Chinese, the Indians, everybody in Africa,

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:05.260
the rest is Indian subcontinent.

02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.580
That's how you fix these issues, right?

02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:09.620
So the idea here is to say,

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:13.460
instead of thinking that we can sort of push people

02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:16.620
to do stuff they really don't want to do,

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:17.660
which is basically saying,

02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:21.580
let's use more of the solar and wind

02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:23.580
that you would otherwise have invested in,

02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:25.500
force people to buy an electric car

02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:26.860
by giving huge subsidies,

02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:30.060
because otherwise they're clearly not all that interested

02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:31.540
in buying it and so on,

02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:35.460
then get the innovation such that they become cheaper

02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:38.060
than fossil fuels and everyone will switch.

02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:39.820
This is how we've solved problems in the past,

02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:40.660
if you think.

02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:44.740
And in Los Angeles in the 1950s was hugely polluted place,

02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.460
mostly because of cars.

02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.260
The sort of standard climate approach today

02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:51.180
would be to tell everyone in Los Angeles,

02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:53.700
I'm sorry, could you just walk instead?

02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:56.300
And of course that just doesn't work, that doesn't pay off.

02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:59.700
You never get politicians voted in office

02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:01.540
or at least staying in office

02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:03.060
if you make that kind of policy.

02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:04.820
What did solve the problem

02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:07.380
was the innovation of the catalytic converter.

02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:09.260
You basically get those little gizmo

02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.780
and it cost a quarter hundred dollars

02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:12.540
and you put it on your tailpipe

02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:15.900
and then you can drive around basically almost not pollute.

02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:19.220
And that's how you fix the air pollution in Los Angeles.

02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:22.580
Basically we've solved all problems in humanity,

02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:25.820
all big, difficult problems with innovation.

02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:27.740
We haven't solved it by telling everyone,

02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:30.220
I'm sorry, could you be a little less comfortable

02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:33.140
and a little more cold and a little poorer

02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:36.580
and believing that that can go on for decades?

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:41.420
And while it possibly works in some pockets of the US,

02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:44.620
and I think actually in large parts of Europe at least,

02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:47.940
it used to, the war in Ukraine

02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:50.380
is definitely sort of changing that whole perspective.

02:46:50.380 --> 02:46:52.140
But there's a willingness to say,

02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:53.660
we're gonna suffer a little,

02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:55.220
but then we'll fix this problem.

02:46:55.220 --> 02:46:58.020
But the point is we're gonna be willing to suffer a little

02:46:58.020 --> 02:47:02.140
and so fix a tiny bit of the climate problem

02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:04.700
instead of actually focusing on innovation.

02:47:04.700 --> 02:47:07.940
So what we found was if you spend a dollar on innovation,

02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:11.380
you will probably avoid about $11 of climate damage

02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:14.300
in the long run, which is a great investment.

02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:17.980
And the terrible thing is we have not been doing this.

02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:20.540
So because everybody is focused on saying

02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:23.460
we need this solution within the next 12 years,

02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:26.020
it means you're not thinking about the innovation.

02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:27.340
We're actually spending less money,

02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:30.780
not more money on innovation globally.

02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:33.700
So everyone is focusing on reducing carbon emission

02:47:33.700 --> 02:47:36.540
versus innovating on alternate energy.

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:38.220
You're basically focusing on putting

02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:40.540
the existing solar panels or wind turbines

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:44.220
which are either just about inefficient or inefficient

02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:47.380
instead of making the next generation

02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:51.620
or it's more likely the 10th generation after that

02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.860
that comes with lots of battery backup power

02:47:54.860 --> 02:47:57.860
or fourth generation nuclear,

02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:00.140
or Craig Venter has this great idea.

02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:02.020
Craig Venter, the guy who cracked the human genome

02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:05.220
back in 2000, he has this idea of growing algae

02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:06.500
out on the ocean surface.

02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:08.700
These algae, they'd be genetically modified

02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:12.180
and they would basically soak up sunlight and CO2

02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:13.540
and produce oil.

02:48:13.540 --> 02:48:15.740
So we'd basically just grow our own Saudi Arabia

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:18.060
out on the ocean surface and we'd harvest it.

02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:20.380
We'd keep our entire fossil fuel economy,

02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:23.460
but it'd not be net zero because we just soaked up

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.300
the CO2 out there.

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.780
One dollar invested in the portfolio of different ideas.

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:30.260
Gives the $11 back.

02:48:30.260 --> 02:48:32.340
I first wrote about that in the New York Times.

02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:36.860
It was one of my actual page one stories in 2006.

02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:41.860
It was declining R&D in energy at a time of global warming.

02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:46.060
And the baseline is so low for this

02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:47.900
that it's a super bargain.

02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:52.220
We were in during the, there was during the energy crisis,

02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:55.380
the 70s, the first energy crisis in the 70s

02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:56.580
before the current one,

02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:00.740
our annual spending in the United States

02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:04.340
and constant dollars on R&D research and development

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:07.940
for energy was about $5 billion.

02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:11.060
And then it's just dribbled away since then.

02:49:11.060 --> 02:49:13.580
And recently now there's a big burst of new money

02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:16.260
coming through these new bills that got passed.

02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:17.580
But what I was told over and over again

02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:21.660
by people in that arena is you can't just have

02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:24.300
these little bubbles of investment.

02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:27.340
You don't get young people away from thinking

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:28.500
about Wall Street for jobs

02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:30.820
towards thinking about energy innovation

02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:33.220
if there isn't like a future there.

02:49:33.220 --> 02:49:35.660
And a lot of the, in the United States and Europe,

02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:40.020
the presumption was the way to that future was taxing carbon.

02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:43.420
You make that so punitive

02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:47.140
that you're basically evening the landscape

02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:49.380
for cleaner stuff that's more expensive.

02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:51.740
That has failed completely.

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:54.460
There are little examples in Europe where it's working.

02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.220
And what's happened now is,

02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:59.060
well, the United States, this big chunk of money

02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:03.180
is designed to take us over a finish line

02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:05.620
that was started with not just innovation

02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:07.780
but with the production efficiency too.

02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:09.100
This is one thing I got wrong,

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:10.460
I think a little bit in my reporting.

02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:12.940
I was so fixated on the innovation part

02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:15.300
just because I love science too.

02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:18.460
I saw this untapped possibility

02:50:18.460 --> 02:50:21.060
that others were saying, no, no, production efficiency,

02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:23.100
the more people are producing batteries,

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:24.140
the cheaper they'll get.

02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:28.980
This is Elon Musk's path and many others.

02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:29.900
And it really is both.

02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:31.620
So when you were talking about purchasing power

02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:33.580
for governments, for example,

02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:37.740
that can stimulate production capacity for batteries

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:41.380
or whatever the good thing is and take you down faster.

02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:43.700
And it's all about getting that margin

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:46.020
of the new thing out competing the old.

02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:48.540
And it's not just innovation.

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:50.260
It has so many parts of the pipeline

02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:51.860
that need to be nurtured.

02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:55.860
So, and the other thing is relative cost.

02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:58.780
The United States, when I was writing about this in 2006,

02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:02.100
our budget for DARPA,

02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:04.100
the Advanced Research Project Agency

02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:06.780
for the Defense Department,

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:10.100
just for science was 80 billion a year.

02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:13.460
For health, for medical frontier research on cancer

02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:14.820
and stuff, 40 billion.

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:16.100
Energy was two or three.

02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:19.620
So we weren't taking this remotely seriously.

02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:21.980
So now that if we get that up,

02:51:21.980 --> 02:51:23.820
to me there's like this level,

02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:25.940
you know we're taking something seriously

02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:28.620
when it's like in the tens of billions for R&D.

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.620
It's not that R&D will solve the problem,

02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:33.500
but it's a proxy for what we really care about.

02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:35.700
We care a shitload about defense.

02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:37.380
What's the defense budget in the United States now?

02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:38.820
Like 800 billion?

02:51:38.820 --> 02:51:40.100
It's some insane number.

02:51:40.100 --> 02:51:41.660
Who's counting when you're having fun?

02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:42.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:45.900
And so innovation is not just like for the better,

02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:49.540
you know, camera, the better solar panel,

02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:50.940
the better battery.

02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:53.060
Social innovation actually matters hugely.

02:51:53.060 --> 02:51:55.580
Like the guy in Nairobi I mentioned

02:51:55.580 --> 02:51:58.580
with a company doing micropayment gas

02:51:58.580 --> 02:52:00.460
to get people off charcoal.

02:52:00.460 --> 02:52:03.580
We need that as much as this.

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:06.260
And I actually, I interviewed Bill Gates.

02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:09.700
We had spent an hour with him in Seattle in 2016

02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:14.100
when he was rolling out his breakthrough energy thing.

02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:15.980
I got to spend, it was 45 minutes,

02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:17.780
me and Bill Gates, which was pretty fun.

02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:19.060
But I brought this up.

02:52:19.060 --> 02:52:22.060
I said, you know, cause he's all about the new nuclear thing

02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:23.580
that will solve the world's problems.

02:52:23.580 --> 02:52:25.060
And I, yes, yes, yes, but we also-

02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:25.900
Oh, he brought up nuclear?

02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:26.740
Sorry to interrupt.

02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:27.580
Oh, he did, oh sure, yeah.

02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:29.420
So he's interested in one of the-

02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:31.260
Oh, he's investing heavily in nuclear,

02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:32.580
but he invests in everything.

02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:33.900
He's got a big portfolio.

02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:37.780
But I brought up a guy I met in India

02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:41.380
who runs a little outfit called Selco

02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:44.580
that they do really interesting, cool village to village.

02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:47.540
They're like an energy analyst

02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:48.780
who'll come to your house here in the States

02:52:48.780 --> 02:52:50.820
and tell you how to weatherize your house.

02:52:50.820 --> 02:52:52.860
But they do it at the village scale.

02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:56.980
And in a village that has, where they're milling wheat,

02:52:56.980 --> 02:53:00.060
he'll put in a solar powered wheat mill.

02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:02.820
And, you know, that's not gonna solve the world's problems,

02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:05.740
but it gives them a way to control their energy.

02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:08.060
They don't have to buy something to grind their wheat.

02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:10.620
And that needs just as much attention

02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:14.340
as the things I really like too, the cool technologies.

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.540
And I thought I cornered Bill Gates.

02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:20.780
I was like, cause he really does focus on these big wins,

02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:22.820
the big, you know, like nuclear

02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:25.700
that will make net zero completely doable.

02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:28.340
And I said, well, you know, what about nuclear,

02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:30.780
like New York City, where I was still living at the time,

02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:34.180
well near, and I said, it's got a million buildings.

02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:37.020
New York City has 1 million buildings.

02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:40.260
And in 2013, the Bloomberg government analyzed,

02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:43.300
they said, looking ahead to 2050,

02:53:43.300 --> 02:53:45.660
75% of the buildings in New York City

02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:48.780
that will exist in 2050 already exist.

02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:51.500
You think about these brave new futures, right?

02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:53.500
Like, we're just gonna like come in,

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:56.420
have these shiny, cool passive house cities.

02:53:56.420 --> 02:53:58.220
And as I put this to Bill, and I said,

02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:00.820
so how do you do that?

02:54:00.820 --> 02:54:03.580
How do you retrofit all those boilers,

02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:06.140
many of which were coal fired like 20 years ago

02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:08.660
to get a zero energy New York City?

02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:11.220
And I kind of thought I had him,

02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:13.860
and he immediately, he kind of sat back and went,

02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:17.100
well, but if you have unlimited clean power

02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:20.060
coming into that city, it doesn't really matter.

02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:21.380
It's a pretty good Bill Gates impression.

02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:22.900
It was a good answer.

02:54:22.900 --> 02:54:24.300
I mean, it was a good answer.

02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:25.940
He said, oh yeah, it's a leaky bucket,

02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:29.940
but pour in zero carbon energy, then it doesn't matter.

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:32.540
But I still think we have to figure out the other part too.

02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:35.340
That end, how do you innovate at the household level,

02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:36.620
at the village level?

02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:40.300
It's much more of a distributed problem, we used to think.

02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:42.740
The one big change I've had in my own thinking too

02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:47.740
is from top down to distributed.

02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:50.540
Everything about the climate problem

02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:53.580
through the first three decades of my reporting

02:54:53.580 --> 02:54:57.420
was that the IPCC will come out a new report,

02:54:57.420 --> 02:55:02.260
the framework convention, the treaty will get us on board,

02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:03.580
we'll all behave better.

02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:07.980
It has this top down parent to child architecture,

02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:13.060
and everything I've learned has gone the other way.

02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:17.900
It's distributed capacity for improved lives,

02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:19.820
kids getting through school,

02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:23.140
women not having to spend three hours collecting firewood.

02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:25.660
And if it means propane for that household in that context,

02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:26.500
that's a good thing.

02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:27.900
So stop with all your yammering

02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:30.180
about sending all fossil fuel subsidies.

02:55:30.180 --> 02:55:33.420
And what's an America look like

02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:38.020
that has some climate safe energy future?

02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:39.820
Find your part in that.

02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:41.900
Don't get disempowered by the scale of it.

02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:43.380
There's like a thousand things to do.

02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:45.460
When you start to cut it into pieces.

02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:48.500
So it's very different, it's not a top down thing.

02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:50.020
No one's gonna magically come in and-

02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:52.060
And that's where I think,

02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:55.900
so I agree that everyone should try to play their part

02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:59.460
and do whatever they can.

02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:03.020
But I also think just the sheer incentives,

02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:08.020
what we saw happening with shale gas is a great example.

02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:10.060
When shale gas becomes so cheap

02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:12.500
that you just stop using coal,

02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:14.780
then you don't really have to convince

02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:17.580
lots and lots of people, coal is really bad.

02:56:17.580 --> 02:56:18.620
And it wasn't a label of climate.

02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:19.660
No, it wasn't a climate thing.

02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:20.580
It was an energy thing.

02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:21.420
It was totally.

02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:25.700
And the point is just the power of an innovation

02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:28.540
is that you almost don't see it anymore.

02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:30.300
It just happens.

02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:32.620
And I think that's really the only way

02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:34.940
we're gonna fix these big problems.

02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:39.100
If you think about the nutrition problem back in the 60s,

02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:42.340
70s, we worried a lot about India and other places.

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:44.540
A solution is not worrying

02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:47.140
or the solution was not us eating a little bit less

02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:49.300
and sending it down to India or wherever.

02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:51.180
The solution was the green revolution, right?

02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:53.860
It was the fact that some scientists made ways

02:56:53.860 --> 02:56:56.420
to make every seed produce three times as much.

02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:59.020
So you could grow three times as much food on an acre.

02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:01.580
And that's what basically made it possible

02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:03.860
for India to go from a basket case

02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:07.020
to the world's leading rice exporter.

02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:10.300
And that's how you do these things.

02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:13.260
You solve these big problems through innovation.

02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:15.100
And again, I'm not saying,

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:17.340
we're actually arguing our carbon tax

02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:18.940
is a smart thing to do.

02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:21.540
That's what any economist would tell you to do.

02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:24.260
But it also turns out that it's partly,

02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:26.260
it's not gonna solve most of the problem

02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:29.580
and it's incredibly politically hard to do.

02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:33.420
So it may also just be the wrong sort of tree to bark up.

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:35.340
Again, if you can do it, please do.

02:57:36.220 --> 02:57:39.220
But this is not the main thing that's gonna solve climate.

02:57:39.220 --> 02:57:41.540
The main thing is that we get these innovations

02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:44.060
that basically make green energy so cheap.

02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:46.220
Everyone will just want it.

02:57:46.260 --> 02:57:48.660
We mentioned nuclear quite a few times.

02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:50.980
You know, there was a, for a long time,

02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:52.420
it seems to have shifted recently.

02:57:52.420 --> 02:57:54.820
Maybe you can clarify and educate me on this.

02:57:54.820 --> 02:57:56.660
But for the longest time,

02:57:56.660 --> 02:58:01.660
people thought that nuclear is almost unclean energy

02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:05.620
or dangerous energy or all that kind of stuff.

02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:07.300
When did that shift?

02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:09.540
What was the source of that alarmism?

02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:13.140
Maybe is that a case study

02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:16.340
of how alarmism can turn into

02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:20.060
a productive, constructive policy?

02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:23.100
Productive from whose standpoint?

02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:26.020
Is it not? Is it not?

02:58:26.020 --> 02:58:27.100
Like nuclear?

02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:27.940
No, I was trying to,

02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:29.780
do you mean productive in terms of yay, we banned it

02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:30.740
or productive for those who went?

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.260
Oh, I see, I see what you mean, yes.

02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:34.700
I meant productive for human civilization.

02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:36.940
No, the alarmism over nuclear power

02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:40.060
dominated any alarmism over global warming.

02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:42.420
Absolutely.

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:43.340
Really?

02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:46.980
Oh yeah, this in the United States, Three Mile Island,

02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:48.500
then you had Chernobyl there.

02:58:49.660 --> 02:58:52.420
And the traditional environmental movement

02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:54.620
still won't go there.

02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:59.140
They still, the big groups, NRDC, EDF,

02:58:59.140 --> 02:59:02.140
that whole alphabet soup of the big greens

02:59:02.140 --> 02:59:06.100
are reluctant to put forward the nuclear option

02:59:06.100 --> 02:59:08.460
because they know a lot of their aging donors

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:11.900
basically grew up in the thinking about nuclear

02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:14.220
as the problem, not the solution.

02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:15.780
I lived for the last 30 years.

02:59:15.780 --> 02:59:17.180
I moved to Maine recently,

02:59:18.260 --> 02:59:19.540
but I lived in the Hudson Valley,

02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:21.860
10 miles from the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant,

02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:26.780
which was built in the 60s, 70s, and had some problems.

02:59:26.780 --> 02:59:30.580
None of them were to the point of a meltdown

02:59:30.580 --> 02:59:31.820
or the threat of it,

02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:33.940
even the theoretical possibility of one.

02:59:35.420 --> 02:59:38.300
I've been in, I was in it twice as a reporter,

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:39.740
looking down in the cooling pool,

02:59:39.740 --> 02:59:41.900
I can send you a fun video of bubbles

02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:43.260
in the cooling pool with the rods,

02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:47.580
and progressively they demonstrated how to handle waste.

02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:49.540
In the United States now, the waste is,

02:59:49.540 --> 02:59:50.460
because we haven't figured out

02:59:50.460 --> 02:59:52.140
how to move it across state lines,

02:59:53.020 --> 02:59:57.260
it's glassified, it's put into kind of containers

02:59:57.260 --> 02:59:59.460
that sit there at the plant.

02:59:59.460 --> 03:00:02.540
We just simply don't have a long-term solution.

03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:09.660
The Nevada politicians were successful

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.900
in saying, not here, not Yucca Mountain.

03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:16.860
But my wife, who I've been married to,

03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:19.460
well, I met 30 years ago, and she lives with me.

03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:21.580
She's an environmental educator.

03:00:21.580 --> 03:00:25.140
She was very happy when Cuomo shut it down,

03:00:25.140 --> 03:00:27.740
said we're gonna shut it down three or four years ago,

03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:29.060
which just happened a year.

03:00:29.060 --> 03:00:30.540
It actually is shut down now.

03:00:30.540 --> 03:00:31.380
It's being mothballed.

03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:33.140
And I was like, that sucks.

03:00:33.140 --> 03:00:33.980
We need-

03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:34.900
But she's happy.

03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:36.380
Yeah, and we still love each other.

03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:37.700
And she's an environmentalist,

03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:41.500
so that just speaks to a lot of environmentalists

03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:43.860
still see nuclear as bad.

03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:44.700
Oh, totally.

03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:45.540
Oh, yeah.

03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:50.460
And you bring in the weapons proliferation issues.

03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:51.900
But it's a safety thing.

03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:53.300
It's a generational thing.

03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:56.300
I think young people are different, I hope.

03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.740
These small modular reactor designs,

03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:04.740
several of which, there's a couple of PhDs from MIT

03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:07.380
who did transatomic power.

03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:09.660
They're both in their early 30s.

03:01:09.660 --> 03:01:11.580
We need so much more of them.

03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:13.420
And just briefly, the one thing I say about nuclear

03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:17.300
is there's so many of these things, like subsidies.

03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:20.460
Don't talk to me about yes, no nuclear.

03:01:20.460 --> 03:01:21.940
Talk to me about what do you wanna do

03:01:21.940 --> 03:01:24.340
with existing nuclear power plants?

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:28.020
And what do you wanna do about the possibility of new ones?

03:01:28.020 --> 03:01:29.700
Let's parse this out in chunks

03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:32.420
that we can have constructive conversations about.

03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:35.220
The idea of no nuclear drives me crazy,

03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:37.820
just like no fossil fuel subsidies

03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:39.540
is silly in the world we inhabit

03:01:39.540 --> 03:01:41.780
that has these pockets of no energy.

03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:45.820
So that's just my sustain what mantra

03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:50.660
is start with some dividing and conquer,

03:01:50.660 --> 03:01:53.220
to conquer the dispute over by saying,

03:01:53.220 --> 03:01:54.900
let's at least get real.

03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:57.780
This power plant has been in the Hudson Valley for 30 years.

03:01:57.780 --> 03:01:59.300
It was the baseload.

03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:00.220
It was baseload.

03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:02.380
Baseload is a real thing.

03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:05.060
And guess what has filled the gap

03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:07.260
since that power plant has turned off?

03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:09.220
Natural gas, natural gas.

03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:13.460
But, and you don't hear that from the environmental community

03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:17.140
that was so eager to turn off the Indian point.

03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:19.180
I think both the point of saying,

03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:21.060
the people are saying it's the end of the world,

03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:23.540
but no, I don't want a nuclear power plant.

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:25.900
It just doesn't make sense.

03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:28.620
And Andy's absolutely right to talk about.

03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:30.780
So existing nuclear power plants,

03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:32.660
we already paid for them.

03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:34.180
We already have them.

03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:37.780
We already committed to decommissioning them eventually

03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:39.100
while they're running.

03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:41.140
They're pretty much the cheapest power

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:42.980
you can possibly have on the planet

03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:46.460
because it costs almost nothing to run them day to day.

03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:51.460
So it's basically cheap or almost free CO2 baseload power.

03:02:51.940 --> 03:02:56.940
There's just nothing there that you should embrace.

03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:59.900
Now, new nuclear power plants

03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:02.620
turn out to be very expensive currently.

03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:04.820
So the one they built in Finland,

03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:08.860
some in the UK and France and several other places

03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:10.940
turn out to be incredibly expensive.

03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:12.420
So they're much more expensive

03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:16.620
than the costliest renewables you can imagine.

03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:19.700
So they're actually not a solution right now.

03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:21.820
And that's why we need the innovation.

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:23.540
That's why we need the potentially

03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:25.140
fourth generation nuclear power.

03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:27.460
It's just simply, it's a bad deal.

03:03:27.460 --> 03:03:30.300
And that's why nuclear is never gonna win

03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:31.580
on its third generation.

03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:35.540
Now it may never get there, who knows,

03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:38.780
but it's certainly a possibility

03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:40.180
and we should be looking into it.

03:03:40.180 --> 03:03:45.180
And there are wonky realities that need to be dealt with.

03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:48.100
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission of the United States,

03:03:48.100 --> 03:03:51.740
their approval process is still locked and designed

03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:55.300
on this 50 year old model of big giant power plants.

03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:57.180
There's a intense discussion right now

03:03:57.180 --> 03:04:01.660
about evolving a new regulatory scheme

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:04.020
for small modular ones because of all these

03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:06.300
implicit advantages they offer.

03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:09.140
And that, so along with the innovation,

03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:12.380
you need to have this get out of the way

03:04:12.380 --> 03:04:14.100
or you're never gonna have the investment.

03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:17.100
So it really is an all of the above thing.

03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.260
Looking at these as systems problems,

03:04:19.260 --> 03:04:21.540
systems solutions is really important.

03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:25.900
Let me ask you about Alex Epstein.

03:04:25.900 --> 03:04:29.740
So he wrote, I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is,

03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:31.620
but he wrote a couple of books.

03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:34.060
It's just interesting to ask a question about fossil fuels

03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:36.020
because we're talking about reality.

03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:38.020
And he's somebody that doesn't just talk about

03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:39.380
the reality of fossil fuels,

03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:41.500
but he wrote a book,

03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:45.140
Moral Case for Fossil Fuels and Fossil Future,

03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:49.420
where he makes the case that as his subtitle says,

03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:54.420
global human flourishing requires oil, coal and natural gas

03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:58.940
or more oil, coal and natural gas, not less.

03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:02.140
What do you think about the argument he makes?

03:05:02.140 --> 03:05:07.140
So he pushes, we've had this kind of speaking of the center

03:05:07.260 --> 03:05:10.060
of this balanced discussion of the reality of fossil fuels,

03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:13.540
but also investing a lot into renewable energy

03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:17.340
and having the $1 to $11 return.

03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:22.100
He says, I'm not sure exactly how to frame it,

03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:27.100
but investing and maintaining investment of fossil fuels

03:05:27.820 --> 03:05:29.940
also has a positive return

03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:32.140
because of how efficient the energy is.

03:05:32.140 --> 03:05:33.620
I've read the first book.

03:05:33.620 --> 03:05:35.380
Yeah, I've got his second one.

03:05:35.380 --> 03:05:37.620
I've been planning to have him on my webcast,

03:05:37.620 --> 03:05:38.500
my tiny webcast.

03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:41.220
What's the name of the webcast?

03:05:41.220 --> 03:05:42.100
Sustain what?

03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:43.940
Everything I do is sustain what?

03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:46.660
Because it's like, don't talk to me about sustainability.

03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:47.580
Sustain what?

03:05:47.580 --> 03:05:48.400
For whom?

03:05:48.400 --> 03:05:49.240
How?

03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:53.180
Then we're talking, interrogatory approach to things.

03:05:53.180 --> 03:05:57.660
So I think the valuable part of what he has done

03:05:57.660 --> 03:06:02.140
is to remind people, particularly in the West or North

03:06:02.140 --> 03:06:04.460
or whatever, the developed world,

03:06:04.460 --> 03:06:06.780
that everything we take for granted,

03:06:07.740 --> 03:06:10.900
low fertilizer, from low fertilizer prices

03:06:10.900 --> 03:06:13.260
to air conditioning to everything else,

03:06:13.260 --> 03:06:16.300
exists because we had this bounty

03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:18.860
that we dug out of the ground or pumped out of the ground.

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:19.700
It's a boon.

03:06:19.700 --> 03:06:22.060
It's been an amazing boon to society, period.

03:06:22.060 --> 03:06:25.580
So start there, which means going forward,

03:06:25.580 --> 03:06:28.020
what we're talking about is a substitution

03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:31.500
or having your fossil fuels and eating it too,

03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:33.180
meaning getting rid of the carbon dioxide.

03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:34.940
If you focus on the carbon dioxide,

03:06:35.860 --> 03:06:37.620
which is the thing warming the planet,

03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:40.340
not the burning of the fuels,

03:06:40.340 --> 03:06:41.900
then that's another way forward

03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:44.060
that could sustain fossil fuels.

03:06:44.060 --> 03:06:46.500
As far as I can tell from at least the first book,

03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:48.660
he makes the moral case that fossil fuels

03:06:48.660 --> 03:06:52.780
are essentially a good overall.

03:06:52.780 --> 03:06:55.700
I don't think he adequately accounts for the need

03:06:56.700 --> 03:06:58.620
to stop global warming.

03:06:58.620 --> 03:07:01.140
I think that we have to slow,

03:07:01.140 --> 03:07:03.700
slowing global warming is a fundamental need

03:07:04.140 --> 03:07:06.380
coming in the century we're in.

03:07:06.380 --> 03:07:08.420
And that's just not factored into his math.

03:07:08.420 --> 03:07:10.860
Well, I think that's where,

03:07:10.860 --> 03:07:13.260
I've had a few sort of offline conversations with him.

03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:14.860
I think he said,

03:07:14.860 --> 03:07:16.260
because I mentioned I'm talking to the two of you,

03:07:16.260 --> 03:07:19.620
he said that that's probably where he disagrees

03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:22.060
about sort of the level of threat

03:07:22.060 --> 03:07:25.060
that global warming causes.

03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:27.380
Well, Steve Kuhnen is another one.

03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:29.220
He's a brilliant guy.

03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:31.860
He lived right close to me in the Hudson Valley.

03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:34.300
He was in the Obama administration energy department.

03:07:34.300 --> 03:07:35.860
It's K-O-O-N-I-N.

03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:37.420
He wrote a bestseller that came out recently

03:07:37.420 --> 03:07:40.260
on skepticism about climate.

03:07:41.740 --> 03:07:45.300
And there are other smart people

03:07:45.300 --> 03:07:49.780
who somehow feel we can literally adapt our way forward

03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:53.980
without any constraint on the gases changing the climate.

03:07:53.980 --> 03:07:57.220
And I've spent enough time on this.

03:07:57.220 --> 03:07:59.140
I think I'm a pretty level-headed reporter

03:07:59.140 --> 03:08:00.460
when it comes to this issue.

03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:01.700
And I think having some sense

03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:05.740
that we can adapt our way into the world

03:08:05.740 --> 03:08:08.940
we're building through relentless climate change

03:08:08.940 --> 03:08:11.020
with no new normal, remember,

03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:14.100
more gas accumulating in the air every year.

03:08:15.100 --> 03:08:18.340
These are not static moments.

03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:20.020
That that's a good thing to do

03:08:20.020 --> 03:08:24.020
is doesn't strike me as smart.

03:08:26.340 --> 03:08:29.460
I'd probably say that I think it's more sort of a,

03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:31.740
at least the thing that I take away from Alex

03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:35.420
is the fact, as you point out,

03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:37.980
that we need to recognize that fossil fuels

03:08:37.980 --> 03:08:41.020
is basically the backbone of our society today.

03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:44.380
We get 80% of our energy from fossil fuels today.

03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:47.020
Still, as we did 50 years ago, four years ago.

03:08:47.020 --> 03:08:49.100
And people have no sense of this, right?

03:08:49.100 --> 03:08:50.700
So they have the idea,

03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:53.660
because you see so many wind turbines and solar panels

03:08:53.660 --> 03:08:55.100
and everybody's talking about it,

03:08:55.100 --> 03:08:57.100
that this is huge, big things.

03:08:57.100 --> 03:08:58.420
But the reality is, remember,

03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:01.860
only about a fifth of all energy use is electricity.

03:09:01.860 --> 03:09:04.060
The rest is processes and heating,

03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:06.340
industrial processes and so on.

03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:09.700
So actually, solar and wind right now

03:09:09.700 --> 03:09:14.700
produces 1% of energy from wind and 0.8% from solar.

03:09:15.100 --> 03:09:16.860
This is not a huge thing.

03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:18.460
It's a fairly tiny bit.

03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:20.540
And growing explosively.

03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:21.940
Yes, it's absolutely growing.

03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:23.980
But actually it's growing slower

03:09:23.980 --> 03:09:26.700
than what nuclear was growing in the 70s and 80s,

03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:28.380
which I thought was a fun point,

03:09:28.380 --> 03:09:31.260
not by a little amount, by like two or three times.

03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:34.100
So we're still talking about something

03:09:34.100 --> 03:09:37.260
which is somewhat boutique, at least.

03:09:37.260 --> 03:09:40.220
And when you then look out into the future,

03:09:40.220 --> 03:09:43.020
and I think this is the interesting part of it,

03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:44.580
when you look out into the future,

03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:47.340
if you look at the Biden administration's own estimate

03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:49.180
of what will happen by 2050,

03:09:50.460 --> 03:09:54.500
we will be at, if all countries do all the stuff

03:09:54.500 --> 03:09:56.100
that they promised and everything,

03:09:56.100 --> 03:10:01.100
we will be at 70% fossil fuels by 2050, globally.

03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:04.660
This is just, yes, it's a better world.

03:10:04.660 --> 03:10:09.220
I think it's good that we're now down to 70 instead of 80,

03:10:09.220 --> 03:10:12.540
but it is still a world that's fundamentally

03:10:12.540 --> 03:10:15.620
dependent on fossil fuels for almost everything

03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:17.460
that we really like about the world.

03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:20.940
And forgetting that, and I think we are doing that

03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:22.500
in the sense, as you also mentioned,

03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:24.140
that people say no fossil fuels,

03:10:24.140 --> 03:10:26.740
and we're in all development organizations,

03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:28.860
we're now telling the poor countries,

03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:31.260
you can't get any funding for anything

03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:33.420
that has to do with fossil fuels.

03:10:33.420 --> 03:10:37.340
We have literally reduced our investment

03:10:37.340 --> 03:10:42.340
in oil and gas by more than half since 2014.

03:10:43.540 --> 03:10:46.700
And much of this is because of climate concerns.

03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:48.500
This has real world consequences.

03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:51.620
This is why energy prices have gone up.

03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:52.980
It's not the only reason.

03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:55.420
COVID also, certainly the war in Ukraine,

03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:58.540
but this is an underlying systemic reason

03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:01.460
why fossil fuel costs will go up dramatically.

03:11:01.460 --> 03:11:04.060
Now, a lot of greens will sort of tend to say,

03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:06.900
well, that's great, because we want fossil fuels

03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:07.820
to be expensive.

03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:10.740
We want people to be forced over to renewables,

03:11:10.740 --> 03:11:14.340
but that's very easy to say if you're rich.

03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:16.980
It's the kind of thing that New Yorkers will say

03:11:16.980 --> 03:11:20.460
when you go to rich, well-meaning green New Yorkers

03:11:20.460 --> 03:11:24.100
and say, yes, gasoline should cost $20 a gallon.

03:11:24.100 --> 03:11:27.740
Well, you don't have a car, you just ride the Metro.

03:11:27.740 --> 03:11:29.180
It's very easy for you to say that,

03:11:29.180 --> 03:11:31.540
but lots of people both in the rich world

03:11:31.540 --> 03:11:35.300
but in poor parts of the US, but all around the world,

03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:37.780
their lives have basically dependent on fossil fuels.

03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:40.580
And so the idea that we're gonna get people off

03:11:40.580 --> 03:11:43.460
by making it so expensive that it becomes impossible

03:11:43.460 --> 03:11:45.700
for them to live good lives

03:11:45.700 --> 03:11:47.700
is almost morally reprehensible.

03:11:47.740 --> 03:11:50.740
And I think Alex has the right point there.

03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:53.340
We need to get people to realize

03:11:53.340 --> 03:11:55.980
we're not gonna get off fossil fuels anytime soon.

03:11:55.980 --> 03:11:59.300
So we need reasonably affordable fossil fuels

03:11:59.300 --> 03:12:00.620
for most of the world.

03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:03.300
And that's, of course, why we need to focus so much more

03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:05.900
on the innovation so that we can get to the point

03:12:05.900 --> 03:12:09.220
where we no longer need fossil fuels as soon as possible.

03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:11.060
But to say to everyone, look,

03:12:11.060 --> 03:12:13.020
we're gonna make fossil fuels expensive way

03:12:13.020 --> 03:12:15.420
before we have the solution is just terrible.

03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:19.260
And so much is on the rich countries of the world.

03:12:21.500 --> 03:12:24.180
I did a conversation recently with Johan Rockström,

03:12:24.180 --> 03:12:29.180
who's a famed sustainability scientist in Stockholm,

03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:30.980
actually Potsdam now.

03:12:32.020 --> 03:12:35.220
And he's come up with the idea of planetary boundaries.

03:12:35.220 --> 03:12:37.860
There's lots of things he has said that I,

03:12:37.860 --> 03:12:39.980
as a journalist, I'm still looking into about that.

03:12:39.980 --> 03:12:40.940
Planetary boundaries?

03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:43.260
Yeah, that there are limits to what Earth can absorb

03:12:43.300 --> 03:12:46.340
in human, our use of water, phosphorus,

03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:48.740
our carbon dioxide loading in the atmosphere.

03:12:48.740 --> 03:12:51.180
There are these tipping, there are these boundaries

03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:54.380
if we cross them, we're in a hot zone, a danger zone.

03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:55.820
He's an interesting thinker.

03:12:55.820 --> 03:13:00.820
But on this point, last year at the Glasgow Climate Talks,

03:13:01.220 --> 03:13:05.820
he gave a very important talk about the equity thing here

03:13:05.820 --> 03:13:09.380
that you, he basically laid out a landscape

03:13:10.260 --> 03:13:13.100
saying the rich nations of the world

03:13:13.100 --> 03:13:15.620
need to greatly ramp up their reduction of emissions

03:13:15.620 --> 03:13:17.820
or what they're gonna pay poor countries to do

03:13:18.860 --> 03:13:20.700
to allow poor countries,

03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:25.060
some of which have fossil resources like in Africa,

03:13:25.060 --> 03:13:29.140
to have the carbon space to own whatever space

03:13:29.140 --> 03:13:34.060
or time is left to be able to develop their fossil fuels

03:13:35.420 --> 03:13:36.460
as a fundamental right.

03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:39.300
Because also they're starting from this little baseline,

03:13:40.140 --> 03:13:41.900
Ghana hasn't contributed squat

03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:44.340
to the global warming problem in terms of emissions.

03:13:44.340 --> 03:13:46.020
Ghana has natural gas.

03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:48.580
And right now, this month,

03:13:48.580 --> 03:13:53.260
environmental groups are outside the World Bank today,

03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:56.820
actually tonight, saying this was on their list

03:13:56.820 --> 03:13:57.660
of dirty projects.

03:13:57.660 --> 03:13:59.660
World Bank should stop financing Ghana's right

03:13:59.660 --> 03:14:02.940
to get gas out of the ground, to develop its economy,

03:14:02.940 --> 03:14:04.460
get its people less poor,

03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:07.180
make them more productive, innovative parts of humanity.

03:14:07.660 --> 03:14:10.260
To me, that's really reprehensible.

03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:12.300
One of the other projects on their list

03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:14.300
as a World Bank kind of gotcha,

03:14:14.300 --> 03:14:16.460
like how dare they give money,

03:14:16.460 --> 03:14:20.660
was for a new fertilizer factory in Bangladesh

03:14:20.660 --> 03:14:23.500
that is designed to get three times as much fertilizer

03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:25.060
from the same amount of natural gas

03:14:25.060 --> 03:14:27.060
as the old plants that are now dormant.

03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:32.620
This is in a time when we're facing high energy prices,

03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:34.980
high gas prices, high food prices,

03:14:34.980 --> 03:14:37.620
when food insecurity is spreading rapidly,

03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:38.740
when a country like Bangladesh

03:14:38.740 --> 03:14:42.660
has millions of rice farmers who need urea tablets

03:14:42.660 --> 03:14:44.300
to put in their rice fields.

03:14:44.300 --> 03:14:46.300
And to say that shouldn't,

03:14:46.300 --> 03:14:47.660
how dare they finance that

03:14:47.660 --> 03:14:50.700
because there's a fossil fuel involved is immoral.

03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:52.700
So yes, on that point from Alex.

03:14:52.700 --> 03:14:56.940
So this is 2022 polls.

03:15:00.180 --> 03:15:01.700
This is a bunch of different ways

03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:04.380
to look at the same basic effect.

03:15:04.380 --> 03:15:08.900
In the United States, Democrats, younger Americans

03:15:08.900 --> 03:15:11.980
identify dealing with climate change as a top priority.

03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:16.980
US adults, 42% say that dealing with climate change

03:15:19.140 --> 03:15:21.140
should be a top priority.

03:15:21.140 --> 03:15:25.820
11% of Republicans, 65% of Democrats.

03:15:25.820 --> 03:15:28.860
And we could see this effect throughout.

03:15:32.140 --> 03:15:34.660
46% of Americans say human activity

03:15:34.660 --> 03:15:37.180
contributes a great deal to climate change.

03:15:37.180 --> 03:15:39.580
By the way, this is a little bit different

03:15:39.580 --> 03:15:41.100
than what we're discussing.

03:15:41.100 --> 03:15:44.060
I was just looking through different polls.

03:15:45.420 --> 03:15:48.540
In the public, there seems to still be uncertainty

03:15:48.540 --> 03:15:52.900
about how much humans contribute to climate change.

03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:55.340
More than the scientific.

03:15:55.340 --> 03:15:57.500
It would only be 24% that disagree

03:15:57.500 --> 03:15:59.420
with the UN climate panel, right?

03:15:59.420 --> 03:16:00.940
Three quarters would agree.

03:16:00.940 --> 03:16:03.260
Are you uncomfortable about the 29?

03:16:03.260 --> 03:16:06.180
No, 29 is actually, it's exactly right.

03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:08.540
I mean, the UN doesn't say it's all.

03:16:08.540 --> 03:16:11.260
Well, they say that could be the border case.

03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:12.740
But anyway, this is interesting.

03:16:12.740 --> 03:16:14.740
But to me, across all these polls,

03:16:14.740 --> 03:16:18.420
if you look Republican versus Democrat,

03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:23.420
Republican say that 17% say it's a great deal.

03:16:24.580 --> 03:16:28.060
Democrats say 71% say it's a great deal.

03:16:28.100 --> 03:16:30.540
And you just see this complete division.

03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:35.580
I think you probably, the COVID pandemic,

03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:39.700
you can ask a lot of questions like this.

03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:41.220
Do masks work?

03:16:41.220 --> 03:16:43.060
Are they an effective method

03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:45.340
to slow transmission of a pandemic?

03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:47.940
You'll probably have the same kind of polls

03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:50.140
about Republicans and Democrats.

03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:54.740
And while the effectiveness of masks,

03:16:54.740 --> 03:16:56.740
to me, is a scientific question.

03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:00.540
But so there's different truths here, apparently.

03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:02.140
One is a scientific truth.

03:17:03.740 --> 03:17:07.420
One is a truth held by the scientific community,

03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:08.660
which seems to be also different

03:17:08.660 --> 03:17:11.380
than the scientific truth sometimes.

03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:13.060
And the other is the public perception

03:17:13.060 --> 03:17:18.060
that's polluted or affected by political affiliation.

03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:23.060
And then there's whatever is the narrative

03:17:23.060 --> 03:17:25.980
that's communicated by the media.

03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:27.300
They will also have a question,

03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:30.140
the answer to the question of whether masks work or not.

03:17:30.140 --> 03:17:32.060
And they will also have an answer to the question

03:17:32.060 --> 03:17:34.180
about all these climate-related things.

03:17:34.180 --> 03:17:38.100
So that's a long way of asking the question

03:17:38.100 --> 03:17:43.100
of how is politics mixed into all of this

03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:45.020
on the communication front,

03:17:45.020 --> 03:17:48.380
on the figuring out what the right policy is front,

03:17:48.380 --> 03:17:50.660
on the friction of humanity

03:17:51.660 --> 03:17:53.620
in the face of the right policies.

03:17:53.700 --> 03:17:55.580
I've written a ton on this.

03:17:55.580 --> 03:17:58.340
After I had that conversion about the social science,

03:17:58.340 --> 03:18:01.740
in 2006, I began digging in a lot more

03:18:01.740 --> 03:18:05.860
on how people hold beliefs and what they do

03:18:05.860 --> 03:18:10.260
as opposed to what they think and questions about polling.

03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:12.020
And there's two things that come to me

03:18:12.020 --> 03:18:15.020
that make me not worry about the basic literacy,

03:18:15.020 --> 03:18:19.260
like is climate change X percent of whatever?

03:18:19.260 --> 03:18:21.300
I don't really care about that.

03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:22.540
And I'll explain why.

03:18:23.620 --> 03:18:28.340
For one thing, more science literacy, more basic literacy,

03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:32.380
like what is a greenhouse gas, all that stuff.

03:18:32.380 --> 03:18:35.540
Dan Kahane, K-A-H-A-N at Yale,

03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:37.900
he's actually at Yale Law School.

03:18:37.900 --> 03:18:40.060
The last decade, he did all this work

03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:41.980
on what he calls cultural cognition,

03:18:43.140 --> 03:18:47.060
which is, and he did studies that showed

03:18:48.460 --> 03:18:53.140
how what you believe emerges based on culture,

03:18:53.140 --> 03:18:56.460
based on your background, your red, blue,

03:18:56.460 --> 03:18:58.380
where you are in the country.

03:18:58.380 --> 03:19:01.180
And one of the really disturbing findings was

03:19:02.060 --> 03:19:04.940
that the people who have the most basic science literacy,

03:19:04.940 --> 03:19:09.100
like who know the most about greenhouse effect or whatever,

03:19:09.980 --> 03:19:13.260
they're at both ends of the spectrum of views on climate,

03:19:13.260 --> 03:19:15.260
dismissives and alarmed.

03:19:15.260 --> 03:19:17.140
Steve Kuhnen, as I mentioned, is a good example.

03:19:17.140 --> 03:19:20.980
He's a brilliant physicist and he knows all the science

03:19:20.980 --> 03:19:23.460
and he's completely at the end of skepticism.

03:19:24.900 --> 03:19:29.500
Will Happer, who was close to being Trump's science advisor,

03:19:29.500 --> 03:19:31.140
was even more out there.

03:19:31.140 --> 03:19:34.500
And he's on, they're both on the Jason committee

03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:37.100
that advises the government on big strategic things.

03:19:38.380 --> 03:19:40.820
And people who are really alarmed about it

03:19:40.820 --> 03:19:42.020
also have the same belief.

03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:43.420
So as a journalist, I was thinking,

03:19:43.420 --> 03:19:47.060
do I just spend my time writing more explanatory stories

03:19:47.060 --> 03:19:48.700
that explain the science better?

03:19:49.700 --> 03:19:50.900
No.

03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:53.020
Do I dig in on this work to understand

03:19:53.020 --> 03:19:54.420
what brings people together?

03:19:54.420 --> 03:19:58.100
And then these same surveys, the same science shows you,

03:19:58.980 --> 03:20:00.340
if you don't make it about climate,

03:20:00.340 --> 03:20:02.460
among other things, this becomes,

03:20:02.460 --> 03:20:03.980
you don't have to worry about this anymore.

03:20:03.980 --> 03:20:08.980
If you Google for no red, blue divide climate revkin,

03:20:09.300 --> 03:20:11.780
you'll find a piece I did with some really good graphs.

03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:15.060
Essentially, it shows that in America,

03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:17.220
this is the Yale group again,

03:20:17.300 --> 03:20:19.180
their climate communication group.

03:20:19.180 --> 03:20:23.140
There's no red, blue divide on energy innovation, none.

03:20:23.140 --> 03:20:26.020
We need more climate energy, clean energy innovation.

03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:29.780
There wasn't even a divide state by state

03:20:29.780 --> 03:20:33.580
on whether CO2 should be regulated as a pollutant.

03:20:34.780 --> 03:20:37.180
But it's all like, what are the questions you ask

03:20:37.180 --> 03:20:40.180
if you ask about innovation,

03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:44.380
if you ask about more incentives for renewable power?

03:20:45.260 --> 03:20:50.180
Oklahoma, Iowa, I did a piece when I was at ProPublica

03:20:50.180 --> 03:20:54.420
showing that the 17 states that were fighting Obama

03:20:55.380 --> 03:20:58.300
in court over his clean power plan,

03:21:00.220 --> 03:21:02.380
the majority of them were actually meeting the targets

03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:04.740
that the clean power plan had

03:21:04.740 --> 03:21:07.900
because they're expanding wind power already,

03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:09.140
not because of the climate,

03:21:09.140 --> 03:21:12.140
because it makes money sense and energy sense.

03:21:12.140 --> 03:21:14.100
So you don't think there's a political divide in this?

03:21:14.740 --> 03:21:17.260
There is on climate, if you call it climate.

03:21:17.260 --> 03:21:18.740
If you say it's a climate,

03:21:18.740 --> 03:21:20.140
do you believe in the climate crisis?

03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:23.140
You're not asking, what kind of energy future

03:21:23.140 --> 03:21:24.380
do you want in your town?

03:21:25.420 --> 03:21:29.420
And so if you ask that question, the polarization goes away.

03:21:30.340 --> 03:21:33.900
I guess I'm asking, is there polarization on policy?

03:21:33.900 --> 03:21:36.540
No, well, there, again,

03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:40.620
the bipartisan infrastructure law

03:21:40.620 --> 03:21:43.620
that was passed last November, that was bipartisan.

03:21:43.620 --> 03:21:44.460
And I said, yes.

03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:45.820
And that's a trillion dollars,

03:21:46.780 --> 03:21:48.180
several hundred billion of which

03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:50.220
are for cleaner energy and resilience.

03:21:51.180 --> 03:21:53.140
Yeah, but that's, yeah.

03:21:53.140 --> 03:21:57.020
But it's not a climate bill, and it wasn't a tax.

03:21:57.020 --> 03:22:00.300
It's incentives.

03:22:00.300 --> 03:22:02.860
So the word climate and similar words

03:22:02.860 --> 03:22:06.780
are just used as part of the signaling, like masks.

03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:09.260
It's not. Absolutely.

03:22:09.260 --> 03:22:11.540
Dan Cahan's work, the guy at Yale,

03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:14.100
he really demonstrated powerfully abortion,

03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:16.100
gun rights, climate,

03:22:17.060 --> 03:22:19.780
and a more parsed level of nuclear power

03:22:19.780 --> 03:22:22.660
has enduring camps that for and against.

03:22:22.660 --> 03:22:24.500
What, why do the camps form?

03:22:25.660 --> 03:22:28.300
Some of it's cultural cognition.

03:22:28.300 --> 03:22:29.460
It's how you grew up.

03:22:29.460 --> 03:22:30.900
It's what you fear.

03:22:30.900 --> 03:22:32.860
There's no common human frame for-

03:22:32.860 --> 03:22:34.060
Is it because of like folks,

03:22:34.060 --> 03:22:36.380
like certain individuals like Al Gore?

03:22:37.420 --> 03:22:38.260
Ah.

03:22:38.540 --> 03:22:39.980
He would make a film.

03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:41.580
He cares about this thing.

03:22:41.580 --> 03:22:42.820
He's a Democrat.

03:22:42.820 --> 03:22:44.140
Therefore, I hate this thing.

03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:45.420
Therefore, I don't like this thing, yeah.

03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:46.900
Oh, sure. Yeah.

03:22:46.900 --> 03:22:48.260
When people get attached to an issue,

03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:50.860
if that's what pops into your head

03:22:50.860 --> 03:22:52.340
when you hear climate, then,

03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:53.780
and it got politicized.

03:22:53.780 --> 03:22:56.260
It became emblematic.

03:22:57.220 --> 03:23:00.420
And the whole vaccine thing.

03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:01.780
I mean, I'm not American,

03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:03.580
so I should stay a little bit out of this,

03:23:03.580 --> 03:23:07.660
but I think it seems to me that a lot of the thing

03:23:07.660 --> 03:23:10.060
that people believe and talk about

03:23:10.060 --> 03:23:13.500
is really about what they worry that that will lead to

03:23:13.500 --> 03:23:15.740
in terms of policy down the line.

03:23:15.740 --> 03:23:18.300
So a little bit like, do masks work?

03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:20.460
I'm sort of imagining.

03:23:20.460 --> 03:23:21.980
I don't know whether this is true,

03:23:21.980 --> 03:23:25.100
but I think part of it is if I say masks work,

03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:27.860
they're gonna force me to wear it for the next year.

03:23:27.860 --> 03:23:29.140
So it doesn't work

03:23:29.140 --> 03:23:31.260
because then I don't have to wear it kind of thing.

03:23:31.260 --> 03:23:34.780
That it's really, you're looking much further down the line.

03:23:34.780 --> 03:23:37.220
And certainly on climate, it seems to me

03:23:37.220 --> 03:23:40.380
that a lot of the people who say it's not real,

03:23:40.380 --> 03:23:42.540
it's not because they don't know it's,

03:23:42.540 --> 03:23:43.620
of course it's real,

03:23:43.620 --> 03:23:45.820
but it's that they don't want you to then come

03:23:45.820 --> 03:23:47.660
and regulate it really heavily.

03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:48.500
Yeah.

03:23:48.500 --> 03:23:50.260
Because they don't like top-down government.

03:23:50.260 --> 03:23:53.140
Yeah, and also because they don't want another tax

03:23:53.140 --> 03:23:55.420
and there's lots of other.

03:23:55.420 --> 03:23:59.940
So it's really, it's not a straight science question.

03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:03.100
It really is a question of what do you want to do?

03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:04.660
And that's where I think, Andy,

03:24:04.660 --> 03:24:06.660
you're much, much more right in saying

03:24:06.660 --> 03:24:08.820
we should have that discussion.

03:24:08.820 --> 03:24:10.460
So what do you want to do?

03:24:10.460 --> 03:24:13.860
Because that will be a much easier conversation to say,

03:24:13.860 --> 03:24:15.860
do you want to do really smart, cheap stuff?

03:24:15.860 --> 03:24:18.780
Or do you want to do pretty dumb, expensive stuff?

03:24:18.780 --> 03:24:21.340
When you put it that way, you can get most people on board.

03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:23.500
Of course, it's not as simple as that, I know.

03:24:23.500 --> 03:24:25.100
And it gets back to what you said earlier,

03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:26.620
that again, you talked about

03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:28.500
collaborative cooperation or whatever.

03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:31.500
There's a guy at Columbia, Peter Coleman,

03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:32.340
who runs this thing called

03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:34.340
the Difficult Conversations Laboratory.

03:24:34.340 --> 03:24:36.300
Yeah.

03:24:36.860 --> 03:24:37.700
And when I first heard about it,

03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:39.380
I was like, oh man, we need that.

03:24:40.340 --> 03:24:45.340
And his background is psychology and conflict resolution,

03:24:45.340 --> 03:24:48.900
mostly at the global scale related to atrocities

03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:51.580
that countries are trying to get over.

03:24:51.580 --> 03:24:54.500
And there's a science to how to hold a better conversation.

03:24:54.500 --> 03:24:58.860
As you either through experience or whatever know,

03:24:58.860 --> 03:25:00.540
you could, if you hold a debate,

03:25:00.540 --> 03:25:02.900
like I wouldn't want to be in a debate with Bjorn.

03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:05.180
We could find lots of things we disagree on,

03:25:05.180 --> 03:25:08.860
but that takes it back to the win-lose model, right?

03:25:08.860 --> 03:25:11.380
That's not how you make progress.

03:25:11.380 --> 03:25:15.380
And what Peter, what I learned absorbed from him,

03:25:15.380 --> 03:25:18.700
Peter Coleman, because I was thinking like,

03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:19.780
we need room for agreement.

03:25:19.780 --> 03:25:21.060
I need to build a room for agreement.

03:25:21.060 --> 03:25:24.780
My blog at the Times and then the stuff I do now,

03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:27.380
it's like, how can we talk and come to agreement?

03:25:27.380 --> 03:25:29.100
He says, no, no, you don't want agreement.

03:25:29.100 --> 03:25:30.180
You want cooperation.

03:25:31.140 --> 03:25:34.020
That allows you to hold onto your beliefs.

03:25:34.900 --> 03:25:39.060
But to, you know, we can disagree on all these things,

03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:41.140
but let's cooperate on that one thing.

03:25:41.140 --> 03:25:44.580
And that's a really valuable distinction

03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:46.620
that's needed so much in this arena,

03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:50.340
because as I said earlier, you can parse it right down

03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:53.620
to the whole menu of things Joe Manchin wanted,

03:25:53.620 --> 03:25:56.020
you know, transmission lines.

03:25:56.020 --> 03:25:57.940
Now we're going to have big fights over transmission lines.

03:25:57.940 --> 03:25:59.460
We've got billions of dollars to expand,

03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:01.580
expanding America's grid.

03:26:01.580 --> 03:26:04.220
And every community in America is going to say, not here.

03:26:04.220 --> 03:26:08.900
So how do you foster a federal local dialogue

03:26:08.900 --> 03:26:10.380
that allows that to happen

03:26:10.380 --> 03:26:12.940
if you want to have any hope of a better grid?

03:26:16.180 --> 03:26:18.220
So those insights come from behavioral sciences

03:26:18.220 --> 03:26:23.220
that I think are completely undervalued in this area.

03:26:23.620 --> 03:26:26.820
Pielke loves to quote, I think it's Lippert.

03:26:26.820 --> 03:26:28.020
Oh, Walter Lippman.

03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:30.980
Lippman, yes, that democracy is not about,

03:26:31.140 --> 03:26:32.540
you know, everybody agreeing,

03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:35.300
but it's about different people disagreeing,

03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:36.500
but doing the same thing.

03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:37.820
Doing one thing together.

03:26:37.820 --> 03:26:40.260
Yes, I mean, agreeing that we're going to do this thing.

03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:42.580
So you can disagree, but still do a thing,

03:26:42.580 --> 03:26:46.060
you know, possibly for very different reasons,

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:46.900
and that's fine.

03:26:46.900 --> 03:26:48.340
And there's an amazing video clip

03:26:48.340 --> 03:26:51.580
that shows this so powerfully.

03:26:51.580 --> 03:26:54.380
2015 was the buildup to the Paris talks

03:26:54.380 --> 03:26:57.820
that led to the Paris agreement, you know, this.

03:26:57.820 --> 03:27:00.900
And a really talented journalist at CNN at the time,

03:27:00.900 --> 03:27:03.700
John Sutter, who's from Oklahoma originally,

03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:07.060
he saw another Yale study

03:27:07.060 --> 03:27:09.500
that was a county by county study

03:27:09.500 --> 03:27:12.020
of American attitudes on global warming,

03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:13.420
like right down to the county level.

03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:17.740
And there's this little glowing data point

03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:20.500
in Woodward County, West Oklahoma.

03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:22.420
Woodward County, Oklahoma was ground zero

03:27:22.420 --> 03:27:24.420
for climate skepticism, climate denial,

03:27:24.420 --> 03:27:25.900
whatever you want to call it.

03:27:25.900 --> 03:27:27.340
And he thought, oh, I'm going to go there.

03:27:27.340 --> 03:27:30.500
And he went there just to meet people on the street,

03:27:30.500 --> 03:27:33.220
talk to them about energy and weather.

03:27:33.220 --> 03:27:35.060
And he did these little interviews.

03:27:35.060 --> 03:27:36.460
And there's this one with this guy

03:27:36.460 --> 03:27:39.540
who's like a middle-aged oil company employee,

03:27:40.380 --> 03:27:43.380
like a business, like an administrator, Thai kind of guy.

03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:47.420
And he starts out the interview and the guy is saying like,

03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:49.780
well, you know, God controls the environment.

03:27:50.660 --> 03:27:51.860
And if you're watching this, you're just going,

03:27:51.860 --> 03:27:53.980
okay, this is going to be interesting.

03:27:53.980 --> 03:27:55.060
And the backstory, by the way,

03:27:55.060 --> 03:27:59.500
is the guy, he paid for the local playground

03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:01.380
to have dinosaurs and people,

03:28:01.380 --> 03:28:04.420
like toy dinosaurs and people all at the playground

03:28:04.420 --> 03:28:06.300
because he believes in creation,

03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:07.940
6,000 year creation.

03:28:07.940 --> 03:28:09.980
So that's the guy, right?

03:28:09.980 --> 03:28:13.140
And then he gets to energy and the guy says,

03:28:13.140 --> 03:28:16.980
the same guy who believes God controls the environment says,

03:28:16.980 --> 03:28:18.860
we have half of our roof covered with solar panels

03:28:18.860 --> 03:28:21.620
and we want to get off the grid entirely.

03:28:21.620 --> 03:28:24.820
And when I show this to audiences, I say,

03:28:24.820 --> 03:28:27.620
just pause and think about that for a second.

03:28:27.660 --> 03:28:30.380
If you went, why do you think that that's happening?

03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:31.620
And it's because he's independent.

03:28:31.620 --> 03:28:33.060
He wants to have his own source of power.

03:28:33.060 --> 03:28:33.900
He's libertarian.

03:28:33.900 --> 03:28:35.540
He doesn't want the government telling him what to do.

03:28:35.540 --> 03:28:37.540
He would never vote for Hillary, I guarantee you.

03:28:37.540 --> 03:28:39.500
This is 2015.

03:28:39.500 --> 03:28:40.900
But he wanted to get off the grid entirely

03:28:40.900 --> 03:28:44.340
to be his own, to be himself.

03:28:44.340 --> 03:28:47.060
And so then I say, okay, so if you were going

03:28:47.060 --> 03:28:49.860
around the country with your climate crisis placard

03:28:49.860 --> 03:28:51.900
and you go to Woodward County,

03:28:51.900 --> 03:28:54.400
do you think that would be a productive way

03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:57.140
to go to that place and make your case?

03:28:57.180 --> 03:29:00.420
And the answer is pretty obvious, no.

03:29:00.420 --> 03:29:02.220
If you go in there and you listen,

03:29:02.220 --> 03:29:04.500
like listening is such an important property

03:29:04.500 --> 03:29:06.540
that we all forget, including journalists,

03:29:07.940 --> 03:29:11.700
you're much more apt to find a path to cooperation.

03:29:11.700 --> 03:29:14.020
You could talk to him about, I guarantee you,

03:29:14.020 --> 03:29:15.980
if I went there today, maybe I should go

03:29:15.980 --> 03:29:18.460
to talk about this new bill, $370 billion.

03:29:18.460 --> 03:29:22.020
How do we make that work at the local level?

03:29:22.020 --> 03:29:24.140
How do we answer that guy at the energy department,

03:29:24.140 --> 03:29:26.840
Jigar Shah, so how do we put this to work

03:29:26.840 --> 03:29:29.920
to get our buses off to get electrified

03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:33.080
or transition our street lamps and stuff?

03:29:33.080 --> 03:29:34.560
You could have a good chat with him.

03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:37.000
If you go in there and say, I'm here to debate you

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.600
to death on global warming, forget about it.

03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:42.600
Actually, let me ask you a question,

03:29:42.600 --> 03:29:45.200
given your roots as a journalist.

03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:49.520
So yeah, talking to a guy you disagree with,

03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:51.120
that's one thing.

03:29:51.120 --> 03:29:56.120
What about talking to people that might be society

03:29:56.760 --> 03:30:01.760
might consider bad, unethical, even evil?

03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:05.060
What's the role of a journalist in that context?

03:30:06.240 --> 03:30:09.080
So climate change is a large number of people

03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:11.200
that believe one thing, a large number of people

03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:13.200
that believe another thing.

03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:16.320
It turns out, even with people that society deems as evil,

03:30:16.320 --> 03:30:19.360
there's a large number of people that support them.

03:30:19.360 --> 03:30:24.360
What's your role as a journalist to talk to them?

03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:27.640
Well, I have talked to really bad people.

03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:29.960
When I wrote about the murder of Chico Mendes,

03:30:29.960 --> 03:30:34.400
a Brazilian Amazon rainforest activist in 1989,

03:30:34.400 --> 03:30:36.300
I interviewed the killers.

03:30:37.820 --> 03:30:41.780
One was in jail, several of them were just ranchers who,

03:30:43.620 --> 03:30:45.120
they had their point of view.

03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:48.020
They were there in the Amazon rainforest to,

03:30:49.080 --> 03:30:51.920
the word in Brazil in Portuguese is limpar,

03:30:51.920 --> 03:30:53.560
to clean the land.

03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:56.360
The bandarantes, the pioneers of Brazil,

03:30:56.360 --> 03:30:58.680
they go into these frontiers and tame them

03:30:58.680 --> 03:31:01.100
like we had in our West.

03:31:01.100 --> 03:31:03.160
And they would bring that up too.

03:31:03.160 --> 03:31:06.240
They would say to me, well, you did this.

03:31:06.240 --> 03:31:08.920
They didn't say you murdered your Native Americans and stuff,

03:31:08.920 --> 03:31:10.160
but they could easily have said that too,

03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:12.740
and you deforested all your landscapes.

03:31:12.740 --> 03:31:14.480
So who are you to come down here to?

03:31:14.480 --> 03:31:16.920
But if I didn't talk to them,

03:31:16.920 --> 03:31:20.840
that would be not a way to do journalism.

03:31:20.840 --> 03:31:23.920
But when you talk to them, did you empathize with them?

03:31:23.920 --> 03:31:26.200
Or did you push back?

03:31:26.200 --> 03:31:28.120
That's the ultimate question.

03:31:28.120 --> 03:31:29.880
Like if you want to understand,

03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:35.240
like if you talk to Hitler in 1941,

03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:39.080
you empathize with him or do you push back?

03:31:39.080 --> 03:31:41.720
Because most journalists would push

03:31:42.760 --> 03:31:45.640
because they're trying to signal to fellow journalists

03:31:45.640 --> 03:31:48.980
and to people back home that this me,

03:31:48.980 --> 03:31:50.820
the journalist is on the right side.

03:31:51.780 --> 03:31:54.820
But if you actually want to understand the person,

03:31:54.820 --> 03:31:56.100
you should empathize.

03:31:57.380 --> 03:31:59.460
If you want to be the kind of person

03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:04.460
that actually understands in the full arc of history,

03:32:06.020 --> 03:32:07.180
you need to empathize.

03:32:07.180 --> 03:32:10.300
I find that journalists, a lot of times,

03:32:10.300 --> 03:32:12.420
perhaps they're protecting their job,

03:32:12.420 --> 03:32:14.700
their reputation, their sanity,

03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:16.640
are not willing to empathize.

03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:18.720
I think this happened with Joe Manchin.

03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:20.360
I'm not doing any kind of equation here

03:32:20.360 --> 03:32:23.440
related to Hitler and Joe Manchin or Trump.

03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:25.000
I interviewed the guy, Will Hepper,

03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:27.400
I mentioned who was a physicist at Princeton

03:32:27.400 --> 03:32:29.840
who thinks carbon dioxide is the greatest thing

03:32:29.840 --> 03:32:32.680
in the world and we should have more of it in the atmosphere.

03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:35.680
I profoundly disagree on that point.

03:32:35.680 --> 03:32:37.680
But I interviewed him for an hour

03:32:37.680 --> 03:32:40.680
and it was so interesting

03:32:40.680 --> 03:32:43.360
because he was trying to kind of rope-a-dope me

03:32:44.360 --> 03:32:47.840
into making it about CO2 and climate

03:32:47.840 --> 03:32:51.480
because he's a super smart physicist.

03:32:51.480 --> 03:32:55.640
And I kind of said, let's talk about some other things.

03:32:55.640 --> 03:32:57.920
And we started talking about education and science education.

03:32:57.920 --> 03:32:59.680
He went on for like 20 minutes

03:32:59.680 --> 03:33:03.600
about the vital importance of better science education

03:33:03.600 --> 03:33:04.680
for Americans.

03:33:04.680 --> 03:33:08.440
He drew on people he knew from Europe, Hungary.

03:33:08.440 --> 03:33:11.600
Bunch of Nobel Prize winners came from some town in Hungary

03:33:11.640 --> 03:33:13.000
for at least a couple.

03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:15.160
And he said that he learned their teachers.

03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:18.360
At any rate, he went into a long exposition on that.

03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:20.840
He then defended climate science.

03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:22.240
He said, we need more climate science.

03:33:22.240 --> 03:33:23.240
He says, I love this stuff.

03:33:23.240 --> 03:33:25.000
I love the ocean buoys.

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:26.600
There are now thousands of them in the oceans

03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:31.000
charting clear pictures of ocean circulation and satellites.

03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:32.360
And he said something really important

03:33:32.360 --> 03:33:33.720
that made people discount,

03:33:33.720 --> 03:33:36.040
which is we need sustained investment

03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:37.480
in monitoring this planet.

03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:42.680
We neglect our systems that just tell us

03:33:42.680 --> 03:33:44.240
what's happening in the world.

03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:46.920
And that's happened over and over again.

03:33:46.920 --> 03:33:48.320
So if I had left it,

03:33:48.320 --> 03:33:53.320
if I had gone into the terrain of the fight over CO2,

03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:55.640
some journalist friends might say,

03:33:55.640 --> 03:33:59.640
oh, that was a good mashup, you know, matchup.

03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:02.480
But I found these really profound and important things

03:34:02.480 --> 03:34:05.000
that I wanted the world to know about

03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:06.840
in the context of whether Trump was gonna have him

03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:08.240
as a science advisor.

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.640
And so if I hadn't gone there,

03:34:11.640 --> 03:34:13.480
and a lot of people, if you look back,

03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:18.000
I got hammered for doing that from, even from friends.

03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:21.560
And then later, John Holdren,

03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:24.360
who had been Obama's science advisor for eight years,

03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:29.160
he said, I would rather have Will Happer

03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:32.840
as Trump's science advisor than no science advisor.

03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:34.280
In other words, there's a landscape

03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:35.200
of things that are important.

03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:37.720
He recognized that Happer is really smart about defense

03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:39.040
and all kinds of things too.

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:42.400
So it's like, you do have to sort of screw up your,

03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:44.680
ideally screw up your courage,

03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:47.760
but then not necessarily get into the,

03:34:47.760 --> 03:34:51.000
it's like with the guy in Oklahoma, you know,

03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:53.640
if you go in looking for the differences, you'll find them.

03:34:53.640 --> 03:34:54.840
You can amplify them.

03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:59.240
You can leave with this paralyzed sense

03:34:59.240 --> 03:35:02.720
of nothing having happened that was useful,

03:35:02.720 --> 03:35:04.720
or you can find these nuggets.

03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:06.960
Everyone is a human being.

03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:08.760
I can't play the mind game

03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:11.880
of what I would have said asked to Hitler, but.

03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:14.960
I play that mind game all the time,

03:35:14.960 --> 03:35:16.800
but that's for another conversation.

03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:17.640
Yeah, yeah.

03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:22.640
I had many in my family that have suffered under him.

03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:25.280
Nevertheless, he is a human being.

03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:27.120
Yeah.

03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:29.960
And I, you know, people sometimes caricature Hitler

03:35:29.960 --> 03:35:31.920
saying like, that's when you mention

03:35:31.920 --> 03:35:35.240
Hitler, the conversation evolves,

03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:37.000
but I don't agree.

03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:38.600
I think sort of these extremes

03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:40.760
are useful thought experiments to understand,

03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:43.160
because if you're not willing to take your ideals

03:35:43.160 --> 03:35:48.160
to that extreme, then maybe your ideals need some rethinking

03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:52.440
from a journalistic perspective, all that kind of stuff.

03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:55.360
A number of years ago, my wife and I were with our veterinarian

03:35:55.360 --> 03:35:59.360
who was German born, Dr. Bach, B-A-C-H.

03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:00.560
We were talking about the dog and stuff,

03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:01.680
and then we were talking about Trump,

03:36:02.520 --> 03:36:04.000
and he just mentioned in passing,

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:05.800
he said, my mother voted for Hitler.

03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:09.080
Wow, that hit me like a brick.

03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:09.920
Yeah.

03:36:09.920 --> 03:36:13.440
Because it was so, these, at the very least,

03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:18.440
understanding how pathways that lead to people doing things

03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:22.320
like he did and ordered is essential,

03:36:22.320 --> 03:36:25.840
and the only way to understand that is to dig in

03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:28.640
and ask questions and get uncomfortable.

03:36:28.640 --> 03:36:30.160
That still makes my hair prickle

03:36:30.160 --> 03:36:32.080
when I think back to him saying,

03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:33.800
yeah, my mom voted for Hitler.

03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:35.240
That somehow makes it super real.

03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:38.120
Like, oh, yeah, there's elections,

03:36:38.120 --> 03:36:40.920
there's real people living their lives.

03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:43.280
Exactly, struggling with a broken economy

03:36:43.280 --> 03:36:44.840
and all kinds of stuff.

03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:48.160
Having their own little personal resentments

03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:49.880
and all that kind of stuff.

03:36:49.880 --> 03:36:52.440
Let me ask you about presidents, American presidents.

03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:58.680
Who had a positive or negative impact

03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:01.320
on climate change efforts, in your view?

03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:03.840
Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden,

03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:06.160
or maybe you could say that they don't have much of an impact.

03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:09.200
So like they, in public discourse,

03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:14.200
presidents have a kind of maybe disproportional,

03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:18.160
like we imagine they have a huge amount of impact.

03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:23.040
How much impact do they actually have on climate policy?

03:37:24.640 --> 03:37:25.760
I don't know if you have comments on this.

03:37:25.760 --> 03:37:29.040
Well, there is a background decarbonization rate

03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:31.360
that's happened for 150 years.

03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:36.360
We moved from wood to charcoal to coal to oil

03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:40.360
and gas is cleaner, it's more hydrogen, less carbon.

03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:42.760
And when you, I asked recently,

03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:44.680
I asked some really smart scientists

03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:47.760
who study these long trajectories of energy.

03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:48.840
When you look at those curves,

03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:50.520
is there anything in that curve that says,

03:37:50.520 --> 03:37:53.000
oh, climate treaty, 1992.

03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.800
Oh, Paris.

03:37:55.800 --> 03:37:58.760
And it's really hard or China.

03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:02.160
I mean, when China came in with this huge growth

03:38:02.160 --> 03:38:07.160
in emissions that created a bit of a recarbonization blip

03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:08.920
but that was this huge growth in their economy.

03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:11.520
They pulled a bunch of people out of poverty.

03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:15.040
So yeah, no, presidents don't really change anything

03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:17.440
on time scales that we would measure

03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:19.640
as meaning where you could parse it out.

03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:23.560
I think that's not to say that Obama's

03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:27.960
and the current focus on the stimulus that's happening

03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:30.520
which includes a lot more money for research, et cetera

03:38:30.520 --> 03:38:31.400
and innovation.

03:38:32.400 --> 03:38:35.760
I do think that will be beneficial in a very, very long run.

03:38:35.760 --> 03:38:38.680
But I have to say, you know, when Obama stood up

03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:42.880
and made credit, you know, took credit for reductions

03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:46.160
from moving from coal to gas because of fracking,

03:38:47.240 --> 03:38:49.520
that was actually Cheney who set that emotion.

03:38:50.360 --> 03:38:53.200
I would say Bush, not because I like him or anything

03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:57.280
but he's the guy who inadvertently started fracking.

03:38:57.280 --> 03:38:58.520
And it goes further back than that.

03:38:58.520 --> 03:39:00.000
It was a federal investment in fracking

03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:01.080
in the sixties and seventies.

03:39:01.080 --> 03:39:03.960
And then this one guy in Texas, right here in Texas

03:39:03.960 --> 03:39:08.400
George Mitchell who, you know, cobbled together technology.

03:39:08.400 --> 03:39:13.400
And that led to this real dramatic change from gas to coal

03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:16.200
that mostly played out in the Obama years

03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:17.440
but that really was stimulated

03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:22.080
by Cheney's early energy task force in 2001

03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:23.600
when they were getting in office.

03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:25.640
And also Bush did something interesting

03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:30.880
in the whole wonky climate treaty process.

03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:34.560
It was under Bush that they started to focus on sectors.

03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:37.680
Let's do a, they did a, oh, and also on big emitters.

03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:40.440
Let's, this isn't about 200 countries.

03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:43.360
It's about basically eight or 10 countries.

03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:44.680
Let's get them into a room

03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:48.320
and let's have these little sub rooms on

03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:52.080
like electrification, on mining, on whatever.

03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:54.160
And by parsing it out,

03:39:54.160 --> 03:39:55.800
and Obama picked up the same model.

03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:57.000
They had different names for it

03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.960
because presidents always name something different

03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:00.520
than the last president.

03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:02.240
One was the major economies forum

03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:05.840
and then it was the major emitters, something or other.

03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:09.520
And that getting away from the treaty dots and dashes

03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:13.360
toward just sectoral, big sectors that matter,

03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:17.760
you know, gas, electrification makes a difference.

03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:20.120
But again, you couldn't ever measure.

03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:23.000
It's always the lag time would be important.

03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:27.880
And also I think one very under reported fact,

03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:30.440
so the UNEP, the environment program,

03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:34.960
they come out with what they call a gap report every year

03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:37.440
where they estimate how much is the world doing

03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:40.360
compared to what should it or has it promised to do.

03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:41.480
Emissions gap.

03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:45.960
And in 2019, so just before COVID hit,

03:40:45.960 --> 03:40:49.240
they actually did a survey of the 2010s.

03:40:49.240 --> 03:40:52.800
So the last big sort of report on how well are we doing?

03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:54.320
And their takeaway quote,

03:40:54.320 --> 03:40:55.720
and I'm not gonna get this right,

03:40:55.720 --> 03:40:57.800
but it's pretty much what they said was,

03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:01.640
if you take the world as if we hadn't cared

03:41:01.640 --> 03:41:04.960
about climate change since 2005,

03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:09.080
we can't tell the difference between that world

03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:11.680
and the world that we're actually living in.

03:41:11.680 --> 03:41:14.120
So despite the fact that we've had 10 years

03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:18.760
of immense focus on climate and everybody talks about it

03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:19.920
and the Paris agreement,

03:41:19.920 --> 03:41:22.920
which is perhaps the biggest global sort of agreement

03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:25.920
and what we're gonna be doing, you can't actually tell.

03:41:26.880 --> 03:41:29.440
And that I think is incredibly important

03:41:29.440 --> 03:41:31.920
because what it tells you is all that we're doing

03:41:31.920 --> 03:41:35.200
is not even on the margin, it's sort of smaller than that.

03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:36.680
And I'm not sure what that is,

03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:39.120
but we're basically dealing in,

03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:41.080
for instance, the UK loves to point out

03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:43.560
that they have dramatically reduced their carbon emissions

03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:44.480
and they have,

03:41:44.480 --> 03:41:47.360
they've really dramatically lowered their emissions,

03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:50.040
but mostly because they've deindustrialized.

03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:51.080
They've basically said,

03:41:51.080 --> 03:41:53.480
look, we're just gonna be bankers for all of you guys

03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:56.360
and then everybody else is gonna produce our stuff,

03:41:56.360 --> 03:41:58.480
which of course is great for Britain,

03:41:58.480 --> 03:41:59.800
I don't know if it's great for Britain,

03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:02.320
but we can't all do that.

03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:05.600
And so most of what we're trying to do right now

03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:08.640
is sort of this virtue signaling,

03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:10.040
it makes us feel good,

03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:11.840
it's sort of, yeah, on the margin

03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:13.440
or in the very tiny margin,

03:42:13.440 --> 03:42:14.680
but what we basically,

03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:17.520
and that was Andy, your point with China,

03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:19.600
and the reason why we can't tell the difference, of course,

03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:22.920
is because China basically became the workshop for everyone.

03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:25.440
And so not only did they lift

03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:27.440
more than half a million people out of poverty,

03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:29.320
sorry, half a billion, yes,

03:42:29.320 --> 03:42:31.160
half a billion people out of poverty,

03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:34.160
but they also basically took over

03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:36.120
most production in the world.

03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:40.680
And so of course, many rich countries could decarbonize

03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:42.560
or at least reduce their carbon emissions

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:44.160
and feel very virtuous about it,

03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:45.880
but fundamentally we haven't solved

03:42:45.880 --> 03:42:47.960
how does the world do this?

03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:50.880
And that's why I think we're also left with this sense of

03:42:50.880 --> 03:42:54.760
not only are we being told this is an unmitigated catastrophe

03:42:54.760 --> 03:42:56.320
and that's why this is the only thing

03:42:56.320 --> 03:42:57.480
we should be focusing on,

03:42:57.480 --> 03:43:00.000
but also somehow, and we can all fix it.

03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:02.000
And I don't think we have any sense

03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:04.080
of how hard this is actually gonna be.

03:43:04.080 --> 03:43:06.120
And that's of course why I would go back and say,

03:43:06.120 --> 03:43:07.840
look, the only way you're gonna fix this

03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:08.720
is through innovation,

03:43:08.720 --> 03:43:10.320
because if you have something that's cheaper

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:12.200
than fossil fuels, you fixed it.

03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:15.960
If you have something that's harder and costlier

03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:19.680
and more inconvenient, no, you're just not gonna make it.

03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:23.640
And getting more time by cutting vulnerability.

03:43:23.640 --> 03:43:26.160
The pockets of vulnerability on the planet are huge

03:43:26.160 --> 03:43:28.240
and they're identifiable and you know what to do.

03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:30.520
What are the biggest pockets of vulnerability?

03:43:31.160 --> 03:43:32.560
Infrastructure of cities?

03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:33.920
No, it's where people are living

03:43:33.920 --> 03:43:36.040
and what their capacities are.

03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:38.720
So moving people, how do you decrease

03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:40.160
the vulnerability in the world?

03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:41.000
What are the big...

03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:42.000
Affordable housing.

03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:45.040
One reason so many people moved out of San Francisco

03:43:45.040 --> 03:43:47.440
and adjacent cities into the countryside

03:43:47.440 --> 03:43:49.920
and then had their houses burned down

03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:52.880
is because they can't afford to live in the city anymore.

03:43:52.880 --> 03:43:57.120
So affordable housing in cities can limit exposure to,

03:43:57.120 --> 03:43:58.640
in that case, wildfire.

03:43:58.680 --> 03:44:01.680
Durban, South Africa, that terrible devastating flood

03:44:01.680 --> 03:44:03.800
they had this year, last year.

03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:05.440
Who was washed away?

03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:07.480
Poor people who don't have any place to live.

03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:11.840
So they settle in a floodplain along a stream bed

03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:15.360
that's livable when it's not raining buckets.

03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:17.840
And those are vulnerabilities that are there

03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:21.400
because of dislocation, housing.

03:44:21.400 --> 03:44:24.800
Tacloban, this typhoon that hit the Philippines terribly

03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:27.000
ahead of the Paris talks, or was it the previous one?

03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.520
I don't know, it was in 2013, I believe.

03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:30.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:31.920
Thousands died.

03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:34.360
Most of the stories that were written

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:35.800
were framed around climate change

03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:37.520
because the Pope made a deal about it.

03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:40.120
It was just before the climate talks of that year.

03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:45.440
And what happened, partially why there were so many losses

03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:49.800
was Tacloban city had quadrupled in population

03:44:49.800 --> 03:44:50.720
in the last 30 years.

03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:52.920
And most of the people coming into the city were poor,

03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:55.760
looking for work and settling in marginal places

03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:58.160
where a storm surge killed them.

03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:02.160
So those are things we, whatever the we is

03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:04.960
in the different places, really can work on.

03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:07.040
And that gives more flex for sure.

03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:09.800
And thinking about how this long trajectory

03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:11.520
that seems so immovable and so hard,

03:45:11.520 --> 03:45:15.000
the decarbonization part, there's no excuse.

03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:18.200
I wrote a piece, I guess a year ago,

03:45:18.200 --> 03:45:20.080
I said there's a vulnerability emergency

03:45:20.080 --> 03:45:23.920
hiding behind this climate emergency label.

03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:27.440
That's really what needs work.

03:45:27.440 --> 03:45:29.800
And also on the Tacloban, I mean,

03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:32.200
the hurricane that hit in 2013,

03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:34.120
there was almost a similar hurricane

03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:37.600
in the early part of 1900s

03:45:37.600 --> 03:45:40.760
that hit pretty much the same strength

03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:42.440
and it eradicated half the city.

03:45:42.440 --> 03:45:44.400
It killed half the city.

03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:45.760
And so what's happened since then

03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:48.680
is people just got much, much richer.

03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:51.960
From early 1900 to 2013,

03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:54.360
we've just moved a lot of people out of poverty.

03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:56.880
Now, it's a lot bigger and yeah.

03:45:56.880 --> 03:45:58.560
Bangladesh is even a bigger example of that.

03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:01.280
And in the 1970s, they had horrible cyclones,

03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:02.680
one of which was the Beatles,

03:46:02.680 --> 03:46:04.920
George Harrison's concert for Bangladesh.

03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:08.080
Great album that I still have somewhere.

03:46:08.080 --> 03:46:11.120
Hundreds of thousands, he did a concert,

03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:13.400
a fundraising concert, the concert for Bangladesh

03:46:13.400 --> 03:46:16.640
after this terrible cyclone tragedy hit Bangladesh.

03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:18.560
And I think there were several hundred thousand

03:46:18.560 --> 03:46:20.000
who were killed.

03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:22.320
And a couple like that around that time.

03:46:22.320 --> 03:46:25.520
Bangladesh has been hit by comparable storms recently

03:46:25.520 --> 03:46:27.440
and it's terrible, every death is terrible,

03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:30.040
but it's like 123 deaths.

03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:31.600
And it's not just because of wealth,

03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:33.520
it's because people know what to do.

03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:35.080
It's because there's cell phones.

03:46:35.080 --> 03:46:37.400
It's because they have elevated platforms

03:46:37.400 --> 03:46:40.600
in many communities in the floodplains there

03:46:40.600 --> 03:46:41.920
that you know to get to.

03:46:41.920 --> 03:46:44.680
So they went from hundreds of thousands of deaths

03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:47.400
in a cyclone to 123.

03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:49.520
When we were working with Bangladesh,

03:46:49.520 --> 03:46:52.200
it's no longer the problem of people dying,

03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:53.840
it's the fact that their cattle die.

03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:57.840
So they want cattle places where you could herd your cattle.

03:46:57.840 --> 03:47:00.240
This is their capital and it's not to make fun of it,

03:47:00.240 --> 03:47:01.800
but it's an amazing progress

03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:04.720
that you've stopped worrying about your parents dying

03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:06.240
and you worry about your cows dying.

03:47:06.240 --> 03:47:08.040
And when I was talking about social innovation

03:47:08.040 --> 03:47:10.760
the other hour, there's a model emerging in Bangladesh

03:47:10.760 --> 03:47:14.600
for farmers to move from raising chickens, poultry to ducks.

03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:17.320
And it's working.

03:47:18.200 --> 03:47:19.880
And ducks actually fetch a higher price at the market.

03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:20.720
And guess what?

03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:24.480
When you get flooded, you can still have your income

03:47:24.480 --> 03:47:25.360
and your future.

03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:30.560
Let me ask you to give advice.

03:47:30.560 --> 03:47:35.480
Put on your Sage wise hat and give advice to young people

03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:38.840
that are looking into this world

03:47:38.840 --> 03:47:40.520
and see how they can do the most good.

03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:44.680
We talked about what is the $1 that can do

03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:47.240
the most positive improvement

03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:51.600
to lead to $40, $45 and so on.

03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:53.560
What advice would you give to young people

03:47:53.560 --> 03:47:56.080
in high school, in college,

03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:58.840
how to have a positive impact on the world,

03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:01.240
how to have a career they can be proud of,

03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:03.840
maybe ask Bjorn first and how to have a life

03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:06.120
to be, they can be proud of.

03:48:06.120 --> 03:48:09.040
So I think, and this really pretty well reflects

03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:10.720
the whole conversation we've had.

03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:14.440
We've got to sort of take the catastrophism

03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:17.840
out of the climate conversation.

03:48:17.840 --> 03:48:21.080
And this really matters because a lot of kids

03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:24.320
literally think that the world is gonna end pretty soon.

03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:27.120
And that obviously makes any other kind of plan

03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:29.960
meaningless.

03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:32.760
So first of all, look, you're not gonna die.

03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:37.000
That poster that people, a lot of kids have,

03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:38.320
you're gonna die from old age,

03:48:38.320 --> 03:48:39.520
but I'm gonna die from climate.

03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:40.840
No, you're not.

03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:42.200
You're gonna die from old age

03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:45.200
and you're gonna die much older, very likely.

03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:49.880
So the reality is the world has improved dramatically

03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:52.120
and it's very likely to improve even more.

03:48:52.120 --> 03:48:54.640
So the baseline is good.

03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:56.560
This is just the facts.

03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:00.520
Then there's still lots and lots of problems.

03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:02.520
And what you should do as a young person

03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:06.200
is stop being paralyzed by fear

03:49:06.200 --> 03:49:08.280
and then realize what you can do

03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:12.320
is basically help humanity become even smarter.

03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:14.440
There's a lot of different places you can do.

03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:15.560
I mean, the obvious thing

03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:17.320
when you're talking about climate is

03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:19.120
what if you could become the guy

03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:21.960
that develops fourth generation nuclear?

03:49:21.960 --> 03:49:24.640
It's very likely something that neither of us

03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:26.120
know anything about right now,

03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:28.360
but develop the energy source

03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:30.400
that will basically power the rest of humanity.

03:49:30.400 --> 03:49:32.120
How cool would that be?

03:49:32.120 --> 03:49:34.240
That's one of the many things you could do.

03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:36.960
But again, also remember there are lots and lots

03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:39.400
of other things that need solutions.

03:49:39.400 --> 03:49:42.720
So what about you become the guy that makes the,

03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:46.160
or the girl that makes the social innovation

03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:50.200
in Tanzania or in Kenya, sorry, in Kenya?

03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:52.680
Or what about if you become the person

03:49:52.680 --> 03:49:55.560
who finds a way that is a much cheaper,

03:49:55.560 --> 03:49:58.520
more effective way to tackle tuberculosis right now?

03:49:58.520 --> 03:50:01.040
It needs four to six months of medication.

03:50:01.040 --> 03:50:03.480
One of the big problems is once you pop the pills

03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:06.320
and you're fresh, it's really hard to get people to do it

03:50:06.320 --> 03:50:08.280
for the other five and a half months, right?

03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:09.760
And you need that.

03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:11.840
Otherwise you actually have a big risk

03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:15.920
of getting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis,

03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:18.200
which is a real scourge on the earth.

03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:20.760
So what if you develop that?

03:50:20.760 --> 03:50:24.720
So the truth is not only can your life be much better

03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:28.240
when you sort of ditch that, that doomerism,

03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:30.160
but it also becomes much more possible

03:50:30.160 --> 03:50:32.280
for you to be a positive part

03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:34.320
of making sure that you do that progress.

03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:36.480
Why has the world improved so much?

03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:39.600
Because our parents and great grandparents,

03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:41.280
they made all this work.

03:50:41.280 --> 03:50:44.560
This was all their innovations and a lot of hard work.

03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:47.280
And I'm incredibly grateful that they've done it,

03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:49.320
but now it's kind of time to pay back.

03:50:49.320 --> 03:50:53.400
So you got to do this for our grandkids.

03:50:53.400 --> 03:50:55.240
You got to make those innovations,

03:50:55.240 --> 03:50:57.840
make those policy opportunities

03:50:57.840 --> 03:51:01.000
that'll make the world an even better place.

03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:01.840
Totally.

03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:06.080
And to me, there's never been a better time

03:51:06.080 --> 03:51:08.480
to be effective as a young person

03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:11.680
because the internet connectedness.

03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:15.240
You can brainstorm with someone in another country

03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:16.560
just as easily as you can brainstorm

03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:19.240
with someone down the block when we were kids.

03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:22.040
As I said earlier with my pen pal,

03:51:22.040 --> 03:51:24.840
with letters taking weeks to come.

03:51:24.840 --> 03:51:29.640
And so the key properties, ideally,

03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:34.640
that young people would do well to cultivate are,

03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:39.800
well, certainly adaptability because change is changing.

03:51:39.800 --> 03:51:42.520
Not just, you know, the rate of change is changing.

03:51:42.520 --> 03:51:45.280
These layers of change are all piling up on each other.

03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:51.600
Having an ability to understand the information environment

03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:53.240
is a fundamental need now

03:51:53.240 --> 03:51:55.400
that wasn't a need when we were growing up.

03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:56.760
We read a few newspapers.

03:51:56.760 --> 03:51:58.920
My dad would turn on the nightly news.

03:51:58.960 --> 03:52:01.880
And Walter Cronkite would say, that's the way it is.

03:52:01.880 --> 03:52:03.880
He always said, that's the way it is.

03:52:03.880 --> 03:52:07.640
And that's so not the way the media environment is now.

03:52:07.640 --> 03:52:09.440
So courses in media literacy

03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:13.040
should be kind of fundamental parts of curriculum

03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:14.280
from like kindergarten on,

03:52:14.280 --> 03:52:16.360
or parents can do the same thing.

03:52:16.360 --> 03:52:18.520
There's a woman at URI, University of Rhode Island,

03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:21.320
Renee Hobbs who teaches a course in propaganda literacy.

03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:26.160
And she said, you know, the history of the word is not bad.

03:52:26.160 --> 03:52:27.320
Propaganda could be good.

03:52:27.320 --> 03:52:30.480
It's pro, it's for the church.

03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:32.600
She did a wonderful chat with me.

03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:34.160
She laid this out and,

03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:37.080
but understanding when it is propaganda,

03:52:37.080 --> 03:52:38.760
like the tobacco, you know,

03:52:38.760 --> 03:52:42.960
there is hopefully a difference between that and that,

03:52:42.960 --> 03:52:47.960
cigarette ads and journalistically acquired information.

03:52:48.960 --> 03:52:51.320
So key to everything Bjorn was talking about too

03:52:51.320 --> 03:52:54.040
is just understanding how to not be sucked

03:52:54.040 --> 03:52:55.520
into this information environment

03:52:55.520 --> 03:53:00.360
and spit out as a paralyzed, doomist entity.

03:53:00.360 --> 03:53:03.520
Because once you have an ability to step back,

03:53:04.480 --> 03:53:07.320
then you can use Twitter or whatever you're on

03:53:07.320 --> 03:53:10.080
to find people who might have a skillset you don't have

03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:14.200
that is something you need to do to incorporate,

03:53:14.200 --> 03:53:17.680
to harness, to do the thing you want to do in the world.

03:53:17.680 --> 03:53:19.680
Finding your way to make the world better.

03:53:19.680 --> 03:53:21.760
And it can have nothing to do with climate,

03:53:21.760 --> 03:53:24.120
but if it makes a few more people's lives better

03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:26.480
then overall you're leading toward better capacity

03:53:26.480 --> 03:53:27.480
for all this stuff.

03:53:27.480 --> 03:53:29.120
So that, and then the climate problem,

03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:31.160
the prismatic giant nature of it

03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:35.240
is what makes it so daunting,

03:53:35.240 --> 03:53:37.880
but it's also what gives everybody an opportunity.

03:53:37.880 --> 03:53:41.000
Like there's something for artists, scientists, poets,

03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:43.800
everybody needs to get into the game.

03:53:43.800 --> 03:53:46.320
I just spent some time with Kim Stanley Robinson

03:53:46.320 --> 03:53:47.840
who wrote that book, Ministry of the Future,

03:53:47.840 --> 03:53:51.160
which is this sprawling novel about a worst case,

03:53:51.160 --> 03:53:53.560
a worst case outcome where everyone in India is dying

03:53:54.360 --> 03:53:59.360
and so fiction can help experiment,

03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:02.640
different kinds of fiction, different kinds of arts

03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:05.160
can help us sort of experiment with what the future

03:54:05.160 --> 03:54:08.000
might look like in different ways and just get started.

03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:10.400
And the other thing unfortunately that's needed,

03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:13.880
I think I first said this in 2008

03:54:13.880 --> 03:54:15.640
when someone asked me something about climate,

03:54:15.640 --> 03:54:19.960
I said, weirdly you have to sort of have a sense of urgency

03:54:19.960 --> 03:54:22.480
but a sense of patience at the same time.

03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:24.440
Like just roll those words around in your mind,

03:54:24.440 --> 03:54:25.560
like what does that mean?

03:54:25.560 --> 03:54:27.880
Urgent and patient, how could that possibly be?

03:54:28.960 --> 03:54:32.400
But actually it really is the reality.

03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:34.560
There is an urgency with this building gas

03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:37.000
that's cumulative, that doesn't go away like smoke

03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:39.160
when it rains.

03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:42.960
And every year that happens, it's adding to risk.

03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:46.360
And you can kind of wake up completely freaked out urgent,

03:54:46.360 --> 03:54:49.200
but when you realize energy transitions take time,

03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:50.800
then you have to sort of find patience

03:54:51.200 --> 03:54:53.320
whatever your word is for that.

03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:55.360
Yeah, I think you have to oscillate back and forth

03:54:55.360 --> 03:54:56.640
throughout the day.

03:54:56.640 --> 03:54:59.160
Having a sense of urgency when you're trying to

03:54:59.160 --> 03:55:02.040
actually be productive and have patience

03:55:02.040 --> 03:55:03.760
so you can have a calm head about you

03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:06.560
in terms of putting everything into perspective.

03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:10.400
And like you said with information, that is interesting,

03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:11.840
especially in the scientific community,

03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:13.880
I think you've spoken about this before,

03:55:15.160 --> 03:55:16.640
that there is some responsibility

03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:19.280
or at least an opportunity for scientists

03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:22.200
to not just do science, but to understand the dynamics

03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:25.760
of the different mediums in which information is exchanged.

03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:28.000
So it could be Twitter for a few years,

03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:31.280
then it could be TikTok, then it could be,

03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:33.520
I'm a huge believer in the power of YouTube

03:55:35.200 --> 03:55:39.000
over the next several years, perhaps decades.

03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:42.360
I mean, it's a very interesting medium for education

03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:46.640
and communication and for debate and that's grassroots,

03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:48.720
that's from like the bottom up.

03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:52.440
That every scientist is able to communicate their work

03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:55.040
and I personally believe have the responsibility

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:56.360
to communicate their work.

03:55:57.280 --> 03:55:59.520
If anything, the internet made me realize

03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:04.720
that science is not just about doing the science,

03:56:04.720 --> 03:56:06.200
it's about communicating it.

03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:11.440
Like this is not some kind of virtue signaling on my part.

03:56:11.440 --> 03:56:12.280
No, no, no.

03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:15.760
No, like I feel like if the tree falls in the forest

03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:17.600
and nobody's around to hear it,

03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:19.480
it really didn't fall.

03:56:19.480 --> 03:56:22.640
Like that's not, there should be a culture of,

03:56:23.720 --> 03:56:27.960
wherever at MIT, there's a place called the Media Lab.

03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:28.800
Yes, sir.

03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:31.200
Where they really emphasize,

03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:35.080
like you always be able to demo something,

03:56:35.080 --> 03:56:36.000
to show off your work,

03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:37.800
they really emphasize showing off their work.

03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:41.080
And I think that was in some part criticized

03:56:41.080 --> 03:56:42.800
in the bigger MIT culture that,

03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:47.400
that's like being focusing too much on the PR

03:56:48.200 --> 03:56:49.040
versus doing the science.

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:50.600
But I really disagree with that.

03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:52.600
Of course, there's a balance to strike.

03:56:52.600 --> 03:56:54.320
You don't want to be all smoke and mirrors,

03:56:54.320 --> 03:56:57.880
but there really is a lot of value to communication

03:56:57.880 --> 03:57:01.840
and not just sort of some broad,

03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:04.480
you almost don't wanna teach a course on communication

03:57:04.480 --> 03:57:05.960
because by the time you teach the course,

03:57:05.960 --> 03:57:06.800
it's already too late.

03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:10.960
It's always being on top of how,

03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:12.120
what is the language?

03:57:12.120 --> 03:57:13.960
What is the culture and the etiquette?

03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:17.680
What is the technology of communication that is effective?

03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:18.520
Yeah.

03:57:18.520 --> 03:57:20.720
I actually had a big conversation about that

03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:23.000
in my university because I think,

03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:26.240
and this is perhaps especially true for social sciences,

03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:28.520
but I think it's probably true for everyone.

03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:30.960
Just simply communicating what it is you've done

03:57:30.960 --> 03:57:32.960
in research makes it possible for you

03:57:32.960 --> 03:57:35.320
to sort of get an outsider's perspective and see,

03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:39.120
did I just go into an incredibly deep hole

03:57:39.120 --> 03:57:42.240
that just three other people really care about in the world?

03:57:42.240 --> 03:57:44.800
Or is this actually something that matters to the world?

03:57:44.800 --> 03:57:47.720
And being able to explain what it is that you've done

03:57:47.720 --> 03:57:51.760
to everyone else makes my sort of senses,

03:57:51.760 --> 03:57:53.480
if you can't say it in a couple of minutes,

03:57:53.480 --> 03:57:56.400
it's probably, it's not necessarily true,

03:57:56.400 --> 03:57:59.040
but it's probably because it wasn't all that important.

03:57:59.040 --> 03:58:03.320
There was a hashtag generated maybe seven years ago

03:58:03.320 --> 03:58:06.840
by a Caltech PhD candidate woman,

03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:09.640
and it was fantastic.

03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:13.040
The hashtag was, I am a scientist because,

03:58:13.040 --> 03:58:14.840
and she posted it with a picture of herself

03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:16.960
with her answer, you know.

03:58:16.960 --> 03:58:19.080
And that, when I talked to scientists,

03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:21.640
or basically anybody about communicating,

03:58:21.640 --> 03:58:26.640
I said, don't start with, I am a phytologist,

03:58:27.080 --> 03:58:30.760
and I use a spectrophotometer to do X.

03:58:30.760 --> 03:58:34.080
Start with, I'm a scientist because

03:58:34.080 --> 03:58:36.080
the world is endlessly interesting,

03:58:36.080 --> 03:58:39.400
and I just found these salamanders,

03:58:40.040 --> 03:58:42.680
which are gonna vanish if we don't stop this fungus

03:58:42.680 --> 03:58:44.080
from coming to the United States.

03:58:44.080 --> 03:58:45.280
Utterly interesting.

03:58:45.280 --> 03:58:47.640
And then you've got people hooked.

03:58:47.640 --> 03:58:49.040
But it's the motivation part,

03:58:49.040 --> 03:58:50.720
because everyone grew up as a kid,

03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:52.240
and a kid is basically like a scientist.

03:58:52.240 --> 03:58:53.280
Wow, what the hell is this?

03:58:53.280 --> 03:58:54.520
How does this work?

03:58:54.520 --> 03:58:56.800
So you can connect with people that way.

03:58:56.800 --> 03:58:59.440
But this other issue you broached is really important.

03:58:59.440 --> 03:59:02.000
And what I love about MIT particularly,

03:59:02.000 --> 03:59:04.040
I spent a lot of time there over the decades,

03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:06.560
not just talking to the hurricane guy.

03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:08.360
Amy Smith, who's the development lab

03:59:08.400 --> 03:59:09.600
in the basement there somewhere.

03:59:09.600 --> 03:59:10.440
Most of them.

03:59:10.440 --> 03:59:11.920
My team looks like it's the basement.

03:59:11.920 --> 03:59:14.640
Yeah, it's sort of like they're part of the charm.

03:59:14.640 --> 03:59:16.520
But it's a usability function

03:59:16.520 --> 03:59:18.800
is part of a lot of that goes on there.

03:59:18.800 --> 03:59:20.360
It's engineering and science.

03:59:20.360 --> 03:59:23.760
And it reminds me of 1997,

03:59:23.760 --> 03:59:25.800
these two very different scientists,

03:59:25.800 --> 03:59:28.680
Dan Kamen at Berkeley and Michael Dove at Yale,

03:59:29.760 --> 03:59:31.240
wrote a manifesto,

03:59:31.240 --> 03:59:35.160
and it was the virtues of mundane science.

03:59:35.160 --> 03:59:36.200
That's what they called it.

03:59:36.200 --> 03:59:37.880
It was a prod to the scientific community

03:59:38.480 --> 03:59:41.040
actually, it's about useful utility.

03:59:41.040 --> 03:59:44.520
Because the whole arena is set up to advance your career

03:59:44.520 --> 03:59:47.520
through revealing new knowledge

03:59:47.520 --> 03:59:49.200
that will get you tenure someday.

03:59:49.200 --> 03:59:53.960
And actually doing useful science is disincentivized,

03:59:53.960 --> 03:59:54.800
having a conversation,

03:59:54.800 --> 03:59:58.760
and especially if it involves more than one discipline.

03:59:58.760 --> 04:00:00.200
Because as a young scientist,

04:00:01.480 --> 04:00:04.040
there were some post-docs at Columbia

04:00:04.040 --> 04:00:06.320
wrote this other manifesto paper saying,

04:00:06.480 --> 04:00:09.360
here are the things universities need to do

04:00:09.360 --> 04:00:11.800
to foster the collaborative capacity we need

04:00:11.800 --> 04:00:14.240
to have sustainable development.

04:00:14.240 --> 04:00:15.600
And it was like four or five things

04:00:15.600 --> 04:00:17.000
that universities don't do.

04:00:17.880 --> 04:00:19.920
Give you time to become fluent

04:00:19.920 --> 04:00:24.920
and for a physicist to talk to an anthropologist

04:00:25.040 --> 04:00:28.160
and understand how anthropology works or sociology,

04:00:28.160 --> 04:00:29.000
takes time.

04:00:29.000 --> 04:00:30.680
And then building a relationship with a community

04:00:30.680 --> 04:00:34.040
that has a problem that you wanna fix takes time.

04:00:34.440 --> 04:00:37.400
So you do these like quick turnaround papers

04:00:37.400 --> 04:00:40.400
that get you toward your little micro career goal,

04:00:40.400 --> 04:00:41.920
but they're not actually getting you

04:00:41.920 --> 04:00:43.680
what you want in the world.

04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:45.480
Those are really hard problems going forward.

04:00:45.480 --> 04:00:47.560
But starting with that idea of usability,

04:00:48.520 --> 04:00:49.640
what can I do with my skill sets?

04:00:49.640 --> 04:00:51.160
You know, a lot of great physicists I know

04:00:51.160 --> 04:00:53.640
are dug in on string theory and stuff.

04:00:53.640 --> 04:00:55.720
And someone has to dig in on that too,

04:00:55.720 --> 04:00:57.280
but I'd like to have them pull a little bit

04:00:57.280 --> 04:00:59.640
of their brain power away to think about

04:00:59.640 --> 04:01:02.440
some of the practical things beyond things about too.

04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:06.600
The two of you have been thinking about

04:01:06.600 --> 04:01:08.680
some of the biggest questions,

04:01:08.680 --> 04:01:11.400
which is life here on earth,

04:01:11.400 --> 04:01:12.560
the history of life here,

04:01:12.560 --> 04:01:15.000
the future of life here on earth,

04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:17.240
of earth itself,

04:01:17.240 --> 04:01:21.080
and how to allocate our resources

04:01:21.080 --> 04:01:23.280
to alleviate suffering in the world.

04:01:23.280 --> 04:01:24.960
So let me ask the big question.

04:01:24.960 --> 04:01:27.960
What do you think is the why of it all?

04:01:27.960 --> 04:01:29.320
What's the meaning of it?

04:01:29.320 --> 04:01:31.560
What's the meaning of our life here on earth?

04:01:32.640 --> 04:01:37.640
You waited till the last moment to ask us that question.

04:01:37.840 --> 04:01:42.840
Yes, in case I can trick you into finding an answer.

04:01:46.240 --> 04:01:47.800
Well, so, I mean, again,

04:01:47.800 --> 04:01:49.720
I'm just gonna take a stab in this

04:01:49.720 --> 04:01:52.080
because I think in some ways

04:01:52.080 --> 04:01:55.600
it's the same thing that you were talking about before.

04:01:55.600 --> 04:01:58.560
It's not about getting everybody sort of in the same track

04:01:58.560 --> 04:02:00.440
and all agree on something,

04:02:00.440 --> 04:02:02.240
but it's about getting a lot of people

04:02:03.040 --> 04:02:05.400
with very different goals and targets

04:02:05.400 --> 04:02:07.560
and ways of thinking about the world

04:02:07.560 --> 04:02:09.520
to go in the same direction.

04:02:09.520 --> 04:02:13.280
So for me, the goal of life,

04:02:13.280 --> 04:02:16.680
certainly my goal, but I think for most people,

04:02:16.680 --> 04:02:18.640
is to make the world a better place.

04:02:18.640 --> 04:02:21.120
It sounds incredibly pedestrian

04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:22.800
because it's become so overused,

04:02:22.800 --> 04:02:25.520
but that really and literally is the point.

04:02:25.520 --> 04:02:27.840
You know, your point of your life is to,

04:02:27.840 --> 04:02:31.160
you know, when one of your friends is sad

04:02:31.160 --> 04:02:33.080
to make sure that they sort of get out of that

04:02:33.080 --> 04:02:35.120
and find out why they're sad

04:02:35.120 --> 04:02:37.280
and maybe move them a little bit in the right direction

04:02:37.280 --> 04:02:40.680
and all the things that we've talked about,

04:02:40.680 --> 04:02:43.120
stop people from dying from tuberculosis

04:02:43.120 --> 04:02:46.120
and live longer lives and fix climate change,

04:02:46.120 --> 04:02:48.480
but fix it in such a way

04:02:48.480 --> 04:02:50.840
that we actually use resources smartest

04:02:50.840 --> 04:02:52.120
because there are lots of problems.

04:02:52.120 --> 04:02:55.960
So let's make sure we deal with them adequately.

04:02:55.960 --> 04:02:59.600
This is very unsexy in some sense,

04:02:59.640 --> 04:03:01.360
but I think it's also very basic

04:03:01.360 --> 04:03:03.400
and really what matters.

04:03:03.400 --> 04:03:08.400
Well, you know, biologically, evolution has demanded

04:03:09.320 --> 04:03:12.800
that life is about finding sources of energy

04:03:12.800 --> 04:03:14.800
and perpetuating yourself, right?

04:03:14.800 --> 04:03:15.960
So that's the baseline.

04:03:17.120 --> 04:03:19.560
And that's led us into a bit of a bollocks

04:03:19.560 --> 04:03:22.480
because we have this easy energy

04:03:22.480 --> 04:03:24.120
that's come from the ground so far.

04:03:24.120 --> 04:03:29.120
And, but our brilliance has given this larger awareness

04:03:30.840 --> 04:03:35.320
of everything about the planet is transitory.

04:03:35.320 --> 04:03:39.160
And so, well, how do you work with that productively

04:03:39.160 --> 04:03:41.080
is really an important question.

04:03:41.080 --> 04:03:43.200
I could just sort of, you know,

04:03:43.200 --> 04:03:44.400
try to be as rich as possible

04:03:44.400 --> 04:03:46.480
and use as much energy as possible

04:03:46.480 --> 04:03:50.160
and have other people, I mean, Alex Epstein,

04:03:50.160 --> 04:03:51.600
I think, again, this is one of the constraints

04:03:51.640 --> 04:03:53.920
and my support for what he says is,

04:03:53.920 --> 04:03:58.440
he's just talking about growth and progress in that sense,

04:03:58.440 --> 04:04:00.280
but there are consequences

04:04:00.280 --> 04:04:02.080
and there are long-term trajectories here

04:04:02.080 --> 04:04:04.440
that have to be taken into account too.

04:04:04.440 --> 04:04:07.040
So what do you wake up to do?

04:04:07.040 --> 04:04:10.320
To me, it's finding your part of this.

04:04:10.320 --> 04:04:14.600
And as Bjorn said, finding a way to pursue

04:04:14.600 --> 04:04:16.560
and expand betterment.

04:04:16.560 --> 04:04:19.480
When I taught, I was at Pace University for six years

04:04:20.480 --> 04:04:22.040
and one of the courses I launched there

04:04:22.040 --> 04:04:23.840
was called Blogging a Better Planet.

04:04:25.120 --> 04:04:27.440
And it was for grad students, mostly in communication.

04:04:27.440 --> 04:04:29.880
It wasn't an environment, it wasn't like better planet,

04:04:29.880 --> 04:04:31.840
like save the climate.

04:04:31.840 --> 04:04:33.840
But my task for the students was to blog

04:04:33.840 --> 04:04:36.000
about something they're passionate about, first of all,

04:04:36.000 --> 04:04:36.840
because you can't do this

04:04:36.840 --> 04:04:38.600
just like you can't do your conversations

04:04:38.600 --> 04:04:39.640
if you don't wake up in the morning

04:04:39.640 --> 04:04:41.600
wanting to do what you're doing, right?

04:04:41.600 --> 04:04:42.680
You're doing this.

04:04:42.680 --> 04:04:44.480
I used to call myself a selfish blogger

04:04:44.480 --> 04:04:45.680
because I was learning every day.

04:04:45.680 --> 04:04:46.840
I still am.

04:04:46.840 --> 04:04:47.680
I loved this.

04:04:48.600 --> 04:04:51.440
My wife laughs, she thinks I work too much,

04:04:51.440 --> 04:04:55.280
but I'm always asking those questions, like, sustain what?

04:04:55.280 --> 04:04:59.160
So my charge to the students was harness a passion,

04:04:59.160 --> 04:05:01.840
build a blog, either alone or with others

04:05:02.760 --> 04:05:05.360
that notches the world a little bit

04:05:05.360 --> 04:05:07.160
towards some better outcome.

04:05:07.160 --> 04:05:10.160
And so there was a musician who did a thing on music,

04:05:10.160 --> 04:05:12.720
musicians who use their art for their work

04:05:12.720 --> 04:05:14.360
for making the world better.

04:05:14.360 --> 04:05:16.640
Some of it was like music therapy,

04:05:16.680 --> 04:05:18.600
bands, contributing money, whatever.

04:05:18.600 --> 04:05:22.000
Another one did, her blog was on comfort food

04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:22.920
all around the world.

04:05:22.920 --> 04:05:25.480
And I thought it was my favorite, it was a video.

04:05:25.480 --> 04:05:27.880
I think it should be viral actually.

04:05:27.880 --> 04:05:30.040
It was like looking at the world,

04:05:30.040 --> 04:05:33.040
every different cultures, she was in Queens.

04:05:33.040 --> 04:05:36.280
So every culture, every cuisine is there in Queens,

04:05:36.280 --> 04:05:38.160
200 countries, right?

04:05:38.160 --> 04:05:39.520
But she would go and talk to people's moms

04:05:39.520 --> 04:05:41.360
and have them cook the food of that country

04:05:41.360 --> 04:05:42.480
that's their comfort food.

04:05:42.480 --> 04:05:45.200
I mean, I just love this because we all need to eat

04:05:45.200 --> 04:05:49.120
and you're getting this expanded sense of what comfort is

04:05:49.120 --> 04:05:52.120
by thinking about what other cultures choose.

04:05:52.120 --> 04:05:54.320
And that felt like a great course

04:05:54.320 --> 04:05:55.840
because it was not directive.

04:05:55.840 --> 04:05:59.320
It was just, it gave them this potential to go forward.

04:05:59.320 --> 04:06:02.200
I'd love to think they've all gone on to become superstar,

04:06:02.200 --> 04:06:03.600
whatever is, I don't know.

04:06:03.600 --> 04:06:06.360
That's the giving, that's the letting go part.

04:06:06.360 --> 04:06:08.680
Even if one did something special,

04:06:08.680 --> 04:06:10.440
then that makes me feel job done.

04:06:11.360 --> 04:06:15.560
And after I'd been writing about climate for 30 years,

04:06:15.560 --> 04:06:20.160
2016-ish, I did a lot of writing about

04:06:20.160 --> 04:06:22.200
what did I learn, unlearn and stuff.

04:06:22.200 --> 04:06:26.160
And I had had a stroke in 2011, which was interesting.

04:06:26.160 --> 04:06:29.120
It was the first time I really thought about my brain.

04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:32.840
You don't think about your brain on a day-to-day basis,

04:06:32.840 --> 04:06:34.680
but this is my brain telling me,

04:06:34.680 --> 04:06:37.960
ding, ding, ding, ding, some weird shit's happening.

04:06:37.960 --> 04:06:39.960
And when I was thinking about climate

04:06:39.960 --> 04:06:40.920
or confronting climate change,

04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:42.440
it felt like some of the things I learned

04:06:42.440 --> 04:06:45.720
about my own existence, I'm gonna die,

04:06:45.720 --> 04:06:47.960
but you don't really absorb that.

04:06:47.960 --> 04:06:51.120
Is that the first time you kind of faced your mortality?

04:06:51.120 --> 04:06:53.400
Yeah, this is really the shit,

04:06:53.400 --> 04:06:55.520
or at least deep disability, if not death,

04:06:55.520 --> 04:06:59.800
and that ability is transitory.

04:06:59.800 --> 04:07:01.840
And I thought about the climate problem.

04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.800
We're not gonna solve the global warming problem,

04:07:03.800 --> 04:07:05.480
at least not in our lifetimes,

04:07:05.480 --> 04:07:10.480
but you work on making those trajectories sustainable,

04:07:11.640 --> 04:07:13.400
the end of life, particularly.

04:07:13.400 --> 04:07:16.440
You work on making sure other people don't get strokes

04:07:16.440 --> 04:07:17.280
if they can avoid it.

04:07:17.280 --> 04:07:18.840
In my case, I wrote about it.

04:07:18.840 --> 04:07:21.760
I was blogging about my stroke while I was having it.

04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:22.760
I was tweeting about it.

04:07:22.760 --> 04:07:25.400
There's a funny tweet that's kind of mistyped

04:07:25.400 --> 04:07:27.440
because things weren't working.

04:07:27.440 --> 04:07:28.920
Wow, co-pipi?

04:07:28.920 --> 04:07:31.440
Yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

04:07:31.440 --> 04:07:34.360
So that's like share your knowledge, share your learning.

04:07:34.360 --> 04:07:37.600
And everyone can do this now on whatever platform.

04:07:37.600 --> 04:07:41.600
And then there's also this giving up part,

04:07:41.600 --> 04:07:44.240
but not in a depressing, well,

04:07:44.240 --> 04:07:45.720
maybe you could call it depressing.

04:07:45.720 --> 04:07:47.880
I started to zoom in years ago

04:07:47.880 --> 04:07:50.880
on the idea of the serenity prayer, the sobriety thing.

04:07:50.880 --> 04:07:54.080
It's like know what you can change, know what you can't.

04:07:54.080 --> 04:07:56.440
Grant me the serenity to accept the things

04:07:56.440 --> 04:07:59.120
that cannot change, the courage to change the things

04:07:59.120 --> 04:08:02.480
that can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

04:08:02.480 --> 04:08:04.560
Yeah, see those three properties

04:08:04.560 --> 04:08:06.560
are really important right now.

04:08:06.560 --> 04:08:08.840
Some aspects of this, we know absolutely

04:08:08.840 --> 04:08:11.560
what we can work on, cutting vulnerability,

04:08:11.560 --> 04:08:13.560
energy transitions take time.

04:08:13.560 --> 04:08:16.800
Science can help us discriminate the difference.

04:08:17.680 --> 04:08:21.320
And that's an iterative changing landscape going forward.

04:08:22.400 --> 04:08:26.440
But at the same time, science,

04:08:26.440 --> 04:08:28.760
like I personally on climate modeling

04:08:28.760 --> 04:08:31.720
or like narrowing how hot it's gonna get

04:08:32.080 --> 04:08:36.000
or more clarity on when an ice sheet is gonna collapse.

04:08:36.000 --> 04:08:38.040
I think those are what I call known unknowables.

04:08:38.040 --> 04:08:41.360
So being able to, I've seen enough evidence

04:08:41.360 --> 04:08:44.200
that those are deeply complex problems

04:08:44.200 --> 04:08:45.600
that we're not gonna get there quickly.

04:08:45.600 --> 04:08:47.960
So then that gives you a landscape to act on.

04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:51.920
And that, whether you bring God into the mix is irrelevant.

04:08:51.920 --> 04:08:55.160
It's really know what you can change, know what you can't.

04:08:55.160 --> 04:08:58.480
And know that gives you the quality to work on them.

04:08:58.480 --> 04:09:03.240
And serenity is comfort with that this is transitory

04:09:03.240 --> 04:09:08.240
that the human journey like anyone's individual journey

04:09:09.640 --> 04:09:11.560
will have some end.

04:09:11.560 --> 04:09:13.720
That doesn't mean it has to be near.

04:09:13.720 --> 04:09:15.320
This Anthropocene that I've been writing

04:09:15.320 --> 04:09:20.320
about for decades can still be a good Anthropocene

04:09:20.640 --> 04:09:23.840
or at least a less bad one in terms of how we get through it.

04:09:23.840 --> 04:09:25.800
And you're also a musician.

04:09:25.800 --> 04:09:29.960
So in context, one of my favorite songs of yours,

04:09:29.960 --> 04:09:32.960
an album, A Very Fine Line.

04:09:32.960 --> 04:09:37.320
I should mention that with the stroke coming close to death,

04:09:37.320 --> 04:09:40.560
the lyrics here are quite brilliant, I have to say.

04:09:40.560 --> 04:09:43.960
It's a very fine line between winning and losing.

04:09:43.960 --> 04:09:46.320
A very fine line between living and dying.

04:09:46.320 --> 04:09:48.920
A very fine line, by the way, people should listen to this.

04:09:48.920 --> 04:09:52.440
I can't play this because YouTube will give me trouble.

04:09:52.440 --> 04:09:55.560
A very fine line between loving and leaving.

04:09:56.520 --> 04:09:58.920
Most of your life you spend walking a very fine line

04:09:58.920 --> 04:10:01.960
and the rest of the lyrics are just quite brilliant.

04:10:01.960 --> 04:10:03.320
It is a fine line.

04:10:04.200 --> 04:10:06.840
I'm glad you walked it with me today, gentlemen.

04:10:06.840 --> 04:10:10.840
You're brilliant, kind, beautiful human beings.

04:10:10.840 --> 04:10:13.600
Thank you so much for having this quote unquote debate

04:10:13.600 --> 04:10:16.880
that was much more about just exploring ideas together.

04:10:16.880 --> 04:10:18.760
Bjorn, thank you so much.

04:10:18.760 --> 04:10:21.800
And Andy, thank you so much for talking today.

04:10:21.800 --> 04:10:25.800
These kinds of extended conversations,

04:10:25.800 --> 04:10:27.080
the more of it, the better.

04:10:27.080 --> 04:10:31.480
And finding ways to spread that capacity

04:10:31.480 --> 04:10:33.640
just to get people out of this win-lose thing

04:10:33.640 --> 04:10:36.640
is really important, so thanks for what you're doing.
