00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
When we're beyond good and evil, you know,

00:01.800 --> 00:03.900
and all that's left is the will to power,

00:04.800 --> 00:07.880
then why are we surprised that the powerful rise

00:07.880 --> 00:10.900
and that they use the power less for their purposes?

00:10.900 --> 00:13.780
When we forget ideas like equality and rights,

00:13.780 --> 00:15.040
which are grounded in God,

00:15.040 --> 00:18.040
why are we surprised that death camps follow?

00:20.520 --> 00:24.080
The following is a conversation with Bishop Robert Barron,

00:24.080 --> 00:26.120
founder of Word on Fire

00:26.120 --> 00:29.240
and one of the greatest educators in the world

00:29.280 --> 00:33.160
on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism, Christianity,

00:33.160 --> 00:35.680
and religious faith in general.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.800

00:41.200 --> 00:44.660
And now, dear friends, here's Bishop Robert Barron.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.600
Let's start with the big question.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.040
Who is God?

00:50.040 --> 00:52.480
According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,

00:52.480 --> 00:53.440
who's God?

00:53.440 --> 00:55.360
I'll give you Thomas Aquinas' definition.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.900
God is ipsum, essay, subsistence.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.460
God is the subsistent act of to be itself.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.180
Another way to state that in Aquinas

01:03.180 --> 01:06.940
is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,

01:06.940 --> 01:09.820
in which essence and existence coincide.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.300
To be God is to be to be.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.500
Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.580
They are kind of nomic, and that's on purpose.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.420
There's almost a Zen koan kind of equality

01:20.420 --> 01:22.680
about the way we talk about God.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.860
I'm saying something that's substantive,

01:25.860 --> 01:28.100
but it's more in like a via negativa mode.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.380
It's more like what God is not,

01:29.380 --> 01:31.660
because there's nothing in the world

01:31.660 --> 01:33.900
that would correspond to those descriptions.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.880
So anything in the world would be a being of some type

01:36.880 --> 01:41.260
or an event of some type, some particular mode of existence.

01:41.260 --> 01:45.060
And God is not an entity in the world.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.820
I would say that's the fundamental mistake

01:46.820 --> 01:49.540
that atheists old and new make all the time,

01:49.540 --> 01:53.940
is they think of God as a big being.

01:53.940 --> 01:57.500
When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,

01:57.500 --> 01:59.180
even the genus of being,

01:59.180 --> 02:01.340
it's one of the strangest remarks in the whole tradition,

02:01.340 --> 02:02.660
but it's really interesting.

02:02.660 --> 02:03.900
So you say, well, at the very least,

02:03.900 --> 02:05.220
God must be a being, right?

02:05.220 --> 02:09.120
And Aquinas' answer is no, he's not in the genus of being.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.540
So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.340
To say in God essence and existence coincide

02:15.340 --> 02:18.500
is to say God's very nature is to be.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.780
And that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.700
So what I'm doing there is I'm gesturing

02:23.700 --> 02:26.160
the way the tradition does toward God,

02:26.160 --> 02:29.380
using language that's at the same time

02:29.380 --> 02:32.360
philosophically precise and nomic.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.420
It's both accurate, it's true.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.740
God, essence and existence coincide.

02:36.740 --> 02:40.820
What God is is the same as God's active to be.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.340
But now what does that mean?

02:42.340 --> 02:45.220
I'm not quite sure because nothing in our ordinary experience

02:45.220 --> 02:46.840
corresponds to that.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.320
Everything in our experience is a being of some type.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.000
So it's existence received according

02:53.000 --> 02:55.280
to the mode of some essence.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.460
That's not true of God,

02:58.480 --> 03:00.220
which is why you can't be found in the world.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.240
And that's, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,

03:04.240 --> 03:06.680
oh, I guess theists are those that believe there's this

03:06.680 --> 03:09.180
being alongside the other beings in the universe.

03:09.180 --> 03:12.360
And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.840
And that's precisely wrong.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.280
That's just a category error.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.280
Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell

03:21.120 --> 03:22.800
to the effect that proving the non-existence of God

03:22.800 --> 03:26.200
is a bit like proving the non-existence of a China teapot

03:26.200 --> 03:28.680
orbiting between Earth and Mars.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.540
No, that's precisely what God is not.

03:31.540 --> 03:35.360
Some entity that's sort of hidden among the other entities

03:35.360 --> 03:36.960
of the universe.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.160
God is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.600
That's the way to put it.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.840
In more theological language,

03:43.840 --> 03:45.880
God's the creator of all things.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.920
So if God is outside of our world,

03:48.920 --> 03:51.640
is it possible for us to visualize,

03:51.640 --> 03:54.460
to comprehend, to know God?

03:54.460 --> 03:55.800
Not utterly, of course.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.840
And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,

03:58.840 --> 04:00.460
begins in ordinary experience.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.200
But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.140
through philosophical reasoning,

04:05.140 --> 04:08.360
can come to some knowledge of a reality

04:08.360 --> 04:10.600
which is transcendent to our experience.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.620
So we gesture toward it.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.200
I always like Aquinas who says the language about God

04:15.200 --> 04:17.160
that we use is analogical.

04:17.160 --> 04:21.400
So it's not univocal, meaning what I say about that can

04:21.400 --> 04:23.600
or about this bottle, I can say about God.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.560
No, that makes God an entity.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.420
At the same time, it's not simply equivocal.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.600
So if I say, well, that thing is and God is,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.420
I mean totally different things.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.040
No, no, I mean something analogous.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.280
So to be God is to be to be.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.160
So the real meaning of being is the being of God.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.420
The being of that thing or this thing

04:44.420 --> 04:47.660
or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles

04:47.660 --> 04:50.600
would be analogous to God's manner of being.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.460
So on that basis, I can make some statements.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.140
I can theorize and even at the limit,

04:57.140 --> 04:59.320
as you suggest, I can visualize.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.180
So we have metaphors for God

05:01.180 --> 05:04.300
and the Bible is replete with those, right?

05:04.300 --> 05:07.460
So God is a rock, you know, God's like a lion,

05:07.460 --> 05:09.140
God's like this and that.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.220
The Bible will sometimes imagine God

05:11.220 --> 05:14.020
as a human being walking around, you know.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.980
Now only the crudest fundamentalism would say,

05:15.980 --> 05:20.180
well, that's a univocal, accurate description of God.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.460
It's an image that's catching something

05:22.460 --> 05:23.900
of God's manner of being.

05:25.180 --> 05:30.180
Then what does it mean to believe in God?

05:31.260 --> 05:34.460
So there's a word and we have to limit ourselves

05:34.460 --> 05:37.300
to human interpretable words today.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.420
There's a word called faith.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.940
What does faith mean?

05:40.940 --> 05:44.780
So if we can't really directly know God,

05:45.660 --> 05:50.060
you kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.940
Better he sneaks up on us

05:51.940 --> 05:53.780
because I like the language of grace.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.900
God's action comes first.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.540
So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I'm seeking

06:00.540 --> 06:04.660
with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,

06:04.660 --> 06:06.180
I'm not gonna find God that way.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.740
I might find a path that opens up,

06:09.740 --> 06:12.140
but I would say finally God finds me.

06:12.140 --> 06:14.020
And I think then the language of faith

06:14.020 --> 06:15.260
begins to make more sense.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.860
I'm with Paul Tillich though, the Protestant theologian,

06:18.860 --> 06:20.660
said the most misunderstood word

06:20.660 --> 06:22.900
in the religious vocabulary is faith

06:22.900 --> 06:24.460
because he said the way we take it

06:24.460 --> 06:26.780
usually is something subrational.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.340
You know, I have proof of this.

06:29.340 --> 06:32.380
I really know this and I only kind of believe that.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.940
Like that's just a personal opinion or impression.

06:35.940 --> 06:38.460
But that's to identify faith

06:38.460 --> 06:40.220
with the kind of infra-rational.

06:40.220 --> 06:41.780
And that's not it.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.540
I mean, I don't want something infra-rational.

06:43.540 --> 06:47.340
I don't want superstition or childish credulity.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.540
So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason

06:51.540 --> 06:52.900
and on the far side of reason.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.860
It's super irrational, not infra-rational.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.100
And that's a very important move.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.980
At the limit of what I can know,

06:59.980 --> 07:02.540
at the limit of my striving and my vision,

07:02.540 --> 07:04.940
there's this horizon that opens up.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.140
And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.580
There's kind of a horizon that lures us beyond what I've got.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.340
Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness

07:14.340 --> 07:16.900
rather than a darkness prior to reason.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.940
The darkness beyond the horizon prior to reason.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.380
First of all, the poetry or your language is incredible.

07:24.380 --> 07:27.260
To be to be, I have a million questions.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.500
Yeah, go ahead.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.100
I do too.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.380
So first of all, let me just jump around.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.740
You mentioned to be to be a few times.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.300
What does that mean?

07:36.300 --> 07:39.620
Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.660
To be this is to be a table, to be this is to be a microphone.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.940
So I'll use Aquinas' language.

07:43.940 --> 07:47.380
It's the act of being poured, if you want,

07:47.380 --> 07:50.140
into the receptacle of some essential principle.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.380
So it's got a ontological structure.

07:52.380 --> 07:56.620
It's an existent, it's a thing that exists,

07:56.620 --> 07:59.300
but it's existing in a limited way

07:59.300 --> 08:01.060
according to essential principle.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.900
God, well, what's God?

08:04.900 --> 08:05.740
What's God's name?

08:05.740 --> 08:06.900
What kind of being is he?

08:07.900 --> 08:09.620
We'll go back to Moses now.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.140
When the Israelites ask me, what's your name?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.220
What should I tell them?

08:14.220 --> 08:17.140
And he says, famously, I am who I am.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.660
But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.060
So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods

08:24.060 --> 08:25.740
and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities.

08:25.740 --> 08:26.580
Which one are you?

08:26.580 --> 08:27.500
You gotta be one of them.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.260
So tell me your name.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.260
In philosophical language, give me the essence

08:31.260 --> 08:34.460
that receives your act of existing, right?

08:34.460 --> 08:37.340
And God's answer blows the mind of Moses

08:37.340 --> 08:38.180
and the whole tradition.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.020
I am who I am.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.860
To be God is to be.

08:43.420 --> 08:44.540
So I'm not this or that.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.380
I'm not up or down.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.740
I'm not here or there.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.460
God is that whose center is everywhere

08:48.460 --> 08:51.660
and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.500
Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.820
No, and in a way, that's the whole point.

08:56.820 --> 09:00.140
If I could, I'd be talking about a being of some kind.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.540
So to be God is to be to be is to,

09:02.540 --> 09:04.740
and that's, you know, Moses, take off your sandals.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.100
You're on holy ground.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.380
So I'm gonna go over confidently

09:07.380 --> 09:09.820
and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.500
I'm gonna find out.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.940
No, no, no.

09:12.940 --> 09:13.780
Take off your shoes.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.620
You're on holy ground.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.380
Cause you're not in charge here.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.700
You're not in command.

09:17.700 --> 09:21.220
Cause if you got shoes on, you can walk wherever you want.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.940
You can walk with confidence, but you take your shoes off,

09:23.940 --> 09:26.380
you're much more vulnerable.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.620
And that's appropriate when you're talking about God,

09:28.620 --> 09:29.580
you know?

09:29.580 --> 09:30.740
But here's another interesting thing,

09:30.740 --> 09:31.900
I didn't think about the burning bush

09:31.900 --> 09:33.580
in this connection before,

09:33.580 --> 09:37.740
but it's a bush that's on fire, but not consumed.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.500
Beings are competitive with each other.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.940
And so these can't be in the same place at the same time.

09:43.940 --> 09:46.780
These two beings, they're mutually exclusive if you want.

09:48.740 --> 09:52.820
But as God comes close to a creature,

09:52.820 --> 09:55.780
he doesn't destroy it or consume it,

09:55.780 --> 09:58.900
but the creature becomes more beautiful and more radiant.

09:58.900 --> 09:59.740
Right?

09:59.740 --> 10:02.820
And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.

10:02.820 --> 10:06.580
When they come bursting into life and experience,

10:06.580 --> 10:09.140
things are incinerated and people give way

10:09.140 --> 10:10.700
and they're overwhelmed.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.660
Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close

10:13.660 --> 10:17.060
and sets things on fire, but doesn't burn them up.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.140
And that's because he's not a competitive being

10:19.140 --> 10:20.140
in the world.

10:20.140 --> 10:25.140
If he were a big being, then he'd be competing for space,

10:25.180 --> 10:27.980
so to speak, on the same ontological grid.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.180
But he's not like that.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.860
So God can come close and we come more fully alive.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.260
Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.860
I mean, the central Christian doctrine

10:38.860 --> 10:42.380
that God can actually become a human

10:42.380 --> 10:46.020
without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.020
So I mean, that's kind of the next step,

10:48.020 --> 10:49.540
but the basic idea of God

10:49.540 --> 10:53.380
is non-competitively transcendent to the world.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.940
That's another way to get at it.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.940
Non-competitively transcendent to the world

10:57.940 --> 11:01.780
so as beyond being is the source of being.

11:01.780 --> 11:03.020
Right.

11:03.020 --> 11:06.140
Let me make it maybe more imagistic.

11:06.140 --> 11:10.500
I think a really good analogy would be author to book, right?

11:10.500 --> 11:13.700
So like Tolkien or someone that writes one of these

11:13.700 --> 11:17.100
big sprawling novels, and Tolkien is good too

11:17.100 --> 11:18.580
because he creates a whole world.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.180
He creates a new nature, a new language, new history,

11:21.180 --> 11:22.020
all that.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.900
Think of the thousands of characters and the plots

11:23.900 --> 11:25.300
and subplots and all of it.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.580
Tolkien is utterly responsible

11:28.580 --> 11:31.500
for every bit of that story, right?

11:31.500 --> 11:34.140
Every character, every plot, every subplot,

11:34.140 --> 11:36.740
every description, he's completely responsible.

11:36.740 --> 11:39.540
He's involved in every nook and cranny of it,

11:39.540 --> 11:41.740
but he's not in the story.

11:41.740 --> 11:43.100
He's not in the book.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.740
You're not gonna find him as a character in the book.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.820
So that's the category mistake of the atheist in a way is,

11:48.820 --> 11:49.660
I'm looking for God.

11:49.660 --> 11:51.860
He's a character in this story somewhere.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.580
No, he's the author of the story.

11:54.620 --> 11:58.540
Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,

11:58.540 --> 12:00.260
but not a character in it.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.940
He is deeply in the story somehow.

12:03.940 --> 12:08.700
He's present, but he's not, even if he is a character,

12:08.700 --> 12:13.100
he's not really, the full embodiment is not a character.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.460
And people inside the book

12:16.460 --> 12:18.500
can't really know about the author.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.780
Right.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.620
No, right.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.780
Well, see, Augustine says God is simultaneously

12:23.780 --> 12:26.860
in timior intimo meo et superior sumo meo.

12:26.860 --> 12:30.300
He's closer to me than I am to myself,

12:30.300 --> 12:33.340
and he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine

12:33.340 --> 12:34.380
at the same time.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.460
But see, once you get the insight

12:36.460 --> 12:38.940
that God is the sheer active to be,

12:38.940 --> 12:40.260
well, of course that's true.

12:40.260 --> 12:45.260
So right now, God is sustaining us in existence.

12:45.780 --> 12:46.940
True.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.420
Aquinas says God is in all things

12:49.420 --> 12:53.460
by essence, presence, and power, and most intimately so.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.740
And he's nowhere in this room.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.100
Okay, well, where's God?

12:58.100 --> 12:59.700
He's nowhere in this room.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.100
He's totalitare alitare, we say.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.940
He's totally other.

13:03.940 --> 13:04.940
Same time.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.820
But once you crack that code though,

13:06.820 --> 13:09.500
I think you see it of like why that would be true.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.180
And see, now I'm getting from more philosophical language

13:12.180 --> 13:13.260
to more mystical language,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.220
because all the mystics talk that way

13:15.220 --> 13:16.780
in these high paradoxes

13:16.780 --> 13:20.660
about God's availability and unavailability.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.060
I've often thought in the Bible,

13:23.060 --> 13:24.220
story after story,

13:24.220 --> 13:28.420
God can neither be grasped nor hidden from.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.940
So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God's.

13:32.940 --> 13:33.780
I've got him.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.820
I understand him.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.340
I can manipulate him.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.180
No, no, no.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.700
Story after story is told you can't do that.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.420
Well, then the other extreme of the sinner,

13:41.420 --> 13:43.500
all right, then I'm gonna run from God.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.460
I'm gonna avoid God, Jonah and the whale.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.020
So he has the call from God,

13:50.020 --> 13:51.780
and he said, no, no, I'm gonna refuse that.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.380
I'm gonna run as far away.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.420
I'm gonna go to Tarshish,

13:54.420 --> 13:55.940
which meant like Timbuktu for them,

13:55.940 --> 13:57.140
at the end of the world.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.900
God's got the whale swallows him up

13:59.900 --> 14:01.860
and brings him right back where God wants him.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.580
It's a poetic way of saying,

14:03.580 --> 14:05.860
you can't escape the press of God.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.500
At the same time, Tower of Babel,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.020
I'm gonna build a tower up to God.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.140
I'm gonna grab hold of God.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.900
No, no, no, you can't do that.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.460
So live in the space in between those two things,

14:15.460 --> 14:18.180
which would be the space of friendship with God.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.740
Falling in love with God

14:20.740 --> 14:22.900
is neither grasping nor hiding from God.

14:25.260 --> 14:28.700
You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.820
You mentioned grace.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.340
You mentioned sin.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.220
You mentioned incarnation.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.540
Is there a philosophical pragmatic way

14:37.540 --> 14:40.740
to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?

14:40.740 --> 14:45.740
What are the defining things that make Christianity to you

14:46.060 --> 14:51.060
and broadly speaking to those that follow the religion?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.300
In a way, what we've been doing so far

14:53.300 --> 14:55.140
is a necessary propa-deutic

14:55.140 --> 14:56.860
because we're talking about God.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.060
What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,

15:00.060 --> 15:01.820
is the claim of the incarnation.

15:01.820 --> 15:03.340
So we come up out of Judaism.

15:03.340 --> 15:06.100
We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.060
And the Bible itself and all the great commentaries

15:09.060 --> 15:11.340
within Judaism, I think, would agree

15:11.340 --> 15:15.460
with this basic theistic stuff that I've been talking about.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.420
Take Moses, Maimonides, for example.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.860
Now, what makes Christianity distinct?

15:20.860 --> 15:25.780
This supremely weird claim that God becomes one of us.

15:25.780 --> 15:30.500
God becomes a creature, but without ceasing to be God

15:30.500 --> 15:31.980
and without overwhelming the integrity

15:31.980 --> 15:33.500
of the creature he becomes.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.260
What we see in the burning bush,

15:35.260 --> 15:37.900
that principle which obtains across the board.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.380
So the closer God comes to me,

15:39.380 --> 15:42.100
the more radiant I become, right?

15:42.100 --> 15:44.580
But take that now to the nth degree

15:44.620 --> 15:46.340
would be what we mean by the incarnation,

15:46.340 --> 15:51.340
the incarnation of the son of God becoming a creature

15:51.460 --> 15:56.260
in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.860
That's the pillar of Christianity.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.340
It's the incarnation.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.820
And what follows from that is the redemption

16:03.820 --> 16:05.220
of all of reality.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.540
So not just of human beings,

16:07.540 --> 16:12.540
but in becoming a creature, God divinizes the world.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.420
The Greek fathers always said God became human,

16:17.420 --> 16:19.340
that humans might become God.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.020
And that's a good way to sum up,

16:21.020 --> 16:23.100
I think, the essence of Christianity.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.940
Why is this such an important thing?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.700
So it's a distinctive thing,

16:26.700 --> 16:29.860
but why is it so important philosophically

16:29.860 --> 16:31.940
to what it means to be a Christian?

16:33.940 --> 16:36.860
What impact did that have on our world,

16:36.860 --> 16:39.340
on human civilization, on human nature,

16:39.380 --> 16:43.220
on our morals, of why live, what to live for,

16:43.220 --> 16:44.420
and the meaning of it all?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.380
Why is incarnation so important?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.980
Well, I think it's massively important

16:47.980 --> 16:49.820
because it's the divinization principle

16:49.820 --> 16:52.220
that God wants to divinize his creation

16:52.220 --> 16:56.140
and sort of in this concentrated point of Jesus of Nazareth.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.420
But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.140
So that goes right back to Paul.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.100
As we're grafted onto Christ,

17:02.100 --> 17:04.300
we talk about that as the church,

17:04.300 --> 17:08.340
we become like cells and molecules in an organism.

17:08.340 --> 17:10.380
That's the church, it's not an organization.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.940
That's a deformation of ecclesiology.

17:13.940 --> 17:16.980
The church is this organism that begins with Jesus

17:16.980 --> 17:20.700
and then he's drawing all of humanity,

17:20.700 --> 17:25.700
but ultimately all of nature, all of creation to himself.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.500
When the son of man is lifted up,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.380
he will draw all things to himself.

17:29.380 --> 17:34.380
That idea of the gathering in of a scattered creation.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.300
So in that way, it's at the heart of it.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.580
Then there's all kinds of things.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.660
If God becomes human,

17:39.660 --> 17:41.380
that means there's a dignity to humanity

17:41.380 --> 17:43.060
which goes beyond anything,

17:43.060 --> 17:46.380
any humanist of any stripe has ever said, right?

17:46.380 --> 17:49.140
Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.

17:50.180 --> 17:53.020
Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.

17:53.020 --> 17:56.740
God became one of us in order to divinize us.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.420
The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,

17:59.420 --> 18:02.660
not just to be materially successful,

18:02.660 --> 18:05.380
not just to be a member of society.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.140
The goal of my life is to become a participant

18:08.140 --> 18:09.380
in the divine nature.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.260
And so I don't think there is a humanism greater than that,

18:12.260 --> 18:13.940
even conceivably.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.620
So that's where I think humanism

18:16.620 --> 18:19.340
is profoundly influenced by the incarnation.

18:20.380 --> 18:25.140
And just our notion of God is non-competitive to us.

18:25.140 --> 18:25.980
That's so important,

18:25.980 --> 18:29.500
because I think it's so many systems from mythology onward.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.940
You have these competitive understandings of God.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.620
When Jesus says to his disciples the night before he dies,

18:35.620 --> 18:38.180
I no longer call you servants, but friends,

18:38.180 --> 18:40.260
it's an extraordinary moment.

18:40.260 --> 18:43.620
Because every God who's ever been served,

18:43.620 --> 18:45.580
well, that's the best we can hope for,

18:45.580 --> 18:47.700
is that we'll be as the servant of God.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.220
I've tried to obey you, Lord.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.540
I'll try to do what you want.

18:51.540 --> 18:55.500
But when Jesus says, I no longer call you servants or slaves,

18:55.500 --> 18:58.300
he would have said in the Greek there,

18:58.300 --> 19:01.420
but friends, I don't know.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.420
I can't imagine anything greater than that,

19:03.420 --> 19:04.900
becoming God's friend.

19:04.900 --> 19:08.660
That's a call to become one with God.

19:08.660 --> 19:12.180
It's possible to become one with God.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.540
Now, I should mention,

19:13.540 --> 19:15.980
you're one of the greatest religious communicators

19:15.980 --> 19:17.620
I've ever experienced.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.940
A huge number of people are fans of yours.

19:19.940 --> 19:23.300
You've done a lot of great conversations.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.180
You've done Reddit AMAs,

19:25.180 --> 19:29.820
which is a very unique, bold, brave thing.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.900
And on one of them, somebody asked,

19:34.100 --> 19:37.180
what's the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?

19:37.180 --> 19:41.100
So first, what are the seven deadly sins?

19:41.100 --> 19:43.700
What do they have to do with Christianity?

19:43.700 --> 19:47.860
How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?

19:47.860 --> 19:51.620
And what's the most challenging in our modern day?

19:51.620 --> 19:55.940
Yeah, to name them, pride, envy, anger,

19:55.940 --> 19:59.380
sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust

19:59.380 --> 20:01.260
are the seven deadly sins.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.500
We're called capital sins sometimes.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.420
They're the head sins from which things tend to flow.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.820
The most fundamental is pride.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.460
Probably most people today, if you talk about like vice,

20:13.460 --> 20:15.340
or you talk about a deadly sin,

20:15.340 --> 20:16.860
they would think about lust.

20:16.860 --> 20:19.060
But the classical authors, including Dante,

20:19.060 --> 20:20.860
who does this pictorially,

20:21.940 --> 20:23.740
that's the least of the deadly sins is lust,

20:23.740 --> 20:25.500
because it's the one that's most sort of

20:25.500 --> 20:29.180
dependent upon the body and its passions and so on.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.500
So the most important is pride.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.860
Pride is the deadliest of deadly sins.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.860
And it's very simple to see why.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.300
Pride is the, Augustine calls it, in cravatus, and say,

20:39.300 --> 20:43.020
I'm caved in around myself, like a black hole, right,

20:43.020 --> 20:45.260
to get into the scientific.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.580
But the black hole to me is a great symbol,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.820
you know, that it's so heavy

20:49.820 --> 20:51.660
that it draws everything, including light.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.580
Nothing can escape from it.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.540
See, that's the sinner, we're all sinners.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.340
That we draw everything into ourselves.

21:00.340 --> 21:04.820
So as a sinner, and you know, I'll confess, I'm a sinner,

21:04.820 --> 21:08.260
the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,

21:08.260 --> 21:12.420
and I'm drawing you now into my world and so on.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.500
What that does is it kills us off,

21:16.500 --> 21:19.100
and it darkens life,

21:19.100 --> 21:23.460
and it makes it small and heavy and awful, right?

21:23.460 --> 21:28.380
It's like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,

21:28.380 --> 21:31.420
is when you're lost in a moment,

21:31.420 --> 21:33.820
you're not concerned about the impression I'm making,

21:33.820 --> 21:35.940
you're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself,

21:35.940 --> 21:38.220
you're not concerned about this monkey on my back

21:38.220 --> 21:39.620
that's always telling me, you know,

21:39.620 --> 21:44.140
look good and sound right, but you're lost in something.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.340
You're just talking, you know, to a friend,

21:46.340 --> 21:49.020
and the two of you together are discovering something true

21:49.020 --> 21:51.500
or beautiful, or you're lost in a movie,

21:51.500 --> 21:53.060
or you're lost in a book.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.900
Those are the best moments in life.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.740
Those are the best,

21:55.740 --> 21:58.420
because they're the least prideful moments, right?

21:58.420 --> 22:00.700
That's when the light comes out.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.140
I become radiant,

22:03.140 --> 22:06.620
because I'm overcoming this tendency to fall in on myself.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.580
Dante is so good,

22:09.580 --> 22:13.820
because the way he pictures Satan in Divine Comedy,

22:13.820 --> 22:15.700
and you know, he's at the center of the earth,

22:15.700 --> 22:17.220
so like a black hole that way,

22:17.220 --> 22:19.020
like he's at the center of gravity,

22:19.020 --> 22:21.060
he's at the heaviest place,

22:21.060 --> 22:23.980
and there's not fire where he is, but ice,

22:23.980 --> 22:26.220
which is a much, much better image,

22:26.220 --> 22:29.100
that you're frozen in place and you're stuck,

22:29.100 --> 22:31.460
and he's got wings, right?

22:31.460 --> 22:33.140
And they used to be angel wings,

22:33.140 --> 22:33.960
because he's an angel,

22:33.960 --> 22:35.500
but now they're like bat wings for Dante,

22:35.500 --> 22:37.420
and they're flapping,

22:37.420 --> 22:40.540
and all they're doing is making the world around him colder,

22:40.540 --> 22:43.340
because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness,

22:43.340 --> 22:45.660
and then he's beating his wings over the ice,

22:45.660 --> 22:46.940
making everyone else colder.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.860
It's a great image.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.300
And then he has, this is cool too,

22:50.300 --> 22:53.060
he has three faces, Satan,

22:53.060 --> 22:55.160
because he's the simulacrum of the Trinity,

22:55.160 --> 22:57.140
so every sinner thinks he's God,

22:57.140 --> 22:58.500
so I pretend I'm God,

22:58.500 --> 23:00.260
so he's got the three faces,

23:00.260 --> 23:02.440
and from all six eyes, he weeps.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.220
Also from all three mouths, he's chewing a sinner,

23:07.220 --> 23:11.300
he's got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,

23:11.300 --> 23:13.020
you know, the three traitors.

23:13.020 --> 23:16.420
But I thought, it's just a great image

23:16.420 --> 23:19.480
of all of us sinners, is we're stuck,

23:19.480 --> 23:22.220
it's heavy, it's cold,

23:22.220 --> 23:25.080
we're chewing on our past resentments,

23:25.080 --> 23:27.160
we're weeping in our sadness,

23:27.160 --> 23:29.280
and we're making the world around us colder.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.360
It's beautiful, it's great.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.600
So that's pride.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.160
See, that's an image of pride,

23:33.160 --> 23:35.540
because Satan, that's his great sin, pride,

23:35.540 --> 23:38.240
which is why he needed Michael, right, Mikael,

23:38.240 --> 23:41.040
who's like God, so that the great challenge to him,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.480
which we need all the time,

23:43.480 --> 23:45.420
is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute,

23:45.420 --> 23:46.960
you're not God.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.240
But the minute we say, I'm God,

23:49.920 --> 23:52.680
black hole, I now cave in on myself,

23:52.680 --> 23:54.940
I suck everything into myself,

23:54.940 --> 23:57.600
and I turn into Dante's Satan.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.900
So that's a great image.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.640
That's pride, that's the most fundamental.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.160
That's the uber capital sin.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.240
All the other ones flow from that, in a way.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.200
So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,

24:10.200 --> 24:14.720
love thy neighbor, is the way to fight the sin of pride.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.000
Right, which is why the masters tend to say,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.320
this was Bernard, St. Bernard was asked,

24:19.320 --> 24:21.160
what are the three most important virtues?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.680
And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.520
because it's the opposite of pride.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.840
So, but you know, they're bringing Aquinas in again,

24:29.840 --> 24:32.200
because we think, oh, humility, I'm no good.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.400
That's not what it means at all.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.520
It means what I was describing before,

24:35.520 --> 24:39.000
when you're just lost in something, you're just lost in it.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.960
My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,

24:41.960 --> 24:44.240
and I like to walk on the beach out there,

24:44.240 --> 24:45.660
and there's a section of the beach

24:45.660 --> 24:48.540
where they let the dogs run free without leashes.

24:48.540 --> 24:52.660
And when you see a dog, and he's well cared for,

24:52.660 --> 24:53.820
and his master's right there,

24:53.820 --> 24:56.140
and the master's throwing the tennis ball out into the surf,

24:56.140 --> 24:57.980
and the dog goes galloping out into the surf,

24:57.980 --> 25:01.020
and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.460
That's humility.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.460
That's an image of heaven,

25:03.460 --> 25:05.940
because he's just lost in that moment.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.900
He doesn't care about impressing anybody.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.660
He doesn't care about what people think of him.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.380
He's just lost in it.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.220
That's it.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.500
That's heaven, right?

25:16.460 --> 25:18.860
And those moments in our life, when we get that,

25:18.860 --> 25:21.180
it's a little hint of paradise.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.900
But the trouble is, most of us live, frankly,

25:23.900 --> 25:27.900
most of the time, in various levels of hell,

25:27.900 --> 25:30.220
and we're dealing with these deadly sins.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.580
Envy flows from pride, because if I'm prideful,

25:32.580 --> 25:35.820
I'm a black hole, I'm in cravatus in se, I'm collapsed in,

25:35.820 --> 25:37.820
what am I really gonna be concerned about?

25:37.820 --> 25:39.180
That guy's getting more attention than I am.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.700
That guy's richer than I am.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.540
That lady, she's got a bigger reputation than I do,

25:43.540 --> 25:46.300
and why don't I have that, right?

25:46.300 --> 25:49.220
So envy is a very close daughter of pride.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.020
Anger flows from it.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.540
Why do I get angry?

25:53.540 --> 25:55.020
The dog isn't getting angry on the beach

25:55.020 --> 25:56.740
when he's running after the tennis ball.

25:56.740 --> 25:58.700
But I get angry all the time, sputter with anger,

25:58.700 --> 26:01.420
when things aren't going my way, and you're insulting me,

26:01.420 --> 26:02.620
and you're not doing what I want,

26:02.620 --> 26:04.700
and I'm being hurt, my reputation.

26:04.700 --> 26:07.580
So anger flows from pride, you know?

26:07.580 --> 26:10.300
All of them do, all of the deadly sins do.

26:10.300 --> 26:13.860
So you said, I'm a sinner.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.380
So we're all sinners.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.220
Yeah.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.260
And you mentioned Satan.

26:19.260 --> 26:22.700
Where's the, so there's heaven and hell,

26:22.700 --> 26:24.460
there's God and Satan.

26:25.420 --> 26:29.980
Where's the line between what it means to be good,

26:30.980 --> 26:34.460
and not good enough?

26:34.460 --> 26:38.220
Or I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,

26:38.220 --> 26:43.020
but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.500
Where's the line between hell and heaven?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.100
Think of them as limit concepts, maybe.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.020
They're like heuristic devices.

26:49.020 --> 26:53.580
So heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.

26:53.580 --> 26:54.700
So think of the dog on the beach,

26:54.700 --> 26:58.100
who is just, he's fallen in love with his environment,

26:58.100 --> 26:59.660
with his master, with the surf.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.300
He's just lost in it, right?

27:01.300 --> 27:04.420
He's forgotten himself, he's transcended himself,

27:04.460 --> 27:08.780
and is now lost in the wonder of the beauty of that place.

27:08.780 --> 27:13.500
Now, imagine the limit of that is the friendship with God

27:13.500 --> 27:14.540
that we talked about.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.180
That I become the friend of God.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.140
I become so, I forgetful of myself,

27:19.140 --> 27:22.300
so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God

27:22.300 --> 27:26.020
that I'm, I found beatitude, right?

27:26.020 --> 27:29.220
I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.180
That's the limit case.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.420
That's where we're tending.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.220
That's where God wants us to go.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.220
Think of hell as a limit case in the opposite direction.

27:37.220 --> 27:40.460
That's curvatus in se, that's the black hole.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.700
And we're all sinners,

27:41.700 --> 27:43.820
meaning we're somewhere on that spectrum.

27:43.820 --> 27:46.100
We have good days and bad days,

27:46.100 --> 27:47.620
and we have good moments and bad moments,

27:47.620 --> 27:50.700
and I can be drawn toward sin.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.140
What's God's purpose and Christianity's reading

27:55.140 --> 27:57.260
is to bring us out of that.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.500
Now, where did he go?

27:58.500 --> 28:01.260
He went all the way into it to get us out of it.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.580
It's like pulling a sock back out,

28:03.620 --> 28:05.300
all the way in and pull it back out.

28:05.300 --> 28:08.700
And so, God had to go all the way down, you know?

28:08.700 --> 28:12.140
And there's the trajectory of the incarnation.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.780
Though he was in the form of God,

28:15.780 --> 28:16.820
you know, this is St. Paul,

28:16.820 --> 28:18.340
Jesus did not deem equality with God

28:18.340 --> 28:19.180
a thing to be grasped at,

28:19.180 --> 28:21.540
but rather emptied himself and took the form of a slave,

28:21.540 --> 28:23.380
being born the likeness of men.

28:23.380 --> 28:26.780
But then, he was known to be of human estate,

28:26.780 --> 28:30.380
and he accepted even death, death on a cross.

28:30.420 --> 28:32.540
And so, Paul imagines that the incarnation

28:32.540 --> 28:34.500
is this downward journey,

28:34.500 --> 28:36.780
in order to get all of us, right?

28:36.780 --> 28:40.780
All of us who were stuck, were stuck in our sin.

28:40.780 --> 28:44.180
And so, again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.740
It's a really, really powerful idea.

28:46.740 --> 28:48.220
He wasn't a sinner,

28:48.220 --> 28:49.420
because then he'd need to be saved, too.

28:49.420 --> 28:50.860
He's not a sinner,

28:50.860 --> 28:53.340
but he entered into our dysfunction

28:53.340 --> 28:55.660
in order to pull us back out of it.

28:55.660 --> 28:58.900
So, that's a really powerful message,

28:58.900 --> 29:03.900
an embodiment, sort of educating the world about sin.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.180
That said, day to day,

29:09.180 --> 29:14.180
there's like oscillations in terms of how much

29:14.380 --> 29:17.940
each human sins, and there's a struggle against that.

29:17.940 --> 29:22.940
So, you know, that dog that loses himself on the beach

29:23.780 --> 29:26.020
may have had a lot of sex with other dogs

29:26.020 --> 29:26.860
leading up to that.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.580
That was, may have been not the best dog

29:30.580 --> 29:32.580
he could be leading up to that.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.580
So, how, you know, if it's a math equation,

29:35.580 --> 29:38.820
what does the final calculation look like

29:38.820 --> 29:40.980
in terms of ending up in heaven?

29:40.980 --> 29:44.620
What does it mean to live a good life in the end?

29:44.620 --> 29:49.620
Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?

29:50.140 --> 29:52.420
Are you allowed to make mistakes?

29:52.460 --> 29:56.900
Yeah, you know, the metric is love, right?

29:56.900 --> 29:59.860
And love is not a feeling, it's an act of the will.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.580
To will the good of the other.

30:01.580 --> 30:02.540
That's Aquinas again.

30:02.540 --> 30:04.860
To will the good of the other as other.

30:04.860 --> 30:07.540
You see, that's the anti-black hole principle.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.980
When I, I don't-

30:08.980 --> 30:10.500
Will the good of the other.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.340
As other.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.380
See, because if I'm willing your good,

30:13.380 --> 30:15.020
because it's good for me.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.940
So, I get, you know, it's good for you

30:16.940 --> 30:18.220
that I'm on this program, I guess.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.140
I'm willing your good,

30:19.140 --> 30:21.700
but that's because it's gonna be down to my benefit.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.940
That's just an indirect egotism.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.500
That's why I see love is really rare and strange.

30:26.500 --> 30:31.500
That I really want what's good for you as other.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.860
So, not connected to the black hole tendency

30:34.860 --> 30:36.740
of my own prideful ego.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.940
When I've broken that, I've forgotten self

30:39.940 --> 30:43.020
and I've moved into the space of your own good.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.220
That's what love is.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.700
Now, God wants us to be, you know,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.780
by this they will know that you're my disciples,

30:48.780 --> 30:50.460
that you love one another, Jesus says.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.220
So, that's it.

30:52.220 --> 30:56.180
Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth

30:56.180 --> 30:57.980
and we're better or worse at that.

30:59.820 --> 31:02.500
The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ

31:02.500 --> 31:05.100
that we might become more and more conformed to love.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.220
But, you know, the final calculus, I'll leave that to God.

31:07.220 --> 31:09.820
I mean, but use love as the metric.

31:09.820 --> 31:12.660
At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,

31:12.660 --> 31:14.900
did I will the good of the other today?

31:14.900 --> 31:17.380
How effective was I at that?

31:17.540 --> 31:21.180
And be, just like Ignatius of Loyola, be brutally honest.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.620
Or was I just willing someone's good

31:22.620 --> 31:23.980
because it was good for me?

31:25.460 --> 31:27.500
Where were those moments where I was like the dog

31:27.500 --> 31:29.180
on the beach, see?

31:29.180 --> 31:32.860
See, play it the way, not so much God the law giver

31:32.860 --> 31:35.700
surveying and you did three of those and four.

31:35.700 --> 31:39.180
It's God wants us to be fully alive.

31:39.180 --> 31:41.060
Saint Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,

31:41.060 --> 31:43.100
ancient, you know, patristic figure.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.380
And his famous line is Gloria Dei homo vivens, right?

31:46.380 --> 31:50.780
The glory of God is a human being fully alive.

31:50.780 --> 31:53.620
See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession

31:53.620 --> 31:55.860
with illegalism and did I do enough?

31:55.860 --> 31:57.460
And is that, that's a big enough sin?

31:57.460 --> 32:00.260
And God wants us fully alive.

32:00.260 --> 32:02.740
The key to that is willing the good of the other.

32:02.740 --> 32:07.260
He died that we might come to a richer

32:07.260 --> 32:08.740
appropriation of that.

32:08.740 --> 32:13.740
So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world

32:14.300 --> 32:17.980
or to love the world deeply.

32:17.980 --> 32:21.300
And what love means is the other, is-

32:21.300 --> 32:22.500
Get out of yourself, right.

32:22.500 --> 32:26.100
It's the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself.

32:26.100 --> 32:26.940
Let go.

32:26.940 --> 32:31.380
That's somehow not, that's not even selfless

32:31.380 --> 32:35.540
because the word selfless requires there to be a self.

32:35.540 --> 32:38.180
It's almost like just letting go.

32:38.180 --> 32:40.060
Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self

32:40.100 --> 32:43.940
that you yourself aware, but you give a gift of yourself.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.780
Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself

32:46.780 --> 32:49.740
but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.460
I think Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense

32:51.460 --> 32:52.700
of herself, it seems to me.

32:52.700 --> 32:57.020
But it was to light other people up

32:57.020 --> 32:59.820
so that they might be radiant.

32:59.820 --> 33:00.900
You know, that's the game.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.980
So you probably articulate it that way too.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.540
Yeah, I love love.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.380
It's such an interesting thing.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.620
But we have to be hard-nosed about it.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.420
Like, you know, your friend, Dostoevsky,

33:11.420 --> 33:13.780
love is a harsh and dreadful thing, right?

33:13.780 --> 33:14.900
It's not a feeling.

33:14.900 --> 33:17.100
And our culture is so sentimentalized love

33:17.100 --> 33:20.020
that it's having warm feelings or doing what people want.

33:20.020 --> 33:20.860
And that's not it at all.

33:20.860 --> 33:24.500
Love is always correlated to the order of the good

33:24.500 --> 33:26.420
because if I'm willing the good of the other,

33:26.420 --> 33:28.660
I have to know what that good is, right?

33:28.660 --> 33:29.500
So a parent that says,

33:29.500 --> 33:31.540
oh, give the kid whatever she wants.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.380
Well, that's not love, that's indulgence

33:33.380 --> 33:35.540
or that's sentimentality.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.940
But I have to know what the goods really are

33:37.940 --> 33:39.940
if I'm gonna will them for you, right?

33:39.940 --> 33:43.020
Yeah, I, in some sense, you're absolutely right.

33:43.020 --> 33:47.260
A component of love is the struggle to know the other.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.100
Right.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.620
It's the struggle to understand.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.020
I mean, that's what I mean by empathy,

33:52.020 --> 33:54.180
is to, it's not, yeah,

33:54.180 --> 33:57.180
it's not Valentine's Day romantic gifts.

33:57.180 --> 33:59.700
It's a struggle.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.540
It's like trying to understand,

34:02.540 --> 34:04.460
trying to perturb your own mind

34:04.460 --> 34:06.900
and that of another human being

34:06.900 --> 34:09.180
to try to figure out who they are,

34:09.180 --> 34:12.820
what they want, what makes them happy,

34:12.820 --> 34:16.340
what are they afraid of, what are they hoping for.

34:16.340 --> 34:19.620
And it's like a dance, a dance of conversation,

34:19.620 --> 34:23.700
a dance of just shared experiences

34:23.700 --> 34:24.620
and all that kind of stuff.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.620
And all of that requires for you to be,

34:27.660 --> 34:31.020
I guess, yeah, empathize.

34:31.020 --> 34:35.900
Imagine yourself in their place

34:35.900 --> 34:38.220
and then love that person

34:38.220 --> 34:40.900
when you're living inside that person.

34:40.900 --> 34:41.780
Yeah.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.780
Several minutes ago about the pillars of Christianity.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.540
So we talked about God, talked about incarnation,

34:45.540 --> 34:48.620
but you're getting now to a third key one,

34:48.620 --> 34:50.060
namely the Trinity,

34:50.060 --> 34:52.540
because we're monotheists, right?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.900
But we don't think God is monolithically one.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.380
We think God is a play of persons.

34:57.380 --> 35:01.860
And the Father from all eternity,

35:02.660 --> 35:05.260
by a great mental act,

35:05.260 --> 35:08.820
forms his interior word, as Aquinas puts it.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.060
And that's the logos, right?

35:10.060 --> 35:11.100
That's the verbum,

35:11.100 --> 35:13.380
that's the word by which the Father knows himself.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.780
And we call it the Son.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.100
So the imago, it's the image of the Father.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.540
But then see, the great thing is

35:18.540 --> 35:21.940
that imago is not like just a dead image on a mirror

35:21.940 --> 35:24.220
or a dead image at a pond or something.

35:24.220 --> 35:29.220
It's a full reflection of the Father's being.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.940
He's one in being with the Father.

35:31.940 --> 35:34.300
Therefore, the Son has everything the Father has

35:34.300 --> 35:35.820
except being the Father.

35:35.820 --> 35:39.220
But that means that the two of them look at each other

35:39.220 --> 35:41.900
and they're just crazy in love with each other

35:41.900 --> 35:45.380
because the Father is the fullness of being.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.940
The Son is the fullness of being.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.140
And they're so crazy in love with each other

35:49.140 --> 35:52.500
that they, this is a Fulton Shee put it this way,

35:52.500 --> 35:57.500
that there's this, they love each other with this sigh.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.180
And we call that the spiritus sanctus.

36:00.180 --> 36:01.420
That's the holy breath, right?

36:01.420 --> 36:06.060
The holy sigh of love between the Father and the Son.

36:06.060 --> 36:10.500
And that's one being, one essence we say of God.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.460
But in these three persons,

36:12.460 --> 36:16.740
but all your language are like dance and play and community.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.700
The Greek fathers talked about perichoresis,

36:18.700 --> 36:21.020
which means God, the three persons kind of sit

36:21.020 --> 36:23.100
in a choir together.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.980
So they sing together.

36:27.780 --> 36:32.260
And that's why I see Christianity is unique in this claim

36:32.260 --> 36:34.820
that God is love.

36:34.820 --> 36:38.060
So every religion will say God loves in some way.

36:38.060 --> 36:40.380
Love is an attribute of God.

36:40.380 --> 36:43.180
God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.

36:43.180 --> 36:45.260
But Christianity is unique in all the religions

36:45.260 --> 36:47.700
in saying that God is love.

36:47.700 --> 36:52.020
And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.

36:52.020 --> 36:55.380
I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing

36:55.380 --> 37:00.380
to me what it means to be three things

37:00.940 --> 37:04.700
and at the same time be one God,

37:04.700 --> 37:07.820
the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.540
What is this dance between these three?

37:10.540 --> 37:13.460
What exactly, like how do you visualize,

37:13.460 --> 37:14.980
how do you understand this?

37:14.980 --> 37:19.980
This very fascinating essential thing for Christianity.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.500
The first thing I'd say is what we already

37:21.500 --> 37:24.100
have been sort of talking about is if you say God is love,

37:24.140 --> 37:25.940
and most people probably say, yeah, I like that.

37:25.940 --> 37:26.780
It's a good idea.

37:26.780 --> 37:28.380
God is love, but it's very peculiar

37:28.380 --> 37:33.380
because if he is love, there has to be in his unity

37:34.020 --> 37:37.620
a lover, a beloved, and the love that they share.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.260
Otherwise, he isn't loved by his very essence.

37:40.260 --> 37:43.940
He would love, it would be an attribute of God

37:43.940 --> 37:46.780
or an action of God, but if it's his very nature,

37:46.780 --> 37:49.700
there has to be lover, beloved, and love shared.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.540
And the tradition eventually came to see that.

37:52.540 --> 37:55.220
The image I was using before of the Father,

37:55.220 --> 38:00.220
his imago, the Son, well, that's born of God's infinite mind.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.260
So of course, God has an image of himself.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.100
Heck, I've got an image of myself.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.100
That's something I can pull off as a puny little creature.

38:07.100 --> 38:11.500
God in his infinity has a perfect imago of himself,

38:11.500 --> 38:13.540
and they have to fall in love with each other.

38:13.540 --> 38:14.900
What else can they do?

38:14.900 --> 38:17.860
Because they're in the presence of infinite good,

38:17.860 --> 38:21.580
and so it has to follow that you then have the shared love

38:21.580 --> 38:22.900
that connects them.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.500
And that's how we generate, if you want,

38:24.500 --> 38:26.940
this idea of the three persons in God.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.900
Let me ask you about the church.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.060
One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism

38:35.500 --> 38:37.020
is the Catholic Church.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.780
What is the Catholic Church?

38:40.700 --> 38:43.060
I would say it's the mystical body of Jesus.

38:43.060 --> 38:45.380
So as I said before, it's not an organization.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.820
If we do it that way, we're gonna miss it.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.900
It's got organizational elements to it.

38:48.940 --> 38:52.940
I'm a bishop, I'm a office holder within the church.

38:52.940 --> 38:56.900
But the church is an organism, not an organization.

38:56.900 --> 39:01.300
So it's a organism of interconnected cells, as I said,

39:01.300 --> 39:02.620
namely all of the baptised,

39:02.620 --> 39:06.580
gathered around Christ in a mystical union.

39:06.580 --> 39:07.900
That's the church.

39:07.900 --> 39:10.380
But there's buildings, there's titles.

39:10.380 --> 39:14.180
Sure, because it manifests itself institutionally then.

39:14.180 --> 39:18.140
So are the sort of heavy things about that

39:18.180 --> 39:19.900
all have to do with pride?

39:19.900 --> 39:20.740
Yeah, sure.

39:20.740 --> 39:24.660
Whatever is corrupt in the church, of course,

39:24.660 --> 39:26.660
it comes from pride, from sin.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.620
And one thing I like about the New Testament

39:28.620 --> 39:29.660
is so clear on that.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.260
I mean, Paul is, in his little tiny communities,

39:32.260 --> 39:35.060
so before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything,

39:35.060 --> 39:36.900
Paul has these little tiny communities of Christians

39:36.900 --> 39:39.860
like in Corinth and Ephesus, you know?

39:39.860 --> 39:41.020
What's the one thing we know about them

39:41.020 --> 39:42.740
is they fought with each other.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.660
Because Paul's always up braiding them

39:44.660 --> 39:46.460
and telling them, come on, would you people

39:46.460 --> 39:49.340
get it together and who's bewitched you?

39:49.340 --> 39:51.500
And so from the beginning,

39:51.500 --> 39:52.540
we've been fighting with each other

39:52.540 --> 39:54.060
because we're made up of sinners.

39:54.060 --> 39:59.020
And so one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology

39:59.020 --> 40:00.980
is the official name for the study of the church

40:00.980 --> 40:04.660
is to talk about the treasure in earthen vessels,

40:04.660 --> 40:05.860
Paul's language again.

40:05.860 --> 40:07.060
The treasure is Christ.

40:07.060 --> 40:11.140
The treasure is the love he's bequeathed to the world.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.820
That's the treasure that we have.

40:12.820 --> 40:15.460
But it's always held in these really fragile vessels,

40:15.460 --> 40:16.780
namely us.

40:16.780 --> 40:19.100
And so it's gonna be marked by corruption and stupidity

40:19.100 --> 40:21.300
and pride and everything else.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.940
Well, nevertheless, there's a hierarchy.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.780
There's titles and so on.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.940
If we remove pride from the picture,

40:28.940 --> 40:31.980
so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy

40:31.980 --> 40:36.340
that makes up this one organism, this living organism,

40:36.340 --> 40:39.900
what's the role of the pope, for example?

40:39.900 --> 40:44.540
What is the role of a bishop, for example?

40:44.620 --> 40:46.220
What is the role of the hierarchy

40:46.220 --> 40:49.900
in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,

40:49.900 --> 40:51.580
Catholicism as a religion?

40:52.580 --> 40:54.900
I'm a devotee of this guy named Johann Adam Müller,

40:54.900 --> 40:57.620
who was a theologian early part of the 19th century.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.420
And he was part of the kind of romantic movement.

41:00.420 --> 41:03.460
And he said the purpose of the pope

41:03.460 --> 41:07.900
is to symbolize and embody and draw together

41:07.900 --> 41:10.740
the unity of the entire church.

41:10.740 --> 41:14.060
So he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.100
Who's a bishop?

41:15.100 --> 41:17.300
The bishop is the personal symbol

41:17.300 --> 41:19.540
of the unity of a diocese.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.980
Who's a pastor of a parish?

41:20.980 --> 41:24.460
He's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.

41:24.460 --> 41:27.420
So he understood it not so much organizationally

41:27.420 --> 41:28.580
as organically again.

41:28.580 --> 41:30.860
It was like what?

41:30.860 --> 41:34.380
That around which the pattern organizes itself.

41:34.380 --> 41:37.420
And if you don't have that unifying figure,

41:37.420 --> 41:39.340
the community will kind of separate.

41:39.340 --> 41:43.100
And you see it all the time without headship, we would say.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.180
So it's more symbolic and organic

41:45.180 --> 41:47.500
than it is organizational.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.060
So symbols for community.

41:49.060 --> 41:53.020
But there's such fascinating peculiarities

41:53.020 --> 41:55.420
to each individual symbol.

41:55.420 --> 41:56.740
There's different characteristics

41:56.740 --> 41:58.820
that make up the different people.

41:58.820 --> 42:01.380
They have different ways of communicating.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.780
They have different hopes and fears

42:02.780 --> 42:04.140
and all that kind of stuff.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.260
If they're all symbols,

42:09.220 --> 42:13.300
what's the role of the different peculiarities

42:13.300 --> 42:14.620
of those symbols?

42:14.620 --> 42:17.860
Of being an inspiring uniter

42:17.860 --> 42:20.540
versus maybe a stronger type of

42:23.700 --> 42:26.620
more judgmental kind of communicator,

42:26.620 --> 42:27.460
all that kind of stuff.

42:27.460 --> 42:31.700
I mean, can you maybe speak to the human part

42:31.700 --> 42:33.940
of these symbols?

42:33.940 --> 42:37.140
Yeah, well, I might just shift to another image

42:37.380 --> 42:38.180
of shepherd.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.020
So that's a classic biblical image.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.820
And as a bishop, I walk around with this thing

42:41.820 --> 42:44.060
called the crozier, which is a shepherd staff, right?

42:44.060 --> 42:46.900
So it's the symbol of the bishop's office.

42:46.900 --> 42:50.380
And the crozier, though, is a kind of

42:50.380 --> 42:51.740
in-your-face thing in a way,

42:51.740 --> 42:54.540
because it's got the end of it

42:54.540 --> 42:57.020
was meant to hold off wild animals.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.420
And then the crook part of it

42:58.420 --> 43:01.340
was meant to bring sheep back to the fold, right?

43:01.340 --> 43:02.180
So I walk in with that and be,

43:02.180 --> 43:04.100
oh, this is nice, look at the bishop coming in.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.820
But that's a kind of in-your-face symbol

43:07.420 --> 43:10.940
that I'm here to defend the church against predators,

43:10.940 --> 43:13.100
and I'm also here to draw people in

43:13.100 --> 43:14.900
who are wandering too far away.

43:14.900 --> 43:15.740
So that's okay.

43:15.740 --> 43:18.180
I mean, that's part of the role of the hierarchy

43:18.180 --> 43:21.300
and the pope and bishops and pastors.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.900
Pastor just means shepherd, right?

43:22.900 --> 43:25.140
So I'm the shepherd of a parish.

43:25.140 --> 43:25.980
So that's okay.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.940
It's not like just all sunshine and light

43:27.940 --> 43:29.260
and what a pretty image.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.340
The one who embodies the unity of the community

43:32.340 --> 43:33.540
is also the shepherd.

43:34.540 --> 43:37.980
Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing,

43:39.140 --> 43:41.020
the church is an institution.

43:41.940 --> 43:44.060
And I don't know if you've heard,

43:44.060 --> 43:47.900
but there is an element of power that corrupts.

43:47.900 --> 43:50.260
And absolute power corrupts absolutely,

43:50.260 --> 43:51.620
as the old saying goes.

43:53.500 --> 43:54.900
Let me ask you something else

43:54.900 --> 43:57.820
that came up on the Reddit AMA.

43:57.820 --> 44:00.380
Mega churches and the prosperity gospel.

44:00.740 --> 44:04.860
You've mentioned that you may not be a fan.

44:04.860 --> 44:06.100
What are your views on this?

44:06.100 --> 44:09.220
And what are your views in general of money and power

44:09.220 --> 44:11.900
corrupting the heads of these institutions?

44:13.260 --> 44:14.820
I don't like the prosperity gospel

44:14.820 --> 44:18.420
because the gospel is about Jesus' journey

44:18.420 --> 44:22.260
into radical self-forgetfulness on the cross.

44:22.260 --> 44:27.260
And he never makes a promise of earthly well-being.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.740
Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?

44:29.780 --> 44:31.740
Yeah, the view that if I follow Jesus

44:31.740 --> 44:33.540
and I follow God with great trust,

44:33.540 --> 44:35.860
that I will be rewarded with wealth

44:35.860 --> 44:39.060
and position and status in this world.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.060
It might be God's will that I get that.

44:41.060 --> 44:42.540
But Aquinas said this,

44:42.540 --> 44:44.180
say I look at a very sinful person,

44:44.180 --> 44:45.620
I say, God, he's got a great house

44:45.620 --> 44:47.660
and he's richer than I am and all that.

44:47.660 --> 44:51.060
Aquinas says, yeah, but maybe that's a punishment.

44:51.060 --> 44:53.420
Because maybe all that is leading him away from God.

44:53.420 --> 44:55.340
And actually that's God's way of punishing him.

44:55.340 --> 44:57.580
And the fact that you don't have wealth in a big house

44:57.580 --> 44:59.140
is actually a great gift to you.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.460
Because now it frees you for doing God's will.

45:02.460 --> 45:07.460
So we can't read God's favor in worldly terms.

45:08.460 --> 45:13.140
I would say God's favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?

45:13.140 --> 45:15.380
Then I know that I'm finding God's favor.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.100
Now God might decide, sure,

45:17.100 --> 45:18.580
I want you to have this and that.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.100
I wanna provide this to you.

45:20.100 --> 45:20.940
Fine.

45:20.940 --> 45:21.900
Then I say, thank you, Lord.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.220
How can I use it as an instrument of love?

45:25.860 --> 45:27.820
All the masters talk about detachment.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.300
And that's another reason I don't like the prosperity

45:29.300 --> 45:31.700
gospel is though I'm getting attached now

45:31.700 --> 45:34.060
to all these material advantages.

45:34.060 --> 45:37.260
And I'm even seeing them as a sign of God's favor.

45:37.260 --> 45:38.340
Let go of all that.

45:38.340 --> 45:41.060
You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.

45:41.060 --> 45:43.340
So if you're rich, the right question is,

45:43.340 --> 45:46.260
okay, Lord, why did you allow me to become rich?

45:46.260 --> 45:47.660
So that what can I do?

45:47.660 --> 45:50.020
How can my riches be an expression of love?

45:50.020 --> 45:52.380
If I am popular, if I am healthy,

45:52.380 --> 45:53.660
okay, why am I popular?

45:53.660 --> 45:54.500
Why am I healthy?

45:54.500 --> 45:56.620
How can I use that for your good?

45:56.620 --> 45:59.900
I'm sick in bed, I'm suffering.

45:59.900 --> 46:03.420
Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?

46:03.420 --> 46:05.420
So I'd rather measure it that way

46:05.420 --> 46:07.500
than through worldly success.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.980
That's why I'm against the prosperity gospel.

46:09.980 --> 46:10.820
Okay.

46:10.820 --> 46:15.540
So there is, don't seek worldly possessions,

46:15.540 --> 46:19.220
but whatever happens to you, good or bad,

46:19.220 --> 46:21.820
seek how that could be used

46:21.820 --> 46:23.900
to increase the amount of love in the world.

46:23.900 --> 46:24.740
Right.

46:24.820 --> 46:27.300
Image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,

46:27.300 --> 46:29.820
which is a device on a lot of the Gothic cathedrals.

46:29.820 --> 46:32.380
And it's this great circle, right, this wheel.

46:32.380 --> 46:35.180
At the top of it is a king, and then it turns this way,

46:35.180 --> 46:36.500
and the king has lost his crown,

46:36.500 --> 46:37.900
and the bottom is a pauper.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.540
And then over here is a king,

46:39.540 --> 46:42.460
is a guy climbing up to power, right?

46:42.460 --> 46:45.700
And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.660
And the idea is very simple, but very profound,

46:47.660 --> 46:49.380
that the wheel is life.

46:49.380 --> 46:51.860
It's sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.

46:51.900 --> 46:55.180
Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.

46:55.180 --> 46:56.780
Other times you're losing it, you're going down.

46:56.780 --> 46:57.940
Other times you got none of it.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.460
Other times you're coming back up.

46:59.460 --> 47:01.820
Okay, don't live on the rim of the wheel.

47:01.820 --> 47:02.860
It'll make you crazy.

47:02.860 --> 47:04.540
Every point on the rim of the wheel

47:04.540 --> 47:06.260
is a point of anxiety.

47:06.260 --> 47:08.260
Where you should live is the center of the wheel,

47:08.260 --> 47:10.060
where Christ is, right?

47:10.060 --> 47:13.300
Because that's the link now to the eternity of God.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.620
That's the point of love,

47:15.620 --> 47:17.580
where love can flow through you to the world.

47:17.580 --> 47:19.940
And then you can look at the wheel.

47:19.940 --> 47:21.220
You're a Beatles fan, right?

47:21.220 --> 47:22.060
I think I discovered that.

47:22.060 --> 47:23.300
I love the Beatles.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.460
And the song that always comes to my mind

47:25.460 --> 47:26.740
when I think of that image

47:26.740 --> 47:28.740
is John Lennon at the end of his life.

47:29.660 --> 47:33.140
So a guy that, I mean, rode the wheel of fortune like crazy.

47:33.140 --> 47:36.460
He was at the top of the world in every way.

47:36.460 --> 47:39.020
And then Beatles break up and he kind of loses it.

47:39.020 --> 47:41.300
And then he's at the lost weekend in the seventies

47:41.300 --> 47:42.580
at the very bottom.

47:42.580 --> 47:45.260
When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.

47:45.260 --> 47:48.460
But the song I always think of is watching the wheels, right?

47:48.460 --> 47:50.260
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.740
I really love to watch them roll

47:51.740 --> 47:54.380
because I'm no longer riding on the merry-go-round.

47:54.380 --> 47:55.980
That's right out of the medieval mystics,

47:55.980 --> 47:59.260
that he's not riding on the wheel.

47:59.260 --> 48:01.300
He's just watching it go round and round.

48:01.300 --> 48:04.540
That's the point of, the Greeks call it apotheia,

48:04.540 --> 48:07.940
and the Latins call it indifference.

48:09.060 --> 48:12.620
Not like I'm blasé, it just means I'm detached

48:12.620 --> 48:16.860
from success, failure, less success, more success.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.140
I'm detached from that.

48:18.140 --> 48:20.660
I'm sitting here watching the wheel go round and round

48:20.660 --> 48:22.580
because I'm not riding on it anymore.

48:22.580 --> 48:25.620
The mystics have always made that transition.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.860
Let me ask you a difficult question

48:27.860 --> 48:29.980
about the darker sides of human nature,

48:29.980 --> 48:34.420
of human power, of institutions.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.100
What's your view on the long history

48:36.100 --> 48:39.700
and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children

48:39.700 --> 48:40.820
by a Catholic priest?

48:40.820 --> 48:42.980
So this is a difficult topic,

48:42.980 --> 48:45.500
but maybe an important one to shine a light on.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.340
Yeah, it's awful.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.500
And it's been a problem.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.060
Go back to Peter Damien,

48:50.060 --> 48:52.380
back in the 11th century, he was talking about it.

48:52.380 --> 48:53.340
So it's been a problem.

48:53.340 --> 48:55.700
And whenever really sinful human beings

48:55.700 --> 48:57.500
have been in close proximity to children,

48:57.500 --> 48:59.420
we find this issue.

48:59.420 --> 49:00.580
Has it been around the church?

49:00.580 --> 49:01.420
Yes.

49:03.380 --> 49:06.020
Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way

49:06.020 --> 49:07.060
in the last 30 years?

49:07.060 --> 49:07.940
Absolutely.

49:09.940 --> 49:12.580
I'm glad the church has made important strides,

49:12.580 --> 49:14.060
and it has.

49:14.060 --> 49:16.860
Back in 2002, there was a thing called the Dallas Accords,

49:16.860 --> 49:18.380
and the Bishops of America

49:18.380 --> 49:20.380
put a lot of these protocols in place

49:20.380 --> 49:22.580
that really have been effective

49:22.580 --> 49:24.620
at ameliorating this problem.

49:24.620 --> 49:27.340
The numbers spiked in the 70s and 80s,

49:27.340 --> 49:29.340
and that's been demonstrated over and over again.

49:29.340 --> 49:31.380
And then they fell dramatically after that.

49:31.380 --> 49:33.740
So that's not to excuse anything,

49:33.740 --> 49:36.300
but it's to say I think progress has been made with it.

49:36.300 --> 49:38.900
What's the impulse to secrecy?

49:38.900 --> 49:40.900
Yeah, well, to protect institutions.

49:40.900 --> 49:43.500
And that's always, that's a sinful instinct.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.340
I'm not altogether.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.220
I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting,

49:46.220 --> 49:48.020
but if it reaches the point where you're indifferent

49:48.020 --> 49:52.140
to people's wellbeing, then you're in trouble.

49:52.140 --> 49:57.140
So institution's role should be transparent and honest

49:57.340 --> 50:01.260
with the sins of its members and of itself.

50:01.260 --> 50:02.260
Sure, yeah.

50:04.260 --> 50:08.020
So maybe you can speak to the fact as a priest,

50:08.020 --> 50:11.980
a bishop, as part of Catholicism,

50:13.380 --> 50:15.340
you're not allowed to marry.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.540
You're not allowed to have sex.

50:18.900 --> 50:21.260
You're sworn to celibacy.

50:22.380 --> 50:25.140
What is behind that idea?

50:25.140 --> 50:28.220
What is the sort of, we talked about some broad stroke,

50:29.260 --> 50:31.660
ideas of love.

50:31.660 --> 50:33.540
What's behind the idea of celibacy?

50:33.540 --> 50:34.540
And that's a good way to get at it.

50:34.540 --> 50:35.780
It's a path of love.

50:35.780 --> 50:39.380
So the church is always in favor of inculcating love.

50:39.380 --> 50:42.420
Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.500
St. Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied

50:46.500 --> 50:48.660
with the things of this world and family,

50:48.660 --> 50:50.740
and those who are free from that

50:50.740 --> 50:53.420
are freer for doing the work of God.

50:53.420 --> 50:56.340
So that's kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy.

50:56.340 --> 50:59.100
And we still, I think, take that seriously.

50:59.100 --> 50:59.980
Look at my own life.

50:59.980 --> 51:03.060
I mean, celibacy has enabled me to do all kinds of things

51:03.060 --> 51:07.940
and go places and minister in a way that I could not

51:07.940 --> 51:09.340
if I had been married.

51:09.340 --> 51:10.180
So I get it.

51:10.180 --> 51:11.260
I get the pragmatic side.

51:11.260 --> 51:14.540
But I'm more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.

51:17.300 --> 51:18.940
Remember, Jesus was challenged about the person

51:18.940 --> 51:22.540
who had a whole series of husbands and then they all died.

51:22.540 --> 51:25.180
And so in heaven, which one will love,

51:25.180 --> 51:26.740
which husband will the wife have?

51:26.740 --> 51:30.420
And his answer is in heaven, people don't marry

51:30.420 --> 51:31.540
and they're not given in marriage.

51:31.540 --> 51:34.340
There's a higher way of love.

51:34.340 --> 51:35.780
It's a more radical way of love.

51:35.780 --> 51:37.580
It's not tied to a particular,

51:37.580 --> 51:40.060
but I think through God is tied to everybody.

51:40.940 --> 51:42.420
The celibate, and this has been

51:42.420 --> 51:45.100
from the beginning of the church, not as a law,

51:45.100 --> 51:47.300
but there were celibates from the very beginning

51:47.300 --> 51:50.500
of the church, including Jesus, of course, and Paul.

51:52.260 --> 51:54.900
They sense something that that way of living

51:55.780 --> 51:58.780
mystically anticipates the way we'll love in heaven.

51:58.780 --> 52:02.540
It's a sign even now within this world

52:02.540 --> 52:04.820
of how we will all love in heaven.

52:04.820 --> 52:08.580
So in that way, it's a bit like pacifists

52:10.100 --> 52:12.380
I'm glad there are pacifists in the church.

52:12.380 --> 52:17.380
And I've known some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.

52:19.340 --> 52:22.460
I'm glad they're pacifists because they witness even now

52:22.460 --> 52:25.340
to how we will be in heaven when every tear is wiped away

52:25.340 --> 52:26.940
and we beat our swords into plowshares

52:26.940 --> 52:30.020
and heaven's a place of radical peace,

52:30.020 --> 52:32.100
that some people even now live it.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.140
At the same time, I'm glad not everyone's a pacifist

52:35.140 --> 52:38.300
because I would hold with the church to just war theory

52:38.300 --> 52:42.140
that there's sometimes all we can do in this finite world

52:42.140 --> 52:45.620
is to fight manifest wickedness.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.780
And just in the same way, there's just sex.

52:48.780 --> 52:51.780
Well, no, right, I'm glad there are celibates,

52:51.780 --> 52:53.660
but I'm glad not everyone's a celibate.

52:53.660 --> 52:57.180
I wouldn't want that because married love

52:57.180 --> 52:59.780
is a marvelous expression of the divine love.

52:59.780 --> 53:02.020
So that's why it's good there are some

53:02.020 --> 53:03.780
and it's always been a small number.

53:03.780 --> 53:06.560
The actual experience of it, would you,

53:07.520 --> 53:10.760
the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting?

53:10.760 --> 53:13.680
So I've been enjoying fasting recently,

53:13.680 --> 53:18.680
so not eating for several days, that kind of stuff.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.760
And that somehow brings you even deeper.

53:21.760 --> 53:25.040
I'm in general in love with nature and everything.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.680
I see the beauty in the world,

53:26.680 --> 53:29.640
but there's a greater intensity to that

53:29.640 --> 53:31.600
when you're fasting, for example.

53:31.600 --> 53:34.200
Yeah, I might use the language of sublimation

53:34.240 --> 53:36.080
or redirection of energy and all that.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.920
I think that's true, there's a certain sublimation

53:39.920 --> 53:44.920
of energies into prayer, into mysticism, into ministry,

53:48.360 --> 53:50.720
a redirection of energies.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.920
So it's meant to be life enhancing.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.720
The same way fasting is, it's meant ultimately

53:54.720 --> 53:57.520
to be life enhancing and make you healthier and happier.

53:57.520 --> 54:00.240
So celibacy is a path of love,

54:00.240 --> 54:01.200
and I think it does involve you

54:01.200 --> 54:03.640
a certain redirection of energies, I'd say that.

54:03.640 --> 54:08.640
Don't you think, do you think it's a heavy burden

54:09.120 --> 54:12.440
for some humans to bear, for some priests to bear?

54:12.440 --> 54:17.440
Is that the thing, given the sexual abuse scandal,

54:19.880 --> 54:22.240
is that the thing that breaks humans?

54:22.240 --> 54:24.240
No, I wouldn't tie that to celibacy,

54:24.240 --> 54:27.360
and that's been demonstrated over and over again.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.720
There's a priest named Andrew Greeley,

54:28.720 --> 54:30.800
he was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago,

54:30.800 --> 54:32.920
and Andy did a lot of research,

54:32.920 --> 54:34.200
he was a sociologist of religion,

54:34.200 --> 54:36.080
did a lot of research into that very question,

54:36.080 --> 54:37.720
and there really is not a correlation

54:37.720 --> 54:40.920
between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse

54:40.920 --> 54:42.720
of children or of anybody.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.440
So I wouldn't make that correlation.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.280
So bad people, sinful people are going to do

54:47.280 --> 54:48.520
what they're going to do.

54:48.520 --> 54:50.880
I think people who have a tendency

54:50.880 --> 54:55.760
toward abusing children sexually are drawn to situations

54:55.760 --> 54:58.520
where they get ready access to kids

54:58.520 --> 55:00.760
and they get institutional cover.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.880
So that's the thing, I can go through the list

55:03.880 --> 55:06.400
from sports and Boy Scouts, et cetera,

55:06.400 --> 55:07.960
and that's been proven again and again.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.600
So I would tie it more to that.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.080
I wouldn't tie it to celibacy.

55:11.080 --> 55:13.640
So the challenge, of course, there's all kinds of,

55:13.640 --> 55:15.280
you said institutional cover,

55:15.280 --> 55:17.800
there's all kinds of institutions that cover

55:17.800 --> 55:22.720
for people that don't, that do evil onto the world,

55:22.720 --> 55:25.480
that do sinful things onto the world.

55:25.480 --> 55:27.120
But there's something about the church,

55:27.120 --> 55:32.120
which is as an organism is supposed to be an embodiment

55:32.800 --> 55:35.760
of good in this world, of love in this world,

55:35.760 --> 55:39.240
and it breaks people's hearts to see this kind of,

55:39.240 --> 55:42.880
even a small amount, this kind of thing happen

55:42.880 --> 55:44.240
within the church.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.080
It wakes you up to the cruelty,

55:46.080 --> 55:48.280
the absurdity of the world sometimes.

55:48.280 --> 55:52.960
Like it's back to the question

55:52.960 --> 55:56.720
of why do bad things happen to good people?

55:56.760 --> 56:00.080
Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?

56:00.080 --> 56:02.560
And sort of maybe unanswerable question.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.240
Do you have an answer to that question?

56:04.240 --> 56:08.000
I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.160
which is true enough.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.840
It's completely emotionally unsatisfying,

56:12.840 --> 56:15.400
but it's naming it truthfully enough.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.920
And it goes back to Augustine,

56:16.920 --> 56:21.920
which is God permits evil to bring about a greater good.

56:24.040 --> 56:25.880
Now again, I know how unsatisfying

56:25.880 --> 56:29.160
that sort of spare, austere language can sound,

56:29.160 --> 56:32.360
but it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.

56:32.360 --> 56:34.880
Aquinas, when he lays out a question,

56:34.880 --> 56:37.000
he always has the objections first.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.400
So is there a God?

56:38.400 --> 56:40.880
Well, objection one, objection two, objection three.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.600
And he's really, talk about steel manning an argument.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.960
Aquinas is great at that.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.360
One of the really steel manned arguments,

56:49.360 --> 56:51.880
is that the right grammatical form?

56:51.880 --> 56:55.040
What's the past participle about the steel man?

56:55.040 --> 56:58.960
So one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.440
If one of two contraries be infinite,

57:03.440 --> 57:05.440
the other would be altogether destroyed.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.520
And as an example from his medieval physics,

57:08.520 --> 57:09.840
he goes, if there were an infinite heat,

57:09.840 --> 57:11.560
there'd be no cold, right?

57:11.560 --> 57:14.720
But God is described as infinitely good.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.640
Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil,

57:18.640 --> 57:22.080
but there is evil, therefore God does not exist.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.480
That's a darn good argument.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.080
That's a really persuasive argument.

57:25.080 --> 57:27.880
And I think, I've done this for a long time

57:27.880 --> 57:31.720
in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy,

57:31.720 --> 57:33.560
that's the best argument against God.

57:34.800 --> 57:37.160
But here's something, before I press head with it,

57:37.160 --> 57:38.680
something I find really interesting.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.560
I think the three best arguments against God

57:41.560 --> 57:44.400
all come from within the religious tradition,

57:44.400 --> 57:46.000
namely the book of Job.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.720
So Job, he's great.

57:49.720 --> 57:51.160
I mean, he's a great guy.

57:51.160 --> 57:52.400
He does everything right.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.800
He's God's great servant,

57:54.800 --> 57:58.440
and he's punished in every possible way.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.600
He has every possible suffering.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.680
Aquinas' argument from the summa,

58:02.680 --> 58:06.040
and then to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.

58:06.040 --> 58:10.120
I think in the Brothers Karamazov, Ivan's argument

58:10.120 --> 58:13.120
when he's trying to wreck the faith of Alyosha,

58:13.120 --> 58:18.120
and these examples drawn, they think, from Dostoevsky

58:18.160 --> 58:20.520
from the headlines of his own time

58:20.560 --> 58:24.480
of the most abject cruelty to children,

58:24.480 --> 58:27.920
like an innocent child being made to suffer.

58:27.920 --> 58:32.040
How in God's name could that happen

58:32.040 --> 58:34.400
if God exists and he's all good?

58:34.400 --> 58:36.920
So I get it, but see the book of Job,

58:36.920 --> 58:38.360
Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky,

58:38.360 --> 58:41.040
these are all profoundly believing people.

58:41.040 --> 58:43.240
Like when I hear Stephen Fry,

58:43.240 --> 58:46.400
the famously atheist writer,

58:46.400 --> 58:50.200
he will bring out this argument with great authority.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.480
He does, of children with bone cancer

58:53.480 --> 58:55.680
and worms that go into the eyes of children

58:55.680 --> 58:57.680
and blind them before they kill them.

58:57.680 --> 59:01.680
But he's been preceded by the author of Job,

59:01.680 --> 59:03.240
Thomas Aquinas and Dostoevsky,

59:03.240 --> 59:08.240
who stood right, think of Job, in the whirlwind.

59:08.840 --> 59:12.040
He stands there in the whirlwind.

59:12.040 --> 59:15.320
So you can't blame the Christian tradition

59:15.320 --> 59:17.400
for not dealing with this problem,

59:17.400 --> 59:20.180
for like brushing it under the carpet.

59:21.100 --> 59:23.460
It has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.

59:23.460 --> 59:25.500
It's still a difficult problem to deal with,

59:25.500 --> 59:27.900
that there's all this cruelty of the world.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.860
There's a lot of example through history,

59:31.860 --> 59:36.780
just in my own family history with the Soviet Union,

59:36.780 --> 59:41.780
with Stalin, the atrocities that Stalin has brought on

59:44.660 --> 59:46.940
to the people of the Soviet Union

59:46.940 --> 59:50.980
throughout the 20th century is nearly immeasurable.

59:52.620 --> 59:57.100
And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history,

59:57.100 --> 59:59.860
you will see progress, not just the Soviet Union,

59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.460
but the entirety of the civilization

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.940
throughout the 20th century.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.840
And Stalin has a role to play.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.740
There's a dark aspect to somehow evil

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.700
helps us make progress.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.860
And I don't know how to put that in the calculation.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.700
On the local scale, I want to alleviate suffering.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.700
I'm probably a heavily lean pacifist,

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.420
not out of weakness, but out of strength.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:36.420
But man, it does seem that history is sprinkled with evil

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.340
and that evil does somehow nudge us towards good.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.180
Yes, sometimes we can see it.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.620
And that's where the idea comes from,

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.900
that evil's permitted to bring about some greater good.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.380
And we can sometimes really see it.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.940
Can we always see it?

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.380
No, in fact, typically we don't see it.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.180
But now you bring another factor into this,

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.900
which is the difference between our minds and God's mind.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.140
So our minds, I mean, look, even they're remarkably capacious,

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.540
but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.740
of space and time.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.020
And even our eyes can take in so much of the light spectrum

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.140
and these little ape sensorium that we have

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.580
that can just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.500
How are we ever in a position to say,

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.740
oh no, there's no possible good

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.180
that would ever come from that?

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.820
Even the greatest evil that every Dostoevsky

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.620
can conjure up and Stephen Fry.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.260
Still, how could we have the arrogance to say,

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.540
I know there's no good that could ever come from that.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.700
I know there's no morally justifiable reason

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.380
why God would ever permit that.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.220
Because I think that's hubris to the nth degree

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.860
for us to say that.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.260
And that's the assumption behind this claim

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.700
that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.140
Now God understands it,

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.780
but we're like little kids, like a four-year-old,

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.300
and their parents make a decision,

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.380
and we said, what in the, why in the world

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.620
would you do this to me?

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.220
This is my pastoral experience, years ago,

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.980
there was a young father and his son was like three

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.620
or something, and he was in the hospital for something,

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.420
I forgot what it was, but he had to undergo surgery, right?

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.700
So after the surgery, he's in great pain,

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.620
this poor kid, this three-year-old kid,

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.420
and the dad was there with him, holding his hand.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.700
And the son, this is what the father told me,

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.660
he said, he's looking at me, like, what gives here?

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.260
I mean, why would you, you love me, I've always assumed that,

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.220
and yet you're presiding over this somehow,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.860
you're approving of this,

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.540
and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.500
And he said the kid couldn't articulate that,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.660
but his eyes did, and the father said,

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.700
it was just killing me,

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.780
because I knew I couldn't explain it to him.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.300
And it's true, I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward,

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.140
but the kid didn't understand surgery,

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.260
and cutting his body, and taking things out of it,

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.780
and that this was gonna make him much better

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.100
in the long run.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.700
But I remember thinking, that's a great metaphor

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.180
for us vis-a-vis God, is here's God,

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.500
infinitely loving God, who's with us all the time,

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.820
and we say, what are you doing?

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.260
Why aren't you taking this away from me?

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.140
And the answer, I mean, ultimately, is trust.

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.140
Trust me, trust me, surrender to me.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.900
And when we don't, that's, we get in trouble

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.980
with the old pride, and the hubris,

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.420
and all that kind of stuff.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.540
Yeah, no, but trust me when I tell you,

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.220
I mean, I completely get it in my own life,

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.140
and as a priest, you're dealing with suffering all the time,

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.500
with people in pain all the time.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.460
I remember as a young priest,

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:48.060
there was a policeman in our parish, so he had a gun,

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.860
and inexplicably, no one had any clue.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.540
He got up one night, shot his son to death,

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.140
and then shot himself.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.300
This is my parish.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.340
So I went to the wake, I remember, I show up,

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.780
I'm this young, 27-year-old goofball priest,

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.140
I have my Roman collar on, and I walk in,

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.020
and there were two coffins.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.260
There were two coffins in the room,

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.860
there's the son and the father, and the mother was there.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.500
And she went like this to me, like,

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.900
she saw me, like, okay, you're the religious guy here.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.740
What?

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.060
And just by instinct, I went like that, too.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.940
I went like, I don't know what to tell her, I can't.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.260
I don't have an answer for you.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.980
But I was there, and I'm not saying

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.660
to pat myself on the back, it's just,

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:40.980
that's where the church goes, because Jesus went there.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.900
See, now we're gesturing toward a more theological response.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.100
The first one's more austerely philosophical,

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.500
God permits evil to bring about a good.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.500
But the theological response is, that's where Christ went,

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.020
is he went all the way down.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.740
He went all the way down into our suffering.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:01.860
And see the cross as the limit case of evil.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.100
Humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.180
and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.780
and death, it's all there.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.020
And that's where the son of God went.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.380
And I would say that's why, as a priest, I went there.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.100
That's my job, is to go to those places, you know?

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.180
So that's the ultimate answer to the problem.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:30.860
So there is, we can't comprehend it,

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.060
but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.340
We trust it because we know on other grounds

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.180
of God's existence.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.700
See, I would resist the claim that,

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.460
well, this is such a knockdown argument,

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.700
so now we know there is no God.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.380
I would say, no, there are all kinds

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.940
of other rational warrants for God.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.700
And so I know that God exists,

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.340
I know that God is infinite love,

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.020
and now I gotta square that with this experience.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:58.220
And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.180
that God knows what he's about, you know?

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.660
Again, I know how inadequate that always seems

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.740
to anyone who's suffering, including myself,

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.700
when I'm in great suffering.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.980
But I think that's the best that we've done

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.300
in the great tradition.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:16.180
So if you were to steal man the case against God

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.620
or the existence of God,

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.940
you find the most convincing argument

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.420
is there's evil in the world,

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.620
therefore there's no God.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.460
There's too much of it.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.060
Yeah, if I were to steal man that argument,

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.340
I'd do what Stephen Fry does.

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:30.180
I would do what Dostoevsky's Ivan does.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.500
I would do exactly that.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.180
I would say there's just too much.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.300
And then if you wanna keep pressing it, animal suffering.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.980
So we talk about human suffering,

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.900
but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.580
Isn't there just too much suffering

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.340
to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.980
And that's, again, Thomas Aquinas.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.020
I've just used his very steel manned argument.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.220
You mentioned that, again, on Reddit,

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.020
somebody asked who your favorite communicator

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.900
of atheist ideas was,

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.940
and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:06.820
Yeah.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.820
Are there other ideas for atheism

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.020
that you find particularly challenging?

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.020
Well, that's the one, is the problem of evil.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.740
The other objection in Aquinas,

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.380
which has a lot of contemporary resonance,

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.340
is can't we just explain everything through natural causes?

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.980
Why would you have to invoke a cause

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.420
beyond the causes in the world?

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.620
So as I'm trying to explain,

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.020
let's say for Aquinas, motion, causality, finality,

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.180
can I just do that with natural causes?

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.460
Wouldn't that suffice to explain it?

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.780
So I get like when naturalists are speaking

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.420
or people that are pure materialists,

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.820
they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.940
A scientific account of reality

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:54.220
is utterly adequate to our experience.

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.820
So I would steel man that and say,

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.660
well, show me why we need something more.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.620
And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato's cave,

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.700
it seems to me.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.220
Because my objection to naturalism

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.140
is it's staying within the realm

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.900
of the immediately empirically observable

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.380
and making the mistake of saying

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.740
that's all there is to being.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.860
That's all there is that needs to be explained.

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.420
And long before we get to religion, just stay with Plato.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.860
The first step out of the cave,

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.100
if you combine it now with the parable of the line,

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.140
is mathematical objects.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:36.540
And I'm with those, the many people that would say,

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.780
mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.860
I've stepped out of a merely empirical,

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.020
physical, naturalistic world.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.900
The minute I understand a pure number or a pure equation

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.100
or a pure mathematical relationship,

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.420
which would obtain in any possible world,

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.860
which are not tied to space and time,

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.380
that's a first step out of the cave.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.580
And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.060
For example, in the nature of being.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.860
I mean, so I could talk about this thing

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.700
as a physical object and I can analyze it

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.780
at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.580
up and down through this thing and fine, fine.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.940
But I'm still in Plato's cave.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.700
I'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.220
But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm,

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.980
I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.380
Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.900
so large that it encompasses the whole world?

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.900
Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.620
in terms of, scientifically speaking,

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.220
most of the world we haven't figured out yet,

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.700
but do you think it's possible through science

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.500
to know God, to look outside the world?

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.060
So it's fundamentally the limit

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.500
of the empirical scientific method

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.860
is that we can't know some of these very big questions.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.100
No, I love the, I'm not a scientist

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.260
and I was never all that good at science.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.620
I was more humanities guy,

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.460
but I love and respect the sciences,

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.780
but I hate scientism and scientism is rampant today

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.460
with especially young people.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.820
The reduction of all knowledge

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.220
to the scientific form of knowledge,

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.580
and I'm a vehement opponent of that.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.820
There are dimensions of being that are not capturable

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.500
through a scientific method of mere observation,

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.220
hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.900
As great as that is, as wonderful as that is,

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.420
but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.060
And that's not to say it's not real.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.220
It's just at a relatively low level of reality.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.500
You step out of Plato's cave

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.940
when you go into the pure mathematics.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.940
That's why, you know that article,

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.380
I just came across it recently

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.580
and discovered this whole literature around it

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.740
is Eugene Wigner's article in 1960

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.500
called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.580
to the physical sciences.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.500
I think that's the title of it.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.860
Or effectiveness or something like that, yeah.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.060
But what's so cool is, you know, he's not a religious man.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.940
He was a kind of a secular Jew,

01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.700
but yet he uses the word miracle

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.340
like eight times in that article.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.580
And because he just is so impressed by the fact

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.940
that high complex mathematics describes

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.580
so accurately the physical world

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:13.180
and can be used to create things and to manipulate.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.340
And why should that be true?

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.500
That there's something very weirdly mysterious

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.060
about that relationship, you know?

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.780
And I would say it's because you stepped

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.780
into a higher order of being,

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.220
which is inclusive of a lower level of being.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.140
That's the Platonic approach is that as you move,

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.220
now I'm going to a different metaphor,

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.340
you move to higher levels,

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.340
they're inclusive of the lower levels.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.540
Yeah, there's some magic there

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:38.180
that seems to at least in our current understanding

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:42.300
of science to be not quite capturable,

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.220
even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.740
Can I ask you, where do you think

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.020
the laws of nature come from?

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.860
So, I mean, sort of the vigner question,

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.860
where does the deep mathematical structure

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.260
of things come from?

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.300
How do you explain that?

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.700
The mathematical structure or the fact

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:04.300
that the structure is somehow pleasing and beautiful.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.980
Because those are two different.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.180
I would do the first one for, I'm just curious,

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.060
where do you think it comes from?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.300
I tend to believe even in terms of physics,

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.220
we don't really know what's going on.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.660
There's so, so, so much more to be discovered.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.100
We're walking around in the dark,

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.620
trying to figure out a little puzzles here and there,

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.660
and we're patting ourselves on the back

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.140
on how many puzzles we've discovered so far.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.220
Even Gaito's incompleteness theorem,

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.020
what are the limits of mathematics,

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.100
axiomatic systems?

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.300
I don't know what is the purpose of mathematics.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.900
What is the power of mathematics?

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:43.900
Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us,

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.340
or is it something deeper that we're just discovering?

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.540
All I know from my emotional perspective,

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.060
now I am an engineer, I'm a robotics AI person,

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.260
from an emotional perspective,

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.020
I just find the whole thing beautiful.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.980
Yeah, but that's really cool to me.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.900
It's a very interesting clue.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.460
See, one of the arguments for God

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.460
is based on the intelligibility of the world.

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.540
This very, it's like Wigner, it's a very peculiar fact.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.260
It seems to me that the world is so radically intelligible.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.500
Why should that be true?

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.980
Why should it be the case

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.900
that being has this intelligible structure to it?

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.660
So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:25.500
So Aquinas can say that the intelligible in act

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.340
is the intellect in act,

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.660
meaning there's some deep correspondence

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:34.620
between this and that, and it's, I'm with Wigner.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:39.020
That's, I think, really weird and unreasonable and strange.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.020
Now, my answer is, because the creator of the universe

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:48.540
is a great mind and has stamped the world

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.580
with intelligibility.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.340
In the beginning was the word, right?

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340
And the word was with God,

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.700
and all things came to be through the word.

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.740
Don't, we shouldn't picture that so much.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.980
It's gesturing in this very powerful direction.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.580
There's an intelligence

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.940
that has imbued the world with intelligibility.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.020
And we discover that, you know?

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.420
There's something about the simplicity

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.940
of the way the world works.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.620
That's where the beauty comes from.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.620
And yes, there is something profound to the mechanism,

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:23.260
whatever that is, God that brought that to be.

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.460
The thought into being, that the world has been,

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.380
and the Bible says that God said, let there be light,

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.660
and there was light, God said,

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.580
well, again, we don't literalize the poetry,

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.020
but it's very rich that God spoke the world into being.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.540
So that means it's been imbued with intelligibility

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540
from the beginning.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.660
They say that, you know, the condition for the possibility

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.780
of the Western physical sciences

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.980
was a basically Christian idea,

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.460
namely that the world is not God.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.660
Therefore, I can analyze it, experiment upon it.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.660
I can, I don't divinize it.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.740
I don't have a mystical relation to the world.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.980
It's not God.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.140
But secondly, that it's absolutely

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.340
in every nook and cranny intelligible.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.740
And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.780
So it's been created, it's not God, it's other than God,

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.380
but yet it's touched in every dimension by God's mind.

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.460
And when those two things are in place,

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.460
the sciences get underway, you know?

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.620
I don't worship the world anymore,

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.380
but I'm also utterly confident I can come to know it.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.580
And those are theological ideas.

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.180
Well, we live in this world,

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.660
so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.020
by making the assumption

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.740
that this world is fully understandable.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.900
And we don't need to worry about what's outside the world

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.460
in some sense in order to build bridges and rockets

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.660
and computers and all that kind of stuff.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.180
It's only when we get to the questions that are deeper

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:49.380
about why we're here at all,

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.060
what does it mean to be good, all those kinds of things

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.620
do we need to reach outside of this world?

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:55.980
Can I interrupt another one?

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.380
So I talked about mathematics,

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.740
I think it's stepping out of the cave,

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.780
it's stepping out of just the purely empirical world.

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.140
But then in fact, we use a word like universe,

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.340
to me it's very interesting.

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.540
Even if you say multiple universes,

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.900
to me that it's like, well,

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.500
whatever the whole is, the totality.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.700
Universum, turn toward the one.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.780
Why would we call it that?

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.580
Why wouldn't we just call it an aggregate?

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:21.980
It's just an aggregate of stuff.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.900
It's an aggregate of all, but we call it a universe.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.740
And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition is,

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.340
it's the intuition of being.

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.660
So I immediately experienced things here,

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.060
the color and shape and I can measure them.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.260
But when I've really stepped out of the cave

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.500
and I've now engaged beyond mathematics even,

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.660
I'm now into metaphysical reflection.

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.780
I'm interested not just in this thing as an object

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.260
and how it's colored and shaped

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.580
and what its atoms and quarks and all that are, that's fine.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.500
But I'm interested now in,

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.580
what does it mean to say this thing is real?

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.180
So what makes this a being?

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:58.380
And then what are the characteristics of being?

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.060
So now from Aristotle to Heidegger,

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.660
this question of the nature of being.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.900
Because I would say we call it a universe

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.980
because it's turned toward the one of being.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.580
It's this intuition that whatever,

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.380
from quarks to galaxies to whatever,

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:15.340
give me a billion other universes,

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.500
it would still be existence, right?

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.260
It's turned toward the one,

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.460
that being unites our experience.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.700
And so now I'm at the metaphysical level of analysis.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.180
I've taken another step out of the cave.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.420
In Plato's language, I'm at the formal level now,

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.540
beyond mathematics, the level of forms.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.140
And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical,

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.260
which is inclusive of the physical.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.580
And I think that's Eugene Wigner,

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.300
is that the mathematical includes the physical.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.500
It is metaphysically prior to it.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.420
But here we are sitting in the physical

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.460
trying to make sense of why the unreasonable effectiveness

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.900
of the thing that's beyond, which is the mathematics.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.980
My answer is God.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.700
And I don't know a better answer.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.700
And as I read Wigner, he wasn't ready to say that,

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.460
but I think the language is gesturing.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.860
Who, I was reading someone recently,

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.780
some very well-known physicist,

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.580
who said his answer to Wigner's question is

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.300
that whoever is responsible for the universe

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.580
must be a mathematician.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.180
And I thought, yeah, that's right.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.100
Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.740
You had a great conversation with him.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.220
He has a complicated and nuanced view of faith,

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.940
or faith, period.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.700
He has said that he believes in Jesus, the person,

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.660
and the myth, and some of the full richness and complexity

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.860
that you've talked about.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.540
But he's surprised by his faith.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.420
He's not sure what to make of it.

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.460
He's almost like a meta struggling

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.980
with what the heck his faith means.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.540
He's a super powerful intellect that can't compute

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.220
the faith that he's experiencing.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.420
So what are some interesting differences

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:56.260
between the two of you, or some commonalities

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:59.460
in terms of your understanding of faith?

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.620
He's a very interesting guy.

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.140
And I've had a couple of conversations with him.

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:06.060
And I do think he's moving in the direction of faith.

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.140
And his lectures in the Bible are very fine, I think.

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.540
He reminds me of the Church Fathers,

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.980
because the Church Fathers would have looked at the,

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:15.500
they call it the moral sense of the scripture.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.060
Peterson probably called it the psychological meaning.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.860
But I think he's doing a lot of that.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.580
He, as I read him and talk to him,

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.860
I think he's kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.140
What I mean there is, for Kant, Jesus is,

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.780
it's not so much the historical Jesus,

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:31.900
this figure from long ago.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.980
It's Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.820
He says he's the image of the person

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.500
perfectly pleasing to God.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:43.180
And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:48.100
as a heuristic, as a goal that we're tending toward.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.580
But the historical person of Jesus for Kant is like,

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.980
well, let's not fuss about that so much.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.740
It's this figure.

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.940
And as I read Peterson, especially, and talk to him,

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.820
I think he's kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.860
And even language of like, live as though God exists.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.820
That's the alzob of Kant, you know,

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:09.980
the kind of as if attitude.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.080
And where I perpress him when we talk

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.580
is in the direction of, no, that's not Christianity yet.

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.080
I mean, that's enlightenment, moral philosophy.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.580
But Christianity is very interested

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.860
in this historical figure and very interested

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.500
that God really became one of us.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.620
And he's not just an archetype of the moral life.

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.040
He's someone, he's a person who's invaded our world

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.760
and gone all the way to the bottom of sin

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.240
and thereby saved us, you know.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.760
So the facticity of Jesus and the resurrection.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.320
So like, Peterson will talk about the resurrection

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.120
as a myth and all that,

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.560
and you can find that in different cultures, et cetera.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.360
But Christianity is saying something else.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.880
So in Christianity, when we're talking about who is Jesus,

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.520
it's not just an archetype.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.400
It's not just a myth, it's a historical figure.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.400
And the very grounded fact that God became one of us

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.160
is fundamental to this idea of what Christianity is,

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.360
what it means to be a Christian.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360
It's the sin and the love that came here down to earth

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.800
means we can be one with God.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.680
So that's essential.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.960
It's not just an archetype.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.920
That's right.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.000
You know, it always strikes me the difference

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.040
between, let's say, mythic expressions

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.720
and the New Testament is read someone like, you know,

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.040
Carl Jung and then Joseph Campbell, whom he influenced.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.280
And then now Jordan Peterson, who's very Jungian

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.880
and this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.720
And great.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.960
I mean, I think it's very interesting

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.280
and there's a lot going on there.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.320
There's a sort of calmness though about it.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.720
Like, yeah, interesting.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.440
And that's in this culture and that culture

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.360
and it's the form of the moral life.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.400
And I understand all that.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.200
Then you read the New Testament.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:57.160
Whatever those people are talking about, it's not that.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.880
They are grabbing you by the shoulders

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.040
and shaking you to get your attention,

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.920
to tell you about something that happened to them, right?

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.680
Like the resurrection, the myth of the dying and rising God

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.880
and how powerful it is and shaping our consciousness.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.000
That's fascinating.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.600
That's not the New Testament.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.480
Testament is, did you hear?

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.080
Did you, Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death,

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.080
God raised him from the dead and he was seen by 500

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.680
and he was seen by Peter.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.720
And then lastly, I saw him.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.280
That's how Paul talks.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.200
It's not the detached psychologist musing

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.160
on archetypal things.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.560
And I think that makes a huge difference

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.680
when it comes to Christianity.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.680
The intensity of the historical details are essential here.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:51.000
So if you look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.360
it's not enough to say, well, power corrupts.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.040
And sometimes, so looking at the archetype of Hitler,

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.760
it's much, much more important, much more powerful

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.720
to look at the details of how he came to power,

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.600
what are the ways he did evil onto the world.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.040
And then you can get really intense about your struggle

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.880
with some of the complexities of human nature and power

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.880
on institutions and all that kind of stuff.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.440
So the historical nature of the Bible.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.000
We're a historical religion.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And we've been, we generate philosophical reflection.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.680
We can find common ground with archetypal thinking

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.040
and all that, we can.

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.800
And the church fathers used Greek philosophy

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.440
and Aquinas uses Aristotle and all that's great.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.520
But we're an historical religion and that matters immensely.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.760
Is the Bible the literal word of God?

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.440
How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.640
I think the best way to get at the Bible is to think of it

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.400
as a library, not a book.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.160
So it's a collection of books, right?

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.520
From a wide variety of periods, different authors,

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.440
different audiences and different genre.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.400
So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song,

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.160
you find something like history, not in our sense,

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.600
but something like history.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.720
You find gospel, it's his own genre.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.760
You find epistolary literature like Paul.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.840
You find apocalyptic.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.000
There's all of this in the Bible.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.360
So is the Bible literally the word of God?

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.600
It's like saying, is the library literally true?

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.920
It depends on what section you're in, right?

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.920
So parts of like one and two Samuel, one and two Kings,

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.280
number places in the Old Testament.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.240
Are there elements of the historical in there?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.960
Sure, but it's theologically interpreted history.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.920
It's not like our sense of history of,

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.920
give me 10,000 footnotes and I'm gonna look

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.160
at all the source material I can possibly find.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.080
It's more like ancient history,

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.400
like Herodotus, people like that.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.000
But then there's poetry and there's myth and there's legend

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.840
and there's song and all that stuff in the Bible.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.840
So God breathes through all of it, I would say.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.360
He inspired all of it, right?

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.320
Inspirare, he's breathing through all of it.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.720
God is speaking through all of it.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.880
But he speaks in different voices.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.880
He uses different human instruments

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.600
and he uses different genre and different types of language.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.800
So we have to be sensitive to that

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.240
when we're interpreting the Bible.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.920
So the different instruments are more or less,

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.080
some are more perfect than others in terms of-

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:16.920
No, I wouldn't say that.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.760
I wouldn't say more perfect.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.600
I'd say they're just different.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.200
It's like a symphony and God's like a conductor

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.040
and there's all kinds of different things.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.280
God's like a conductor

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.600
and there's all kinds of different instruments

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.760
in the orchestra and he loves to breathe through the Psalms.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.080
I prayed the Psalms this morning.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.520
I do every day in my office, you know?

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.680
Those are songs.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.040
They probably were literally sung,

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.520
most of them at one point.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.280
He breathes through apocalyptic.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.800
Like we're reading the Book of Revelation now

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.360
in the Easter season and it's this wild and wooly book.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.720
It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.640
And he speaks through the Gospels.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.840
The Gospels correspond in genre

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.160
to what I call ancient biography.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.160
That's the genre of the Gospels.

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.280
It's wrong to call them like mythic or simply literary.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.120
They're like ancient biographies.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.240
You have the Pauline letters,

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.680
which are about particular cities that Paul was visiting

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.360
and particular people he knew.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.360
So you just gotta be sensitive to the genre all the time.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.520
Let's return back to human institutions

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.200
and talk about history of human civilization and politics.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.960
So one question to ask is,

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.080
was America founded as a Christian nation in your view?

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.760
If we look at the Declaration of Independence,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.720
what did the words mean?

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.800
We hold these truths to be self-evident

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.840
that all men are created equal,

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.920
that they are endowed by their creator

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.240
with certain inalienable rights,

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.840
that among these are life, liberty,

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.880
and the pursuit of happiness.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.560
It seems like God is breathing through those words too.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.160
Yeah, I think so.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.280
The founders, it would be some kind of combination of deism.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.960
Certainly Christianity is coming up through them.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.120
Enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.360
So you're not gonna find in our founding fathers

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.800
simply a Thomas Aquinas

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.280
or like a purely classically Christian understanding.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.760
It's Christianity in those various expressions.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.640
Because actually I would see the enlightenment

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.840
as a sort of child of Christianity.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.680
We can talk about that.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.600
But having said all that, yes,

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.640
I think they are expressing at least the residue

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.520
of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.840
That our rights are not created by the government.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.040
They're not doled out by the government.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.440
They come from God.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.760
And the other thing I find really interesting is equality.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.840
Because look in classical philosophy,

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.360
political philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.200
it's not equality.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.120
For them it's our inequality that's really interesting.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.400
So Plato divides us into these three classes

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.040
and Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.040
of property males of sufficient education

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.240
should be in the political life.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.200
The rest should all be in private life.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.120
And then some are suited for slavery.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.720
So, I mean, he divides us dramatically.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.080
Same with Cicero and so on.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.320
Where does this come from?

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.000
This weird idea that we're all equal.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.840
I mean, how?

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.080
We're not equal in beauty, not equal in strength,

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.120
we're not equal in moral attainment,

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.400
we're not equal in intelligence.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.160
So what is it?

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.520
And I think the residue especially comes through

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.760
in that little word.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.520
That all men are created equal.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.600
That's our equality.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.480
That we're all equally children of God.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.880
So take God out of the picture.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.920
I think we are gonna slide rapidly

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.520
into an embrace of inequality.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.760
Now in the classical world, yes.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.560
But heck, look at the 20th century.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.960
I mean, when God is excluded in a very systematic way,

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.200
I think you saw the suspension of rights

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.760
and the suspension of equality like mad.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.480
So no, I think it's very important

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.960
that God is in the picture

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.520
and that we're a nation under God.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.480
It matters enormously.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.320
That's not pie as boilerplate.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.480
That's at the rational foundations of our democracy.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.560
So do you think Nietzsche was onto something

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.360
with the idea looking into the 20th century

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.600
that God is dead?

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.280
That there is a cultural distancing

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.200
from a belief in God?

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.720
Yeah, I'd be somewhat sympathetic

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:23.480
to Jordan Peterson's reading of Nietzsche there.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.520
Namely, it's not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.600
Hey, God is dead.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.160
It's more of a lament.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.120
God is dead and we've killed him.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.480
And what will happen in the wake of that?

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.960
And I think, yeah,

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.720
much of the totalitarianism of the 20th century

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:44.000
follows from that questioning of God

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.960
and the dismissal of God from public life.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.760
So I would be sympathetic with that.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:52.000
When we're beyond good and evil,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.400
and all that's left is the will to power,

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.040
and then why are we surprised that the powerful rise

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.160
and that they use the power less for their purposes?

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.040
When we forget ideas like equality and rights,

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.320
which are grounded in God,

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.960
why are we surprised that death camps follow?

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.480
So I think there's a correlation there for sure.

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.640
I don't know, I believe that there's a capacity

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.720
to do good in all of us and a capacity to do evil.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.480
And there's something that tends towards good,

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.080
whatever that is.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.960
I tend to think that if that community,

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:27.720
that love that we talked about, they find each other,

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.800
they find the good.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.280
If you don't constrain the resources,

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.200
if you don't push them,

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.480
if you don't artificially create conflict

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.320
through power centers and evil, charismatic leaders,

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.000
then people will be good to each other.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.840
And whether that's God or some other source of deep

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.440
moral meaning, that seems to be essential

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.520
for a functioning civilization.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.360
Yeah.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.280
And it's hard, I mean, that's what humans are.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.440
We're searching for what that God is, what that means.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.800
You know what that triggers in my mind?

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.040
I wonder if you agree with this,

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.240
that the modern sciences drew their strength

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.560
from their narrowness.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.760
What I mean there is they almost completely bracketed

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.120
formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense,

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.200
and they focused on efficient and material causality.

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.200
And that gave, as I say, great strength,

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.160
but from the narrowness of focus.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.640
But for Aristotle, the more important causes

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.920
are the final and the formal causes.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.400
And so final causality there, what's drawing us?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.440
So for Aristotle, he'd look at someone like me and say,

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:34.960
okay, you have a intelligible structure,

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.560
and that leads you to seek certain things

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.360
for the perfection of that structure, you know?

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.760
Fair enough, I think that's right.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.680
So I seek the good.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.760
Right now I'm seeking the good of being with you.

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.040
I said, yeah, I'll sit down with Lex Fridman

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.560
and we'll talk about deep and important things.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.320
That's the good I sought this morning when I woke up.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.360
Now, why am I seeking that?

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.960
Well, for a higher reason, a higher good, you know?

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.560
Because it's part of my work, my ministry is to,

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.720
you know, the church reaching out beyond itself

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.160
to the wider culture and, okay, well, why do you want that?

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.080
Well, because I want to bring more and more people

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.680
into what I think is beautiful and true

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.880
and good in the church.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.640
Well, how come you want that?

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.520
Well, because a long time ago,

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.800
I was kind of myself brought into that realm

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.360
and find it very compelling.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.560
Yeah, but then why do you want that?

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.400
Well, because ultimately I want to be friends with God.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.000
Now, I've given you one example there,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.680
but any act of the will, it seems to me,

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.800
has to be analyzed that way.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.160
The will seeks something.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.440
It seeks the good, right, by definition.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.920
But the good always nests like a Russian doll

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.760
in a higher good, right,

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.080
which then nests in a still higher good.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.520
Until you come, this is Aquinas,

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.480
to some, in this sense, uncaused cause,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.280
an uncaused final cause,

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.520
there has to be some summum bonum, right,

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.520
some supreme good that you're looking for.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.800
And that's God, by the way.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.800
That's another, I think, rational path to God

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.600
is every single moment, every day,

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.000
we are implicitly seeking God.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.840
So with your Word on Fire ministries

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.160
and the website and the communication efforts,

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.200
what is the thing you're seeking?

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.560
Just you, if we can pause,

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.200
and for a brief moment, allow you to be prideful.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.800
Or, I'm of course just joking,

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.280
but what is your local efforts?

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.320
Your small little pocket of the world

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:34.320
with smalling quotes with Word on Fire?

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.760
Yeah, it's just using the media,

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.480
especially the new media, the social media,

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.200
to get the gospel out.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.800
So I started, what, 20-some years ago,

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.240
just on a radio show in Chicago,

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.600
5.15 on Sunday morning.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.960
I had a 15-minute sermon show.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.680
And I asked the people in this parish I was at,

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.360
I said, I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.920
at 5.15 on Sunday morning.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.800
And they all laughed when I proposed that.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.040
But they gave me the money.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.000
So that's how I got started,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.720
just doing a sermon on the radio.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.320
And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.320
And then I did a documentary.

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.280
I went all over the world

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.800
and kind of told the story of Catholicism.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.960
So that's how we started.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.800
And now I'm using all the new media and social media.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.080
But what I really love, what we're doing today

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.200
is something I really like,

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.960
which is having a conversation

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.120
outside of just the narrow Catholic world

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.480
or even the narrow Christian world,

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.680
but to look out to the wider culture.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.040
And who's talking about interesting things

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.120
and how can the church engage there?

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.080
And so that's the purpose of Word on Fire,

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:34.920
is to do that.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.280
Is it overwhelming to face

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.800
so many different sort of atheists

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.520
than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.480
and some of the more political style thinkers

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.120
that you've spoken with?

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.960
Is that, what is it?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Dave Rubin who's also has a way different world view as well.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.080
Is that terrifying?

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.640
Is that exciting to you?

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.480
Yeah.

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.680
Is it challenging?

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.560
Yeah, maybe I'll be above, but more exciting.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.000
I would say I like doing that.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.320
I was a teacher for a long time.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.880
I taught in the seminary for like 20 years.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.280
And so I've been engaging these questions for a long time.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.120
I'm a writer, I've written about 20 some books.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.840
So, and I write some at a popular level.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.480
I write some at a high academic level.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.440
And I like doing all that.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.280
So I love those ideas.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.320
I love those questions, love engaging people.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.720
And I find my own experience,

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:32.240
you do run into a course a lot of the vitriol

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.800
and kind of just stupidity and all that online.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.640
And I get it.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.240
And religion is such a magnet for people's hostility

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.080
for different reasons.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:40.920
So I get that.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.720
Like you read it, we talked about it.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.360
You have to wade through swamps of obscenity and everything.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.320
But I do it and I like it and it's worthwhile

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.160
because in that Reddit experience,

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.120
so many of the issues that preoccupy young people,

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.680
I can name them for you exactly what they are.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.640
Comes to religion.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.000
How do you know there's a God?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
So the God question.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.720
Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.720
Third question, why do you think your religion

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.920
is the right religion?

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.320
Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.800
So those are the four things that I found again and again,

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.600
come up when dealing with young people.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:19.240
I've told my brother bishops and priests about that.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.200
I said, structure your adult education programs

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.360
or structure your youth outreach around those four questions.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.400
Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:33.360
How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.640
and a woman and a woman and the institution of marriage?

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:41.240
We love friendship and friendship is at the heart of things.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.120
And so nothing wrong with friendship between a man

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.600
and a man and a woman and a woman.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.360
But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.320
about natural finalities and intelligible forms

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.480
that there's a certain form to human being,

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.840
which includes the physical and includes the sexual.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.280
It has a proper finality.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.360
And so we'd recognize that finality is twofold,

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.080
both unitive and procreative.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720
And so those two we recognize as the appropriate expression

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.160
of human sexuality.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.760
So that's why the church holds to sex between a man

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.280
and a woman within the context of marriage

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.720
is the right expression.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.200
We reach out to everybody in love and in respect

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.960
and deep understanding and seeking to understand

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.880
their lives from the inside.

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.960
So I mean, all of that, I agree with the bridge building

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.640
that we need to do to people like in the gay community

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.120
and people in gay marriage and so on.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.960
So the church holds to the intelligible structure

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:42.000
if you want of human sexuality

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.080
and it reaches out to real human beings

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.880
always in an attitude of invitation and love and so on.

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.720
So it's somewhere in there that the church takes its stance.

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.720
And so there's probably variation in the stances

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.280
that it takes.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.000
So you're saying the institution of marriage

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.280
is about the unitive, which is like the friendship,

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.840
the deep connection between two humans

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.000
and the procreative.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
So being able to have children and all that kind of stuff.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.560
It's interesting.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.560
So is our gay couples seen as sinful?

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.600
So does the church acknowledge the love?

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.440
Yeah.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.400
That's the deep love that's possible between a man and a woman.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.240
I think so.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.360
Yeah, which is why the church says

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.600
in its official teaching, it's the physical expression,

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.400
let's say of sexual passion between two men

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.760
that is problematic, not their friendship,

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.440
not their love for each other.

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.480
So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.600
Well, let me ask you another difficult topic

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.720
that's just happening.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.560
Unlike the other ones we've talked about.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.560
Unlike the other ones we've talked about.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.520
That's going on in the news now.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.080
As we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.920
to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion,

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.960
striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.080
What are your thoughts on this?

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.840
First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.000
making these decisions throughout its history.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.480
And second of all, just the idea,

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.880
the really powerful, the controversial,

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.320
the difficult idea of abortion.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.760
Yeah, I mean, I'm against abortion.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.120
I'm pro-life.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.320
The church recognizes from the moment of conception

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.920
we're dealing with a human life

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.560
that's worthy of respect and protection,

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.720
especially as you see the unfolding of that person,

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.280
across a pregnancy.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.520
But at every stage, we recognize the beauty

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.440
and the dignity of that human being.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.800
And so we stand opposed to this,

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.680
the outright killing of the innocent.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.280
So that's the church's view.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.160
Again, reaching out always in love and understanding

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.080
and compassion to those who are dealing.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.960
And believe me, every single pastor,

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.080
every single priest understands that

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.360
because we deal with people all the time

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.680
who are in these painful situations.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.920
But that's the moral side of it.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.720
The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.320
I think one of the worst expressions of American law

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.000
since the Dred Scott decision.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.840
So I stand in favor of returning Roe v. Wade and Casey.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.120
I think they were terrible.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.000
The Casey decision is instructive to me

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.080
that it belongs to the nature of freedom, that decision says,

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.520
to determine the meaning of one's own life.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.560
And I don't get the language exactly right,

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.720
but end of the universe.

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.600
Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.320
that we can determine the meaning.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.360
See, but that's repugnant

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.440
to everything we've just talked about.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.960
That I'm inventing the meaning of my life

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.120
and of the universe.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.240
And so Casey though was instructive in a way

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.480
because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.560
Is it, I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560
My choice is all that matters.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.920
I would say, no, your choice should be correlated

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.560
to the order of the good.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.120
It's not sovereign.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.480
It doesn't reign sovereignly over being

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.720
and it makes its own decisions.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.040
So I think Casey was terrible law

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.680
and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.840
So I'm in favor of the overturning of those.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.520
I've spoken out that many times.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.560
Now it'll return it to the individual states.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.720
It's not gonna solve the problem.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.760
The individual states will have to decide.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.800
I just heard yesterday,

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.280
we were up in Sacramento,

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.120
the bishops having our annual meeting.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.280
And so we got the word from the governor

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.560
and the legislators that they're gonna push

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.840
for a constitutional amendment in California.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.760
So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.640
in any way, just illegal.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.080
I think that's barbaric.

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.920
So I stand radically opposed to that.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:54.080
It's such an interesting line

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.680
because if you believe that there's a,

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.720
it's a line that struggles with the question

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.760
of what does it mean to be a living being

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.240
or to give life to something?

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.920
Because if you believe that at the moment of conception,

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.800
you're basically creating a human life,

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.420
then abortion is murder.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.920
And then if you don't,

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.200
then it's a sort of basic biological choice

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.400
that's not taking away of a life.

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.280
And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.800
that it's hard and yet so fundamental

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.000
to the question of what it means to be alive

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.400
and the fundamental question about the respect

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.880
for human life and human dignity.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.380
It's interesting to see.

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.200
And also about freedom too.

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.920
All of those things are mixed in there.

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.400
It's a beautiful struggle.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.360
Maybe the freedom is the most important.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.920
This is a freedom run amok or,

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.600
in classical philosophy and theology,

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:07.640
freedom is not self-determination.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.640
Freedom is the disciplining of desire

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.840
so as to make the achievement of the good

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.480
first possible and then effortless.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.320
You know what I'm saying?

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.540
So modern freedom and the roots of that

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.140
are people like William of Ockham in the late middle ages.

01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.320
Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.240
Do I do yes or no?

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.880
And I'm the sovereign subject of that choice.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.460
And on no basis, I will say yes or no.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:39.560
I'm like Louis XIV or I'm like Stalin or something.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.820
But Aquinas wouldn't have recognized that as freedom.

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.000
For him, it's I got this desire in me.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.420
I've got this will and it's pushing toward the good.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:51.280
But the trouble is I got so many attachments

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.760
and I'm so stupid and I'm so conditioned by my sin

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.280
that I can't achieve it.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.520
So I need to be disciplined in my desire

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.880
so as to make that achievement possible

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.400
and then effortless.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:07.960
So right now, I'm freely speaking English to you.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.380
And you had the experience and I've had it too

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.800
of learning a foreign language.

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.120
And don't you feel unfree?

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.760
When you're struggling with a language.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.600
When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.520
and I was okay with French,

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.680
but my first time in a seminar

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:27.080
and there's all these intelligent francophones

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.480
around the table and they're all just,

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.200
and I'm trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:37.200
And I felt unfree because my desire wasn't directed.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.640
But then over time,

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.520
I became freer and freer speaker of French.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.040
I was ordered more to the good.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.680
That's a better understanding of freedom

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.600
than sort of sovereign self-determination.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.760
But our country is now, I think,

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.960
really in the grip of that.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.760
I decide, and that's why the Nietzschean thing

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.320
comes to my mind of the will to power.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.960
I'm beyond good and evil.

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.000
It's just up to me to decide.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.400
God help us.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.160
No, it's the values that we intuit around us,

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.040
intellectual, moral, and aesthetic, the values.

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.360
Think of the dog on the beach again.

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.420
And that you get ordered to those by your education,

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:18.720
by your family, by your religion.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.600
And that's beautiful.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.720
That makes you free.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.200
Now I can freely enter into this.

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.200
So this sovereign self-determination business,

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.200
that's not my game.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.560
The values come in part from the tradition

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.640
carried through the generations.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.720
Let me ask you to put on your wise hat

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.440
and give advice to young folks.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.320
So high school and college.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.520
Thinking about what to do with their life, career.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.920
There's so many options out there.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.320
How can they have a career?

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.000
How can they be proud of,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.520
or even just the life they can be proud of?

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.420
I think I'd say find something you're good at.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.600
Because that's from God.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.720
It's a gift that God's given you.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:06.120
And then dedicate it to love.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:06.940
You know what I'm saying?

01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:11.180
So you're good at science or math or sports or whatever.

01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:13.860
Okay, I'm gonna use that now for my aggrandizement,

01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:17.540
for my wealth, for my privileges and to become famous.

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.000
No, no, no, don't.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.380
Find what you're good at,

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:23.780
but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.040
So use your science and use your mathematics

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.080
and use your sports and use your musicianship

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.840
to benefit the world.

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.880
That's how I'd say them.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.080
So find what you're good at.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:35.920
That's from God.

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.400
Well, that's a tricky one.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:39.040
Finding what you're good at.

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.440
Because it's not just raw skill.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.560
It's also what you connect with.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.000
And it's also like this iterative process

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.500
of if you want to add love to the world,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.640
you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.120
So it's not just the things you're good at.

01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.120
There's like, I'm good at building bridges out of toothpicks.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.560
I'm not exactly sure that's going to be useful

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.640
for the world.

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.840
Then again, to push back on that,

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.360
the joy brings me, maybe somehow the joy radiates out.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.200
Yeah, well, you're good at what you're doing right now.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.240
And you've dedicated that to bringing more light

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.440
and illumination and joy to the world.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.400
But that was a searching.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.360
That's the process of trying stuff and figuring it out.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:30.760
And ultimately, yes, asking the question,

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.640
how is this making the world at all better

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.680
at every step of the way,

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.000
as opposed to enriching yourself

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.560
and all those kinds of things.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.200
I think that's the name of the game.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.240
But it's tricky.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.160
And if we don't have moral mentors

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.560
and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.280
And if you tell a kid, that's deadly to me,

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.240
just decide for yourself, just off you go.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.760
And you make your own choices.

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.440
Now, your choice has to be disciplined.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.520
Your desire has got to be directed.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.680
Then you'll find your creative path.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.600
Everyone does it in its own way.

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.840
But it's a guided choice.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.840
Your freedom is not sovereign.

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.000
It's a guided freedom.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.440
So in the struggle and the suffering

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.680
you've seen in the world,

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.360
let me ask you the question of death.

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.360
Have you, how often do you think about your own mortality?

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.920
Every day.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.920
And one, are you afraid of it, the uncertainty of it?

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.480
And what do you think happens after you die?

01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.320
Sure, I'm afraid of it.

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.960
I mean, because I don't know what's next.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.920
I mean, I can't know it the way I know you.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.480
So of course I'm afraid of it.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.560
And I think of it every day.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.400
That's true.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.480
My prayer life compels me.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.480
We have this, the Hail Mary prayer.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.520
You pray the rosary, now and at the hour of our death, amen.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.920
Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.240
Now at the hour of our death, amen.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.120
You pray the whole rosary 50 times.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.720
You've reminded yourself of your own death.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.400
But I do, I think about it

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.640
because it's the ultimate limit.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.080
It's why it's beguiled every artist and writer

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:08.920
and philosopher.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.560
It's the ultimate limit question.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.400
But yeah, sure.

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.760
I'm afraid of it because it's the unknown.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.400
What do I think happens?

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.320
I think I'm drawn into the deeper embrace of God's love.

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.160
And that's stating it kind of in a more poetic way.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.640
Do you know John Polkinghorne's work?

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.800
Do you know that name?

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.960
John Polkinghorne was a very interesting,

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.440
he just died recently.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.720
He was a Cambridge University particle scientist

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.880
high, high level scientist

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.280
who at midlife became an Anglican priest.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.680
He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.440
and became an Anglican priest.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.400
And then wrote, I think some of the best stuff

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:52.360
on science and religion

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.880
because he really knew the science from the inside.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.080
Here's Polkinghorne's account

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.680
that I've always found persuasive.

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.200
He said, what survives after we die?

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.680
So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.200
or it's burned up or it goes away, right?

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.360
But what's preserved, and he says,

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.440
what Aristotle would have called the form,

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.200
Polkinghorne calls it the pattern.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.120
So the pattern that's organized,

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.000
the matter that's made me up over all these years,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.400
that's obviously not the same as it was,

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.720
even, I mean, you would know how often it all changed,

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.320
all your atoms and cells and, you know.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.280
In other words, the little, you know, Bobby Baron

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.680
who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.960
I can have a picture of him and then there's me.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.360
And I say, oh, that's the same person.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.160
Well, I mean, clearly not materially speaking, not at all.

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:41.720
Completely different.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.600
But there's a unity to whatever that pattern is

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.840
by which all of that materiality

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.600
has been kind of organized, you know.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.640
So Polkinghorne says, I think that pattern

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.200
is remembered by God.

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.160
And remember, it's the wrong word,

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.080
as though it's like derivative.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.680
I mean, it's known by God.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.520
And so God can therefore re-embody me

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.480
according to that pattern at a higher pitch,

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.240
what we call the resurrected body.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.320
So Paul talks about a spiritual body.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.040
Body for sure, I mean, because he believes

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.440
in the resurrection of Jesus.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.520
But it's not a body like ours from this world.

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.120
It's a body at a higher pitch.

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.160
So something, some pattern that's there persists.

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.640
The pattern persists in the mind of God

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.440
and then is used as the ground of the re-embodyment of me.

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.560
So it's not like I've just become a Platonic form.

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:38.320
I'm gonna be re-embodied because the Christian hope

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.320
is not for Platonic escape of soul from matter.

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.880
That's never the Christian hope.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.920
It's for the resurrection of the body, we say.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.960
And he said, what a fantastic idea.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.960
Well, I don't know.

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:53.520
I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.480
according to this pattern, right?

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.200
It's not the same matter.

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:02.200
And so might there be another sort of higher material

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.960
that is organized according to the same pattern

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.680
which has been remembered by God.

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.320
So therefore we can hang on to the language

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.920
of body and soul if you want, or matter and form.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:14.600
But it's the form remembered by God

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:18.080
and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:21.360
that we call heaven, the heavenly state.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.680
That's what I hope for.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.000
That's my Christian faith, my Christian hope.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.840
Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.320
We've talked about it in different directions

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.760
from different perspectives.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.880
What's the meaning of our existence here on earth?

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:39.320
What's the meaning of life?

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.680
Love.

01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.240
God is love.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.000
And the purpose of my life is to become God's friend.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.280
And that means I'm more conformed to love.

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.600
And so my life finds meaning in the measure

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.960
that I become more on fire with the divine love.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.080
I'm like the burning bush, is to become more

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.600
and more radiant with the presence of God.

01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.720
That's what gives life meaning.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.920
Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.120
to a value, I would say.

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.880
So there's all kinds of values.

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:07.680
As I say, moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.320
And when I have a purposive relationship,

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.080
so right now you and I, we have a purposive relationship

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.480
to the value of, let's say, finding out the truth of things

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:18.040
and we're speaking together to seek that.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.160
Well, good.

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.360
What's the ultimate value?

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.720
The value of values is God, the supreme good, right?

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:27.920
The supremely knowable, the supremely intelligible is God.

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.120
And so to be conformed to God

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.520
is to have a fully meaningful life.

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.960
And who's God, God is love.

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.080
So that's where I would fit the package together that way.

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:41.240
You're adding a lot of love to this world,

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.320
and which is something I deeply appreciate,

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.800
and that you would sit down with me,

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.120
given how valuable your time is, it's a huge honor.

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:48.960
Thank you so much for talking to me.

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:49.960
Well, my great pleasure, I loved it.

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.600
Lex, thank you.

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.080
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.640
with Bishop Robert Barron.

And now, let me leave you with some words

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.080
from Bishop Robert Barron himself,

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:05.560
which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560
spoken through Prince Mishkin,

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.960
that quote, beauty will save the world.

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.720
Robert says, begin with the beautiful,

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.080
which leads to the good, which leads you to truth.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.960
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.000
Thank you.
