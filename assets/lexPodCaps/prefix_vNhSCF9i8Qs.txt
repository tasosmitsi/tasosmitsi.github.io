00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well.

00:02.840 --> 00:04.720
We've got to understand how the guy thinks

00:04.720 --> 00:07.320
and why he thinks like he does.

00:07.320 --> 00:10.640
You know, he has got his own context and his own frame

00:10.640 --> 00:13.480
and his own rationale, and he is rational.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.280
He is a rational actor in his own context.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.120
We've got to understand that.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.000
We've got to understand that he would take offense

00:19.000 --> 00:21.520
at something and he would take action over something.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.160
It doesn't mean to say that, you know,

00:23.160 --> 00:26.400
we are necessary to blame by taking actions,

00:26.400 --> 00:28.320
but we are to blame when we don't understand

00:28.320 --> 00:32.120
the consequences of things that we do and act accordingly,

00:32.120 --> 00:33.960
or, you know, take preventative action

00:33.960 --> 00:36.160
or recognize that something might happen

00:36.160 --> 00:37.520
as a result of something.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.800
What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine

00:40.800 --> 00:42.680
with a tactical nuclear weapon?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.600
The following is a conversation with Fiona Hill,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.280
a presidential advisor and foreign policy expert

00:50.280 --> 00:52.120
specializing in Russia.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.760
She has served the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations,

00:55.800 --> 01:00.240
including being a top advisor on Russia to Donald Trump.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.880
She has made it to the White House

01:01.880 --> 01:04.600
from humble beginnings in the North of England,

01:04.600 --> 01:07.400
a story she tells in her book,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.640
There's Nothing for You Here.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.720
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.160

01:15.160 --> 01:18.920
And now, dear friends, here's Fiona Hill.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.040
You came from humble beginning

01:22.040 --> 01:24.600
in a coal mining town in Northeast England.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.040
So what were some formative moments in your young life

01:28.040 --> 01:31.440
that made you the woman you are today?

01:31.440 --> 01:33.280
Well, I was born in 1965,

01:33.280 --> 01:37.240
and it was the period where the whole coal sector

01:37.240 --> 01:39.680
in Britain was in decline already.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.600
And, you know, basically, my father,

01:42.600 --> 01:45.360
by the time I came along, had lost his job multiple times.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.760
Every coal mine he worked in was closing down.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.800
He was looking constantly for other work,

01:49.800 --> 01:51.400
and he had no qualifications,

01:51.400 --> 01:54.440
because at age 14, he'd gone down the mines.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.320
His father had gone down the mines at 13.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.760
His great-grandfather, you know, around the same kind of age.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
I mean, you had a lot of people at different points

02:01.240 --> 02:04.280
going down coal mines at 12, 13, you know, 14.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.640
They didn't get educated beyond that period,

02:06.640 --> 02:07.960
because the expectation was,

02:07.960 --> 02:09.040
are you going to go down the mine

02:09.040 --> 02:11.480
like everybody else in your family?

02:11.480 --> 02:14.560
And then he didn't really have any other qualifications

02:14.560 --> 02:17.760
to, you know, basically find another job

02:17.760 --> 02:19.280
beyond something in manual labor.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.400
So he worked in a steelworks.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.920
That didn't work out. A brickworks.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.040
That closed down.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.200
And then he went to work in the local hospital,

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
part of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom

02:28.200 --> 02:29.880
as a porter and orderly.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.080
Basically, somebody's just pushing people around.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.480
There was no opportunity to retrain.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.040
So the big issue in my family was education.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.280
You've got to have one.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.280
You know, you've got to have some qualifications.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.040
The world is changing. It's changing really quickly.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.400
And for you to kind of keep up with it,

02:45.400 --> 02:48.680
you're going to have to get educated

02:48.680 --> 02:50.320
and find a way out of this.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.280
And very early on, my father had basically said to me,

02:53.280 --> 02:54.920
there's nothing for you here.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.800
You're going to have to, if you want to get ahead.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.280
And he didn't have any kind of idea

02:59.280 --> 03:00.360
that as a girl I wouldn't.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.560
I mean, actually in many respects,

03:01.560 --> 03:04.080
I think I benefited from being a girl rather than a boy.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.400
There was no expectation that I would go into industry.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.520
There was, you know, some kind of idea that maybe I,

03:10.520 --> 03:12.400
you know, if I got qualifications, I could be a nurse.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.880
My mother was a midwife.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.480
And so she'd at age 16 left school and gone to train

03:17.480 --> 03:19.680
as a nurse and then as a midwife.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.920
I had other relatives who'd gone to teach,

03:21.920 --> 03:23.800
you know, in local schools.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.920
And so there was an idea that, you know,

03:24.920 --> 03:26.720
women could get educated.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.480
And there was a kind of a range of things that you could do.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.000
But the expectation then was go out there,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.800
do something with your life,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.960
but also a sense that you'd probably have to leave.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.320
So all of that was circling around me,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.040
particularly in my teenage years,

03:42.040 --> 03:45.400
as I was trying to sort of find my way through life

03:45.400 --> 03:47.760
and looking forward.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.560
First of all, what does that even look like

03:50.560 --> 03:53.560
getting educated, given the context of that place?

03:53.560 --> 03:54.400
You don't know.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.480
There's a whole world of mystery out there.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.960
So how do you figure out what to actually do out there?

03:58.960 --> 04:02.080
But was there moments, formative moments,

04:02.080 --> 04:04.760
either challenging or just inspiring

04:04.760 --> 04:08.440
where you wondered about what you want to be,

04:08.440 --> 04:09.400
where you want to go?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.800
Yeah, there were, I mean, there were a number of things.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.760
I mean, I think like a lot of kids, you know,

04:12.760 --> 04:14.640
you talk to people and particularly

04:14.640 --> 04:15.680
from blue collar backgrounds.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.800
So what did you want to do?

04:16.800 --> 04:18.920
Boys might say I wanted to be a fireman, you know,

04:18.920 --> 04:20.920
or you got, you know, kind of,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.240
at one point as a little girl, I wanted to be a nurse

04:23.240 --> 04:25.240
and I had a little nurse's uniform like my mother.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.440
I didn't really know what that meant,

04:26.440 --> 04:28.960
but you know, I used to go around pretending to be a nurse.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.520
I even had a little magazine called Nurse Nancy

04:31.520 --> 04:33.240
and I used to read this.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.240
And you know, kind of that was one of the formative ideas.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.560
We also, it was a rural area, semi-rural area.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.040
And you know, I'd be out in the fields all the time

04:41.040 --> 04:43.640
and I'd watch farmers, you know, with their animals

04:43.640 --> 04:45.960
and I'd see vets coming along and, you know,

04:45.960 --> 04:48.080
watching people deal with the livestock.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.440
And there was a kind of a famous story at the time

04:50.440 --> 04:53.000
about a vet called James Herriot.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.960
It became here in the United States as well

04:54.960 --> 04:56.480
and was a sort of a TV mini series.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.920
He'd written a book and he was the vet for my,

04:58.920 --> 05:01.080
one of my great aunt's dogs.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.440
And people were always talking about him.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.000
I thought, oh, I could be a vet.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.840
And then one day I saw one of the local vets

05:05.840 --> 05:08.800
with his hand up the backside of a cow in a field

05:08.800 --> 05:10.640
and he got his hand stuck and the cow was kicking him.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.320
And I thought, yeah, maybe, maybe not actually.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.840
No, I don't think I want to be a vet.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.560
So I cycled through all of these things about,

05:17.560 --> 05:18.920
okay, I could get an education,

05:18.920 --> 05:21.600
but the whole sense was you had to apply your education.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.920
It wasn't an education for education's sake.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.160
It was an education to do something.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
And when I was about 14 or 15,

05:28.160 --> 05:31.120
my local member of parliament came to the school

05:31.120 --> 05:32.280
and it was one of these, you know,

05:32.280 --> 05:35.400
pep talks for kids in these, you know, deprived areas.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.080
He had been quite prominent in local education

05:39.080 --> 05:40.440
and now he was a member of parliament.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.200
He himself had come from a really hard scrabble background

05:43.200 --> 05:44.840
and had risen up through education.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.840
He had even gone to Oxford

05:45.840 --> 05:48.640
and done philosophy, politics and economics.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.800
And he basically told my class,

05:50.800 --> 05:52.600
even though it was highly unlikely any of us

05:52.600 --> 05:55.600
were really going to get ahead and go to elite institutions,

05:55.600 --> 05:56.960
look, you can get an education.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.640
You don't have to be held back by your circumstances.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.880
But if you do get an education,

06:00.880 --> 06:03.800
it's a privilege and you need to do something with it.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.680
So then I'm thinking, well, what could I do?

06:06.680 --> 06:08.600
Okay, an education is a qualification.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.720
It's to do something.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.320
Most people around me I didn't,

06:11.320 --> 06:12.640
I knew didn't have careers.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.920
I mean, my dad didn't really have a career.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.080
He had jobs.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.960
My mom, you know, thought of her nursing as a career though,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.040
and it genuinely was.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.800
And she was out there trying to help women

06:21.800 --> 06:23.280
survive childbirth.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.040
My mother had these horrific stories, you know,

06:26.040 --> 06:27.680
basically over the dining room table,

06:27.680 --> 06:29.880
I wish she'd stop, she'd leave out her nursing books.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.880
And I tell you, if everyone had had my mom as a mother,

06:32.880 --> 06:35.400
there'd be no reproduction on the planet.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.360
It was just these grim, horrific stories of breached births

06:38.360 --> 06:40.720
and fistulas and all kinds of horrors

06:40.720 --> 06:43.360
that my sister and I would just go, oh my God, you know,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.160
please stop.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.440
So I thought, well, you know,

06:46.440 --> 06:50.200
I don't necessarily want to go in that direction,

06:50.200 --> 06:54.360
but it was the timing that really cinched things for me.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.520
I was very lucky that the region that I grew up,

06:56.520 --> 06:59.240
County Durham, despite the massive decline,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.600
deindustrialization and the complete collapse

07:02.600 --> 07:06.040
of the local government system around me

07:06.040 --> 07:08.440
still maintained money for education.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.200
And they also paid for exchanges.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.080
And we had exchange programs with cities in Germany

07:14.080 --> 07:17.720
and France, also in Russia, in Kostroma near Yaroslavl,

07:17.720 --> 07:20.000
for example, an old textile town, similar, you know,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.080
down in its kind of region, but quite historic

07:23.080 --> 07:24.680
in the Russian context.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.920
In fact, the original birthplace of the Romanov dynasty

07:28.920 --> 07:30.920
in Kostroma, just as County Durham, you know,

07:30.920 --> 07:33.240
was quite a distinguished historic area

07:33.240 --> 07:34.520
in the British context.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.480
And so it was an idea that I could go on exchanges,

07:36.480 --> 07:38.400
I could learn languages, I studied German,

07:38.400 --> 07:39.480
I studied French.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.680
And then in 1983, there was the war scare,

07:45.920 --> 07:48.440
basically provoked by the Euro missile crisis.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.320
So the stationing of new categories

07:50.320 --> 07:54.640
of strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate nuclear weapons

07:54.640 --> 07:57.960
in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe

07:57.960 --> 07:59.880
during the height of the Cold War.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.240
And this Euro missile crisis over SS-20 and Pershing missiles

08:03.240 --> 08:06.920
went on from 1977, so when I was about 11 or 12,

08:07.080 --> 08:11.200
all the way through into the later part of the 1980s.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.200
And in 1983, we came extraordinarily close

08:15.200 --> 08:17.120
to a nuclear conflict.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.800
It was very much another rerun

08:19.800 --> 08:22.240
of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,

08:22.240 --> 08:24.720
so 20 years on, same kind of thing.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.760
The Soviets misread, although I didn't know this

08:26.760 --> 08:29.280
at the time, I know a lot of this after the fact,

08:29.280 --> 08:31.120
but the tension was palpable,

08:31.120 --> 08:33.920
but what happened was the Soviets misread the intentions

08:33.920 --> 08:38.480
of a series of exercises, Operation Able Archer

08:38.480 --> 08:40.200
that the United States was conducting

08:40.200 --> 08:41.800
and actually thought that the United States

08:41.800 --> 08:44.320
might be preparing for a first nuclear strike.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.120
And that then set off a whole set

08:46.120 --> 08:49.520
of literal chain reactions in the Soviet Union.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.120
Eventually, it was recognized that all of this

08:52.120 --> 08:55.000
was really based on misperceptions.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.520
And of course, that later led to negotiations

08:57.520 --> 08:59.800
between Gorbachev and Reagan

08:59.800 --> 09:02.560
for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, the INF Treaty.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.920
But in 1983, that tension was just acute.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.720
And for as a teenager, we were basically being prepped

09:08.720 --> 09:13.720
the whole time for the inevitability of nuclear Armageddon.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.720
There were TV series, films in the United States

09:17.720 --> 09:19.800
and the UK threads the day after.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.400
We had all these public service announcements

09:21.400 --> 09:24.960
telling us to seek sanctuary or cover

09:24.960 --> 09:26.720
in the inevitability of a nuclear blast.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.640
And my house was so small, they said,

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
look for a room without a window.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.960
There were no rooms without windows.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.120
My dad put on these really thick curtains over the window,

09:35.120 --> 09:37.200
and said if there was a nuclear flash,

09:37.200 --> 09:39.680
we'd have to get down on the floor, not look up,

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
but the curtains would help.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.360
And we were like, this is ridiculous, dad.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.160
And we would all try to see if we could squeeze

09:44.160 --> 09:46.000
in the space under the stairs,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.960
a cupboard under the stairs like Harry Potter.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.920
I mean, it's all just totally nuts.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.520
Or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.320
And I thought, well, this isn't gonna work.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.920
And one of my great uncles who had fought in World War II

09:57.920 --> 10:00.000
said, well, look, you're good at languages, Fiona.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.320
Why don't you go and study Russian?

10:01.360 --> 10:02.320
Try to figure it out.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.840
Figure out why the Russians are trying to blow us up.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.680
Because during the-

10:05.680 --> 10:06.520
Go talk to them.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.560
Exactly, during World War II, the United Kingdom,

10:09.560 --> 10:10.840
the United States, and the Soviet Union

10:10.840 --> 10:12.000
had all been wartime allies.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.640
And my uncle Charlie thought,

10:13.640 --> 10:15.160
well, there's something going wrong here.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.400
Maybe you can figure it out.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.440
And as you said, go talk to them.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.680
So I thought, okay, I'll study Russian.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.760
So that's really how this came about.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.880
I thought, well, it's applying education.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.880
I'll just do my very best to understand everything

10:26.880 --> 10:29.120
I possibly can about the Russian language

10:29.120 --> 10:30.560
and the Soviet Union.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
And I'll see what I can do.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.720
And I thought, well, maybe I could become a translator.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.080
So I had visions of myself sitting around,

10:36.080 --> 10:38.680
listening to things in a big headset

10:38.680 --> 10:40.320
and in a basically translating perhaps

10:40.320 --> 10:43.760
at some future arms control summit.

10:43.760 --> 10:48.760
So how did the journey continue with learning Russian?

10:50.320 --> 10:54.400
I mean, this early dream of being a translator

10:54.400 --> 10:58.160
and thinking how can I actually help understand

10:58.200 --> 11:01.760
and maybe help even deeper way with this conflict

11:01.760 --> 11:04.240
that threatens the existence of the human species?

11:05.560 --> 11:07.560
How did it actually continue?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.560
Well, I mean, I read everything

11:08.560 --> 11:11.000
I also actually possibly could about nuclear weapons

11:11.000 --> 11:14.320
and nuclear war, and I started to try to teach myself

11:14.320 --> 11:15.160
Russian a little bit as well.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.360
So it was always in context of nuclear war.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.200
It was very much in the context of nuclear war

11:19.200 --> 11:22.240
at this particular point, but also in historical context,

11:22.240 --> 11:24.880
because I knew that the United States and the United Kingdom

11:24.880 --> 11:27.320
and the Soviet Union had been wartime allies in World War II.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.280
So I tried to understand all of that.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.520
And also, like many other people,

11:32.520 --> 11:35.120
I read Russian literature in translation.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.920
I'd read War and Peace, and I'd love the book actually.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.280
I mean, particularly the story parts of it.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.440
I wasn't one really at that time when I was a teenager,

11:43.440 --> 11:45.360
I thought Tolstoy went on a bit

11:45.360 --> 11:48.320
in terms of his theories of the great man and of history

11:48.320 --> 11:51.360
and kind of social change, though now I appreciate it more.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.040
But when I was about 14, I was like,

11:53.040 --> 11:54.720
this man needed an editor.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.040
Could he have just gone on with the story?

11:56.080 --> 11:59.280
What an amazing story, what an incredible kind of book this is.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.600
I still think he needs an editor, but yeah.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.960
Well, I think his wife tried, didn't she?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.640
But he got quite upset with her.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.760
And then I kind of thought to myself,

12:06.760 --> 12:08.480
well, how do I study Russian?

12:08.480 --> 12:11.800
Because there were very few schools in my region,

12:11.800 --> 12:13.960
given the impoverishment of the region,

12:13.960 --> 12:15.000
where you could study Russian.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.040
So I would have to take Russian from scratch.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.880
And this is where things get really quite interesting.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.440
Because there were opportunities

12:23.440 --> 12:25.920
to study Russian at universities,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.760
but I would need to have, first of all,

12:28.760 --> 12:31.440
an intensive Russian language course in the summer.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.720
And I didn't have the money for that.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.520
And the period is around the miners' strike

12:36.520 --> 12:38.800
in the United Kingdom in 1984.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.680
Now, the miners of County Durham had very interestingly

12:44.680 --> 12:48.440
had exchanges and ties with the miners of Donbas,

12:48.440 --> 12:51.160
going back to the 1920s.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.600
And as I studied Russian history,

12:52.600 --> 12:54.720
I discovered there was lots of contacts

12:54.760 --> 12:57.560
between Bolshevik, Soviet Union,

12:57.560 --> 12:59.200
the early period after the Russian Revolution,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.200
but even before that, during the imperial period in Russia,

13:02.200 --> 13:05.280
between the Northern England and the Russian Empire

13:05.280 --> 13:06.960
and the old industrial areas.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.440
Basically, big industrial areas

13:08.440 --> 13:11.280
like the Northeast of England and places like Donbas

13:11.280 --> 13:12.400
were built up at the same time,

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
often by the same sets of industrialists.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.400
And Donetsk in the Donbas region used to be called Husevka

13:20.480 --> 13:23.840
because it was established by a Welsh industrialist

13:23.840 --> 13:26.040
who brought in miners from Wales

13:26.040 --> 13:28.760
to help kind of develop the coal mines there

13:28.760 --> 13:30.680
and also the steelworks and others

13:30.680 --> 13:33.280
that we're hearing about all the time.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
And so I got very fascinated in all these linkages

13:35.280 --> 13:38.440
and famous writers from the early parts of the Soviet Union

13:38.440 --> 13:41.440
like Evgeny Zamyatin worked in the shipyards

13:41.440 --> 13:44.080
and Newcastle-Pontine.

13:44.080 --> 13:48.080
And there was just this whole set of connections.

13:48.080 --> 13:53.080
And in 1984, when the miners' strike took place,

13:53.280 --> 13:55.400
the miners of Donbas, along with other miners

13:55.400 --> 13:58.720
from famous coal regions like the Ruhr Valley,

13:58.720 --> 14:01.680
for example, in Germany or miners in Poland

14:02.680 --> 14:05.840
sent money in solidarity to the miners of County Durham.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.160
And there'd been these exchanges, as I said,

14:07.160 --> 14:09.400
going back and forth since the 1920s,

14:09.400 --> 14:11.640
formal exchanges between miners,

14:11.640 --> 14:13.960
the region of miners' unions.

14:13.960 --> 14:18.960
And I heard again from the same great uncle

14:19.120 --> 14:21.560
who told me to study Russian

14:21.600 --> 14:22.920
that there were actually scholarships

14:22.920 --> 14:24.040
for the children of miners,

14:24.040 --> 14:27.520
and it could be former miners as well, for their education.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.600
And I should go along to the miners' hall,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.440
a place called Red Hills,

14:32.440 --> 14:34.120
where the miners of County Durham

14:34.120 --> 14:36.280
had actually pooled all of their resources

14:36.280 --> 14:38.040
and built up their own parliament

14:38.040 --> 14:39.440
and their own kind of place

14:39.440 --> 14:41.440
that they could talk among themselves

14:41.440 --> 14:44.160
to figure out how to enhance the welfare

14:44.160 --> 14:46.240
and wellbeing of their communities.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.520
And they'd put money aside for education for miners.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.560
There was all kinds of lecture series from the miners

14:50.560 --> 14:53.880
and all kinds of other activities supporting soccer teams

14:53.880 --> 14:57.400
and artistic circles and writing circles, for example.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.480
People like George Orwell were involved

14:59.480 --> 15:01.200
in some of these writer's circles

15:01.200 --> 15:04.040
in other parts of Britain and mining communities,

15:04.040 --> 15:05.120
for example.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.400
And so they told me I could go along

15:08.400 --> 15:11.680
and basically apply for a grant to go to study Russian.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.040
So I show up and it was the easiest application

15:15.040 --> 15:15.880
I've ever come across.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.760
They just asked me to, my dad came along with me.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.320
They asked me to verify that my dad had been a miner

15:22.320 --> 15:25.360
and they looked up his employment record on little cards,

15:25.360 --> 15:27.800
kind of a little tray somewhere.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.160
And then they asked me how much I needed

15:30.160 --> 15:33.440
to basically pay for the travel

15:33.440 --> 15:37.800
and some of the basic expenses for the study

15:37.800 --> 15:39.320
and they wrote me a check.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.880
And so thanks to the miners of Donbass

15:41.880 --> 15:43.480
and this money that was deposited

15:43.480 --> 15:45.280
with the miners of County Durham

15:45.280 --> 15:47.040
with the Durham Miners Association,

15:47.040 --> 15:50.640
I got the money to study Russian for the first time

15:50.640 --> 15:53.800
before I embarked on my studies at university.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.400
As you're speaking now,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.440
it's reminding me that there's a different way

15:57.440 --> 16:01.000
to look both at history and at geography

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
and at different places.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.880
This is an industrial region.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.720
That's right.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.600
And it echoes in the experience of living there

16:11.600 --> 16:16.400
is more captured not by Moscow or Kiev,

16:17.360 --> 16:18.960
at least historically,

16:18.960 --> 16:21.920
but by just being a mining town and industrial town.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.960
That's right, in the place itself.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.840
Yeah, I mean, there are places in the United States

16:25.840 --> 16:28.360
and Appalachia and West Virginia and in Pennsylvania

16:28.360 --> 16:31.920
like the Lehigh Valley that have the same sense of place.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.600
And the Northeast of England

16:33.600 --> 16:36.440
was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.400
It was the industrial version of Silicon Valley,

16:39.400 --> 16:43.880
which has its own, I would say contours and frames.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.440
And when you come to those industrial areas,

16:46.440 --> 16:48.680
your previous identities get submerged

16:48.680 --> 16:50.680
in that larger framework.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.440
I've always looked at the world through that lens

16:53.440 --> 16:55.920
of being someone from the working class,

16:55.920 --> 16:58.800
the blue collar communities from a very specific place

16:58.800 --> 17:02.920
with lots of historical and economic connotations.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.760
And it's also a melting pot,

17:04.760 --> 17:08.480
which is the problems that the Donbass has experienced

17:08.480 --> 17:10.560
over the last 30 years,

17:10.560 --> 17:12.360
that people came from all over the place to work there.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.000
Of course, there was a population

17:14.000 --> 17:15.520
that one might say is indigenous,

17:15.520 --> 17:17.280
might have gone back centuries there,

17:17.280 --> 17:19.080
but they would have been in the smaller

17:19.080 --> 17:20.360
rural farming communities,

17:20.360 --> 17:23.160
just like it was the same in the Northeast of England.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.720
And people in the case of the Northeast of England

17:25.720 --> 17:27.400
came from Wales, they came from further

17:27.400 --> 17:28.840
in the South of England, the Midlands,

17:28.840 --> 17:31.760
they came from Scotland, they came from Ireland.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.960
I have all of that heritage in my own personal background

17:35.960 --> 17:38.560
and you've got a different identity.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.760
And it's when somebody else tries to impose an identity

17:42.160 --> 17:44.000
on you from the outside that things go awry.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.400
And I think that that's kind of what we've really seen

17:46.400 --> 17:48.320
in the case of Donbass.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.360
It's a place that's a part in many respects historically

17:51.360 --> 17:55.040
and in terms of its evolution and development over time.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.160
And particularly in the case of Russia,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.000
the Russians have tried to say,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.160
well, look, because most people speak Russia,

18:01.160 --> 18:02.600
there is the lingua franca.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.680
I mean, in the Northeast of England,

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
of course, everyone spoke English,

18:04.680 --> 18:06.920
but lots of people were Irish speakers,

18:06.920 --> 18:07.880
Gallic Irish speakers,

18:07.880 --> 18:11.360
or some of them might have certainly been Welsh speakers.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.240
There was lots of Welsh miners who spoke Welsh

18:13.240 --> 18:15.560
as their first language who came there,

18:15.560 --> 18:17.280
but they created an identity.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.640
It's the same in Belfast, in Ulster,

18:19.640 --> 18:24.640
the Northern province of the whole of the Irish island,

18:24.880 --> 18:28.480
the part of Ireland that is still part of the United Kingdom.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.840
That was also a heavily industrialized area,

18:31.840 --> 18:36.160
high manufacturing, mass manufacturing, shipbuilding,

18:36.160 --> 18:38.600
for example, people came from all over there too,

18:38.600 --> 18:41.920
which is why when Ireland got its independence

18:41.920 --> 18:45.280
in the United Kingdom, Ulster, Belfast,

18:45.280 --> 18:47.800
and that whole region kind of clung on

18:47.800 --> 18:49.760
because it was again that melting pot.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.560
It was kind of intertwined

18:51.560 --> 18:54.200
with the larger industrial economy

18:54.200 --> 18:56.320
and had a very different identity.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.200
And so that, for me growing up in such a specific place

19:00.200 --> 19:05.200
with such a special in many respects heritage

19:05.240 --> 19:06.960
gave me a different perspective on things.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.280
When I first went to the Soviet Union in 1987

19:10.280 --> 19:11.120
to study there,

19:11.120 --> 19:12.840
I actually went to a translator's Institute,

19:12.840 --> 19:14.360
what was then called the Maurice Therese,

19:14.360 --> 19:17.040
which is now the Institute of Foreign Languages.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.640
I was immediately struck by how similar everything was

19:21.640 --> 19:23.240
to the North of England,

19:23.240 --> 19:25.520
because it was just like one big working class culture

19:25.520 --> 19:27.920
that sort of broken out onto the national stage.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.880
Everything in Northern England was nationalized.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.640
We had British steel, British coal,

19:32.640 --> 19:34.520
British rail, British shipbuilding,

19:34.520 --> 19:35.720
because after World War II,

19:35.720 --> 19:37.920
the private sector had been devastated

19:37.920 --> 19:39.880
and the state had to step in.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.040
And of course, the Soviet Union

19:41.040 --> 19:44.760
is one big giant nationalized economy when I get there.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.800
And it's just the people's attitudes

19:46.800 --> 19:47.640
and outlooks are the same.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.960
People didn't work for themselves,

19:48.960 --> 19:50.920
they always worked for somebody else.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.400
And it had quite a distortion

19:53.400 --> 19:55.000
on the way that people looked at the world.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.320
Do you still speak Russian?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.160
I do, yeah.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.000
Do you speak Russian?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.600
Yeah, I can, of course, if you want.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.240
Well, yes, then I need to say something,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.320
and everyone will think about what we're talking about now.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.960
Yeah, it would be a big mystery for everybody.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.240
And you have an advantage on me

20:08.240 --> 20:09.480
because it's your native language as well.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.520
For people wondering, the English speakers in the audience,

20:12.520 --> 20:13.720
you're really missing a lot

20:13.720 --> 20:15.680
from the few sentences we said there.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
Yeah, it's a fascinating language

20:18.960 --> 20:21.120
that stretches actually geographically

20:21.120 --> 20:23.360
across a very large part of this world.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.000
So there you are in 1987,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.160
an exchange student in the Soviet Union.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.280
What was that world like?

20:30.280 --> 20:33.760
Well, that was absolutely fascinating in that period

20:33.760 --> 20:37.400
because it's the period that's just around the time

20:37.400 --> 20:38.880
of the peak of perestroika,

20:38.880 --> 20:43.360
Mikhail Gorbachev's role as president.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.680
Well, he wasn't quite president at that point.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.400
He was Secretary General of the Communist Party

20:47.400 --> 20:50.200
of the Soviet Union, trying to transform the whole place.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.720
So I arrived there in September of 1987,

20:54.720 --> 20:59.720
just as Gorbachev and Reagan sign the INF Treaty.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.680
It was just within weeks of them about to sign that,

21:02.680 --> 21:04.440
which really ends that whole period

21:04.440 --> 21:07.440
that had shaped my entire teenage years

21:07.440 --> 21:09.280
of the end of the Euro Missile Crisis

21:09.280 --> 21:12.880
by finally having agreement on basically the rejection

21:12.880 --> 21:16.040
and constraints on intermediate nuclear forces.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.400
And also at this point,

21:17.400 --> 21:21.000
Gorbachev is opening the Soviet Union up.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.200
So we got all kinds of opportunities to travel

21:23.200 --> 21:25.640
in ways that we wouldn't have done before.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.040
Not just in Moscow, which is where I was studying

21:28.040 --> 21:28.880
at the Translates Institute,

21:28.880 --> 21:31.040
but to the Caucasus, to Central Asia,

21:31.040 --> 21:34.920
went all the way to Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East,

21:34.920 --> 21:37.120
all the way around, kind of Moscow.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.080
And there was, at this point,

21:39.080 --> 21:41.640
it was also the Kreshenia Rus,

21:41.640 --> 21:43.080
which has become very important now.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.040
This is the anniversary, the thousandth anniversary

21:46.040 --> 21:50.440
of the Christianization of Russia,

21:50.440 --> 21:52.560
which of course has become a massive obsession

21:52.560 --> 21:56.000
of Vladimir Putin's, but 988,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.200
because I was there, 87 to 88.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.400
And at this point, the Russian Orthodox Church

22:00.400 --> 22:01.600
is undergoing a revival

22:01.600 --> 22:03.960
from being repressed during the Soviet period.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.200
You suddenly have the church stepping out

22:06.200 --> 22:08.280
as a non-governmental organization

22:08.280 --> 22:10.400
and engaging in discussions with people

22:10.400 --> 22:11.840
about the future of religion.

22:12.840 --> 22:17.840
So that was something that I wasn't expecting to witness.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.160
Also, I mean, being in Moscow,

22:20.160 --> 22:23.760
this is the cultural capital of a vast empire at this point.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.320
I'd never lived in a major city before.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.200
It's the first big city I lived in.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.560
I'd never been to the opera.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.800
The first time I go to an opera, it's at the Bolshoi.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.680
I'd never seen a ballet.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.040
I mean, I was not exactly steeped in high classical culture.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.320
When you're kind of growing up in a mining region,

22:40.320 --> 22:42.480
there's very limited opportunities for this kind of thing.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.760
I'd been in a youth orchestra and a youth choir.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.440
My parents signed me up for obviously everything

22:46.440 --> 22:48.400
they possibly could education-wise,

22:48.400 --> 22:50.720
but it wasn't exactly any exposure to this.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.120
So I was kind of astounded by the sort of wealth

22:54.120 --> 22:56.360
of the cultural experience that one could have in Moscow.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.400
But the main thing was I was really struck

22:58.400 --> 23:02.640
by how the Soviet Union was on its last legs.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.000
Because this was Moscow.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.440
You know, I got this image about what it would look like.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.200
I was quite, to be honest, terrified at first

23:09.200 --> 23:11.920
about what I would see there, even at the big nuclear superpower.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.960
And since I got there, it was just this like,

23:13.960 --> 23:16.640
as if a huge weight that I'd been carrying around for years

23:16.640 --> 23:18.040
and my teenage years just disappeared

23:18.040 --> 23:20.520
because it's just ordinary people in an ordinary place,

23:20.520 --> 23:21.760
not doing great.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.880
This is the period of, you know, what they call deficitne vremya,

23:25.880 --> 23:27.440
you know, so the period of deficits.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.120
There was no food in the shops.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.480
There was, you know, very little in terms of commodities

23:31.480 --> 23:36.120
because the supply and demand parts of the economic equation

23:36.120 --> 23:38.440
were out of whack because this was total central planning.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.920
You know, you'd go into a shop that was supposed to sell boots

23:41.920 --> 23:44.680
and there'd be just one pair of boots,

23:44.680 --> 23:47.000
all in the same size and the same colour.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.560
I actually looked out because once I was in this Hungarian boot shop

23:51.560 --> 23:54.320
that was right next to where my hall of residence was,

23:54.320 --> 23:55.560
and I was looking for a new pair of boots,

23:55.600 --> 23:58.480
and every single pair of boots in the shop were my size.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.920
And they were all women's boots, they weren't men's boots at all,

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
you know, because there had been an oversupply of boots

24:02.920 --> 24:04.520
and that size production.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.800
But you could really kind of see here

24:05.800 --> 24:06.800
that there was something wrong.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.040
And, you know, in the north of England,

24:08.040 --> 24:08.960
everything was closed down.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.440
The shops were shuttered because there was no demand

24:11.440 --> 24:12.680
because everybody lost their jobs.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.120
There was massive unemployment.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.560
And when I went off to university in 1984,

24:16.560 --> 24:19.360
90% youth unemployment in the UK,

24:19.360 --> 24:21.280
meaning that when kids left school,

24:21.280 --> 24:22.640
they didn't have something else to go on to

24:22.640 --> 24:25.080
unless they got to university or vocational training

24:25.080 --> 24:25.960
or an apprenticeship.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.600
And most people were still looking,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.760
you know, kind of months out of leaving school.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.360
And so shops were closing because people didn't have any money.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.360
You know, I had 50% male unemployment

24:35.360 --> 24:38.760
in some of the towns as the steelworks closed down

24:38.760 --> 24:42.800
and the wagon works, the railways, for example, in my area.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.240
But in Moscow, people in theory did have money,

24:45.240 --> 24:47.240
but there was just, there was nothing to buy.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.400
Also, the place was falling apart, literally.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.000
I saw massive sinkholes open up in the street,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.680
balconies fall off buildings, you know,

24:53.680 --> 24:55.800
one accident after another.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.760
And then there was, you know, this real kind of sense,

24:57.760 --> 25:00.200
even though the vibrancy and excitement and hope

25:00.200 --> 25:01.640
of the Gorbachev period,

25:01.640 --> 25:05.000
a real sense of the Soviet Union had lost its way.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.160
And of course, it was only a year or so

25:07.160 --> 25:10.080
after I left from that exchange program

25:10.080 --> 25:13.160
and I'd already started with my degree program

25:13.160 --> 25:15.600
in Soviet studies at Harvard,

25:15.600 --> 25:18.320
that the Soviet Union basically unraveled.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.440
And it really did unravel.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.080
It wasn't like it collapsed.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.520
It was basically that there was so many debates

25:23.520 --> 25:25.080
that Gorbachev had sparked off

25:25.080 --> 25:26.600
about how to reform the country,

25:26.600 --> 25:28.560
how to put it on a different path,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.440
that, you know, no one was in agreement.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.160
And it was basically all these fights and debates

25:34.160 --> 25:36.680
and disputes among the elites at the center,

25:36.680 --> 25:39.360
as well as, you know, basically a loss of faith

25:39.360 --> 25:41.360
in the system in the periphery

25:41.360 --> 25:43.360
and among the general population

25:43.360 --> 25:44.840
that in fact pulled it apart.

25:44.840 --> 25:48.440
And of course, in 1991,

25:48.440 --> 25:53.400
you get Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Federation,

25:53.400 --> 25:55.760
then a constituent part of the Soviet Union,

25:55.760 --> 25:59.240
together with the presidents of Ukraine and Belarus,

25:59.240 --> 26:03.240
all of these being individual parts of the Soviet Union

26:03.240 --> 26:06.040
getting together and agreeing of essentially ending it.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.680
And Gorbachev, you know, so basically I'm there

26:07.680 --> 26:10.760
at the peak of this whole kind of period of experimentation

26:10.760 --> 26:12.280
and thinking about the future.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.000
And within a couple of years, it's all kind of gone

26:14.000 --> 26:16.080
and it's on a different track entirely.

26:16.080 --> 26:21.080
Well, I wonder if we reran the 20th century a thousand times

26:21.440 --> 26:24.280
if how many times the Soviet Union will collapse.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.360
Yeah, I wonder about that too.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.760
And I also wonder about what would have happened

26:27.760 --> 26:28.840
if it didn't collapse

26:28.840 --> 26:31.480
and Gorbachev had found a different direction.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.320
I mean, it's, you know, we see a very divisive time now

26:34.320 --> 26:38.760
in American history, the United States of America,

26:38.760 --> 26:42.160
there's very different cultures, very different beliefs,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.800
ideologies within those states,

26:43.800 --> 26:46.480
but those are, that's kind of the strength of America

26:46.480 --> 26:50.200
because there's these little laboratories of ideas.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.920
Until though, that they don't keep together.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.720
I mean, I've had colleagues who have described

26:53.720 --> 26:54.840
what's happening in the West right now

26:54.840 --> 26:57.560
as a kind of soft secession with states, you know,

26:57.560 --> 26:59.400
going off in their own direction.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.920
In which states?

27:01.920 --> 27:04.680
Well, you know, these kinds of conceptions that we have now

27:04.680 --> 27:06.800
are divisions between red and blue states

27:06.800 --> 27:09.720
because of the fracturing of our politics.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.600
And I'd always thought that that wouldn't be possible

27:11.600 --> 27:13.000
in somewhere like the United States

27:13.000 --> 27:15.320
or, you know, many other countries as well

27:15.320 --> 27:18.880
because there wasn't that ethnic dimension.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.240
But in fact, many of the way that people talk

27:21.240 --> 27:24.640
about politics has given it that kind of appearance

27:24.640 --> 27:25.480
in many respects.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.000
Because look, I mean, we know from the Soviet Union

27:28.000 --> 27:30.760
and the Soviet period and from where you're from,

27:30.760 --> 27:31.800
you know, originally in Ukraine,

27:31.800 --> 27:35.840
that language is not the main signifier of identity

27:35.840 --> 27:39.760
and that identity can take all kinds of other forms.

27:39.760 --> 27:40.760
That's really interesting.

27:40.760 --> 27:45.040
I mean, but there has to be a deep grievance of some kind.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.600
If you took a poll in any of the states in the United States,

27:48.600 --> 27:51.040
I think a very small minority of people

27:51.040 --> 27:53.240
would want to actually secede,

27:53.240 --> 27:56.400
even in Texas where I spend a lot of my time.

27:56.400 --> 28:01.160
I just, I think that there is a common kind of pride

28:01.160 --> 28:05.760
of nation, you know, there's a lot of people complain

28:05.760 --> 28:09.800
about government and about how the country's going,

28:09.840 --> 28:12.320
the way people complain about the weather when it's raining.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.160
They say, oh, this stupid weather, it's raining again.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.680
But really what they mean is we're in the smock together.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.840
There's a together there that I-

28:21.840 --> 28:23.800
I also feel that when I go around,

28:23.800 --> 28:25.120
because I mean, I've spent a lot of time

28:25.120 --> 28:28.280
since I wrote my book in last October

28:28.280 --> 28:31.320
and this last year going around, I find the same feeling.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.200
But you know, when I traveled around the Soviet Union

28:34.200 --> 28:37.400
back in the late 1980s, I didn't get any kind of sense

28:37.400 --> 28:40.360
that people wanted to see the end of the Soviet Union either.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.240
It was an elite project.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.080
There's a really great book called Collapse

28:45.080 --> 28:47.960
by Vladislav Zubok, who is a professor

28:49.280 --> 28:54.000
at London School of Economics at LSE.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.840
And Zubok is pretty much my age

28:55.840 --> 28:58.600
and he's from the former Soviet Union, he's Russian.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.880
And I mean, he describes it very quite aptly

29:00.880 --> 29:03.320
about how it was kind of the elites, you know,

29:03.320 --> 29:06.120
that basically decided to pull the Soviet Union apart.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.840
And there is a risk of that, you know, here as well

29:07.840 --> 29:10.920
when you get partisan politics and people forgetting,

29:10.920 --> 29:12.000
you know, that they're Americans

29:12.000 --> 29:13.200
and they are all in this together

29:13.200 --> 29:14.800
like a lot of the population thing.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.200
But they think that their own, you know,

29:16.200 --> 29:19.640
narrow partisan or ideological precepts,

29:19.640 --> 29:21.240
you know, count for more.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.240
And in the Soviet case, of course, it was also a power play,

29:24.240 --> 29:27.480
you know, in a way that actually can't quite play out

29:27.480 --> 29:29.360
in the United States because it was the equivalent

29:29.360 --> 29:32.720
of governors in many respects who got together,

29:32.720 --> 29:35.760
three of them, you know, in the case of, you know,

29:35.760 --> 29:38.360
the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus,

29:38.360 --> 29:40.720
who then, you know, got rid of, you know,

29:40.720 --> 29:45.000
basically the central figure of Mikhail Gorbachev.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.920
It would be a little difficult to do that.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.640
The dynamic is not the same, but it does worry me

29:49.640 --> 29:54.640
of having seen all of that close up in the late 1980s

29:54.920 --> 29:57.800
and the early 90s, and I spent, you know, a lot of time

29:57.800 --> 30:02.120
in Russia as well as in Ukraine and the Caucasus,

30:02.120 --> 30:03.840
Central Asia and, you know, other places

30:03.840 --> 30:05.920
after the collapse of the Soviet Union,

30:05.920 --> 30:09.880
but that you kind of see the same elite divisions here

30:09.880 --> 30:14.400
in the United States pulling in different directions

30:14.400 --> 30:16.760
and straining, you know, the overall body politic

30:16.760 --> 30:20.680
and the way that national politics gets imposed

30:20.680 --> 30:23.560
on local politics in ways that it certainly wasn't

30:23.560 --> 30:25.600
when I first came to the U.S. in 1989.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.040
I didn't honestly, in 1989, when I first came here,

30:28.040 --> 30:30.160
I didn't know anybody's political affiliation.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.680
I mean, I rarely knew their religious affiliation.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.120
And, you know, obviously race was a major phenomenon here

30:36.120 --> 30:38.840
that was a shock to me when I first came.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.840
But many of the kind of the class, regional, geographic,

30:42.840 --> 30:44.480
you know, kind of political dimensions

30:44.480 --> 30:45.760
that I've seen in other places,

30:45.760 --> 30:49.720
I didn't see them at play in the same way then as I do now.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.600
And you take a lot of pride to this day of being nonpartisan.

30:56.160 --> 31:01.160
That said, so you served for the George W. Bush,

31:01.920 --> 31:04.520
Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations,

31:05.440 --> 31:10.400
always specializing in Eurasia and Russia.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.720
You were the top presidential advisor to president,

31:14.720 --> 31:17.520
former president Donald Trump on Russia and Europe

31:17.520 --> 31:22.280
and famously testified in his first impeachment trial

31:22.280 --> 31:27.280
in 2019 saying, I take great pride in the fact

31:28.040 --> 31:31.360
that I'm nonpartisan foreign policy expert.

31:31.360 --> 31:35.520
So given that context, what does nonpartisan mean to you?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.680
Well, I mean, it's been very careful

31:37.680 --> 31:39.840
about not putting any kind of ideological lens

31:39.840 --> 31:42.800
on anything, you know, that I'm analyzing or looking out

31:42.800 --> 31:45.280
or saying about foreign policy for one thing,

31:45.280 --> 31:47.480
but also not taking, you know, kind of one stance

31:47.480 --> 31:49.520
of one party over another either.

31:49.520 --> 31:53.160
To be honest, I've always found American politics

31:53.160 --> 31:56.040
somewhat confounding because both the Democratic

31:56.040 --> 31:58.000
and the Republican party are pretty big tents.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.920
I mean, they're coalitions.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.560
In Europe, it's actually kind of in some respects

32:02.560 --> 32:05.560
easier to navigate the parameters of political parties

32:05.560 --> 32:08.760
because, you know, you have quite clear platforms.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.600
You know, there's also a longer history in many respects,

32:10.600 --> 32:11.960
obviously, I mean, there's a long history here

32:11.960 --> 32:13.840
in the United States of the development of the parties,

32:13.840 --> 32:16.520
you know, going back to the late 18th century.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.760
But in the United Kingdom, you know, for example,

32:18.760 --> 32:21.000
in the 20th century, the development of the mass parties,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.480
you know, it was quite easy to get a handle on.

32:23.480 --> 32:26.320
You know, at one point in the UK, for example,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
the parties were real, genuine mass parties

32:28.320 --> 32:29.760
with people who were properly members

32:29.760 --> 32:32.360
and took part in regular meetings and paid dues.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.160
And, you know, it was easy to just kind of see

32:34.160 --> 32:35.320
what they stood for.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.520
And the same in Europe, you know, when you look at France

32:37.520 --> 32:40.640
and in Germany and Western Germany, of course,

32:40.640 --> 32:42.240
Italy and elsewhere.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.000
Here in the United States, it's kind of pretty amorphous.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.880
You know, the fact that you could kind of register,

32:46.880 --> 32:49.640
you know, randomly, it seems to be a Democrat or Republican,

32:49.640 --> 32:50.760
like Trump did.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.120
At one point he's a Democrat, next thing he's a Republican.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.520
And then you kind of usurp a party apparatus.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.760
But you don't have to be, you're not vetted in any way.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.520
You're not kind of, you know, they don't check you out

33:00.520 --> 33:03.040
to see if you have ideological coherence.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.760
You know, you could have someone like Bernie Sanders

33:04.760 --> 33:06.640
on the other side, on the left, you know,

33:06.640 --> 33:08.800
basically calling himself a socialist

33:08.800 --> 33:13.400
and running for the Democratic presidential nomination.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.080
So, you know, kind of in many respects,

33:15.080 --> 33:19.000
parties in the United States are much more loose movements.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.560
And I think you can, you know, it's almost like

33:20.560 --> 33:23.440
kind of an a la carte menu of different things

33:23.440 --> 33:26.240
and that people can pick out.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.840
And it's more over time, as I've noticed,

33:29.840 --> 33:32.200
become more like a kind of an affiliation

33:32.200 --> 33:33.760
even with the sporting team.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.440
I mean, I get very shocked, by the way,

33:35.440 --> 33:36.480
that people say, well, I couldn't do this

33:36.480 --> 33:38.200
because, you know, that's my side

33:38.200 --> 33:39.560
and I couldn't do anything

33:39.560 --> 33:41.360
and I couldn't support someone for the other side.

33:41.360 --> 33:45.760
I mean, I have a relative in my extended family here

33:45.760 --> 33:49.600
who is a, you know, died in the war Republican

33:50.440 --> 33:52.600
on, you know, family holiday,

33:52.600 --> 33:54.200
there was a book on their table

33:54.200 --> 33:56.640
said a hundred reasons for voting for a Democrat.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.480
I said, hey, are you thinking of shifting party affiliation?

33:59.480 --> 34:01.160
Then I opened the book and it's blank.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.320
It was pretty funny. I had to laugh.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.920
I thought, well, there you go then.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.440
It was just, there's no way that, you know,

34:06.440 --> 34:08.560
people can pull themselves out of these frames.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.960
So for me, it's very important

34:09.960 --> 34:12.440
to have that independence of thought.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.800
I think you can be politically engaged on the issues,

34:15.800 --> 34:19.400
but, you know, basically without taking a stance

34:19.400 --> 34:22.840
that's defined by some ideology

34:22.840 --> 34:25.960
or some sense of kind of parties on affiliation.

34:25.960 --> 34:29.080
I think I tweeted about this, maybe not eloquently

34:29.080 --> 34:31.440
and the statement, if I remember correctly,

34:31.440 --> 34:36.440
was something like, if you honestly can't find

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
a good thing that Donald Trump did

34:38.560 --> 34:41.400
or a good thing that Joe Biden did,

34:41.400 --> 34:46.400
you're not thinking about ideas.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.560
You just pick the tribe.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.840
I mean, it was more eloquent than that,

34:49.840 --> 34:54.240
but it was basically, this is a really good test

34:54.240 --> 34:56.840
to see are you actually thinking

34:56.840 --> 34:58.800
about like how to solve problems

34:58.800 --> 35:01.400
versus like your red team or blue team,

35:01.400 --> 35:02.840
like a sporting team.

35:02.840 --> 35:07.840
Can you find a good idea of Donald Trump's that you like

35:08.080 --> 35:10.240
if you're somebody who is against Donald Trump

35:10.240 --> 35:13.120
and like acknowledge it to yourself privately?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.600
Oh, that's a good idea.

35:14.600 --> 35:15.920
I'm glad he said that.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.240
Or he's even asking the right kinds of questions,

35:18.240 --> 35:19.240
which he often did actually.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.680
I mean, obviously put them in a way

35:20.680 --> 35:22.560
that most of us wouldn't have done,

35:22.560 --> 35:23.760
but there was often kind of questions

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
about why is this happening?

35:24.760 --> 35:25.680
Why are we doing this?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.000
And we have to challenge ourselves all the time.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.480
So yeah, actually, why are we doing that?

35:30.480 --> 35:32.280
And then you have to really inspect it

35:32.280 --> 35:34.640
and say whether it's actually worth continuing that way

35:34.640 --> 35:36.400
or they should be doing something differently.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.600
Now, he had a more kind of destructive quality

35:38.600 --> 35:40.960
to those kinds of questions.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.480
Maybe it's the real estate developer in him

35:42.480 --> 35:44.120
that was taking a big wrecking ball

35:44.120 --> 35:47.040
to all of these kinds of sacred edifices

35:47.040 --> 35:47.860
and things like that.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.060
And then he was asking a question.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.740
If you really pay attention,

35:51.740 --> 35:53.740
he was asking a valid set of questions

35:53.740 --> 35:55.620
about why do we continue to do things like this?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.100
Now, we didn't often have answers

35:57.100 --> 35:59.020
about what he was gonna do in response,

35:59.020 --> 36:01.260
but those questions still had to be asked

36:01.260 --> 36:04.700
and we shouldn't be just rejecting them out of turn.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.860
And then another strength,

36:07.860 --> 36:09.660
the thing that people often,

36:09.660 --> 36:12.340
they criticize Donald Trump will say is a weakness,

36:12.340 --> 36:17.340
is his lack of civility can be a strength

36:17.340 --> 36:21.700
as bureaucracy functions on excessive civility.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.500
Like, actually I've seen this,

36:23.500 --> 36:25.540
it's not just, it's bureaucracy in all forms.

36:25.540 --> 36:29.980
Like in tech companies, as they grow,

36:29.980 --> 36:31.140
everybody kind of, you know,

36:31.140 --> 36:32.500
you're getting pretty good salary.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.700
Everyone's comfortable and there's a meeting

36:36.700 --> 36:40.580
and you discuss how to move stuff forward.

36:40.580 --> 36:44.220
And like, you don't wanna be the asshole in the room

36:44.260 --> 36:47.900
that says, why are we doing this this way?

36:47.900 --> 36:52.900
This could be unethical, this is hurting the world,

36:52.940 --> 36:55.020
this is totally a dumb idea.

36:55.020 --> 36:57.300
Like, I mean, I could give specific examples

36:57.300 --> 36:59.580
that I have on my mind currently that are technical,

36:59.580 --> 37:02.540
but the point is oftentimes the person that's needed

37:02.540 --> 37:04.260
in that room is an asshole.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.980
That's why Steve Jobs worked.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.980
So Elon Musk works, you have to roll in.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.900
That's what first principles thinking looks like.

37:09.900 --> 37:10.980
The one bit when it doesn't work

37:10.980 --> 37:12.780
is when they start name calling,

37:13.060 --> 37:14.180
kind of inciting violence

37:14.180 --> 37:15.820
against the people that they disagree with.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.940
So that was kind of your problem.

37:16.940 --> 37:20.900
Because I mean, often, when I was in the administration,

37:20.900 --> 37:24.020
I had all of Europe in my portfolio as well as Russia.

37:24.020 --> 37:25.900
And there were many times when,

37:25.900 --> 37:27.980
we were dealing with our European colleagues

37:27.980 --> 37:31.420
where he was asking some pretty valid questions about,

37:31.420 --> 37:34.260
well, why should we do this if you're doing that?

37:34.260 --> 37:36.860
For example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,

37:36.860 --> 37:40.020
the United States has been opposed to Europe's reliance

37:40.020 --> 37:42.820
on gas and oil exports from Russia,

37:42.820 --> 37:45.620
the Soviet Union since the 70s and 80s.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.860
And Trump kept pushing this idea about,

37:47.860 --> 37:51.180
so why are we spending so much money on NATO

37:51.180 --> 37:53.980
and NATO defense and we're all talking about this.

37:53.980 --> 37:58.300
If you're then basically paying billions to Russia for gas,

37:58.300 --> 37:59.860
isn't this contradictory?

37:59.860 --> 38:02.540
And of course it was, but it was the way that he did it.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.980
And I actually, one instance had a discussion

38:05.980 --> 38:09.620
with a European defense minister,

38:09.620 --> 38:10.900
because he said to me, look,

38:10.900 --> 38:12.380
he's saying exactly the same things

38:12.380 --> 38:13.620
as people said before him,

38:13.620 --> 38:16.060
including former defense secretary Gates,

38:16.060 --> 38:18.220
it's just the way he says it.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.980
So they took offense and then as a result of that,

38:19.980 --> 38:20.820
they wouldn't take action

38:20.820 --> 38:22.900
because they took offense at what he said.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.780
So it was a kind of then a way of,

38:24.780 --> 38:29.780
could you find some other means of massaging

38:29.940 --> 38:32.180
this communication to go on and make it effective,

38:32.180 --> 38:34.620
which we would always try to focus on.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.780
Because it's the kind of, it was the delivery.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.580
But the actual message was often spot on

38:41.580 --> 38:42.700
in those kinds of issues.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.860
I mean, he was actually highlighting

38:44.860 --> 38:47.940
these ridiculous discrepancies between what people said

38:47.940 --> 38:49.780
and what they actually did.

38:49.780 --> 38:54.180
And it's the delivery, the charisma in the room too.

38:54.180 --> 38:57.420
I'm also understanding the power of that, of a leader.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.660
It's not just about what you do at a podium,

39:00.620 --> 39:03.860
but in a room with advisors,

39:03.860 --> 39:06.620
how you talk about stuff, how you convince other leaders.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.460
Yeah, you don't do it through gratuitous insults

39:08.460 --> 39:09.500
and incitement to violence.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.900
That's one of the things you just,

39:10.900 --> 39:11.940
you don't get anywhere on that front.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.620
Well, I mean, it's possible.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.220
Tough measures and maximum pressure,

39:16.220 --> 39:17.820
often though it does work.

39:17.820 --> 39:20.860
Because there were often times where

39:20.860 --> 39:24.220
that kind of relentless nagging about something

39:24.220 --> 39:26.780
or constantly raising it actually did have results,

39:26.780 --> 39:28.460
but it hadn't previously.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.500
So there's the maximum pressure,

39:31.340 --> 39:33.300
if it kind of kept on it in the right way

39:33.740 --> 39:35.940
and often when we were coming in behind

39:35.940 --> 39:38.780
on pushing on issues related to NATO

39:38.780 --> 39:43.020
or other things in this same sphere,

39:43.020 --> 39:45.340
it would actually have an effect.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.580
It just doesn't get talked about

39:46.580 --> 39:48.500
because it gets overshadowed

39:48.500 --> 39:51.700
by all of the other kind of stuff around this

39:51.700 --> 39:54.140
and the way that he interacted with people

39:54.140 --> 39:56.020
and treated people.

39:56.900 --> 39:59.580
What was the heart, the key insights

39:59.580 --> 40:01.500
to your testimony in that impeachment?

40:02.500 --> 40:05.140
Look, I think there is a straight line

40:05.140 --> 40:08.340
between that whole series of episodes

40:08.340 --> 40:10.460
and the current war in Ukraine.

40:10.460 --> 40:12.220
Because Vladimir Putin and the people around him

40:12.220 --> 40:15.180
in the Kremlin concluded that the US

40:15.180 --> 40:17.020
did not care one little bit about Ukraine

40:17.020 --> 40:18.900
and it was just a game.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.620
For Trump, it was personal game.

40:20.620 --> 40:24.700
He was basically trying to get Vladimir Zelensky

40:24.700 --> 40:27.780
to do him a personal favor related to his desire

40:28.260 --> 40:32.540
to stay on in power in the 2020 election.

40:33.620 --> 40:36.420
And generally they just thought that we were using Ukraine

40:36.420 --> 40:39.380
as some kind of proxy or some kind of instrument

40:39.380 --> 40:40.700
within our own domestic politics

40:40.700 --> 40:42.700
as that's what it looked like.

40:42.700 --> 40:45.060
And I think that as a result of that,

40:45.060 --> 40:48.980
Putin took the idea away

40:48.980 --> 40:50.860
that he could do whatever he wanted.

40:50.860 --> 40:53.340
We were constantly being asked even prior to this

40:53.380 --> 40:58.380
by people around Putin like Nikolai Patrushev,

40:59.540 --> 41:03.340
the head of the National Security Council equivalent

41:03.340 --> 41:04.580
in Russia who we met with frequently.

41:04.580 --> 41:05.420
What's Ukraine to you?

41:05.420 --> 41:06.380
We don't get it.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.900
Why do you even care?

41:07.900 --> 41:09.580
So they thought that we weren't serious.

41:09.580 --> 41:12.420
We weren't serious about Ukraine's territorial integrity

41:12.420 --> 41:16.540
and its independence or it is a national security player.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.780
And Putin also thought that he could just manipulate

41:19.780 --> 41:21.580
the political space in the United States.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.940
Actually he could because what he was doing

41:23.940 --> 41:28.940
was seeding all this dissent and fueling already

41:30.660 --> 41:33.620
debates inside of US politics.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.580
The kinds of things that we see just kind of coming out now.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.980
This kind of idea that Ukraine was a burden,

41:38.980 --> 41:42.900
that Ukraine was basically just trying to extract things

41:42.900 --> 41:43.940
from the United States.

41:43.940 --> 41:47.740
The Ukraine had somehow played inside of US politics.

41:47.740 --> 41:49.620
Trump was convinced that the Ukrainians

41:49.620 --> 41:50.580
had done something against him,

41:50.580 --> 41:52.860
that they had intervened in the elections.

41:52.860 --> 41:56.220
And that was kind of a combination of people around him

41:56.220 --> 41:59.780
trying to find excuses to kind of what had happened

41:59.780 --> 42:01.700
in the election to kind of divert attention away

42:01.700 --> 42:04.460
from Russia's interference in 2016

42:04.460 --> 42:06.980
and the Russians themselves poisoning the world

42:06.980 --> 42:08.420
against Ukraine.

42:08.420 --> 42:11.620
So you had a kind of a confluence of circumstances there.

42:11.620 --> 42:15.980
And what I was trying to get across in that testimony

42:15.980 --> 42:17.820
was the national security imperative

42:17.820 --> 42:20.220
of basically getting our act together here

42:20.860 --> 42:21.980
and separating out what was going on

42:21.980 --> 42:24.740
in our domestic politics from what was happening

42:24.740 --> 42:27.460
in our national security and foreign policy.

42:27.460 --> 42:31.420
I mean, I think we contributed in that whole mess

42:31.420 --> 42:35.340
around the impeachment, but it's the whole parallel policies

42:35.340 --> 42:38.540
around Ukraine to the war that we now have.

42:39.500 --> 42:40.500
That we're confronting.

42:40.500 --> 42:44.700
Signaling the value we place in peace and stability

42:44.700 --> 42:46.540
in that part of the world or the reverse

42:46.540 --> 42:47.780
by saying we don't care.

42:47.780 --> 42:48.820
Yeah, we seem to not care.

42:48.820 --> 42:49.660
It was just a game.

42:49.660 --> 42:54.660
But I mean, the US role in that war is very complicated.

42:54.820 --> 42:58.940
One, that's one of the variables.

42:58.940 --> 43:03.940
Just on that testimony, did it in part break your heart

43:05.620 --> 43:09.660
that you had to testify essentially against the president

43:09.660 --> 43:13.260
of the United States or is that not how you saw it?

43:15.740 --> 43:18.580
I don't think I would describe it in that way.

43:18.620 --> 43:21.580
I think what I was was deeply disappointed

43:21.580 --> 43:26.580
by what I saw happening in the American political space.

43:28.060 --> 43:29.620
I didn't expect it.

43:29.620 --> 43:32.460
Look, I was a starry-eyed immigrant.

43:32.460 --> 43:35.500
I came to the United States with all of these expectations

43:35.500 --> 43:36.340
of what the place would be.

43:36.340 --> 43:39.580
I'd already been disabused of some of the,

43:40.540 --> 43:43.260
let's just say, rosy perspectives

43:43.260 --> 43:44.260
that I held in the United States.

43:44.260 --> 43:49.260
I'd been shocked by the depths of racial problems.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.700
It doesn't even sum up the problems

43:53.700 --> 43:54.780
we have in the United States.

43:54.780 --> 43:58.020
I couldn't get my head around it when I first came.

43:58.020 --> 44:00.340
I'd read about slavery in American history,

44:00.340 --> 44:03.380
but I hadn't fully fathomed really the way

44:03.380 --> 44:05.580
that it was ripping apart the United States.

44:05.580 --> 44:08.420
I had to read Alexis Tocqueville and he'd commented on this

44:08.420 --> 44:10.500
and it obviously hadn't changed

44:10.500 --> 44:13.300
to the way that one would have expected all this time.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.460
From the 18th century onwards.

44:15.460 --> 44:17.100
So that was kind of one thing

44:17.100 --> 44:19.940
that I realized that the civil rights movement

44:19.940 --> 44:22.620
and all of these acts of expansion of suffrage

44:22.620 --> 44:25.420
and everything else were imperfect at best.

44:25.420 --> 44:28.380
And I was born in 65, the same time as the Civil Rights Act

44:28.380 --> 44:29.700
and there was heck of a long way still to go.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.980
So I wasn't, let's just say,

44:31.980 --> 44:34.940
as starry-eyed about everything as I'd been before,

44:34.940 --> 44:37.300
but I really saw an incredible competence

44:37.300 --> 44:39.620
and professionalism in the US government.

44:39.620 --> 44:42.980
It was in the election system and the integrity of it.

44:43.380 --> 44:44.220
I really saw that.

44:44.220 --> 44:46.460
I saw that the United States was the gold standard

44:46.460 --> 44:49.140
for some of its institutions.

44:49.140 --> 44:50.820
I worked in the National Intelligence Council

44:50.820 --> 44:52.300
and I'd seen the way that the United States

44:52.300 --> 44:56.420
had tried to address the problems that it had faced

44:56.420 --> 45:00.580
in this whole botched analysis of Iraq

45:00.580 --> 45:03.020
and this terrible strategic blunder of,

45:04.180 --> 45:07.380
honestly a crime in my view of invading Iraq,

45:07.380 --> 45:10.300
but the way that people were trying to deal with that

45:10.300 --> 45:11.140
in the aftermath.

45:11.140 --> 45:13.380
I went into the National Intelligence Council

45:13.380 --> 45:16.100
and the DNI, the Office of the Director

45:16.100 --> 45:16.940
of National Intelligence,

45:16.940 --> 45:19.340
when they were coming to terms with what had gone wrong

45:19.340 --> 45:22.860
in the whole analysis about Iraq in 2003,

45:22.860 --> 45:24.740
in the whole wake of people trying to pull together

45:24.740 --> 45:28.180
after 9-11 and to learn all of the lessons from all of this.

45:28.180 --> 45:30.340
And I saw just really genuine striving

45:30.340 --> 45:32.660
and deliberation about what had gone wrong,

45:32.660 --> 45:34.700
what lessons could we learn from this?

45:34.700 --> 45:38.540
And then suddenly I found myself in this,

45:38.540 --> 45:39.700
I couldn't really describe it in any words,

45:39.860 --> 45:41.540
totally crazy looking glass,

45:41.540 --> 45:43.020
thinking of Alice in Wonderland,

45:43.020 --> 45:45.340
Alice Through the Looking Glass version

45:45.340 --> 45:46.700
of American politics.

45:47.860 --> 45:50.020
I mean, I'd seen everything starting to unravel

45:50.020 --> 45:51.300
over a period of time

45:51.300 --> 45:52.860
before I'd been asked to be in the administration,

45:52.860 --> 45:54.580
but I did not expect it to be that bad.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.220
I honestly didn't.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.020
I mean, I'd been warned by people

45:58.020 --> 46:03.020
that this was kind of really a very serious turn

46:03.020 --> 46:04.140
that the United States had taken,

46:04.140 --> 46:06.540
but I really thought that national security

46:06.540 --> 46:08.500
would still be uppermost in people's minds.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.060
And it was, I mean, a lot of the people that I work with,

46:11.060 --> 46:14.780
but what I found, if you want to use that term

46:14.780 --> 46:17.700
of heartbreaking, was the way in which

46:17.700 --> 46:22.700
all of these principles that I had really bought into

46:22.820 --> 46:26.300
and tried to uphold in the United States government

46:26.300 --> 46:28.060
and in the things that we were trying to do

46:28.060 --> 46:28.900
with me and my colleagues

46:28.900 --> 46:31.220
was just being thrown out the window.

46:31.220 --> 46:34.780
And I would have to step up in defense of them

46:34.780 --> 46:37.060
and in defense of my colleagues who were being lambasted

46:37.060 --> 46:39.660
and criticized and given death threats

46:39.660 --> 46:41.740
for actually standing up and doing their own jobs.

46:41.740 --> 46:44.140
In particular on the topic of Ukraine?

46:44.140 --> 46:46.220
Not just on Ukraine, but on national security overall.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.940
So, I mean, I'd gone through this whole period

46:47.940 --> 46:50.300
even before we got to that point.

46:50.300 --> 46:53.340
I'm seeing non-partisan government officials

46:53.340 --> 46:55.620
being attacked from all sides,

46:55.620 --> 46:58.460
left and right, but especially the right,

46:58.460 --> 47:01.580
and being basically accused of being partisan hacks

47:01.580 --> 47:05.460
in a deep state, coup plotters, you name it.

47:05.460 --> 47:09.780
And the patriotism being questioned as well.

47:09.780 --> 47:11.420
And a lot of people I worked with in government,

47:11.420 --> 47:12.940
like myself, naturalized Americans,

47:12.940 --> 47:15.260
a lot of them were immigrants, many were refugees,

47:15.260 --> 47:18.140
and many people had fought in wars

47:18.140 --> 47:19.540
on behalf of the United States

47:19.540 --> 47:21.260
and Iraq and Afghanistan being blown up.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.900
And they'd put their lives on the line.

47:24.900 --> 47:27.140
They'd put their family lives on the line

47:27.140 --> 47:28.660
because they believed in America.

47:28.660 --> 47:31.260
And they were reflections of Americans

47:31.260 --> 47:33.180
from all kinds of walks of life.

47:33.180 --> 47:36.260
Because what really made that cliche of America great,

47:36.260 --> 47:39.300
it wasn't whatever it was that was being bandied around

47:39.300 --> 47:41.780
in these crude, crass political terms.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.900
It was just the strength of an incredible set of people

47:43.900 --> 47:45.940
who've come together from all kinds of places

47:45.940 --> 47:48.860
and decided that they're gonna make a go of it,

47:48.860 --> 47:51.660
and that they're going to try to work towards

47:51.660 --> 47:54.700
the whole idea of the preamble of the Constitution

47:54.700 --> 47:56.060
towards a more perfect union.

47:56.060 --> 47:58.380
And I saw people doing that every single day,

47:58.380 --> 48:00.340
despite all of the things that they could criticize

48:00.340 --> 48:01.260
about the United States,

48:01.260 --> 48:02.860
still believing in what they were doing

48:02.900 --> 48:04.140
and believing in the promise of the country,

48:04.140 --> 48:05.340
which is what I felt like.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.660
And then here we were,

48:06.660 --> 48:09.060
people were just treating it like a game,

48:09.060 --> 48:11.380
and they were treating people like dirt.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.300
And they were just playing games with people's lives.

48:13.300 --> 48:15.220
I mean, we all had death threats.

48:15.220 --> 48:17.340
People's whole careers,

48:17.340 --> 48:19.820
which were not just careers for their own self-aggrandizement,

48:19.820 --> 48:21.780
but careers of public service,

48:21.780 --> 48:25.260
trying to give something back, were being shattered.

48:25.260 --> 48:27.020
And I just thought to myself,

48:27.020 --> 48:29.020
I'm not gonna let that happen

48:29.020 --> 48:30.740
because I've come from a,

48:30.740 --> 48:32.540
well, are they gonna send me back to Bishop Auckland

48:32.540 --> 48:33.380
and County Durham?

48:33.380 --> 48:35.580
Fine, I'm totally fine to go back,

48:35.580 --> 48:37.020
because I could do something back there.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.420
But I'm not gonna let this happen.

48:38.420 --> 48:39.940
I've made this choice to come to America.

48:39.940 --> 48:41.340
I'm all in.

48:41.340 --> 48:44.980
And these guys are just behaving like a bunch of idiots.

48:44.980 --> 48:46.900
And they're ruining it, they're ruining it for everybody.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.900
So the personal attacks on competent,

48:49.900 --> 48:51.620
hardworking, passionate people

48:51.620 --> 48:54.620
who have love for what they do in their heart.

48:54.620 --> 48:59.020
Similar stuff I've seen for virologists and biologists,

48:59.020 --> 49:02.420
so colleagues, basically scientists in the time of COVID

49:03.260 --> 49:04.820
and there's a bunch of cynicism.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.060
And there was just personal attacks,

49:07.060 --> 49:11.580
including death threats on people that work on viruses,

49:11.580 --> 49:12.420
work on vaccines.

49:12.420 --> 49:13.660
Yeah, and they're going around in,

49:13.660 --> 49:16.460
basically with protective gear on

49:16.460 --> 49:17.980
in case somebody shoots them in the street.

49:17.980 --> 49:19.740
That's just absurd.

49:19.740 --> 49:24.140
But, let me zoom out from the individual people.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.260
Yeah.

49:25.260 --> 49:29.060
And actually look at the situations that we saw

49:30.020 --> 49:35.020
in the George W. Bush, Obama and Donald Trump presidencies.

49:37.620 --> 49:41.180
And I'd like to sort of criticize each

49:43.020 --> 49:45.900
by not the treatment of individual people,

49:45.900 --> 49:47.300
but by the results.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.100
Right, yeah, I think that's fair.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.180
So if you look at George W. Bush,

49:51.180 --> 49:53.260
and maybe you can give me insights,

49:53.260 --> 49:54.820
this is what's fascinating to me.

49:54.820 --> 49:56.860
When you have extremely competent,

49:57.660 --> 50:02.460
smart, hardworking, well-intentioned people,

50:02.460 --> 50:07.460
how do we, as a system, make mistakes in foreign policy?

50:08.180 --> 50:13.180
So the big mistake you can characterize in different ways,

50:13.300 --> 50:16.780
but in George W. Bush is invading Iraq,

50:16.780 --> 50:18.980
or maybe how it was invaded,

50:18.980 --> 50:23.420
or maybe how the decision process was made to invade it.

50:23.580 --> 50:27.140
Again, Afghanistan, maybe not the invasion,

50:27.140 --> 50:31.740
but details around having a plan

50:31.740 --> 50:34.700
about how to withdraw, all that kind of stuff.

50:34.700 --> 50:39.300
Then Barack Obama, to me, similarly,

50:39.300 --> 50:44.300
is a man who came to fame early on

50:44.300 --> 50:46.540
for being somebody who was against,

50:46.540 --> 50:49.500
a rare voice against the invasion of Iraq,

50:49.540 --> 50:53.500
which was actually a brave thing to do at that time.

50:54.580 --> 50:58.860
And nevertheless, he, I mean, I don't know the numbers,

50:58.860 --> 51:02.780
but I think he was the president for years

51:02.780 --> 51:05.700
over increased drone attacks,

51:05.700 --> 51:10.700
like everything from a foreign policy perspective,

51:11.540 --> 51:14.780
the military industrial complex,

51:14.780 --> 51:17.940
that machine grew in power under him,

51:17.940 --> 51:22.940
not shrunk, and did not withdraw from Afghanistan.

51:24.220 --> 51:26.900
And then with Donald Trump,

51:26.900 --> 51:28.860
the criticisms that you're presenting,

51:28.860 --> 51:33.460
sort of the personal attacks, the chaos,

51:33.460 --> 51:36.140
the partisanship of people

51:36.140 --> 51:38.100
that are supposed to be nonpartisan.

51:38.100 --> 51:41.060
So that, you know, if you do sort of the steel man,

51:41.060 --> 51:44.380
the chaos, to make the case for chaos,

51:44.380 --> 51:47.340
maybe we need to shake up the machine,

51:47.380 --> 51:51.620
throw a wrench into the engine, into the gears.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.220
And then every individual gear

51:53.220 --> 51:55.140
is gonna be very upset with that,

51:55.140 --> 51:58.180
because it's a wrench, it's an inefficient process,

51:58.180 --> 52:01.380
but maybe it leads for government.

52:01.380 --> 52:04.500
It forces the system as a whole, not the individuals,

52:04.500 --> 52:07.780
but the system to reconsider how things are done.

52:07.780 --> 52:09.860
So obviously all of those things,

52:11.020 --> 52:14.060
the actual results are not that impressive.

52:14.060 --> 52:15.780
You could have done that on the latter,

52:16.020 --> 52:18.300
shaking things up, because I'm all one for questioning

52:18.300 --> 52:19.460
and trying to shake things up as well

52:19.460 --> 52:21.220
and do things differently.

52:21.220 --> 52:23.780
But the question is, if you bring the whole system down

52:23.780 --> 52:26.860
with nothing, ideas of putting it to the place.

52:26.860 --> 52:28.940
Like many people, I've studied the Bolshevik Revolution

52:28.940 --> 52:33.820
and many others as well, and kind of what's the pattern here

52:33.820 --> 52:36.060
that actually fits into what you're talking about here

52:36.060 --> 52:37.380
is a kind of rigidity of thought

52:37.380 --> 52:39.740
on the part of revolutionaries in many cases as well.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.780
And also narcissism.

52:41.780 --> 52:45.540
In fact, I think it takes a pretty strong sense of yourself,

52:46.500 --> 52:48.740
to want to be president of the United States, for example,

52:48.740 --> 52:50.980
and we see that in many of our presidents

52:50.980 --> 52:53.620
have been narcissists to different kind of degrees.

52:53.620 --> 52:55.700
You think about Lenin, for example,

52:55.700 --> 52:58.300
and people can go back and read about Lenin.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.980
He formed his views when he was about 18

52:59.980 --> 53:01.740
and he never shook them off.

53:01.740 --> 53:03.140
He never evolved.

53:03.140 --> 53:06.300
He didn't have any kind of diversity of thought.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.820
And when systems go awry,

53:08.820 --> 53:11.980
it's when they don't bring in different perspectives.

53:11.980 --> 53:14.620
And so Trump, if you brought in different perspectives

53:14.620 --> 53:15.460
and actually listened to them

53:15.460 --> 53:17.260
and not just believed that he himself

53:17.260 --> 53:18.300
knew better than anyone else

53:18.300 --> 53:20.340
and then tried to divide everybody against each other,

53:20.340 --> 53:21.780
it would have been a different matter.

53:21.780 --> 53:23.780
It's a tragedy of a completely and utterly lost

53:23.780 --> 53:28.300
set of opportunities because of the flaws in his own nature.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.980
Because I mean, again, there was all kinds of things

53:29.980 --> 53:31.380
that he could have done to shake things up

53:31.380 --> 53:32.940
and so many people around him

53:32.940 --> 53:34.580
remained completely disappointed.

53:34.580 --> 53:37.260
And of course he divided and pitted people against each other

53:37.260 --> 53:40.380
and are creating so much factualism in American politics

53:40.380 --> 53:42.060
that people have forgotten they're Americans.

53:42.060 --> 53:45.020
I think that they're red or blue parts of teams.

53:45.020 --> 53:46.900
And if you go back over history,

53:46.900 --> 53:50.700
that's a kind of a recipe for war and internal conflict.

53:50.700 --> 53:53.220
You go back to the Byzantine Empire, for example,

53:53.220 --> 53:56.220
there's the famous episode of the Nikkei riots

53:57.180 --> 54:01.620
in Constantinople where the whole city gets trashed

54:01.620 --> 54:03.620
because the greens, the reds, the blues,

54:03.620 --> 54:06.460
and these various sporting teams in the hippodrome

54:06.460 --> 54:08.420
get whipped up by political forces

54:08.420 --> 54:10.020
and they pull the place apart.

54:10.020 --> 54:11.900
And that's kind of where we've been heading

54:11.900 --> 54:13.380
on some of these trajectories.

54:13.380 --> 54:15.820
But the other point is when you look back

54:15.820 --> 54:17.460
at Bush and Obama as well,

54:17.460 --> 54:20.300
there's a very narrow circle of decision-making.

54:20.300 --> 54:23.700
Bush period, it's the focus on the executive branch

54:23.700 --> 54:25.660
with Dick Cheney as the vice president

54:25.660 --> 54:27.340
being very fixated on it.

54:27.340 --> 54:30.500
And Obama, it's he and kind of the bright young things

54:30.500 --> 54:35.260
around him from, he himself is kind of intellectually,

54:36.740 --> 54:39.460
one might say arrogant in many respects.

54:39.740 --> 54:43.180
He's a very smart guy and he's convinced that he has

54:43.180 --> 54:44.860
and he ruminates over a lot of things,

54:44.860 --> 54:47.940
but he's the person who makes a lot of decisions.

54:47.940 --> 54:51.340
And basically George W. Bush used to call himself

54:51.340 --> 54:52.460
the decider as well, right?

54:52.460 --> 54:54.620
I mean, they're all the people who make the decisions.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.460
It's not always as consultative as you might think it is.

54:57.460 --> 55:00.260
And for Trump, it's like, I'm not listening to anybody at all.

55:00.260 --> 55:02.620
It's just me and whatever it is that I've woken up today

55:02.620 --> 55:04.060
and I've decided to do.

55:04.060 --> 55:05.860
So I think the problem with all of our systems

55:05.860 --> 55:08.500
and why we don't get results is because we don't draw

55:08.500 --> 55:11.540
upon the diversity of opinion and all the ideas

55:11.540 --> 55:12.780
of people out there.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.580
You do that in science.

55:14.580 --> 55:17.820
I mean, all of my friends and relatives are in science.

55:17.820 --> 55:19.500
They've got these incredible collaborations

55:19.500 --> 55:21.300
with people across the world.

55:21.300 --> 55:24.420
I mean, how did we get to these vaccines for the COVID virus?

55:24.420 --> 55:27.420
Because of this incredible years of collaboration

55:27.420 --> 55:30.620
and of sharing results and sharing and ideas.

55:30.620 --> 55:34.220
And our whole system has become ossified.

55:34.220 --> 55:36.500
We think about the congressional system, for example,

55:36.820 --> 55:39.340
and there's this kind of rapid turnover

55:39.340 --> 55:41.780
that you have in Congress every two years.

55:41.780 --> 55:43.900
There's no incentive for people basically

55:43.900 --> 55:45.140
to work with others.

55:45.140 --> 55:46.620
They're constantly campaigning.

55:46.620 --> 55:48.860
They're constantly trying to appeal to whatever their base is

55:48.860 --> 55:50.580
and they don't really care about.

55:50.580 --> 55:54.180
Some do, of their constituents, but a lot of people don't.

55:54.180 --> 55:56.500
And the Senate, it's all kind of focused on the game

55:56.500 --> 56:00.780
of legislation for so many people as well.

56:00.780 --> 56:03.300
Not focusing again on that kind of sense

56:03.300 --> 56:04.900
about what are we doing like scientists

56:04.940 --> 56:07.140
to kind of work together for the good of the country

56:07.140 --> 56:08.380
to push things along.

56:08.380 --> 56:11.660
And also our government also is siloed.

56:11.660 --> 56:14.900
There's not a lot of mechanisms for bringing people together.

56:14.900 --> 56:15.900
There ought to be and things like

56:15.900 --> 56:17.540
the National Security Council,

56:17.540 --> 56:19.420
the National Intelligence Council actually did that

56:19.420 --> 56:22.580
quite successfully at times for analysis that I saw.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.780
But we don't have, we have it within

56:24.780 --> 56:26.020
the National Institutes of Health,

56:26.020 --> 56:29.620
but we saw the CDC break down on this kind of front.

56:29.620 --> 56:32.260
We don't have sufficient of those institutions

56:32.260 --> 56:33.420
that bring people together

56:33.420 --> 56:35.660
from all kinds of different backgrounds.

56:35.660 --> 56:38.060
One of the other problems that we've have with government,

56:38.060 --> 56:42.420
with the federal government over state and local government

56:42.420 --> 56:43.780
is it's actually quite small.

56:43.780 --> 56:46.020
People think that the federal government's huge

56:46.020 --> 56:47.380
because we've got postal service

56:47.380 --> 56:48.700
and the military that are part of it.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.180
But your actual federal government employees

56:51.180 --> 56:53.060
is a very small number.

56:53.060 --> 56:56.060
And the senior executive service part of that

56:56.060 --> 56:58.580
is the older white guys who kind of come up

56:58.580 --> 57:01.060
all the way over the last several decades.

57:01.060 --> 57:03.780
We have a really hard time bringing in younger people

57:03.780 --> 57:05.260
into that kind of government service

57:05.260 --> 57:06.700
unless they're political hacks

57:06.700 --> 57:08.540
and they want to kind of,

57:08.540 --> 57:11.780
or they're kind of looking for power and sort of influence.

57:11.780 --> 57:13.660
We have a hard time getting people like yourself

57:13.660 --> 57:16.620
and other younger people kind of coming in

57:16.620 --> 57:18.940
to make a career out of public service

57:18.940 --> 57:20.500
and also retaining them.

57:20.500 --> 57:24.460
Because people with incredible skills

57:24.460 --> 57:27.340
often get poached away into the private sector.

57:27.340 --> 57:28.900
And a lot of the people that I work

57:28.900 --> 57:30.260
with in the national security side

57:30.260 --> 57:35.260
are now at all kinds of high-end political consultancies

57:36.140 --> 57:37.500
or they've gone to Silicon Valley

57:37.500 --> 57:40.380
and they've gone to this place and that place.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.420
Because after a time as a younger person,

57:42.420 --> 57:44.500
they're not rising up particularly quickly

57:44.500 --> 57:46.220
because there's a pretty rigid way of looking

57:46.220 --> 57:49.460
at the hierarchies and the promotion schemes.

57:49.460 --> 57:51.300
And they're also getting lambasted by everybody.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.540
People like public servants,

57:53.540 --> 57:54.780
they're not really public servants.

57:54.780 --> 57:58.500
There's this whole lack and loss

57:58.500 --> 58:01.300
of kind of a faith in public service.

58:01.300 --> 58:04.300
And the last few years have really done a lot of damage.

58:04.300 --> 58:08.020
We need to revitalize our government system

58:08.020 --> 58:09.100
to get better results.

58:09.100 --> 58:10.260
We need to bring more people in,

58:10.260 --> 58:11.620
even if it's for a period of time,

58:11.620 --> 58:14.780
not just through expensive contracts

58:14.780 --> 58:17.980
for the big consulting companies

58:17.980 --> 58:21.300
and other entities that do government work out there,

58:21.300 --> 58:23.180
but getting people in for a period of time,

58:23.180 --> 58:26.700
expanding some of these management fellowships

58:26.700 --> 58:28.580
and the White House fellows

58:28.580 --> 58:32.460
and bringing in scientists from the outside,

58:32.460 --> 58:36.300
giving that kind of opportunity for collaboration

58:36.300 --> 58:37.820
that we see in other spheres.

58:37.820 --> 58:40.460
I think that's actually one of the biggest roles

58:40.460 --> 58:44.820
for a president that for some reason during the election

58:44.820 --> 58:48.940
that's never talked about is how good are you at hiring

58:48.940 --> 58:53.700
and creating a culture of attracting the right,

58:53.700 --> 58:55.580
I mean, basically chief hire.

58:55.580 --> 59:00.580
When you think of a CEO, like the great CEOs are,

59:01.940 --> 59:04.100
I mean, maybe people don't talk about it that often,

59:04.100 --> 59:08.140
but they do more often for CEOs than they do for presidents

59:08.140 --> 59:10.460
is like how good are you at building a team?

59:10.460 --> 59:11.620
Well, we make it really difficult

59:11.620 --> 59:12.740
because of the political process.

59:12.740 --> 59:14.260
I mean, and also because we have

59:14.260 --> 59:16.020
so many political appointments,

59:16.020 --> 59:17.700
we ought to have less, to be honest.

59:17.700 --> 59:20.220
I mean, if you look at other governments around the world,

59:20.220 --> 59:21.580
you know, there's a smaller,

59:21.580 --> 59:23.940
it's much easier for them to hire people in.

59:23.940 --> 59:24.780
Yeah.

59:24.860 --> 59:26.660
Successful governments are much smaller.

59:26.660 --> 59:28.540
And it's not that I say that the government

59:28.540 --> 59:29.540
is necessarily too big,

59:29.540 --> 59:32.900
but it's just thinking about each unit in a different way.

59:32.900 --> 59:35.300
We shouldn't be having so many political appointments.

59:35.300 --> 59:37.020
We should kind of find more professional appointments,

59:37.020 --> 59:39.140
more non-parties on appointments,

59:39.140 --> 59:42.180
because every single administration that we've had

59:42.180 --> 59:45.660
over the last, let's say span of presidencies,

59:45.660 --> 59:47.940
they have jobs that are unfulfilled

59:47.940 --> 59:50.020
because they can't get their candidates

59:50.020 --> 59:52.540
through Congress and the Senate

59:52.540 --> 59:54.100
because of all the kind of political games

59:54.580 --> 59:55.420
that are being played.

59:55.420 --> 59:57.100
I know loads of people have just been held up

59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.340
because it's just on the whim of some member of Congress,

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.140
even though that the actual position that they want

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.900
is really technical and doesn't really care

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.940
about what political preference they particularly have.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.620
So I think we have to try to look

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.980
at the whole system of governments

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.740
in the way that we would over other professional sectors

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.300
and to try to think about this as,

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.180
just as you said there,

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.820
that this is a government that's actually

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.460
running our country.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.180
This is an operating system

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.220
and you wouldn't operate it like that

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.580
if you were looking at it in any kind of rational way.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.900
It shouldn't be so ideologically or partisan-tainted

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.260
at every level anyway.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.740
So I would actually just say,

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.460
make a bid for a more non-partisan approach

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.900
to a lot of the parts of government.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.940
You can still kind of bring in the political and premature,

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.740
but also you have to explain to people

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.660
writ large in America as well that this is your government

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.900
and that actually you could also be part of this.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.940
Things like the Small Business Administration,

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.700
the US Department of Agriculture,

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.500
all these kinds of things that actually people interact with

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.380
but they don't even know it,

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.700
the Postal Service, all of these things.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.980
People actually, when you ask them

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.980
about different functions of government,

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.940
they have a lot of support for it,

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.580
the National Park Service, for example.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.300
It's just when you talk about government in an abstract way,

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.380
they're like, ooh, too much bloated,

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.900
not efficient and effective.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.260
But if you kind of bring it down more

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.900
to the kind of local and federal levels,

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.660
that's kind of when people really see it

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.740
if people could see kind of themselves reflected

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.620
and many of the people have gone into public service,

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.380
I think that they would have a lot more support for it.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:33.900
More like superstars, like individuals

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:38.380
that are like big on social media, big in the public eye

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.060
and having fun with it and showing cool stuff that is not.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.380
Right now, a lot of people see government

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.620
as basically partisan warfare.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.660
And then it makes it unpleasant to do the job.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.140
It makes it uninspiring for people looking in from outside

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.980
about what's going on inside government,

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.180
all of it, the whole thing.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.780
But you are, just with all due respect,

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.100
you're a pretty rare individual in terms of nonpartisanship.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.580
Like actually your whole life story,

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.340
the humbling aspect of your upbringing

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.140
and everything like that.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.460
Do you think it's possible

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.220
to have a lot of nonpartisan experts in government?

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:26.220
Like can you be a top presidential advisor on Russia

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:31.380
for 10 years, for 15 years, and remain nonpartisan?

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.340
I think you can.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.020
I don't think that's advisable, though, by the way,

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.100
because I mean, I don't think anybody should be there.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.740
So your first advice is to fire yourself after 10 years.

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.780
Well, you should definitely have a term limit.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.180
It's just like you should in everything, right?

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.340
I mean, it's just like tenure in university.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.300
Well, we all have term limits.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.700
Yeah, you kind of, we do, we have natural term limits,

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.220
but you're kind of basically bottling it up

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.660
for other people.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:56.740
I mean, what I'm trying to do now, I'm 57 now,

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.940
and I always try to work with people

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.460
from different generations to me,

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.340
just like I've really benefited

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.420
from these kind of mentorships of people older.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.580
You can mentor up and well and mentor down.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.860
I mean, I would try to get people

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.840
from different backgrounds and different generations

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.300
to work together in teams, honestly.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.900
I'd like a more team networked kind of approach to things,

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.380
the kind of things that you get again in science, right?

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.740
I mean, all these ideas are gonna come

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.940
from all kinds of different perspectives.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.340
Age and experience does count for something,

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.020
but fresh ideas and coming in

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.260
and looking at a problem from a different perspective

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.100
and seeing something that somebody else hasn't seen before.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.660
I mean, I just kind of love working in an environment

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.340
with all kinds of different people

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.580
and people who don't agree with you.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.180
You need people to take you on

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.780
and say, absolutely, that's crap.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.140
Where did you come up with that from?

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.380
And they go, hang on.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.260
Well, explain to me why you think so.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.780
And then, you have this kind of iterative process

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.620
back and forth.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.780
I mean, I would always encourage my colleagues

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.460
to tell me when they thought it was wrong.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.480
I mean, sometimes I didn't agree

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.700
because I didn't see the reasoning,

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.580
but other times I'd be like, they're right.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.900
That was a complete mistake.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.980
I need to admit that,

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.740
and we need to figure out a different way of doing things.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.300
But the one point I do wanna get across

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.700
is there were a lot of people

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.580
who were non-partisan that I worked with.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.620
I mean, honestly, in most of the jobs that I had

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.860
up until more recently,

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.340
I had no idea about people's political affiliation.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.780
It's just when you get into this kind of

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.960
highly charged partisan environment,

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.220
they kind of force people to make decisions.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.620
And when you have one political party,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.540
a political faction that's trying to usurp power,

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.340
it does make it quite difficult.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.420
I mean, that's the situation that we're in right now.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.340
And we're seeing some of the things happening in United States

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.380
I've seen and studied in other settings

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.460
or seen for myself happening.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:45.460
When you have a president who wants to cling onto power,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.460
you've gotta call that out.

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.180
Is that a partisan act or is that a kind of defense

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.180
of that larger political system that you're part of?

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.420
So I think we've got to recognize

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.860
that even if you're not partisan,

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.460
you can be politically engaged.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.020
And sometimes you just have to stand up there

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.300
and speak out, which is what I did

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.580
and what others did as well.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.580
None of those people who spoke out

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.460
can initially saw that as a partisan act,

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.900
even if some of them since then

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.740
have decided to make political choices

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.980
they hadn't made before.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.860
Because the situation actually forced people

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:22.060
into taking sides.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.420
It's very hard to still stay above the fray

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.940
when you've got someone who's trying to perpetrate a coup.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.000
Yeah, just to linger on that,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.260
I think it's hard and it's the courageous thing to do

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.220
to criticize a president

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.660
and not fall into partisanship after.

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.260
Because the whole world will assume

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.300
if you criticize Donald Trump,

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.580
that you're clearly a Democrat.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.820
And so they will just,

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.660
everybody will criticize you for being a Democrat.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.740
And then, so you're now stuck in that.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.620
So you're going to just embrace that role.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.860
But to still walk the nonpartisan route

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.500
after the criticism, that's the hard road.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.220
To not let the criticisms break you into

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.460
a certain kind of ideological set of positions.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.220
I mean, our political system needs revitalization.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.420
We need to be taking a long, hard look at ourselves here.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.420
And I think what people are calling out for,

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.020
look, there's a vast wave of population,

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.980
like me, who are unaffiliated.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.020
Maybe some lean in one direction over another.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.660
And unaffiliated doesn't mean you don't have views

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.500
about things and political opinions.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.420
And you may sound quite extreme on some of those,

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.180
either from a left or right perspective.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:39.460
What people are looking for is kind of an articulation

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.820
of things in a kind of a clear way

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.100
that they can get a handle on.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.940
And they're also looking for a representation.

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.060
Somebody's going to be there for you.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.380
You're not part of a kind of a rigid team

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.380
that you're excluded from.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.820
You're the ins and the outs.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.180
But what people are looking at now,

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.660
they're looking at that in the workplace

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.100
because they're not finding that.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.620
In politics, you're actually getting workers,

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.900
pushing the, people talk about the rise of the workforce.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.500
People are just saying, hang on a sec,

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.900
the most important space that I'm in right now

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.180
is my workplace because that's where my benefits are from.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.580
They're not coming from the state.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.340
I mean, that's a peculiarity of the United States system.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.860
In Britain, you've got the National Health Service

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.180
and you've got all the kind of national wide benefits.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.460
You're not tethered to your employer

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.700
like you are in the United States.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.780
But here now, we're asking people,

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:26.060
people are pushing for more representation.

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.700
They're asking to be represented within their workplace,

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.300
be it Starbucks, where various other Starbucks employees

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.500
are trying to unionize.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.700
We have unions among our research assistants,

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.340
the Brookings Institution where I am,

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.460
kind of teaching assistants and big universities

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.220
doing the same kind of thing as well

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.020
because they want to have their voice heard.

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.620
They want to kind of play a larger role

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.700
and they want to have change.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.460
And they're often pushing their companies

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:51.020
or the institutions they work for to make that change

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.660
because they don't see it happening

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.420
in the political sphere.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.700
So it's not just enough to go out there

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.900
and protest in the street,

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.700
but if you want something to happen,

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.460
that's why you're seeing big corporations

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.060
playing a bigger role as well.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.020
Yeah, and of course, there's a longer discussion.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.660
There's also criticisms of that mechanisms of unions

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.740
to achieve the giving of a voice to a people.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.180
This goes back to my own experience

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.220
growing up in Northern England.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.460
The Durham miners that I was part of for generations,

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.740
first person in my family not in the mines on my dad's side,

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.900
they created their own association.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.860
It wasn't a union per se at the very beginning.

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.860
Later, they became part of the National Miners Union.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.420
They lost their autonomy and independence

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.700
as a result of that.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.100
But what they did was they pooled their resources.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.300
They set up their own parliament

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.340
so they could all get together.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.860
Literally, they built a parliament.

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.500
And it opened in the same time as World War I

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.420
and where they all got together

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.260
because they didn't have the vote.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.980
They didn't have suffrage at the time

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.340
because they didn't have any money.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.500
So they couldn't pay the tax

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.660
and they couldn't run for parliament.

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.300
And this is the kind of the origins

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:57.100
of the organized labor parties later.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.620
But they create this association

01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.460
so they could talk about

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.620
how they could deal with things with their own communities

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:05.100
and have a voice in the things that mattered.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.500
Education, improving their work conditions.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.740
It wasn't like what you think about

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.580
some kind of like big political trade union

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.380
with left-wing kind of ideas.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.300
In fact, they actually tried to root out later

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.420
after the Bolshevik revolution in the Soviet Union

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.660
even when they were still having ties

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.820
with places like the minds of Don Bass in the 1920s,

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.580
Trotskyites and kind of Leninists and communists.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.540
They were more focused on how to improve

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.100
their own wellbeing, what they call the welfare.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.780
They had some welfare societies

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.940
where they were kind of trying to think

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:39.220
and that's kind of what boosters in Starbucks want

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.580
or workers in Amazon.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.860
They're looking about their own wellbeing.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.660
It's not just about pay and work conditions.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.180
It's about what it means to be part of this larger entity

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.620
because you're not feeling that same kind of connection

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.900
to politics at the moment

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.460
because you're being told by a representative,

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.940
sorry, I don't represent you because you didn't vote for me.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.540
If you're not a Democrat, you're not Republican,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.700
you're not red, you're not blue, you're not mine.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.460
And so people are saying, well, I'm in this workplace.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.460
This is kind of my collective.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.340
This is therefore, this is where I'm gonna have to try

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.580
to push to make change.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.180
So, I mean, this is kind of happening here

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.540
and we have to realize that we've kind of gone

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.820
in a way full circle back to that kind of period

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.380
of the early emergence of sort of mass labor

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.020
and that's where the political parties that we know today

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.700
and the kind of early unions came out of as well.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.820
This sort of feeling of a mass society

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:33.140
but where people weren't really able to get together

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.740
and implement or push for change.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.020
With unions at a small scale and a local scale,

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.060
it's like every good idea on a small scale

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.780
can become a bad idea on a large scale.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.620
On a large scale, yeah.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:51.380
So like, marriage is a beautiful thing

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.980
but at a large scale, it becomes the marriage

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.900
industrial complex that tries to make money off of it

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.140
combined with the lawyers that try to make money

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.300
off the divorce, it just becomes this caricature

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.420
of a thing. Exactly.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.220
Or like Christmas and the holidays, it's like, it's just.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.900
I don't disagree but what I'm saying is there's,

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.140
people are basically looking for something here

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.860
and this is why, I mean, I myself am starting to think

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.660
about much more local kind of solutions

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.060
to a lot of these kind of problems.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.060
It's again, the team networked approach.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.060
On the impeachment, looking back

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.820
because you're part of it, you get to experience it.

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.540
Do you think they strengthened or weakened this nation?

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.780
I think it weakened in many respects

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.020
just the way that it was conducted.

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.100
I mean, there's a new book coming out

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.380
by a couple of journalists in the Washington Post.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.300
I haven't actually seen it yet, but I really did

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.780
kind of worry that myself that it became a spectacle.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.580
And although it actually, I think in many respects

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.220
was important in terms of an exercise

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.620
of civic responsibility and gave people

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.460
a big massive lesson in civics.

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.020
Everyone's kind of running out and looking up

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.060
the whole process of impeachment and what that meant

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.140
and congressional prerogatives.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.340
I was as well, I was running off myself

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.660
and trying to learn an enormous amount about it

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.300
because I was in the middle of all of this,

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.300
that it didn't ultimately show responsibility

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.340
and accountability.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.020
And that in itself was kind of was weakened

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.580
because on both sides, there was a lot of parties

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.540
on politics.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.780
I mean, I think that there was a dereliction of duty

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.180
in many respects.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.660
I mean, especially I have to say on the part

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.820
of Republican members of Congress,

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.780
who were kind of, they should have been embracing

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.820
Congress's prerogatives.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.940
You could have kind of basically done this

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.020
in something of a different way,

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:51.020
but the whole thing is because it was this larger atmosphere

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.580
of polarized, not even polarized,

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.900
but fractured politics.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.220
And I was deeply disappointed, I have to say,

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.940
and many of the members of Congress on the Republican side,

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.060
I mean, there's a lot of grandstanding

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.740
that I really didn't like a bit on the Democratic side either

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.620
and not admitting to mistakes and not kind of addressing

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.540
head on the fact that they'd kind of been pushing

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.100
for Trump to be impeached and talking about

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.500
being an illegitimate president,

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.580
kind of right from the very beginning.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.140
And as a result of that, a lot of people just saw this

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.740
as kind of a continuation of political games

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.700
coming out of the 2016 election.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.100
But on the Republican side, it was just a game.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:34.580
There was people I knew who were basically,

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.540
one of them winked at me in the middle of this

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.380
kind of impeachment.

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.260
It was just like, don't take this personally.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.100
This is-

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:42.940
This is a game.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:43.780
This is a game.

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.100
And I just thought, this isn't a game.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.100
And that's why I think that it kind of weakened

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.140
because, I mean, again, on the outside,

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.020
it weakened us, the whole process weakened us

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.300
in the eyes of the world, because again,

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.380
the United States was the gold standard.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.900
And I do think, I mean, again,

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.540
in the terms of the larger population,

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.580
although a lot of people did actually see the system

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.940
standing up trying to do something to help people account,

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.620
but there still was that element of circus

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.180
and a big political game.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.940
And people being careless with the country.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.460
But I do think that the Democrats

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.820
were the instigators of the circus.

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.700
So as a, it's perhaps subtle,

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.780
but there's a different way you talk about

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.060
issues or concerns about accountability

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.660
when you care about your country,

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.140
when you love your country, when you love the ideals,

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:38.380
and when you, versus when you just want to win.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:39.700
And stick it to the other side.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.540
No, I agree.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.380
I agree.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.860
I mean, there were people who I actually thought

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:46.620
managed that, that made it about the country

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.820
rather than about themselves.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:48.660
And there were others who did.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.820
But I guess there's no incentive to do that.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.060
Yeah, there were others who did a lot of grandstanding.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.900
Yeah.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.220
And that's another problem

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.860
of our political incentive structures,

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.580
that the kind of sense of accountability

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.020
and responsibility tends to be personal.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.140
You know, people, whether people decide to do it or not.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.740
It's not institutional, if that makes sense.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.500
We've had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of, that sense.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.260
Now, I took an oath of office,

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.500
and I'm assuming that most of them did too.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.100
You know, I had to be sworn in.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.700
You know, when I took those positions,

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.540
I took that seriously,

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.900
but I already took an oath of citizenship.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.420
There's, you know, presumably you did too, you know?

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.940
You kind of started to become an American citizen.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.180
It's not something you take on lightly.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.860
And, you know, that's why I felt this deep sense

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.620
of responsibility all the time,

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.180
which is why I went into the administration

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.020
in the first place.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.820
I mean, I got a lot of flak for it,

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.180
because, you know, I thought, well, look, I've been asked,

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:40.220
and there's a real issue here after the Russian interference

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.180
and, you know, the whole influence operation

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.540
in the 2016 elections.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.700
And I knew what was going on, and I should do something.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.500
You know, if not me, then, you know, okay,

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.540
someone else will go and do it,

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.860
but can I live with myself just sitting on the sidelines

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.180
and criticizing what people are doing, you know,

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.780
and kind of worrying about this?

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.180
Or am I actually going to muck in there

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.060
and, you know, just go and do something?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.780
It's like seeing your house on fire,

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.820
and you see that, you know, okay,

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.180
this is pretty awful and dangerous,

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.860
but I could go in there and do something.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.220
To clarify, the house on fire,

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.900
meaning the cyber war that's going on,

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.620
or cyber attacks, or cyber security.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.940
Well, in 2016, you know,

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.460
when the Russians had interfered in the election,

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.100
you know, I mean, basically,

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:25.140
this was a huge national security crisis.

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.780
And our politics, we'd gone mad as a result of it.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.860
And we, in fact, we were making the situation worse.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:34.100
And I felt that I could, you know, kind of at the time,

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.060
maybe I could do something here.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:36.140
I could try to clarify.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.420
I could, you know, work with others who I knew

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.180
in the government from previous stints in the government

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.220
to push back against this

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.500
and try to make sure it didn't happen again.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.380
And look, and I also didn't have this, you know,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.980
mad, you know, kind of crazy ideological view

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.820
of Russia either.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.640
I mean, I knew the place.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.220
I knew the people had been studying it a long time

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.420
and quite calm about it.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.060
I don't take it personally.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.660
It's not kind of an extension of self.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.340
It's, you know, something I've spent a long time

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.540
trying to understand for myself,

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.940
going back to that very beginning of

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.500
why were the Russians trying to blow us up?

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.620
There must be an explanation.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.660
There was a very complicated and complex explanation.

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.060
It wasn't as simple as how it sounded.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:14.060
And also there's a long tail to 2016,

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.380
you know, Putin's perceptions,

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.740
the kind of things that he thought were going on.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.980
You know, the whole way that what they did

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.900
was actually fairly straightforward.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.700
They'd done this before in the Soviet period

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.340
during the Cold War, classic influence operation.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:30.300
It just had gone beyond the bounds

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.660
of anything they could have anticipated

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.780
because of social media

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.980
and just a confluence of circumstances

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.460
in the United States as well.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.540
We were very fragile and vulnerable.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.820
And I remember at one point having a discussion

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.980
with the Russian ambassador where, you know,

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.420
we were complaining about the Russian intervention.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.140
He said, are you telling me

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.380
that the United States is a banana republic

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.820
that it's so vulnerable to these kinds of efforts?

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.980
He actually looked genuinely mystified,

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.140
although obviously it was probably part of a, you know,

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.820
kind of political schtick there, but he had a point.

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.220
The United States had never been that vulnerable

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.780
as it suddenly was in 2016.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.420
And in the time that I was in government

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.780
and going back to what you asked about

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.220
the whole impeachment and the whole exercise in Congress,

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.140
that vulnerability was as stark as it ever could be.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:23.940
Our domestic politics were as much a part of the problem

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.780
as anything else.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.900
They were the kindling to all of the kind of the fires.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.420
Putin didn't start any of this other kind of problems.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.660
Domestically, he just took advantage of them.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.460
And, you know, basically added a bit

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.060
of an accelerant here and there.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.180
Yeah, the interference, I mean,

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.980
that's a much longer discussion

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.940
because it's also for me, technically fascinating.

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.460
I've been playing with the idea of just launching

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:50.620
like a million bots,

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.300
but they're doing just positive stuff and just being kind.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.140
Yeah, I always kind of wonder if it's possible

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.220
to do something on this skill that's positive

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.100
because, you know, a lot of people seem to be able

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.940
to use all of this for pretty negative effect.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.220
You've got to kind of hope that you could do this,

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.420
use the same networks for positive effect.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.860
I think that's actually where a lot of the war,

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.300
I think from the original hackers to today,

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.660
what gives people like me and I think a lot of people

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.260
that in the hacking community pleasure

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:20.060
is to do something difficult,

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:25.060
break through the systems and do the ethical thing.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.300
So do the, because if there's something broken

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:33.420
about the system, you want to break through all the rules

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.260
and do something that you know in your heart

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.620
is the right thing to do.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.340
I mean, that's what Aaron Schwartz did

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.940
with releasing journals and publications

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.140
that were behind paywalls to the public

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.620
and got arrested for and then committed.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.220
But to me, it's fascinating because I,

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.780
maybe you can actually educate me,

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.140
but I felt that the Russian interference

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.780
in terms of social engineering,

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.140
in terms of bots, all that kind of stuff,

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.860
I feel like that was more used for political bickering

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.620
than to actually understand the national security problem

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:12.820
because I would like to know the actual numbers involved

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.660
in the influence.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.140
I would like to, I mean, obviously, hopefully,

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.260
people now understand that better

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.900
than are trying to defend the national security

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.460
of this country, but it felt like,

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.860
for example, if I launch one bot

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.260
and then just contact somebody at the New York Times

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.700
saying I launched this one bot,

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.700
they'll just say MIT scientists hacks,

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.980
and then it'll spread.

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.580
But that's exactly what happened.

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.020
It was kind of, I think that Putin

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.980
and some of the people around him understood

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:51.660
because, again, propaganda state,

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.900
they spend an awful lot of time

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.460
thinking about how you basically put out your own content

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.540
and how you get maximum effect through performance.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:03.300
Putin himself is a political performance artist.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.580
I mean, Trump understood exactly the same thing.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.140
They were actually operating in parallel,

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.380
not in collusion, but in parallel.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.700
Basically, Trump understood how to get lots of free air time,

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.060
how to get himself at the center of attention.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.060
Putin did that through a kind of, I think,

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.460
less organic kind of way.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.820
He had a lot of people working around him.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.340
I mean, that's the old Bolshevik agitprop

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.820
and kind of then the whole Soviet propaganda machine,

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.700
and Putin kind of growing up in that kind of environment

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.580
and having kind of the Kremlin press office

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.300
and all the kind of people around him

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.100
got kind of a massive machine, knew how that worked.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.380
I mean, they haven't done what the Chinese did in Russia

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.020
of like blocking everything and having a big firewall.

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.420
It was kind of putting out lots of content,

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.020
getting into the sort of center of attention.

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.060
Trump's doing the same kind of thing,

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.180
and the Russians understood

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.460
that if you put a bit of things out there

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.340
and then you call up the New York Times

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.860
and people are going to run with it.

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.340
And what they wanted was the perception

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.500
that they had actually swayed the election.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.420
They loved it.

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.140
This was the huge mistake of the Democrats and everything.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.100
I mean, I kept trying to push against this.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.140
No, they did not elect Donald Trump.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.500
Americans elected Donald Trump,

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.540
and the Electoral College was a key part.

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.940
Vladimir Putin didn't make that up.

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.100
And basically, I also remember at one point

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.740
the Russian ambassador talking to me

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.660
about when we were doing the standard,

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.540
here we are, we're lodging our complaint

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.020
about the interference.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:31.020
He basically said, well, we didn't kind of invent Comey

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:36.260
and basically the decision to reopen Hillary Clinton's emails

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:41.820
or kind of Anthony Weiner and kind of his emails

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.380
on his computer.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.980
And I was like, yeah, he's right.

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:50.020
I mean, there were plenty of things in our own system

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.220
that created chaos and tipped the election,

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.460
not kind of what the Russians did,

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.260
but it's obviously easier to blame the Russians

01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.700
and blame yourself when things are kind of,

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.980
or those random forces and those random factors,

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:07.660
because people couldn't understand what had happened in 2016.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.700
There was no hanging chats like 2000

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:13.100
where there was kind of a technical problem

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.140
that actually ended with the intervention

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.580
of the Supreme Court.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:20.020
There was pure and simple, the Electoral College at work

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.060
and a candidate that nobody had expected,

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.820
including the Republicans in the primaries,

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.060
to end up getting kind of elected or put forward

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.660
different 2016, suddenly becoming the president.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.020
And they needed a meta explanation.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.380
It was much better to say Vladimir Putin had done it

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.380
and Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin guys were like,

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.300
oh my God, yeah, fantastic.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:44.180
Champagne cocks popping, this is great, our chaos agent.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.020
They knew they hadn't done it,

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.020
but they'd love to take credit for it.

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.940
And so, the very fact that other people

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:52.220
couldn't explain these complex dynamics to themselves,

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.580
basically dovetails beautifully with Vladimir Putin's

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.220
attempts to be the kind of the Kremlin gremlin in the system.

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.820
And he's basically was taking advantage of that

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:07.340
forevermore, and I wanted to basically try to work with us

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.180
to cut through that.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.660
People lost faith in the integrity of the election system

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:12.900
because people were out there,

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.740
suggesting that the Russians had actually

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.580
to start the elections.

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.420
People written books about that.

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.420
They said that they hacked the system

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.900
when they were trying to hack our minds.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.820
But again, we were the fertile soul for this.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.460
We know this from Russian history,

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.100
the role of the Bolsheviks,

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.540
the whole 1920s and 1930s with Stalin,

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:35.020
the fellow travelers and the socialist international.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.820
I mean, the Russians and the Soviets,

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.060
we've been at this for years about kind of pulling

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.500
kind of people along and into kind of a broader frame,

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:47.380
but it didn't mean that they were influencing directly

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.060
the politics of countries writ large.

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.580
There were plenty of interventions.

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.660
It's just that we were somehow,

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.180
it was a confluence of events, a perfect storm.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:00.100
We were somehow exquisitely vulnerable

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.620
because of things that we had done to ourselves.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.580
It was what Americans were doing to themselves

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.460
that was the issue.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.500
You think that's the bigger threat

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.300
than large scale bot armies?

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.220
Those can be a threat.

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.420
Obviously they do have an impact,

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.620
but it's how people process information.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.780
It's kind of like the lack of critical thinking.

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.860
I'm just not on the internet to that extent.

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.660
I had to go looking for information.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.500
I'm not on social media.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.780
I'm in social media, but not by myself.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.140
I don't put myself out there.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.540
I haven't got a Twitter feed.

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.380
I haven't got a blog.

01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.220
You don't have a Twitter one.

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.340
Yeah, but there's a, you have a fan club on Twitter.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.620
I have all kinds of strange things.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.180
It's Fiona Hills Cup, which I kind of like.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.580
Occasionally I have people send things to me.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.580
You have so many fans.

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.420
It's hilarious.

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:44.020
But what I try to do is just be really critical.

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.060
I mean, my mom sends me stuff and I'm like, what is this?

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.140
It's just, your own mother can be as much

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.940
of an agent of misinformation as kind of Vladimir Putin.

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.140
I mean, we're all, we all have to really think

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.180
about what it is we're reading.

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.540
There's one thing from my childhood

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.980
that was really important.

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.180
I mean, I always think every kid in school should have this.

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:11.300
My next door neighbor who was,

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.020
he was actually very active in the Labour Party.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.500
And he was kind of really interested in the way

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.580
that opinion shaped people's political views.

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.300
He was Welsh, he was a native Welsh speaker.

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.980
So he was always trying to explore English

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.780
and how there was kind of the reach of the English culture

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.340
and how it was kind of shaping the way that people thought.

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.700
And he used to read every single newspaper

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:33.780
from all the different spectrums,

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.500
which was quite easy to do back in the 70s and 80s

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.020
because there weren't that many in the UK context.

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.540
And every Sunday he would get all the different Sunday papers

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.300
from all the different kind of ideological vantage points.

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.980
And then when I got to be a teenager,

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.540
he'd invite me to look at them with him.

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.420
Because he was my godfather and he was just an incredible guy.

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.900
And he was just super interesting and kind of culturally,

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.380
an outsider, always kind of looking in.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.820
And he basically ran through what the Guardian looked at,

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.260
the Observer, the Daily Mail, the Sun,

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.340
kind of all of these, the Telegraph,

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.500
all of these newspapers and how you could tell

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.620
their different vantage points.

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:12.740
And of course, it's complicated to do that now.

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:17.420
I mean, in this incredibly extensive media space,

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.380
I look at what it is that they're saying.

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:21.580
And then I try to read around it

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580
and then look at what other people are saying

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.340
and why they're saying it and who are they,

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.900
what's their context.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.060
And that was kind of basically what I was taught to look at.

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.300
And I think everybody should have that.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:35.220
And certainly that's something that people in politics

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.300
that are in charge of directing policy should be doing.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.140
They should be.

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.140
Not getting lost in the sort of the hysteria

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.660
that can be created.

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.260
Like it does seem that the American system somehow,

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.220
not the political system, just humans, love drama.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:57.660
Very good, like the Hunter Biden laptop story.

01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:01.740
There's always like one, two, three stories somehow

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.740
that we just pick, that we're just gonna,

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:08.620
this is the stuff we're gonna fight about for this election.

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.780
And everyone's got an opinion on it, everybody.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.820
And it's the most important, like Hillary Clinton's emails,

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.100
Russians hacked the election.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.460
Yeah, we had John Podesta's pasta recipes for a while

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.180
that we were kind of all obsessing over.

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:23.020
I don't know, people running out and trying them out,

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.860
something like that.

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.540
And there's fun, I mean, there's all the best.

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.260
There's conspiracy theories about Giuliani.

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.100
I just love it.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.220
We just pick a random story.

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.580
Sometimes it's ridiculous.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.860
And it detracts from what the larger question should be,

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:39.300
which is about the family members of senior officials

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:41.780
and whether they should be anywhere near any of the issues

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.780
that they're, there's ethics,

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:45.740
there's government ethics and things there,

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.580
kind of across the board.

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.860
But there's a bigger story in there,

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.420
but that becomes a distraction.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.300
It's a look over there,

01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.540
the oldest trick in the book kind of idea.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.700
Yes.

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:56.860
And politicians are really good at that

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.700
because it detracts from the larger question

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.780
because every single member of Congress

01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.780
and government officials,

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.980
their family should be nowhere near anything they're doing.

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:09.060
Well, that I could push back and disagree on.

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:09.900
I mean, I just-

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:10.740
Well, it depends on what they do

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.460
if they're making money out of it.

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.900
And kind of basically being in business is what I mean.

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.740
Kind of this is an issue.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:19.980
So it's not Hunter Biden on his own.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.020
It's kind of basically the kids of the Trump family,

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.180
you name it.

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.020
Yeah, in general like that,

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.580
I just think it's funny.

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.980
Like there's a lot of families that,

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.420
they work very closely together,

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.700
they do business together and it's very successful.

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.860
I get very weird about that.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.820
It just feels like you're not,

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.780
in fact, I don't even like hiring

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:47.260
or working with friends initially.

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:49.140
You make friends with the people you work with.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:49.980
That's right.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.740
No, I have the same worries as well

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.220
because it kind of clouds,

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.260
I would encourage my daughter

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.500
to do something completely different,

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.700
not go into the same field.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.460
No, look, it's different if you're in science

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:03.660
or mathematics or something like this,

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.540
and maybe you've got a family member,

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.300
you're kind of building on some of their theories and ideas.

01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.260
If Albert Einstein had an offspring who was in mathematics

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:14.980
and took his father's thinking further,

01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.500
that would be very different.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.780
But if you're in business and other things

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.780
and it's just, it's the nepotism problem

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:22.620
that no one has there.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.780
Well, Einstein says that too.

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:24.620
In the space of ideas.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.460
Well, they do, if they're not,

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.220
people aren't coming in and building on the ideas

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.380
in a constructive way.

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:31.420
Right, but even for son, daughter of Einstein,

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.860
you want to think outside the box of the previous.

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:35.940
Yeah, well, that's what I'm meaning,

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:36.780
but I mean, it's just,

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:37.620
but they shouldn't be sort of told,

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.420
no, sorry, you can't go and study math

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.180
because, you know, whatever, physics, you know, because of.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.220
But a lot of that, you can't actually make it into law.

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.300
Well, you could, I suppose,

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.060
but honestly, if you do that kind of thing,

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.260
you should just be transparent.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.100
There should be just an honesty about it.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.820
It gets back to what I was talking about

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.140
before we need diversity of views and diversity of thinking,

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.180
and you can't have other things.

01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.980
It's like being partisan or, you know,

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.180
rooting just for a team.

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.780
You know, if something is going to cloud your judgment

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.140
or constrain the way you think about things

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:09.180
and become, you know, kind of a barrier to moving on out.

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.060
I mean, look, that's what we see in the system around Putin.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.980
It's kind of kleptocratic and it's, you know,

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:16.460
it's filled with nepotism.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.060
All of the kind of like the people

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.540
who you kind of see out there

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.020
in prominent positions that the sons or daughters of,

01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.580
including Putin himself.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.140
I mean, that's when a system has degenerated

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.540
and that's, you know, kind of, and I suppose in a way,

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.500
this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.380
But again, it's just a diversion from, you know,

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.820
kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.420
of things that we're discussing.

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:42.860
So critics on the left often use the straw man of TDS,

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.300
Trump Derangement Syndrome.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.900
Why does Donald Trump arouse so much emotion in people?

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.580
It's just the nature of the person.

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.340
I mean, I don't feel particularly emotional about him.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:58.380
I mean, he's kind of a, he's a very flawed guy,

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.620
to be honest, and this may seem bizarre,

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.220
I felt sorry for him because this guy is so vulnerable,

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.220
so wrapped up in himself that, I mean,

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.620
he's just exquisitely open to me.

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:15.220
Exquisitely open to manipulation.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.740
And I saw people taking advantage of him all the time

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:20.220
and he has zero self-awareness.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.620
I mean, I kept thinking to myself, my God,

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.780
if this guy didn't have this entourage around him,

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.820
how would he function?

01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.220
I mean, I felt sorry for us as well.

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.580
I mean, that he ended up being our president

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:29.900
because that should not have happened.

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.500
I mean, in terms of character

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.220
and in terms of fit for the job.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.580
Although I saw this, you know, kind of over a period of time,

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.580
but I didn't feel, you know, kind of any, you know,

01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.260
sense of derangement, you know, kind of around him.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.860
It didn't drive me nuts in that way.

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.100
I just became, I was just very worried about, you know,

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.260
the kind of the impact that he was having

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.340
on many particular issues.

01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.780
Here's the important thing.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.580
So what I notice with people that criticize Donald Trump

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:05.260
is they get caught up in the momentum of it

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.860
and they're unable to see,

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:11.700
first of all, let's start with some ground truth,

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.740
which is approximately half the country

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.140
voted for the guy, right?

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:23.620
Yeah, and more voted in 2020 than voted in 2016 for him.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.460
Yeah.

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:28.140
And I just feel like people don't load that in

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:28.980
when they're honestly criticizing.

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:32.940
And a lot of those people didn't vote for him

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.780
and his personality and often could,

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.300
because I know a lot of people who voted for him

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.260
first time and second time.

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.900
And they could disassociate, you know,

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.900
kind of all of the kind of features of Donald Trump

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.020
that drives other people nuts from, you know,

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.540
what they thought that an actual fact he could achieve

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.300
in terms of, and it wasn't just this kind of sense about,

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.260
well, I couldn't possibly vote for Democrats.

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:58.100
Sometimes it's just like, well, look, he shakes things up

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.700
and we need things to be shaken up.

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.860
Some people might have voted for him for personality.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:03.700
See, this is what I'm trying to tell you.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.180
Yeah, some of them did as well,

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:06.900
but I'm just saying that not all of them did either.

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.540
Well, we don't know that data, that's the thing.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:11.180
Yeah, I can't say how much, I'm just saying anecdotally,

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.260
I know people have voted for him because he's him

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.180
from the charisma and others who voted

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.980
because he's shaking things up

01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:20.900
and, you know, he's keeping people on their toes

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:24.500
and, you know, kind of we need that idea.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.660
But the way to avoid Trump derangement syndrome to me,

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:32.220
me as a doctor, I'm sort of prescribing to the patients

01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:36.020
on this syndrome, this issue,

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.860
is I feel like you have to empathize with the people.

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.660
You have to imagine in your mind all the different

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:47.340
like strengths that the people who have voted

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:51.660
for Donald Trump see and really understand it,

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.500
really feel it, like walk around with it,

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.620
and then criticize.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.900
Like, I just feel like people get lost

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.900
in this bubble of criticism in their own head.

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.180
Forget like the tribe you're in or whatever.

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.500
In their own head, they're not able to see

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.380
like half this country that we're a part of

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:09.740
voted for the person.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.580
Same with Biden.

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.900
Half the country voted for the guy.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.620
The people that are criticizing Biden

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.900
and they're doing this,

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:20.500
the way Biden is currently criticized

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.940
is not based on policy.

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.940
It's based on personal stuff similar like to Trump.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:28.780
Yeah, I know it is.

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:29.620
I mean, that's what people do.

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:31.180
Look, I think part of that is,

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.660
I mean, look, first of all, I want to say

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:34.940
I completely agree with you about

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.340
understanding where people are coming from.

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.700
And I think it's very important for people to listen

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.860
to other people and their views.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.660
I try to do that all the time, try to learn from that.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.820
I mean, everybody's got a perspective and a context.

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.260
We all live in a certain context.

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.780
We're all living in history, our own personal histories

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.900
matter a lot and also the larger context

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:53.780
and environment in which we're living in

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.540
and where we live and who we live with.

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.540
And the kinds of lives that we lead as well,

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.220
those are all extraordinarily important.

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.980
I mean, I know that from myself,

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.780
everything that I've done in my life

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:05.540
has been shaped by where I came from,

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.020
who I was, my family and the way that we looked at things.

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.900
You can't take yourself out of that.

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.540
I mean, you can do it in some,

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.780
like a science or something else,

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.260
but it's still your own views

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.980
and maybe some of the ideas that you have

01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.700
in pursuing an experiment might have been shaped

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.620
by your larger context,

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.380
depending on what it is that you work on.

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.700
But the other thing is the nature of the political system.

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.100
The presidential election is like

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:30.420
a personality contest, a beauty contest.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.380
It's like a kind of a referendum on one person or another.

01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.940
It's kind of like what we see in Russia, honestly,

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:39.860
with Putin or not Putin or Putin and Putin before.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.180
It's all about Putin and what do you think about Putin?

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.020
It's all about what the president should be doing

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.060
and kind of what their policies are.

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.020
That's kind of the bizarreness

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.300
of the US political system.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.660
Look, we've just seen this happening in the United Kingdom.

01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.900
You've got this core of a couple of thousand,

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.460
a couple of hundred thousand, rather,

01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:58.620
people in the conservative party

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.020
who've just voted for three leaders in a row,

01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.860
the rest of the country is.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:05.260
And then they're just looking at whether they like

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.260
that personality and what they say to them

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.740
rather than what they're necessarily gonna do

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.140
for the country.

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.100
I mean, which is kind of pretty absurd.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.420
And again, the presidency is a weird hybrid

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:17.460
in the United States.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.100
We were talking before about the person

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:20.260
who should be running the country,

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.420
so the chief executive or the prime minister

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.300
in another setting.

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.300
But we don't think of it like that.

01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.100
We often think about whether we like the guy or not,

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.540
or we'd like to hang out with him.

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:31.180
Or one of my younger relatives,

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.620
and I said, so why did you vote for Trump?

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.900
He said, well, he was great, he was funny.

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.020
I went to his rallies.

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.980
I got all kind of charged up.

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.980
And I said, could you see yourself voting for Biden?

01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.820
No, he's too old.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.940
And I simply know he's only just a little bit

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.260
kind of older than Trump.

01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:46.260
Or he's the same age as your grandma.

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.100
Do you think your grandma's old?

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.060
Oh no, not at all.

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:50.420
But it's just this kind of perception he's boring.

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.380
So people are actually sometimes basically being

01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.380
kind of motivated by just a feeling,

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.460
kind of that kind of sense,

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:01.260
because that's the sort of nature of the presidency.

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:03.740
It's this kind of how you feel about yourself

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:06.100
as an American or how you feel about the country at large,

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:08.260
the kind of the symbol of the state.

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.420
In Britain, you had Queen Elizabeth II,

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.300
and everybody seemed to, for the most part,

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.260
not everyone, I guess, but most people respected her

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.660
as a person, as a personality,

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.820
as a kind of symbol of the state.

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.500
Even if they actually didn't really like

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.060
the institution of the monarchy,

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.500
there was something kind of about

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.780
that particular personality

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:29.100
that you were able to kind of relate to in that context.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.820
But in the United States, we've got all of that

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.260
rolled into one, the head of state,

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.300
the symbol of the state, the kind of queen, the king,

01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.540
the kind of idea, the chief executive,

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.060
the kind of prime ministerial role,

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:40.180
and then the commander in chief of the military.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.540
It's all things kind of at once.

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.900
But ultimately, for a lot of people,

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.740
it's just how you feel about that person.

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:47.420
Oh, I couldn't go vote for them because of this,

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:49.420
or I couldn't vote for them because of that.

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.780
And in 2016, you know,

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.620
Hillary Clinton actually did win the election

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.260
in terms of the popular vote.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.260
So it wasn't that, you know,

01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.980
kind of people wouldn't vote for a woman.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:01.780
I mean, more people voted for her on the popular level,

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.060
not, obviously, you know, through the electoral college

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.140
and the electoral college vote.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.100
So it wasn't just, you know, gender or something like that,

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.460
but it was an awful lot of things

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.900
that people found Trump attractive

01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.940
because he was sticking up the big middle finger

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.220
to the establishment.

01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:17.540
He's an anti-establishment change character.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.540
There was a lot of people voted for Barack Obama

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.260
for the same reason and voted for Trump.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:22.100
We know that phenomenon.

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:25.140
What was it, 11, you know, 12% of people, you know,

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.980
so they could vote for some completely, totally different,

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.420
radically different people

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:32.260
because of that sort of sense of change and charisma.

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.100
I mean, I had people who I knew voted for Trump

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.020
but would have voted for Obama again if he'd run again

01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.620
because they just liked the way that he spoke.

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:42.540
They liked the way that, you know, because they said,

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.340
I mean, this is all my own anecdotal things

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.180
doing about it.

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.020
One of my relatives said,

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.780
I could listen to Obama all day, every day.

01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:49.420
I just loved the way he sounded.

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.340
I loved the way he looked.

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:52.220
I just liked the whole thing about him

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.260
and then say about Trump, well, he was exciting.

01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.100
He was interesting.

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.140
You know, he was kind of like, you know,

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:57.380
whipping it up there.

01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.900
You know, so there's just this kind of feeling.

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.060
You know, we always say about, you know,

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.140
could you have a beer with this person?

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.140
And people decide they couldn't have one

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.540
with Hillary Clinton.

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.260
And, you know, maybe they could go off

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.260
and have one with Barack Obama and with Donald Trump.

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:15.420
But they didn't want to have one with Joe Biden,

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:16.660
you know, for example.

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.300
And remember, George W. Bush didn't drink,

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.580
so he wouldn't have had a beer with him.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.060
He'd have gone out and got a soda or something with him.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.580
But, you know, there's this,

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.220
there's that kind of element

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:27.820
of just that sort of personal connection

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.300
in the way that the whole presidential election is set up.

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.740
It's less about the parties.

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.900
It's less about the platforms,

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:36.460
and it's more about the person.

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:39.980
Yeah, and picking one side

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.500
and like sticking with your person.

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.300
It really like a sport team.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.820
Yeah, it is, yeah.

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:47.580
What do you think about Vladimir Putin,

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.020
the man and the leader?

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.580
Let's actually look at the full,

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.340
you've written a lot about him,

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:58.340
the recent Vladimir Putin and the full context of his life.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:05.500
Let's zoom out and look at the last 20 plus years of his rule.

01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.300
In what ways has he been good for Russia?

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.660
In what ways bad?

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:15.100
Well, if you look to the first couple of terms

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.300
of his presidency,

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:20.740
I think, you know, on the overall ledger,

01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:21.580
he would have actually said

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:24.260
that he'd made a lot of achievements from Russia.

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:25.460
Now, there was, of course,

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.980
the pretty black period of the war in Chechnya,

01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.460
but, you know, he didn't start that.

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:32.300
That was Boris Yeltsin.

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.700
That was obviously a pretty catastrophic event.

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.260
But if you look at then other parts

01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.860
of the ledger of what Putin was doing,

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.740
you know, from the 2000s, you know, onwards,

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.340
he stabilized the Russian economy

01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:52.380
by confidence in the Russian economy and financial system.

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:56.740
He built up a pretty impressive team of technocrats

01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:58.700
for everything from the central bank and the economics

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.140
and, you know, finance ministries,

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.340
who, you know, really got the country

01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.500
back into shape again and solvent,

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.340
paid off all of the debts,

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.740
and, you know, really started to

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:12.580
build the country back up again domestically.

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.940
And, you know, the first couple of terms,

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.540
again, putting Chechnya, you know, to one side,

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.380
which was a little hard,

01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.540
because, I mean, there was quite a lot of atrocities,

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.500
and I have to say that, you know,

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.780
he was pretty involved in all of that,

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.740
because the FSB, which he'd headed previously,

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.780
you know, was in charge of wrapping up Chechnya,

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.700
and it created, you know, kind of a very strange

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.500
sort of system of fealty, almost a feudal system,

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.660
in the kind of relationship between

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.540
Putin at the top and Kadirov in Chechnya,

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.060
and there was quite a lot of distortions,

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.380
you know, kind of as a result of that,

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.620
in the way that the Russian Federation was run,

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:44.940
you know, a lot more of an emphasis

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.380
on the security services, for example,

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.900
but there was a lot of pragmatism,

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.100
you know, opening up the country for business,

01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:55.020
you know, basically extending relationships.

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.860
I would say that, you know,

01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.660
by the end of those first couple of terms of Putin,

01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.500
Russians were living their best lives.

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.380
You know, there was a lot of opportunity for people.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.220
People's labor, you know, was being paid for,

01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.380
they weren't being taxed,

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:13.220
the taxes were coming out of the extractive industries.

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:16.060
There was, you know, kind of a, I guess,

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.540
a sense of much more political pluralism,

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:21.220
it wasn't the kind of the chaos of the Eltsin period,

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.140
and then you see a shift.

01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:26.540
And it's pretty much when he comes back into power again,

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:30.420
in 2011, 2012, and that's when we see

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:32.180
kind of a different phase emerging.

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.780
And, you know, part of it is the larger

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.220
international environment, where Putin himself

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.620
has become kind of convinced

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.020
that the United States is out to get him.

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:44.980
And part of it goes back to the decision

01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.820
on the part of the United States

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.780
to invade Iraq in 2003.

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.820
There's also, you know, the recognition of Kosovo in 2008,

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:54.580
and, you know, the whole kind of machinations

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.460
around all kinds of, you know, other issues

01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:58.100
of NATO expansion and elsewhere.

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.100
But Iraq in 2003, and this kind of whole idea after that,

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.660
that the United States is in the business of regime change,

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.940
and perhaps, you know, has him in his crosshairs as well.

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.620
But there's also then kind of, I think,

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.900
a sense of building crisis

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.180
after the financial crisis and the Great Recession,

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:19.180
2008, 2009, because I think Putin,

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.700
up until then, believed in, you know,

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.540
the whole idea of the global financial system

01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:26.220
and that Russia was prospering,

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.220
and that Russia, you know, part of the G8

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:29.340
and actually could be genuinely

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:33.500
one of the major economic and financial powers.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.540
And then suddenly he realizes

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.060
that the West is incompetent,

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.260
that, you know, we totally mismanaged the economy

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.780
of our own, the financial crash in the United States,

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:46.940
the kind of blowing up of the housing bubble,

01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.900
and that we were feckless,

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.020
and that had global reverberations.

01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.420
And he's prime minister, of course,

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.300
you know, in this kind of period.

01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.420
But then, you know, and I think that that kind of compels him

01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.020
to kind of come back into the presidency

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.780
and try to kind of take things under control again

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.300
in 2007, 2012, and after that,

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.980
he goes into kind of a much more sort of focused role

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.620
where he sees the United States as a bigger problem.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.580
And he also, you know, starts to, you know,

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.140
kind of focus on also the domestic environment

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.540
because his return to the presidency is met by protests.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.140
And he genuinely seems to believe,

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.420
because again, this is very similar

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:26.260
to belief here in the United States

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.300
that Donald Trump couldn't possibly be elected by Americans.

01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:31.380
There somehow was some kind of external interference

01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.700
because the Russians interfered and had an impact.

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.740
Putin himself thinks at that time,

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.060
it's one of the reasons why he interferes

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.180
in our elections later,

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:40.660
that the United States and others had interfered

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.260
because he knew that people weren't that thrilled

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.460
about him coming back.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.060
They kind of liked the Medvedev period.

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:49.100
And the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg

01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.540
and other major cities,

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.540
he starts to believe are instigated by the West,

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.660
by the outside because of, you know,

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:57.780
funding for transparency in elections

01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:01.220
and, you know, all of the NGOs and others, you know,

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.180
they're operating, state department, embassy funding,

01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:07.500
you know, the whole attitude of God is back,

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.980
you know, kind of thing.

01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:09.820
And so after that,

01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:12.660
we see Putin going on a very different footing.

01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:16.820
It's also somewhere in that period, 2011, 2012,

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.620
we start to kind of obsess about Ukraine.

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:20.460
And he's always, you know,

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.780
I think being kind of steeped

01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.060
in that whole view of Russian history.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.100
I mean, I heard at that time, I was in,

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.060
I've written about this and many of the things that,

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:28.580
you know, I've written about Putin,

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.060
but in that same timeframe,

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.620
I'm going to all these conferences in Russia

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:35.460
where Putin is and Peskov, his press secretary,

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.740
and they talk about him reading Russian history.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.940
I think it's in this kind of period

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.940
that he formulates this idea of the necessity

01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:48.620
of reconstituting the Russian world, the Russian empire.

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:50.180
He's obviously been very interested in this.

01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.460
He's always said, of course,

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:52.740
that the collapse of the Soviet Union

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.140
was the great catastrophe of the 20th century,

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.940
but also the collapse of the Russian empire before it.

01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.420
And he starts to be critical about Lenin and the Bolsheviks

01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:03.180
and he starts to do all this talking about Ukraine

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.900
as the same country,

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.980
Ukrainians and Russians being one in the same.

01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:09.300
And this is where the ledger flips,

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.660
because I mean, the initial question you asked me

01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:14.420
is about, well, has Putin been good for Russia or not?

01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:18.020
And this is where we get into the focal point of,

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.140
or the point where he's not focusing on the prosperity

01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:23.860
and stability and future of Russia,

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.820
but he starts to obsess about the past

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:30.340
and start to take things in a very different direction.

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.060
He starts to clamp it down at home

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.020
because of the rise of opposition

01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.580
and the fact that he knows that his brand

01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.300
is not the same as it was before

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:42.620
and his popularity is not the same as it was before

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.620
because he's already gone over that period

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:49.540
in anybody's professional and political life

01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.820
that if you stay around long enough,

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.660
people get a bit sick of you.

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:53.900
We talked about that before.

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:56.700
How should you stay in any job for a long period of time?

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.820
You need refreshing.

01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:00.540
And Putin is starting to look like

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.500
he's gonna be there forever

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.540
and people are not happy about that

01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.660
and would like the chance as well to move on and move up

01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.180
and with him in some place,

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:11.100
that's not going to be particularly possible.

01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.740
And that's around the time when he starts

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:14.660
to make the decision of annexing Crimea.

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:18.140
And that's when the whole thing flips, in my view.

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.940
The annexation of Crimea in 2014

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.820
is the beginning of the end

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:27.860
of Vladimir Putin being a positive force within Russia.

01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.740
Because if you pay very close attention

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:36.740
to his speech on the annexation of Crimea in March of 2014,

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:41.700
you see all of the foreshadowing of where we are now.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.460
It's already of his view of his obsessions,

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:45.820
his historical obsessions.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:48.380
His view of himself has been fused with the state

01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:50.460
of a modern czar and his idea

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:51.740
that the West is out to get him.

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.100
And it becomes after that,

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.940
almost a kind of like a messianic mission,

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.380
to turn things in a different direction.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:03.140
And who are the key people to you

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:08.140
in this evolution of the human being, of the leader?

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:10.220
Is it Petrushev?

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:12.140
Is it Shoigu, the Minister of Defense?

01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:15.380
Is it, like you mentioned, Peskov, the press secretary?

01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:19.260
What role does some of the others like Lavrov play?

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.100
I think it's more rooted in the larger context.

01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:22.900
I mean, individuals matter in that context,

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:25.460
but it's just kind of like this shared worldview.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:27.220
And if you go back to the early 1990s,

01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:29.380
immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,

01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:33.780
when Yeltsin and his counterparts

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.260
from Ukraine and Belarus pull it apart,

01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.500
there was an awful lot of people

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:40.620
who wanted to maintain the Soviet Union, not just Putin.

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.980
I mean, you remember after Gorbachev

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:47.500
tried to have the new union treaty in 1991,

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.580
there was the emergency committee set up,

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.220
the coup against Gorbachev.

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.060
It was because they were worrying he was going too far

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:55.780
and unraveling the union then as well.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.220
They were opposed to his reforms.

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.620
There's always been a kind of a very strong

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.020
nationalist contingent that become Russian nationalists

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:06.900
over time rather than Soviet hardliners

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.860
who basically want to maintain the empire,

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.660
the union in some form.

01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.900
And in the very early part of the 1990s,

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.740
there was a lot of pressure put on Ukraine

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.980
and all the other former Soviet republics,

01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.020
now independent states, by people around,

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.220
Mayor Lushkov, for example, in Moscow,

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.900
by other forces in the Russian Duma,

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.820
not just Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others,

01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:32.460
but really serious, kind of what we would call him,

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:35.140
like right-wing nationalist forces.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.380
But it's pervasive in the system.

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.020
And it's especially pervasive in the KGB

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.900
and in the security sector.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:45.340
And that's where Putin comes out of.

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.620
Remember, Putin also was of the opinion

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.780
that one of the biggest mistakes the Bolsheviks made

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:53.300
was getting rid of the Orthodox Church

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.460
as an instrument of the state.

01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.900
And so there's this kind of restorationist wing

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:01.420
within the security services and the state apparatus

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.940
that want to kind of bring back Russian orthodoxy

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:07.060
as a state instrument, an instrument of state power.

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.980
And they were kind of looking all the time

01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.340
about strengthening the state, the executive,

01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:14.780
the presidency.

01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.780
And so it's everybody who takes part in that.

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:19.860
And it's also others who want power, honestly.

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.620
And they see Putin as their vehicle for power.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.180
I think for people like Sergey Kirienko,

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:26.460
I knew Kirienko back in the 90s.

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:28.140
I mean, my God, that guy's all in.

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.380
Or like Dmitry Medvedev,

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:33.540
who was a warmer, fuzzier version of Putin,

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.940
certainly had a totally different perspective,

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.060
wasn't it, in the KGB?

01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:37.660
Did you say warmer, fuzzier version?

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.660
A warmer, fuzzier version, yeah.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.620
I mean, he's kind of like,

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.660
he was literally a warm personality.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.620
I don't know if you watched him

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.340
during the September 30th annexation.

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:46.380
The guy had all kinds of facial twitches

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.940
and looked so rigid and stiff

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.540
that he looks like he might implode.

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:53.580
I mean, that wasn't how he was earlier in his career.

01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:56.140
And he had a different view of Perestroika.

01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:58.620
We always have to remember that Putin was not in Russia

01:51:58.620 --> 01:51:59.460
during Perestroika.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.460
He was in Dresden,

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.340
watching the East German state fall apart

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.900
and dealing with the Stasi

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.420
and in a kind of place where

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.780
you weren't getting a lot of information

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.260
about what was happening in West Germany

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:13.100
or even what was happening back home in Perestroika.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.420
And he has that kind of group of people around him,

01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.260
the Patrushevs and Votnikovs and others

01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.740
and Sergei Ivanov and others

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:25.460
from the different configurations of his administration

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.940
who have come out of that same kind of mindset

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.180
and are kind of wanting to put everything

01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.100
back together again.

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.340
So there's a lot of enablers,

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.260
there's a lot of power seekers

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.100
and there are a lot of people

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.700
who think the same as him as well.

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.660
He is a man of his times, a man of his context.

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:45.580
You as a top advisor yourself

01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.340
and a scholar of Putin,

01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:51.620
do you think actually now in his inner circle

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.060
are there people he trusts?

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:55.340
There are people he trusts for some things

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.020
but I don't think there's people he trusts for everything.

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:57.860
I don't think he's the kind of person

01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:00.300
who tells anyone everything at all.

01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:02.540
I don't think he's got something deeply confided.

01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:06.260
No, I think he compartmentalizes things.

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.940
He's often said that the only person he trusts is himself

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.940
and I think that's probably true.

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:12.140
He's the kind of person who keeps his own counsel.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:14.900
I mean, people talk about Kovalchuk, for example,

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.380
or kind of some of the other people

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:18.580
who are friends with him

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:21.980
that kind of go back to his time in St. Petersburg.

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.380
Various points he seemed to spend a lot of time

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:28.100
way back when talking to people who were,

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.140
people think of kind of more moderating forces

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.260
like Alexei Kudrin,

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:35.100
but it doesn't seem to be interacting with them.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.260
There are obviously aspects of his personal life.

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.300
Does he speak to his daughters?

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:45.140
Does he speak to kind of lovers,

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:46.820
kind of in a way people speculate

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.380
about kind of who might he confide in,

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:50.300
but I would greatly doubt

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.340
that he would have deep political discussions with them.

01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:57.420
He's a very guarded, very careful person.

01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.580
What about sources of information then?

01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:03.860
So trust, a deep understanding about military strategies

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.580
for certain conflicts,

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:08.700
like the war in Ukraine,

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:13.460
or even special subsets of the war in Ukraine,

01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:15.980
or any kind of military operations,

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:17.420
getting clear information.

01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.700
I think he's deeply suspicious of people and of information.

01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.580
And I think part of the problems

01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:28.820
that we see with Putin now,

01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:33.340
I mean, I've come from isolation during COVID.

01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.500
I'm really convinced that, like many of us,

01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.740
a lot of Putin's views have hardened,

01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:41.900
and the way that he looks at the world

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:45.340
have been shadowed in very dark ways

01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.020
by the experience of this pandemic.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:50.300
Obviously he was in a bubble,

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:51.860
different kind of bubble from most of us.

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:53.260
I mean, most of us are not in bubbles

01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:57.580
with multiple kind of palaces and kind of the Kremlin,

01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.300
but we've seen so much,

01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.260
it's obviously a lot of this stage, that isolation,

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.180
they're kind of making it very clear that he's the Tsar,

01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.620
the guy who was in charge making all the decisions,

01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:09.460
one end of the table and everybody else's at the other end.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:13.340
But it's very difficult then to bring information to him

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.180
in that way.

01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.980
He used to have a lot of information bundled for him

01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.100
in the old days by the presidential administration.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.980
I mean, I know that because it was a lot more open

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:21.820
in the past.

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.020
And I have a lot of meetings

01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.180
with people in the presidential administration

01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:29.020
who brought outside all sorts of information for him

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:32.860
and kind of funneled in information from different think tanks

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:35.380
and different viewpoints

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:39.780
and maybe a kind of more eclectic diversified set

01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.660
of information he would meet with people.

01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:42.740
You've heard all the stories

01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:46.020
about where he had once called up Masha Gessen

01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:47.500
and had to come in,

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:50.460
obviously a very different character

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.900
as a journalist and a critic.

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.780
We've heard about Benedicta from Echo Muscovy,

01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:58.580
the radio program, the editor,

01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:02.260
who Putin would talk to and consult with.

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.620
He'd reach out.

01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:07.100
People like Ludmila Alexeeva, for example,

01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.220
the head of Memorial, he had some respect for her

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:11.980
and would sometimes just talk to her.

01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.100
For example, all of that seems to have come to a halt.

01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:18.220
And I think a lot of us worry,

01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.140
I mean, us who watch Putin

01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.700
about what kind of information is he getting?

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:24.460
Is it just the information that he's seeking

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:25.540
and gathering himself

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.660
that fits into his worldview and his framework?

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:30.140
We're all guilty of that, of looking for things.

01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:32.700
I think it's about social media preferences.

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.980
People just bring into him things

01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.300
that they think he wants to hear,

01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:37.700
like the algorithm, kind of like the Kremlin

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:38.540
working in that regard,

01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:42.220
or is he himself tapping into sources of information

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.780
that he absolutely wants?

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:46.980
And remember, he is not a military guy.

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:48.740
He's an operative and he was sort of trained

01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:51.340
in operations and contingency planning.

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:54.940
Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister as a civil engineer

01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:56.940
was the former minister of emergencies.

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.700
He wasn't a military planner.

01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:03.700
Somebody like Gerasimov, the head of the chiefs of staff,

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:08.220
maybe a military guy in this case from the army,

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:10.380
but he's also somebody who's in a different part,

01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:11.220
the chain of command.

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:14.260
He's not somebody who would spontaneously start

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.460
telling Putin things.

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.780
And Putin comes out of the FSB,

01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:21.380
out of the KGB of the Soviet era,

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.100
and he knows the way that intelligence

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:24.100
gets filtered and works.

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.500
He's probably somebody who wants to consume

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.460
raw intelligence.

01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.620
He doesn't probably want to hear anybody else

01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:31.380
about intelligence analysis.

01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:35.580
And he thrived in the past of picking things up from people.

01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:37.420
I've taken part in all of these meetings with him,

01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:39.460
gone for hours, because he's just collecting.

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:41.980
He's collecting information, he's sussing people out.

01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:43.820
He wants to know the questions they ask.

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:46.100
He learned something about the questions that people ask,

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:47.700
the way that they ask them.

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.340
So he's kind of soliciting information himself.

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.900
And if he's cut off from that information,

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:57.420
because of circumstances, then how is he formulating things

01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:58.260
in his head?

01:57:58.940 --> 01:57:59.780
You can't get into his head,

01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:02.300
but you can understand the context in which he's operating.

01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.260
And that's where you worry,

01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:06.780
because he clearly made this decision to invade Ukraine

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.540
behind the back of most of his security establishment.

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:12.460
You think so?

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.260
Oh, I think it's pretty apparent.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:18.660
What would the security establishment,

01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.500
what would be the-

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.420
Well, that would be the larger,

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:21.940
thinking the funneling in information

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.020
from the presidential administration,

01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.660
from the National Security Council.

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.060
It looks like he made that decision

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:28.380
with a handful of people.

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:31.180
And then having worked in these kinds of environments,

01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:32.580
and it's not that dissimilar,

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.580
you filter information up.

01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.340
So think about, you and I are talking for hours here.

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:43.580
If you were my basically senior official,

01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.420
and I'm your briefer,

01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.940
I might only get 20 minutes with you.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:50.420
And you might be just looking at your watch the whole time

01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:52.300
and thinking, hang on a second, I've got to go,

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.180
and I've got this meeting, and I've got that meeting.

01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:55.740
And yeah, your point.

01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.820
You're not going to wait there.

01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:58.900
So I give this long explanation.

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.140
I've got to get to the point.

01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:02.260
And then I've got to then choose for myself,

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:04.420
what's the information I'm going to impart to you?

01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:07.580
Out of the 20 things that I think are important,

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:08.820
okay, I've got 20 minutes.

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.540
Maybe I only suddenly get two minutes.

01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.900
Maybe you get called out,

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:15.260
and somebody kind of interrupts.

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.140
Something happens.

01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:18.260
I'm going to get one minute, two minutes.

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.340
I mean, I once remember,

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:22.140
I had to give a presentation when I was in government,

01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:26.180
to Henry Kissinger for the Defense Policy Board.

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:28.980
And we planned bloody weeks on this thing.

01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.340
PowerPoints were created,

01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:32.780
teams of people were brought together.

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:34.620
And people were practicing this.

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.780
We had all these different people there.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.260
And I said, look, Henry Kissinger's an academic

01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:40.340
and a former professor,

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:43.460
and I haven't watched him in action.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:46.860
He's going to like, five seconds in,

01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:49.780
if we're lucky, we get that far, ask us a question

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.740
and just throw off our entire presentation.

01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.020
What is it that we want to convey?

01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:54.580
And that's exactly what happened.

01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:56.460
And then people aren't really prepared

01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.420
what they wanted to convey.

01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:00.220
And they'd prepared a nice,

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:02.940
sort of fulsome PowerPoint-like approach.

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:04.580
We never even got there.

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:05.900
And so God knows what,

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.460
he took away from it at the end of it.

02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:09.340
And that's, think about Putin.

02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:11.380
He's going to be kind of impatient.

02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.300
He's, we see the televised things

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:15.060
where he kind of sits at a table,

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.900
a bit like people won't necessarily see us here.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.180
And he puts his hands on the table

02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.700
and he looks across at the person and he says,

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.100
so, tell me, what's the main things I need to know?

02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.780
And of course, the person's mind probably goes blank,

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.700
with the kind of the thought of like,

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:31.380
oh God, what's the main thing?

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:32.220
And they go and they start,

02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:33.940
well, Vladimir Vladimirovich,

02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.580
they start the kind of,

02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.420
they're revving up to get to the point

02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:39.780
and then he cuts them off.

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:41.100
So you think about that

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:41.940
and then you think about,

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:43.780
well, what information has he got?

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.580
And then how does he process it?

02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:47.100
And is he suspicious of it?

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:48.260
Does he not believe it?

02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:51.900
And what inside of his own history then,

02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.900
leads him to make one judgment over another?

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.860
He clearly thought the Ukrainians

02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:57.500
would fall apart in five seconds.

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:00.300
We don't know if he clearly thought that,

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:04.940
but that there was a high probability maybe.

02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:05.980
I mean, you can guess.

02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:07.380
I think he pretty much thought it

02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.860
because I think he thought that,

02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.020
kind of his answer wasn't very popular.

02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.140
There was an awful lot of pro-Russian sentiment

02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:15.780
in whatever way he thinks that is

02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.620
because people have Russian speakers

02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:20.300
and they're kind of, in polling,

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:22.820
they expressed affinity with Russia.

02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:25.100
I mean, certainly in Crimea,

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:28.020
that worked out because a majority of the population

02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:32.500
had higher sentiments or feelings of affinity with Russia.

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.340
And obviously, that kind of, they got traction there,

02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.300
but it's more complicated.

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:38.620
We talked about Donbass before

02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:40.220
about being a kind of melting pot.

02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:43.140
When they tried the same thing in Donbass,

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:45.500
Donetsk and Luhansk as they tried in Crimea in 2014,

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:46.580
didn't kind of pan out.

02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.460
In fact, a whole war broke out.

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.020
They tried to kind of in,

02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:55.060
many of the major cities that are now under attack,

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:58.940
including Odessa, to kind of ferment pro-Russian movements

02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:01.380
and they completely and utterly fell apart.

02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:03.420
So Putin was thinking,

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.180
I'm pretty sure based on polling

02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.860
and the FSB having infiltrated,

02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:10.180
an awful lot of the Ukrainian hierarchies

02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.660
we now seeing is quite apparent

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:14.140
with some of the dismissals in Ukraine,

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:19.100
he was pretty sure that kind of he would get traction

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.660
and that it would be like 1956 in Hungary

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.260
or 1968 in Czechoslovakia.

02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.540
Remember, he comes out of the Andropov levy,

02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:28.740
as it's called, a kind of cohort of people

02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:32.220
who come into the KGB under Yuri Andropov.

02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:34.740
And Yuri Andropov has presided over a lot of these

02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:38.180
anti-dissident kind of movements inside of Russia itself

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.300
and how you suppress opposition,

02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:44.980
but also over how you deal with kind of the uprisings

02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:47.740
in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.260
And there's all these lessons from this

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.860
that you can put everything back in the box.

02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.180
And yeah, there might be a bit of violence

02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:54.020
and a bit of fighting,

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:56.940
but ultimately you think you've got the political figures

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.820
and you decapitate the opposition.

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:02.020
So they thought Zelensky would run away,

02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:03.260
Yanukovych run away,

02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.780
but that was kind of a bit,

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:08.620
sort of a different set of circumstances.

02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.580
And they thought that all of the local governments

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:11.940
would kind of capitulate

02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:13.620
because they had enough Russians

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:15.260
and inverted commas in there.

02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.460
Again, mistaking language

02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.940
and kind of positive affinity towards Russia

02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:23.740
for identity or how people would react in the time

02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:26.580
and not understanding people's linkages

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.100
and kind of importance of place,

02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:31.220
the way that people feel about who they are

02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:34.220
in a certain set of circumstances of place.

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:38.420
But the invasion of Ukraine in 2022

02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:43.420
is unlike anything that he was ever involved with.

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:45.900
I don't think he thought it would be,

02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:48.260
because it's kind of, if he looks back into the past,

02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:52.340
you're right though, he wasn't involved in 68 or 56

02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.340
or what happened in the 1980s in Poland.

02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:58.060
But there's a very wide front and it's the capital.

02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.180
I mean, this isn't going-

02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:02.820
This isn't Chechnya or this isn't kind of Syria

02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.660
or for example, yeah.

02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:05.140
This is a major nation.

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:05.980
Exactly.

02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:08.060
Like it's large, the size.

02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:09.420
It was more like Afghanistan,

02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:11.500
but they didn't realize that because again,

02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:15.300
Ukrainians are us, there's this kind of inability

02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:17.820
to think that people might think differently

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.780
and might want something different.

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.980
And that 30 years of independence

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.380
actually has an impact on people and their psyches.

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:27.300
And if I look back to the 1990s,

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.900
I mean, I remember being in seminars

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.700
in Harvard at the time and we were doing a lot of research

02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:36.700
on what was happening in the former Soviet Union

02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:38.660
at the time, because it was the early 1990s,

02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:41.380
just after the whole place fell apart.

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:44.540
And there was already under yelts in this kind of idea

02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.380
of Russians abroad, Russians in the near abroad,

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:50.820
Russian speakers and the need to bring them back in.

02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:53.020
And I remember, we had seminars at the time

02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.900
where we talked about at some point,

02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.420
there'd be some people in Russia

02:04:56.420 --> 02:05:00.140
that would actually believe that those Russian speakers

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.500
needed to be brought back into Russia,

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.540
but that the people who spoke Russian might have moved on

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.460
because they certainly had other opportunities

02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:08.140
and other windows on the world.

02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:09.780
I mean, look what's happened in Scotland,

02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:13.580
for example, most people in Scotland speak English.

02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:17.380
The Scottish language is not the standard bearer

02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:18.580
of Scottish identity.

02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:20.740
There's just, it's almost a civic identity,

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.140
different identity than not just national identity,

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:24.780
just like you see in Ukraine.

02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.580
And there's lots of English people that have moved

02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:28.500
to Scotland and now think of themselves as Scottish

02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.460
or Brazilians or Italians and all kinds of people

02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:33.260
who've moved in there.

02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.100
I mean, it's a smaller population, obviously,

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:39.100
in the scale of Ukraine, but people feel differently

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.620
and there's been a devolution of power.

02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.860
And when Brexit happened,

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.700
Scotland didn't wanna go along with that at all.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.780
And they wanted to kind of still be having a window

02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:51.260
on Europe and that's kind of historic.

02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:54.100
And lots of people in Ukraine have looked west, not east.

02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:59.100
It depends on where you are, not just in Lviv

02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.060
or somewhere like that, but also in Kiev

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.780
and Kharkiv was kind of predominantly Russian speaking city.

02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:08.540
But Kharkiv was also the center of Ukrainian culture

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:11.100
and Ukrainian literature at different points.

02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.580
People have different views.

02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:13.620
I grew up in the north of England.

02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.100
We don't feel like the south of England.

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.140
There's been a massive divide between north

02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:20.780
and south in England for millennia, not just centuries.

02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:24.060
So people feel differently depending on where they live

02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:25.660
and kind of where they grew up.

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:28.860
And Putin just didn't see that, he didn't see that.

02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:30.020
Well, hold on a second.

02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:33.700
Let me sort of push back at the fact

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:36.140
that I don't think any of this is obvious.

02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:40.020
So first of all, Zelensky before the war was unpopular.

02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:40.860
Oh, he was, what was it?

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:44.660
38%, something like that, but best in the popularity.

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:46.580
Let me sort of make the case

02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:50.940
that the calculation here is very difficult.

02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:55.140
If you were to poll every citizen of Ukraine

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:58.340
and ask them, what do you think happens if Russia invades?

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:03.380
Just like actually each, put each individual Ukrainian

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:05.100
in a one-on-one meeting with Putin

02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.340
and say, what do you think happens?

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:10.300
I honestly think most of them will say,

02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:12.700
they'll agree with a prediction

02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:15.180
that the government will flee, it would collapse.

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:20.180
And the country won't unite around the cause

02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:21.860
because of the factions,

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:23.780
because of all the different parties involved

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:24.620
because of the unpopularity.

02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:27.780
You might have said the same thing about the Soviet Union

02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:31.140
when Hitler invaded in 1941.

02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:34.380
You see, the problem is Putin always reads history

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.380
from one perspective over another.

02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:41.380
I think most countries basically rise to their own defense.

02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:44.180
So this is actually one of the first times

02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:46.740
that Russia has been on the offensive

02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:48.220
rather than on the defensive.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.620
So there's kind of a bit of a flip there.

02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:55.060
I mean, obviously Afghanistan,

02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:56.500
but that was more complicated

02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:58.460
because it was also supposed to be an intervention, right?

02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:00.740
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be to annex Afghanistan.

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:03.740
It was to try to prop up,

02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.100
kind of a reinstall of a leader there.

02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:11.860
Syria, you were in there to help your guy Bashar al-Assad

02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:13.420
turn away the opposition.

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:15.220
Chechnya was a debacle.

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:18.780
The Chechens fought back big time.

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:23.780
And it was only by dint of horrible, violent persistence

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:28.620
and ruthlessness and nasty, dirty tricks

02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:31.580
that kind of Putin prevailed there.

02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:33.540
But then you wonder, did he prevail?

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:35.380
Because what happened?

02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:37.740
Chechnya sometimes describes the most independent part

02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:40.340
of the Russian Federation and Ramzan Kadyrov

02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:42.620
plays power games in Moscow.

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:45.420
Yeah, his predecessors, even his father

02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:47.660
and others wouldn't have done that.

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:51.220
Ahmed Kadyrov and before that Dudayev and Maskhadov.

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:53.020
I mean, they were willing to make a compromise,

02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.780
they wouldn't have had the same position

02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:58.820
that Kadyrov has had.

02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.740
So, I think that again, it's your perspective

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:04.220
and where you stand and which bit of history

02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:05.060
you start to read.

02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:07.860
And that's why I say that, I think Putin,

02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:09.060
it's again, it's the information,

02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.660
the way that he processes it.

02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:12.820
I think most Russians also can't believe

02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:14.780
that they've done something wrong in Ukraine.

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.660
I mean, maybe at this point, things are changing a bit.

02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:21.140
But that's why there was so much kind of support for this,

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.980
in a right way.

02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:25.020
Again, I said, but look what was happening in Donetsk.

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:28.300
Look what was the Ukrainians were doing to our guys.

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:32.620
Look what was happening to Russian speakers.

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:34.140
We were defenders.

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.340
We were not invaders.

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:40.060
I think, again, the special military operation idea,

02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.780
now I think it's flipping, obviously,

02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:44.380
in the way that with the war going on there.

02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.500
But Putin wasn't kind of looking at what would happen.

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:51.500
I mean, most of the kind of glory parts of Russian history

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:53.140
when you kind of go in,

02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:55.380
you chase Napoleon back to Paris,

02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.620
or you chase the Germans back to Berlin,

02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.740
you put the flag above the Reichstag,

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.500
that's a very different set of affairs.

02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.940
When you've been fighting a defensive one,

02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.820
you've been invaded from a war where you invade someone else.

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.660
And even the most fractured populations,

02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:14.340
like you had in the Soviet Union at the point,

02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:18.100
rally around and World War I fell apart.

02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.940
I mean, the czar didn't manage to rally everybody around.

02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:24.100
I mean, the whole thing fell apart.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:28.780
And World War II, Stalin had to revive nationalism,

02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:32.540
including in the republics in Central Asia and elsewhere

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:33.900
to revive nationalism.

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.540
And Ukraine suddenly found nationalism,

02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:38.580
you know, in a kind of sense of-

02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:39.900
That's really interesting,

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:41.580
because it's not obvious,

02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:46.100
especially what Ukrainians went through in the 1930s.

02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:48.140
It's not obvious that that,

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:50.260
I mean, my grandfather was Ukrainian

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:55.300
and he was proud to fight a Ukrainian Jew.

02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:00.260
He was proud to fight and willing to die for his country.

02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:01.700
It wasn't like-

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.380
His country then was the Soviet Union.

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:05.420
The Soviet Union, right, sorry, to clarify.

02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:08.060
But he might fight now for his country, Ukraine.

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.500
Yes, but I'm just like,

02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:12.860
lingering on the point you made,

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:17.860
it was not obvious that that united feeling would be there.

02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:20.060
No, and again, it wouldn't have been obvious

02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.420
if it wasn't for the Soviet Union.

02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:23.260
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.700
Sorry, I was referring to my grandfather

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:25.540
of the Soviet Union.

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:26.860
We're both saying the exact same thing.

02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:27.700
Yeah, we are.

02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:28.540
We're saying the same thing.

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:30.020
You're saying it's a really powerful thing,

02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:33.340
because you take history as it happened,

02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:35.340
you don't realize it could have happened differently.

02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.260
It's kind of, it's fascinating.

02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:38.780
It's that whole counterfactual, right?

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.620
Yeah.

02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.260
Because I mean, if you've kind of,

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:43.220
that's why we all need in the United States

02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:44.860
to really examine our own history.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:48.780
Because, you know, there's a lot of lessons from that,

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:51.300
that we should treat very cautiously.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.140
It doesn't mean that, you know,

02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.660
history repeats or even rhymes.

02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:56.300
You know, it's the old axiom all the time,

02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:58.260
but there are a lot of things

02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:00.020
that you can take away differently

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.340
from putting a different perspective

02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:05.380
and a different slant on the same set of events.

02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:06.500
I mean, I always used to wonder like,

02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:08.620
how many books can be written on the French Revolution

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.140
or even on the Russian Revolution?

02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:11.740
You know, I studied with Richard Peitz.

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:13.020
I remember he was really offended

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:14.660
after he'd written his great Microsopus

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.060
on the Russian Revolution, two volumes,

02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.380
that other people would, you know,

02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:18.660
kind of write about the Russian Revolution.

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.860
And I thought, well, actually, maybe you haven't.

02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:24.180
It's like, there might be some completely different angle

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:25.300
there that you haven't really thought of,

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.420
and that's Putin.

02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.300
You know, I remember Peskov saying,

02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:30.460
Putin reads history all the time, Russian history.

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.740
And I thought, well, maybe he should read some world history.

02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:34.460
You know, maybe he should, you know,

02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:38.140
kind of read some European authors on Russian history,

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:41.420
not just, you know, reading Lamanosa for, you know,

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.060
Russian historians on Russian history,

02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:45.140
because you might see something

02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:46.740
from a very different perspective.

02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:48.580
Look, and the United States made a massive mistake

02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:50.900
in Vietnam, right?

02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:53.100
I mean, they saw Vietnam as kind of weak,

02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:56.300
manipulated by, you know, kind of external forces,

02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.300
China, Soviet Union,

02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:01.380
but the Vietnamese fought for their own country.

02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:03.660
They suddenly became Vietnamese,

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:05.620
and Ho Chi Minh became, you know,

02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:09.300
kind of basically a kind of a wartime fighter and leader,

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.380
you know, in a way that, you know,

02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:13.180
perhaps people wouldn't have understood either.

02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.940
You said the United States made a massive mistake

02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:19.220
in Vietnam, and that for some reason

02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:21.620
sprung a thought in my head.

02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:24.820
Has the United States, since World War II,

02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:28.020
had anything that's not a mistake

02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:32.020
in terms of military operations abroad?

02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:37.100
I suppose all the ones that are successes,

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.020
we don't even know about probably.

02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:42.100
So it's like very fast military operations.

02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.300
I mean, Korea's divided.

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:44.620
I mean, I don't know if it's successful,

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:46.020
but, you know, kind of, I mean,

02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.020
there was a solution found that, you know,

02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.380
some people are promoting, you know,

02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:51.220
in this case as well of a sort of division

02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:55.100
and the DMZ and, you know, one side over the other

02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:56.860
and, you know, kind of perpetuating a division,

02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.140
which I think is particularly successful.

02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:01.500
But if you think about World War I and World War II,

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.980
the United States came in, you know,

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.420
under some very specific sets of circumstances.

02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:08.620
In World War I, they did kind of come in to help,

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:10.580
you know, kind of liberate, you know,

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.300
parts of Europe, France, and, you know,

02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:15.060
kind of the UK and, you know, everything else,

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.780
Great Britain in the war towards the end of it.

02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.460
World War II, you know, there was that whole debate

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.220
about whether the United States should even be part

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.380
of the war.

02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:25.580
I mean, we know it wasn't fought to, you know,

02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.700
overturn the Holocaust and all of the kind of things

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:29.660
you kind of wish it would been fought for,

02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:30.940
but it was because of Pearl Harbor

02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:32.900
and, you know, the Japanese pulling in.

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:37.220
But, you know, ultimately, it was easy to explain

02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.260
why you were there, you know,

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:40.540
particularly after Pearl Harbor and what had happened.

02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:42.420
It's harder to explain Vietnam and Korea

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.740
and, you know, many of them wasn't,

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.500
but that's kind of going to be a problem for Putin.

02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:47.420
That's why there is a problem for Putin.

02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:51.900
All of his explanations have been questioned,

02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:55.540
you know, sort of off on NATO or this or that or the other.

02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:57.780
And, you know, kind of all liberating, you know,

02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.340
Ukraine from Nazis or, you know,

02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.300
kind of basically stopping the persecution

02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.540
of Russian speakers.

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.980
And all of this has now got lost

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:08.860
in just this horrific destruction.

02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:11.500
And that's what happened in Vietnam as well.

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:15.540
It became, you know, a great degradation

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.620
of the Russian military with atrocities

02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.460
and people wondering why on earth

02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:21.060
the United States was in Vietnam.

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.940
I mean, even that kind of happened in Britain

02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:26.340
in the colonial, you know, kind of period as well.

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.060
Why was the United Kingdom doing, you know,

02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:30.380
committing atrocities and, you know,

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:33.180
kind of basically fighting these colonial wars?

02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:37.300
Northern Ireland, why was the United Kingdom still,

02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:41.180
you know, kind of militarily occupying Ireland?

02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.580
Cyprus, there's all kinds of, you know,

02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:43.940
instances where we look at this thing.

02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:45.540
So because of what Russia was doing now,

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:49.380
Putin is trying to occupy another country

02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:52.420
irrespective of, you know, kind of the historical linkages

02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:54.820
and, you know, the kind of the larger meta-narratives

02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.620
that he's trying to put forward there.

02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:02.180
What role did the United States play

02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:05.260
in the lead up and the actual invasion

02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:09.300
of Ukraine by Russia?

02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:12.780
A lot of people say that, I mean, obviously,

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:16.460
Vladimir Putin says that part of the reason

02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:19.980
the invasion had to happen is because of security concerns

02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:22.180
over the expansion of NATO.

02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:26.300
And there is a lot of people that say

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:29.340
that this was provoked by NATO.

02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:32.420
Do you think there's some legitimacy to that case?

02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:35.540
Look, I think the whole situation here is very complicated

02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:37.580
and you have to take a much longer view than, you know,

02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:39.620
what happened in, you know, 2008

02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:41.700
with the open door for Ukraine and Georgia,

02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:42.540
which actually, by the way,

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:45.140
I thought was a strategic blunder, just to be very clear,

02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:46.420
because it wasn't any kind of thinking through

02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:48.500
about what the implications of that would be

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:49.660
and, you know, what it actually would mean

02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:50.860
for Ukraine's security.

02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:53.060
And also bearing in mind what, you know,

02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:55.900
Putin had already said about NATO expansion,

02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:58.580
they came on the wake of the recognition

02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:01.180
by the United States pretty unilaterally of Kosovo.

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:03.460
And it also comes in the wake of what I mentioned before,

02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:04.820
the invasion of Iraq,

02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:08.740
which really because very important

02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:11.500
for understanding Putin's psyche.

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.340
So I think, you know, we have to go back, you know,

02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:16.340
much further than it's not just talking about kind of NATO

02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:18.180
and what that means.

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:21.580
NATO is part of the whole package of Ukraine

02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:23.780
going in a different direction from Russia,

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.220
just as so as the European Union.

02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:30.020
Remember the annexation of Crimea comes after Ukraine

02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:33.820
sought an association agreement with the European Union,

02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:35.780
not with NATO at that particular point,

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.620
even though, you know, the EU on the security,

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.140
common security defense policy

02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:44.660
basically has all kinds of connections with NATO,

02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:45.740
you know, various different levels

02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:47.780
in European security front, it was all about Europe

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:51.580
and going on a different economic and political

02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:53.220
and ultimately legal path,

02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:56.500
because if you have an association agreement,

02:17:56.500 --> 02:17:58.500
eventually you get into the Aki Komunitet

02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:00.340
and it just transforms the country completely

02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:03.420
and Ukraine is no longer the Ukraine of the Soviet period

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:04.780
or the Russian Empire period.

02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.060
It becomes, you know, on a different trajectory

02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:12.060
like Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, you know,

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:14.660
another country, it becomes a different place.

02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:17.420
It moves into a different space and that's part of it.

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:20.420
But if you go back again to the period

02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.780
at the very beginning of the 1990s,

02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:25.820
after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:27.900
well, there's no discussion about NATO at that point

02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.620
about NATO enlargement.

02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:31.900
There was a lot of pressure, again, as I've said before,

02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:33.620
by nationalist elements on Ukraine

02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:35.580
and trying to bring it back in the fold.

02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:37.940
And wanting to make what was then, you know,

02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:40.260
this mechanism for divorce,

02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:42.140
more of a mechanism for re-managed

02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:44.020
Commonwealth of Independent States.

02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:46.980
And in the early 1990s,

02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:50.900
when Ukraine became an independent state,

02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:54.500
it inherited that nuclear arsenal from the Soviet Union.

02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:57.180
Basically, whatever was stationed or positioned

02:18:57.220 --> 02:19:00.420
in Ukrainian territory at the time became Ukraine's.

02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.460
It's strategic and, you know, kind of basically

02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:04.820
intermediate and tactical nuclear weapons.

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:06.740
And, you know, in the United States at the time,

02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:08.900
you know, we had all this panic about

02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:10.100
what was gonna happen with all of that.

02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.620
I mean, I think, you know, it was a scientist

02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:14.060
and kind of technically it would have been difficult

02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:15.820
for Ukraine to actually use this.

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:18.660
I mean, the targeting was done centrally.

02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.900
They were actually stationed there, but nonetheless,

02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:22.540
Ukraine, like Belarus and Kazakhstan

02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:24.540
suddenly became nuclear powers.

02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:25.900
And, you know, Ash Carter,

02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:29.940
the former US Defense Secretary who's just died tragically

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.580
and Dave was talking about, you know,

02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.860
talking together today was part of a whole team

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:39.780
of Americans and others who, you know,

02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:41.820
tried to work with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan

02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:44.500
to get them to give up the nuclear weapons.

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:50.460
And back in the early period of that, 1993, 94,

02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:52.380
you go back, and I mean, I was writing about this

02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:53.220
at the time.

02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.660
There was a report called Back in the USSR,

02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.300
which is, you know, kind of on the website

02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:59.260
of the Kennedy School with some other colleagues.

02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:01.700
And we were monitoring how there was all these accusations

02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:06.060
coming out of Moscow, the Defense Ministry and the Duma,

02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:08.060
the parliament and others that Ukraine was trying

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:10.020
to find a way of making a dirty bomb

02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:13.180
using its nuclear weapons, you know, becoming a menace

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:15.100
and, you know, kind of Ukraine might have to be

02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:16.740
brought to order.

02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:18.260
So a lot of the dynamics we're seeing now

02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:21.380
were happening then irrespective of NATO.

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.740
Basically, the problem was always Ukraine getting away.

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:28.300
Yeltsin himself, when he unraveled the Soviet Union,

02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:29.980
didn't really want it to unravel,

02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:31.860
but he didn't have the wherewithal to bring,

02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:32.820
you know, the countries back again.

02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:35.500
Russia was weak after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.620
Its economy imploded.

02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:40.340
It had to give sovereignty to all of these constituent parts

02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:42.740
of the Russian Federation in terms of a sort of

02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:43.780
devolution of authority.

02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:45.020
It had the war in Chechnya,

02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:49.540
which Yeltsin stupidly sparked off in 1994.

02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:51.740
You had Tatarstan, one of the regions,

02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:53.780
the old rich regions, you know,

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:58.060
basically resting out a kind of a bilateral treaty

02:20:58.060 --> 02:20:58.900
with Moscow.

02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.260
You had the whole place was kind of seemed like

02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.900
it was falling apart so that, you know,

02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:03.900
you couldn't do anything on Ukraine

02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:05.620
because you didn't have the wherewithal to do it.

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:07.140
And then when, you know, kind of basically

02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:10.340
Russia starts to get its act back together again,

02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:14.380
all of these security nationalist types

02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:16.780
who had never wanted Ukraine or Belarus or Moldova

02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:18.380
or anywhere else to kind of move away,

02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:19.940
they didn't worry that much about Central Asia,

02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:22.260
to be frank, but they know they did want, you know,

02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:25.260
the core states in their view to come back

02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:27.540
and Moldova was part of that, even it's not Slavic,

02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:30.980
but you know, they wanted Belarus and Northern Kazakhstan

02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:32.300
and probably Kazakhstan as well,

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.860
which wasn't really thought about being part

02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:36.900
of Central Asia, back in the fold as close as possible.

02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:41.620
So anything that gave those countries an alternative

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.500
was seen as negative.

02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:45.940
And it, you know, could have been an association

02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:48.500
with China, you know, them joining, you know,

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.300
kind of an association with Latin America or Africa

02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:52.340
or something else like that.

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.780
But of course, NATO has all of those larger connotations

02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:58.980
of it being, you know, the Cold War opposing entity.

02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:01.340
And Putin has always seen NATO

02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.060
as being the direct correlation of the Warsaw Pact,

02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:06.580
which is, in other words, just something dominated

02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:08.900
completely by the United States.

02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:10.860
Now, of course, is why getting back to Trump again,

02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:12.740
Trump was always going, you know, to the Europeans,

02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:14.820
if this is really supposed to be collective security

02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:17.540
in a mutual defense pact, why are you guys not paying?

02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:19.980
You know, why does the US and the States pay for everything?

02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:21.860
But, you know, NATO was actually conceived

02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:25.780
as collective defense, you know, mutual security.

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:28.340
And it was set up by, you know, the United States,

02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:31.540
along with the UK and France and, you know, Germany

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.740
and Turkey and, you know, other countries.

02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:36.980
And we see that now with the entry of Finland and Sweden.

02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:38.740
They didn't have to join NATO.

02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:40.380
They didn't want to join NATO for a long time.

02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:42.180
They wanted to partner with it, just like Israel

02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:44.900
and other countries partner with NATO.

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:46.900
But once they thought that their security was really at risk,

02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:48.940
they wanted to be part of it.

02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:51.220
And so, you know, kind of, you're now really seeing,

02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:53.780
you know, that NATO is something other than just being,

02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:58.140
you know, a creature or an instrument of the United States.

02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:00.020
But that's how Putin always saw it.

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:03.900
So, you know, what this debate about NATO is all about

02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:07.980
or Russia being provoked is wanting to kind of return

02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:11.940
to an old superpower bipolar relationship

02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:14.940
where everything is negotiated with the United States.

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:17.500
It's to try to deny that Ukraine or Belarus,

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:19.660
well, Belarus has kind of been absorbed by this point,

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:22.420
you know, by Russia or Moldova or Kazakhstan

02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:25.420
or any of the other countries have any kind of agency.

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.060
Not even Poland or Hungary or, you know,

02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.060
kind of France and Britain.

02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:34.900
For years and years and years, senior people like Putin

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:37.780
and people around the Kremlin have demanded a return

02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:40.580
to the kind of what they call the old concert of Europe

02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:43.340
or the concert of Vienna where the big guys,

02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:46.420
which now means the United States and Russia,

02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:48.980
just sit down and thrash everything out.

02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:52.380
And so, I mean, Putin by saying, look, it was provoked.

02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:54.340
It's the United States, it's NATO.

02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:56.900
It's a proxy war or it's this or it's that

02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:58.980
or this is gonna be a nuclear confrontation.

02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:00.300
It's like the Cuban missile crisis

02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:01.620
or it's the Euro missile crisis.

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:03.580
It's basically just saying, you know,

02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:06.140
I want to go back to when the Soviet Union,

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:07.780
the United States worked things out.

02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:10.580
I want to go back to the whole period of the 1980s

02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:12.460
when Gorbachev and Reagan just kind of got together

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.860
and figured things out.

02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:18.860
Or even better, back to Yalta, Potsdam and Tehran

02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:22.820
and the big meetings at the end of World War II

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:24.900
where we resolved the whole future security.

02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:26.540
We've had a war, we've had the Cold War.

02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.500
Now we've got another war.

02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.740
We've got a real war, hot war.

02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.260
We've got a war in Ukraine.

02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:31.980
It should be the United States

02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:33.900
and Russia that sought this out.

02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:35.780
So this is where we see the United States

02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:36.900
waffling about as well,

02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.700
trying to kind of like figure out how to handle this

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:41.500
because it has to be handled in a way

02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:43.060
that Ukraine has agency.

02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:44.380
Because if Ukraine doesn't have agency,

02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:45.740
nobody else has agency either.

02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:48.660
Nobody else has any kind of decision-making power.

02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.420
And, you know, we have an environment

02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:53.380
in which Putin thinks that there's only really three players.

02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.460
There's the United States and Russia and China.

02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:58.140
And maybe occasionally it might be India

02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:00.740
and perhaps Brazil or some other South Africa

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:03.660
or some other country like maybe the Bricks at some point.

02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.540
But, you know, ultimately it's like the old days,

02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:08.180
big powers resolve everything.

02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:11.460
And so this war is also about Russia's right,

02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.820
Putin's right, you know, to determine things,

02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:16.460
you know, strong man to strong man,

02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.540
big country to big country,

02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:21.420
and, you know, determine where things happen next.

02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:23.420
That's why he's talking about things being provoked

02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:25.180
and it's being the United States' fault.

02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:29.300
But aren't there parts of the United States establishment

02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:34.060
that likes that kind of three-party view of the world?

02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:35.740
Oh, there's always going to be people

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:38.260
who like that part, that approach.

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:39.380
Of course there is.

02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:41.220
But then they don't necessarily dominate.

02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:43.220
That's the kind of thing that people kind of think about.

02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:45.540
So, I mean, you know, Putin can, you know,

02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:47.860
read, you know, all the various articles

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:49.740
and hear the kind of pronouncements of people.

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:51.980
But, you know, this gets back to, you know,

02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:54.540
the way that the United States operates.

02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:56.340
You know, Putin saw that, you know,

02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:58.740
Trump wanted to have a, you know, top-down,

02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.740
you know, vertical of power.

02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:02.340
And other presidents have wanted to have that.

02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:04.700
But the United States is a pretty messy place.

02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:06.700
And we have all kinds of different viewpoints.

02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:08.780
Now, of course, we know that in Russia,

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.460
everything, even criticism of the Kremlin

02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:12.460
is usually fairly orchestrated,

02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.460
usually to kind of flesh out, you know,

02:26:14.460 --> 02:26:15.740
what people think about things.

02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:17.540
When we had these hardliners saying, you know,

02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:20.340
we needed more destruction of Ukraine, not less,

02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:22.380
and that, you know, the army wasn't doing enough,

02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:23.580
it was in many respects, you know,

02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:25.220
kind of encouraged by the Kremlin

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:27.140
to see how people would react to that,

02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:29.620
you know, to kind of actually create a constituency

02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:32.620
for, you know, being more ruthless than you had before

02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:34.500
because, you know, they wanted to clamp down.

02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:37.620
In the United States, I mean, I can say whatever I want.

02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:38.580
It doesn't mean that I'm speaking

02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:40.740
on behalf of the White House.

02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:43.140
And, you know, even if I have been an advisor

02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:44.980
to this president, that president, and the other,

02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:47.020
it doesn't mean I'm, you know, basically speaking

02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:49.220
on behalf of the U.S. government.

02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:51.380
But there's kind of always an assumption from the Russians

02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:54.500
that, you know, when people, you know, say this

02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:56.780
and people do advocate one thing over another,

02:26:56.780 --> 02:26:59.180
that they're, you know, it's operating,

02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:00.660
there's a lot of mirror imaging,

02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:02.380
thinking that, you know, we're operating

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:03.460
in the same kind of way.

02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:06.380
So yes, there are, of course, constituencies

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:07.740
who think like that and would love it.

02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:08.580
It has to be back to that,

02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:09.780
and there are many people out there

02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:12.380
with their own peace plans, all kinds of people,

02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:14.380
you know, out there trying to push this.

02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:16.580
There does seem to be the engine

02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:18.180
of the military industrial complex

02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:21.300
seems to give some fuel to the hawks,

02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:26.300
and they seem to create momentum in government.

02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.860
Yeah, but other people do too.

02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:30.100
I mean, there's always, you know, kind of checks,

02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:31.020
I mean, again.

02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:33.340
You believe in the tension of ideas, every idea.

02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:34.500
I think there was a lot of tension.

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:36.300
I mean, I've seen it, I've seen it inside of the government

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:37.940
now, you know, and people can push back,

02:27:37.940 --> 02:27:40.180
and that's why I speak out, and I try to lay it out

02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:41.700
so that everybody can, you know,

02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:43.020
kind of figure it out for themselves.

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.420
I say the same to you as I say to everybody.

02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:47.780
This is how I see the situation,

02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:48.900
and, you know, this is, you know,

02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:50.860
how we can analyze it here.

02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.740
Now, look, do I think that we've handled, you know,

02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:56.700
the whole Russia account, you know, for years?

02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.620
Well, no, we haven't.

02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:02.100
I mean, we've taken our eyes off the ball many times.

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:03.340
We've failed to understand the way

02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:05.260
that people like Putin think.

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.060
You know, you talked earlier about, you know,

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:08.420
we need to have empathy for, you know,

02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:10.780
all the people who like Trump or like Biden

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:11.620
and so on, how they think.

02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:14.420
We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well.

02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:16.300
We've got to understand how the guy thinks

02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:18.900
and why he thinks like he does.

02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.220
You know, he has got his own context and his own frame

02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:25.060
and his own rationale, and he is rational.

02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:27.860
He is a rational actor in his own context.

02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:28.700
We've got to understand that.

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:30.580
We've got to understand that he would take offense

02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:33.100
at something and he would take action over something.

02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:34.740
It doesn't mean to say that, you know,

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.980
we are necessary to blame by taking actions,

02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:39.900
but we are to blame when we don't understand

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:43.700
the consequences of things that we do and act accordingly,

02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:45.540
or, you know, take preventative action

02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:47.740
or recognize that something might happen

02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:49.300
as a result of something.

02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:51.420
So you've been in the room with Putin.

02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:54.300
Let me ask you for some advice.

02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:57.940
And it's also just a good philosophical question

02:28:57.940 --> 02:28:59.220
for you or for me.

02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:02.020
If I have a conversation with Vladimir Putin right now,

02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:04.580
can you advise on what questions, topics,

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:07.540
ideas to talk through to him as a leader,

02:29:07.540 --> 02:29:08.900
to him as a human?

02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:11.140
What would you like to understand about his mind,

02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:12.220
about his thinking?

02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:15.140
Yeah, remember what I said before,

02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:18.020
that Putin always tries to, you know, reverse things.

02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:20.980
He wants to hear the questions that people have.

02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:25.620
Because remember, he himself, at different points,

02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:27.180
has been a recruiter, which is, you know,

02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:29.260
the way that you're operating now as well, right?

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:31.060
You're asking an awful lot of questions.

02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:32.660
Your questions also betray, you know,

02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:35.500
often the times where you're thinking about things,

02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.100
you know, the kind of context.

02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:41.380
You know, kind of any kind of, you know,

02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:43.180
any kind of dialogue like this

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:46.380
reveals a lot about the, you know, the other person.

02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:48.300
And I've actually often, you know,

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:50.460
noticed in these settings that Putin likes

02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:52.140
to have a lot of give and take.

02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:54.300
So I think he would actually enjoy having a conversation,

02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.540
you know, with you.

02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:00.540
But again, he would always be trying to influence you,

02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:02.260
inform and influence.

02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:03.700
That's kind of, you know, part of the way

02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:05.780
that he always operates.

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:07.460
So what you would have to, you know,

02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:09.220
be trying to think about, so what is it

02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.420
that you would want to elicit information from him?

02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:13.820
You're trying to understand the guy's worldview.

02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:15.460
And what we're trying to also understand

02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:17.460
is if there's any room there

02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:20.220
where he might compromise on something.

02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:22.260
You know, so if your goal was to go in there,

02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:25.300
you know, to talk about Ukraine at this particular moment,

02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:28.900
I mean, one of the problems that I've often seen

02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:30.420
in the sort of the meetings we've had with Putin

02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:32.860
just ends up in sort of mutual recriminations.

02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:36.540
You know, kind of, no, well, what about what you've done?

02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:38.260
Oh, no, you've done that about, you know,

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:40.900
there's always this what about-ism.

02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:43.700
I mean, it often say, well, you're saying

02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.780
that I've done this, but you've done that.

02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:47.540
The United States invaded Iraq.

02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:49.740
What's the difference between, you know, what I'm doing

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:53.020
and all of the things that you've been doing here?

02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:54.580
I mean, what you would have to try to do

02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:57.820
is kind of elicit information about why

02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:00.740
or what he is thinking about this particular moment in time

02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:01.860
and why he thinks it.

02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:06.980
Yeah, the what about-ism is a failure case,

02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:10.060
I think that shows from all the interviews

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:12.460
I've seen that with him, that just shows

02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:14.660
that he doesn't trust the person on the other side.

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:15.660
No, he doesn't.

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:19.900
Right, but I'm not cynical like people's,

02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:22.900
they seem to think he's some kind of KGB agent

02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:24.260
that doesn't trust anybody.

02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:25.100
I disagree.

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:27.300
I think everybody's human.

02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:30.620
And from my perspective, I'm worried about

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:35.340
what I've seen is I think whether it's COVID,

02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:40.340
whether it's other aspects that I'm not aware of

02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:45.180
leading up to the invasion, he seems to be less willing

02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:48.580
to have a charismatic back and forth dialogue.

02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:49.780
Yeah, an open discussion.

02:31:49.780 --> 02:31:50.900
You know, actually, I mean, I said,

02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:53.420
you asked me before about, you know, that issue of trust

02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:55.860
and he often says he only trusts himself.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:59.660
And I said, you know, he's often distrustful of people,

02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:02.420
but he does trust some people for certain things

02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:04.620
where he knows it's within their competence.

02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:09.340
So he has people he trusts to do things

02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:10.820
because he knows they'll do them

02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:12.500
and he knows that they'll do them well,

02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:15.260
which is why, you know, he has his old buddies

02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:18.180
from St. Petersburg because he's known for a very long time

02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:21.420
and he knows that they won't try to pull a fast one over him,

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:23.940
but he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses

02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:25.220
and what they can be trusted to do.

02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:26.420
I mean, he's learning that, you know,

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.660
some of the people in the military

02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:29.700
that he thought were competent

02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.060
or people on other things are not, right?

02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:35.100
That they, and he intends to actually have a lot of loyalty

02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:37.420
to people as well, or he also kind of thinks

02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:39.940
it's best to keep them inside the tent than outside

02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:42.380
and he moves them around, you know, he kind of, okay,

02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:44.420
you know, he gives them multiple chances

02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:46.100
to redeem themselves if they don't.

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:47.700
It's not like he hasn't done it.

02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:49.740
I mean, yeah, there is a lot of that in the system,

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:51.980
but the people that he's worked with for a long time,

02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:53.700
you know, he moves them around to something else,

02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:55.140
perhaps where they can do less harm.

02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:58.420
Although, you know, we've often see that he has quite

02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:00.900
of small cadre of people that he's reliant on

02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:02.740
and, you know, they're not up to the task,

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:04.780
which is kind of what's happening here.

02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:08.580
But he also, in the past, has been more straightforward,

02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:10.940
just like you were saying here, more pragmatic.

02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:14.180
And I think, you know, if you were engaged with him

02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:16.860
in Russian, while you were actually literally speaking

02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:18.700
the same language, because there's so much

02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:20.100
lost in translation.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:22.300
I used to jump out of my skin listening

02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:24.340
to some of the phone calls, because, you know,

02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:26.700
the way that they kind of relate, you know,

02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:27.740
with an interpreter.

02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:29.540
Oh, because you're listening to the translation.

02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:31.220
No, because I know I'm listening to the Russian

02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:32.060
and the translation.

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:32.900
And the translation.

02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:34.460
You know, in real time.

02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:36.500
And I haven't been at a translators' institute.

02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:37.660
It's really difficult.

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.980
Look, an interpreter is a trend in the moment

02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:42.860
to do something, you know, the synchronicity of it,

02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:47.860
the synchronized or the real time translation.

02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:51.460
It's a translation is an art as well as a skill.

02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:54.500
If you're doing simultaneous translation,

02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:55.540
that's the word in English, you know,

02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:58.180
synchronicity of it in Russian.

02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:00.780
You're kind of focused in the moment on the fragments

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.020
of the discussion and trying to render it

02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:05.620
as accurately as you possibly can.

02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:07.220
And when you come out of that,

02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:10.140
you can't relay the entire conversation.

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.140
And often, you know, what translators do is they, you know,

02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:14.820
they take this little short note like journalists do.

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:17.580
And afterwards, you know, they've just been caught up

02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:20.260
in the moment and they haven't got the big picture.

02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.260
Consecutive translation is different.

02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:25.140
You know, kind of you're trying to convey the whole mood

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:28.140
of like big chunks of dialogue that have already been there.

02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:30.740
But, you know, sometimes you might not get that right either.

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:33.460
And it breaks up the flow of the discussion.

02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:34.620
That's terrible.

02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:35.940
And often it's, you know,

02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:38.540
the kind of the person who translates it's different.

02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:41.220
You know, some of our best translators are women,

02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:43.420
but, you know, hearing a woman's voice, you know,

02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:47.660
translating a guy who has a particular guy's way of speaking

02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:51.140
and a macho way of speaking and a crude way of speaking,

02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:53.460
you know, be that Putin or I've seen that happen

02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:56.260
with Erdogan, the president of Turkey, you know,

02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:59.340
and it gets translated by a much more refined, you know,

02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:02.660
female speaker, you've just lost the whole thing.

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:05.820
And, you know, many of the translators on the Russian side

02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:07.900
are not competent in English

02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:09.340
in the way that you would hope they are.

02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:11.300
It's not just that they're not native speakers.

02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:13.060
They're just not trained to the same high standards

02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:15.100
they used to be in the past.

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:19.180
And you just lose the nuance, you lose the feel.

02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:20.540
You know, you almost need, you know,

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:22.700
kind of the interpretive actor, you know,

02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:26.420
doing, you know, the kind of the interpretation for that.

02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:28.180
You need to match it as much as you can

02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:31.060
in the way that you, you know, do voiceovers in film.

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:35.500
The best way to talk to Putin is one-on-one

02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:37.660
in his own language.

02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:39.700
I mean, I have a really great friend here

02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:42.060
who is one of the best interpreters of Putin.

02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:43.620
He's often asked by the, you know,

02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:46.180
the media to interpret for him.

02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:48.860
But just, he was at the institute that I was at.

02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:51.500
I mean, I knew him from that kind of period.

02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:52.540
And he is just excellent.

02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:55.300
Just like Pavel Palashenko was absolutely phenomenal

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.380
at interpreting Gorbachev.

02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.060
Now he didn't always interpret him.

02:35:58.900 --> 02:35:59.620
He did accurately because Gorbachev

02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:00.940
made lots of grammatical gaffes.

02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:03.980
And sometimes was, you know, Gorbachev himself would joke

02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:06.380
that Palashenko, you know, spoke better for Gorbachev

02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:07.980
than Gorbachev could himself.

02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:09.780
But Putin is actually quite precise

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:11.660
and careful in the way that he speaks

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:13.100
because there's a lot of menace sometimes

02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:13.940
to things deliberately.

02:36:13.940 --> 02:36:15.420
Other times there's lots of humor

02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:18.100
and he's telling a joke for a particular reason.

02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:19.140
And a lot of it is, I mean,

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:21.340
he actually uses the richness of the Russian language

02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:23.660
and the crudity of language that can't be conveyed

02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:24.500
in English.

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:26.180
The facial expressions that go along with it.

02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:27.860
Body language, the way that he sits back

02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:29.620
in the chair and slouches.

02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:31.820
That the kind of the way that he makes fun of people

02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:33.940
and he, you know, kind of uses irony.

02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:36.620
Just some of it is just lost and it needs to be conveyed.

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:39.100
The depth of humor and wit.

02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:42.780
I've met quite a few like political leaders like that

02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.020
in this peak only Russian

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.620
when I was traveling in Ukraine.

02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:50.540
I don't know how you translate that.

02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:51.820
I think it's almost,

02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:53.780
the other person that reminds me like that

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:55.540
a little bit is Obama.

02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:58.980
Obama had a wit and an intelligence

02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:02.980
but like he would smile as he said something

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:04.700
that add a lot to it.

02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:09.060
Like that he's trolling you or he's being sarcastic

02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:11.660
or like me converting into words.

02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:13.500
It's obvious that all English speakers

02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:14.980
if they listen to Obama,

02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:16.860
but if you have to translate to a different language

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:17.980
I think you're gonna lose a lot of-

02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:19.940
Yeah, I mean, when I watched the,

02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:22.100
I mean, I watched many of Putin's speeches,

02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:23.420
you know, kind of just in Russian,

02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:26.100
not looking at any of the subtitles or anything

02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:28.460
and it's just watching the way that his body language is

02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:30.260
at the time when he's saying things,

02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:33.860
the way that he'll smoke, he'll sneer, he'll laugh,

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:36.180
he'll ad lib, you know, kind of from something

02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:37.180
that obviously kind of, you know,

02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:39.900
wasn't there on the prepared speech.

02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:41.220
And it's really critical.

02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:42.340
And, you know, kind of a lot,

02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:44.180
some people speak, you know, like Trump,

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:48.140
it just needs kind of just words.

02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:52.260
Putin, the words are very important.

02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:53.420
Trump, it's the atmosphere,

02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:55.340
it's the kind of the way you feel about things,

02:37:55.340 --> 02:37:58.020
it's the buzz you get, you know, it's revving people up.

02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:00.860
It's the kind of slogans and Putin, it's, you know,

02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:03.540
he's conveying a lot in what he's saying there.

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:05.580
I think, I mean, of course I don't know much

02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:07.620
because I only speak Russian and English,

02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:11.260
but I have in English or Russian have not met

02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:17.220
almost anyone ever as interesting in conversation as Putin.

02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:21.260
I think he shines not in speeches,

02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:23.180
but in interactions with others.

02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:25.060
Yeah, when you watch those interviews and things with him,

02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:26.860
and I've, you know, been at many of these sessions,

02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:29.620
it's been hours of him parrying questions.

02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:33.300
And it's like watching a boxer sparring,

02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:35.300
you know, in a kind of training bout.

02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.780
Yeah, come on, give me another one.

02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:38.780
You know, and it's kind of like, and he prides himself

02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:42.820
and he's made mistakes often,

02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:44.420
but the breadth of, you know,

02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:46.460
the issues that he's often covered has been interesting,

02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:47.420
has been fascinating.

02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:49.700
And I used to just take, you know,

02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:51.300
kind of really detailed notes about this

02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:53.020
because you learn a ton.

02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:54.980
But it's also about his worldview again.

02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:59.660
I mean, he does live in a certain box, like we all do.

02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:02.060
And, you know, again, his world experience

02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:04.060
is not as extensive as, you know,

02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:05.540
you would hope it would be,

02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:07.340
but that's why you have to really pay attention.

02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:09.460
That's where we've messed up.

02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:11.900
That's where we haven't really paid a lot of attention

02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:13.700
to what he's been saying.

02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:18.700
He's been telegraphing this grievance, this dissatisfaction,

02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:22.260
this I'm gonna do something for years.

02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:26.580
And the thing is during war time,

02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:33.180
the combined with propaganda and the narratives

02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:37.620
of resentment and grievance that you dig in on those,

02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:40.700
like maybe you start out not believing it,

02:39:40.700 --> 02:39:43.500
but you're sure it's all gonna believe it eventually.

02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.820
While you convince yourself over time, yeah.

02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:49.020
Look, the longer you're in a position like Putin,

02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:51.700
22 years now, come in 23 years,

02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:54.540
could be out there for 36 years,

02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.500
you become more and more rigid.

02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:57.780
I mean, this is again, you know,

02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.460
something that you see in history.

02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:01.780
You know, you look at, you know, people through history

02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:03.900
have moved from kind of being kind of left-wing

02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:08.140
in their perspectives to hard right.

02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:10.980
They kind of have a kind of a sort of an ossification

02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.540
or a rigidity emerges in their views.

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:14.380
I mean, again, I used to have these arguments

02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:16.180
with Professor Pius about Lenin,

02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:17.660
because he would talk about Lenin,

02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:19.420
but he didn't change his mind from being 18.

02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:20.340
Have you not thought about that?

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:22.100
I mean, it's like, we're not formed,

02:40:22.100 --> 02:40:25.220
fully formed individuals at 18.

02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:26.540
You know, we don't know anything.

02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:27.980
We know something, but not everything.

02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:30.140
I mean, obviously the younger context,

02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:31.780
you know, the kind of the way that you kind of grew up,

02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:33.220
the place you grew up, the things that happened to you,

02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:34.660
the traumas you have.

02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:36.260
I mean, all of these have an impact.

02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:38.460
But then if you don't grow beyond all of that,

02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:41.220
and Putin's been stuck in place since 2000

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:43.540
when he became president, he's not out and about,

02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:46.180
you know, kind of being a man of the people.

02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:48.740
You know, he's not doing the kind of things

02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:49.580
that he used to do.

02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:51.220
Yeah, he gets out there and he goes to Kazakhstan

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:54.900
and, you know, Tajikistan, and he goes to China

02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:55.740
and he does this and that.

02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:57.420
And then under COVID, he didn't go anywhere.

02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:59.100
I mean, to very few places.

02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:00.740
And so he's got stuck.

02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.100
And that worries me a lot,

02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:04.860
because you could see before that he, you know,

02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:07.580
had a bit more of flexibility of thought.

02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:09.580
And that's why nobody should be in place forever.

02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:11.220
You should always kind of like get out there

02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:13.300
and go out there and learn a new skill.

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:16.060
You know, kind of, he needs to sort of,

02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:17.140
you know, he needs to get out more

02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:18.060
and do something different.

02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:19.620
You had an interesting point you've made

02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:24.100
that both Vladimir Zelensky and Putin

02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:28.740
are thinking about, they're just politicians.

02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:31.340
They're thinking about the 2024 election,

02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:32.700
which is coming up for both of them.

02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:34.100
Yeah, I've said that in some of the other interviews.

02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:34.940
Yeah, that's true.

02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:35.780
That's so interesting.

02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:36.620
They do, yeah.

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:37.440
I mean, I-

02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:38.280
Because their election's gonna be

02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.620
pretty much at the same time.

02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:40.900
As the U.S. election, also.

02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:42.340
Yeah, others will be before.

02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:43.860
I mean, because it's some time in that, you know,

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:46.140
early part of the year for the presidential election.

02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:47.700
Yeah, and also, I don't know if you know

02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:48.740
about U.S. elections,

02:41:48.740 --> 02:41:50.500
but they actually last way longer than a year.

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:51.340
Well, they go from it.

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.220
We're in it now, aren't we?

02:41:52.220 --> 02:41:53.060
You know, already.

02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:54.580
We're already starting.

02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.820
So there's going to be a significant overlap.

02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:58.660
Yeah, you know, you're right.

02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:00.700
Do you think that actually comes into play

02:42:00.700 --> 02:42:02.820
in their calculus?

02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:05.100
I think it was one of the reasons why Putin invaded

02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:07.900
in February of 2022, because it was gonna be two years,

02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:09.860
I mean, he thought it'd be over by March of 2022,

02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:12.580
and he got two years to prepare for the election,

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:13.500
and he got a big boost.

02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.460
You know, not only, he got a boost from Crimea.

02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:16.580
I mean, I didn't mention that before.

02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:18.980
I mean, one of the reasons for invading Crimea,

02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:21.340
and annexing, or invading Ukraine the first time

02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.140
and annexing Crimea was, look, what happened to his ratings?

02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:25.940
They went from kind of declining,

02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:27.260
and they were still pretty good, you know,

02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:28.140
by anybody's standards,

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:30.300
to just rocketing off into the stratosphere.

02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:32.220
I mean, I didn't really meet anybody in Russia

02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:36.340
who thought that annexing Crimea was kind of a bad thing.

02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.380
I mean, even, you know, kind of people who opposed Putin

02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:39.300
on so many other things.

02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:41.660
Crimea was, you know, Krimnash, they kept saying.

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:44.300
You know, this is kind of, you know, we got it back.

02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:45.700
You know, it should never have gone away.

02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:49.340
It was ours, you know, but, you know, this is more complex.

02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:51.380
And he wasn't, I don't think at the time,

02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:53.540
planning on annexing all of Ukraine

02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:55.420
when he went into this special military operation.

02:42:55.420 --> 02:42:58.100
He was gonna try to turn it into what Belarus has become,

02:42:58.100 --> 02:42:59.740
you know, part of a, you know,

02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:01.660
bring back the Commonwealth of Independent States,

02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:05.100
or the Union, then a new union with Belarus and Ukraine

02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:06.020
and Russia over time.

02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:10.780
But certainly, you know, remove Ukraine as a major factor,

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:12.620
independent factor on the world stage

02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.740
and, you know, consolidate Crimea

02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.060
and maybe, you know, kind of incorporate

02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.980
Donetsk and Lukhansk, you know, kind of,

02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:20.580
that was also a possibility.

02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:23.660
But it wasn't in his intention in any case

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:25.420
to have something on this kind of scale.

02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:27.140
He wanted to get on with then preparing

02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:29.940
for what was gonna be, he would think the cakewalk,

02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:32.740
the shoe-in of the next presidential election.

02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:34.460
I mean, last time around, he had to invite a bit

02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:36.100
of competition with this person

02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:38.020
who's reputed to be his goddaughter,

02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:40.500
Ksenia Sobchak, you know, for a bit of, you know,

02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:43.140
kind of entertainment for people.

02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:45.060
You know, this next time around, you know,

02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:47.100
maybe he wasn't really planning on running,

02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:49.780
you know, against any other, you know, serious opposition.

02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:51.620
He was just gonna have the acclaim of, you know,

02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:53.380
the kind of the great leader,

02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:56.220
like President Xi in China.

02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:58.260
You know, Putin, you know, was basically,

02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:00.540
I think, you know, he also hoped that he would be able

02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:02.620
to devolve some authority away, you know, kind of,

02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:04.700
so he's more like the, you know,

02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:06.540
the supreme leader kind of figure,

02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:08.460
the czar-like figure, the monarch,

02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:10.060
and then, you know, other people get on with

02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:12.860
the chief executive, prime ministerial,

02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:15.100
running the country, and he could kind of like step back

02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:17.020
and just enjoy this, you know, maybe there was gonna be,

02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:19.580
again, a new union of Belarus, Russia,

02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:24.580
and Ukraine in some fashion, and he would preside over that.

02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:27.340
So speaking of opposition,

02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:30.780
you've criticized the famed Putin critic,

02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:34.540
Alexei Navalny, what's the nature of your criticism?

02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:36.460
Well, it hasn't really been a kind of a criticism

02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:38.580
in the way that, you know, people have implied,

02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:40.260
but more just reminding people

02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.500
that Navalny isn't some stooge of the West,

02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:45.140
as other people have, you know, kind of depicted him

02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:47.100
in the Russian firm, but, you know,

02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:49.740
saying that this is kind of, you know, he's pro-Western.

02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:53.180
He's a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot.

02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:57.060
You know, in the past, he's articulated, you know,

02:44:57.060 --> 02:44:58.500
things are not sort of dissimilar

02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:00.580
from some of the people around Putin,

02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:02.900
and it's more just reminding people that, you know,

02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:05.460
just because you kind of see somebody, you know,

02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:07.180
as a kind of in an opposition figure

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:09.380
or somebody who might be more palatable from,

02:45:09.380 --> 02:45:11.740
you know, your perspective looking from the West,

02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:13.140
they're not always gonna be, you know,

02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:14.460
what you think they are.

02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:16.660
Alexei Navalny is a Russian,

02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:18.780
and, you know, in a particular Russian context,

02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:20.780
he's different from Putin,

02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:22.980
but he wouldn't necessarily, you know,

02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:25.260
kind of run, you know, the Russian system

02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:27.260
in ways that we will like.

02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:29.740
So that's kind of, it's not a kind of a criticism,

02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:32.460
it's more of a critique of the way that we look at things.

02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:34.340
You know, I think it's a mistake to always, you know, say,

02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.700
well, this is pro-Western or this is a, you know, liberal.

02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:38.820
I mean, what the heck does that mean, pro-Western?

02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:40.100
I mean, he's a Russian.

02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:42.060
He's a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot,

02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:43.340
and he's often, you know,

02:45:43.340 --> 02:45:46.340
been, you know, quite critical about immigration.

02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:49.260
He's had some negative views about, you know,

02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:51.540
from one point of view, he said, don't feed the Caucasus,

02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:53.780
you know, kind of played upon some of the, you know,

02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:57.100
the racial and ethnic tensions inside of, you know,

02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:58.620
Russia itself as well.

02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:01.020
Now he is a pluralist and he's kind of,

02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:02.820
and he wants to have, you know,

02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:06.900
a different set of political actors there,

02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:08.700
but he also isn't promoting revolution.

02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:11.300
He's not Lenin, he's not one to bring down the state.

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:13.460
He wants to kind of, you know,

02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:16.700
change the people who are in charge.

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.340
That's what he's being basically focused on.

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.380
And, you know, he might have,

02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:22.740
and have things and do things that, you know,

02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:24.700
we elsewhere might not like.

02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:27.020
And I guess the bigger picture there is,

02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:30.700
it's not trivial to know

02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:33.180
that if you place another human in power

02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:36.220
to replace the current human in power,

02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:37.340
that things are gonna be better.

02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:38.900
They could be a lot worse

02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:42.900
because there's a momentum to a system.

02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:44.660
A system is bigger than just this leader,

02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:47.900
even when that leader has a huge amount of power.

02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:49.180
That's absolutely right.

02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:51.500
And, you know, he grew up in that, you know, same system.

02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:53.060
Now he's younger than Putin,

02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:56.020
so he's got a different generational perspective.

02:46:56.020 --> 02:46:59.140
And he's not wedded to the Soviet Union

02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:01.380
or, you know, kind of some concept of the Russian Empire.

02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:02.620
He doesn't seem to spend a lot of time,

02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:04.380
I don't know what he's doing, you know, in jail,

02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:05.900
but he's probably not sitting around, you know,

02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:07.380
reading Lomonosov and, you know,

02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:10.100
the kind of the great kind of tracks of Russian history.

02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:12.300
Could be actually, but I mean, I think, you know,

02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:13.660
Navalny has a different worldview

02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:14.660
and a different perspective,

02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:17.140
just like Medvedev was different, you know,

02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:20.340
in his time in presidency and made some, you know,

02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:22.460
changes and some innovations there.

02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:24.540
But don't think that they're going to be radically different.

02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:28.300
Cause like Gorbachev, I mean, he was so different

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.540
from Andropov and Chinenko and others as a person,

02:47:31.540 --> 02:47:34.260
but he was also constrained by the system.

02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:35.540
And he wanted to have change,

02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:36.860
but he wanted evolutionary change.

02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:37.700
He didn't know how to do it,

02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:39.220
but he didn't want to bring the whole system down.

02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:41.620
Look at Khrushchev when he came in, you know,

02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:45.860
after that whole period of, you know,

02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:47.180
everybody trying to figure out what to do

02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:48.540
after Stalin had died.

02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:50.020
And there was all this kind of back and forth

02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:51.340
and eventually Khrushchev emerges.

02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:53.380
And, you know, he tries to make changes to the system,

02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:56.980
but he's also a creature of a very specific context.

02:47:56.980 --> 02:47:58.820
He's grown up in the same system and he, you know,

02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.940
kind of brings all kinds of elements of chaos there,

02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:03.460
you know, to the whole thing.

02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:06.660
And, you know, gets into a standoff with the United States

02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:09.460
that we know as the Cuban Missile Crisis.

02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:11.380
And eventually, you know, gets removed.

02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:12.780
You know, we're looking at what's happening

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.780
in the United Kingdom right now.

02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:19.380
You know, they've just churned through three prime ministers

02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:21.620
and actually five prime ministers in, you know,

02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:22.540
kind of as many years.

02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:24.260
But all of those prime ministers have come out

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.060
of the context of the Conservative Party.

02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.540
They're all, you know, kind of just shades of,

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.620
you know, the same thing.

02:48:29.620 --> 02:48:31.580
They've all come out of the same academic

02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:33.980
and, you know, kind of privileged backgrounds.

02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:37.060
Even Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister,

02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:40.900
who's the first, you know, Indian or Anglo-Indian

02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:43.340
prime minister in British history.

02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:45.260
It was a kind of phenomenal, you know, kind of,

02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:47.180
as a child of Indian immigrants,

02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:50.020
but also a person of great privilege

02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:53.580
from the same academic and party background as the others.

02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:55.700
You know, so there are always differences

02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:58.500
with those human beings, but those contexts matter a lot.

02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:01.780
What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine

02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:03.700
with a tactical nuclear weapon?

02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:07.900
Well, Putin's definitely been thinking about it, right?

02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:08.980
I mean, he is the kind of person,

02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:09.820
if he's got an instrument,

02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:11.500
he wants to figure out how to use it.

02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:13.860
You know, we look at polonium, we look at Novichok,

02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:15.740
you know, we look at all kinds of things.

02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:18.980
You know, he's also presided over in Syria.

02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:22.860
He has, you know, put in charge of the war in Ukraine now.

02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:25.540
General Suvorikin is known as General Armageddon,

02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:27.220
you know, the kind of person who, you know,

02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:30.460
pretty much facilitated the use of chemical weapons

02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:32.620
in Syria, you know, for example.

02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:35.060
So, you know, don't think that Putin, you know,

02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:37.460
hasn't thought about how ruthless he can possibly be.

02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:39.820
The question is really the calculation.

02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:42.340
It's his estimation of the probability

02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:44.140
that it will get the desired effect.

02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.860
We keep talking about this idea of escalate to de-escalate.

02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:49.900
That's not what the Russians, you know, how they call it,

02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:51.700
but it's the whole idea that you do something

02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:54.740
really outrageous to get everybody else to back off.

02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:56.780
Now, when you talked about the precedent

02:49:56.780 --> 02:50:00.460
that the United States set of detonating

02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:03.740
the nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:06.340
what, you know, he obviously meant the precedent

02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:07.740
of using nuclear weapons, of course,

02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:09.460
which, of course, we would then say,

02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:13.540
well, we showed then how the impermissibility

02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:14.820
of ever doing that again.

02:50:14.820 --> 02:50:16.620
But what he's talking about is the precedent

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.460
of escalating to such an extent that you stop the war

02:50:19.460 --> 02:50:22.180
because he reads that saying, well, you know,

02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:24.860
the US dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:26.900
The war was brought to a quick conclusion.

02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:28.900
And of course, there's a huge debate in America

02:50:28.900 --> 02:50:30.580
about whether it was necessary to do that,

02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:32.140
whether the war was ending anyway.

02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:35.340
Did that really, you know, kind of change the minds

02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:36.940
of the Japanese high command?

02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:38.300
I mean, there's all kinds of books

02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:40.700
and being written about that.

02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:43.180
And of course, you know, the revulsion that people felt

02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:44.940
in the wake of that was just, you know,

02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:47.140
just the shock of what actually happened.

02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:49.340
And we've spent, you know, 70 years, you know,

02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:50.980
basically coming to terms with the fact

02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:53.620
that we did something like that, you know, the fire bombing.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:55.740
You know, we've also looked at all the bombing,

02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.540
you know, in Vietnam and everywhere.

02:50:57.540 --> 02:51:00.460
And, you know, all these massive bombing campaigns

02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:03.060
and realizing they actually often had the opposite effect.

02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:05.700
Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have contributed

02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:07.340
and there's a lot of, you know, scholars suggesting

02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:08.660
it did to the end of the war.

02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:10.260
But all of the big bombing campaigns,

02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:12.100
the destruction actually prolonged wars

02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:13.460
because they made people fight back

02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:15.060
as we're kind of seeing in the case of Ukraine.

02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:18.660
So Putin has to calculate the probability

02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:21.980
that if he uses some tactical nuclear weapon,

02:51:21.980 --> 02:51:23.340
that it will get the desired effect,

02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:26.500
which is get us to capitulate and Ukraine to capitulate.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.380
Us to capitulate, meaning the United States and Europeans

02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.820
not supporting Ukraine anymore,

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:32.540
pushing towards the negotiating table

02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:34.260
and negotiating Ukraine away.

02:51:34.260 --> 02:51:36.420
And Ukraine saying, okay, we give up,

02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:41.260
like happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in Japan.

02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:44.020
So it's his calculation, you know,

02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:45.740
as much as anything else, which is really important.

02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:46.860
He said, we have to show him

02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:48.180
that he won't get that out of it.

02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:49.820
It's kind of less our probability

02:51:49.820 --> 02:51:50.980
and you know, kind of the odds of it.

02:51:50.980 --> 02:51:54.220
It's just how he calculates that probability

02:51:54.220 --> 02:51:56.060
of getting what he wants.

02:51:56.060 --> 02:51:58.380
I mean, I guess that's how the game of poker works.

02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:01.340
It's your probability and your estimate

02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:04.660
of their probability and your estimate of their estimate

02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:06.340
of your probability and so on and so forth.

02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:08.220
Yeah, so it goes on, yeah, exactly.

02:52:08.220 --> 02:52:10.100
I think he has two tools, right?

02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:12.860
So one is actually the actual use of nuclear weapons

02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:14.060
and then the threat of the.

02:52:14.060 --> 02:52:15.820
Oh, the threat is very effective.

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:19.660
And the more real you make the threat.

02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:20.500
That's right.

02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:24.340
So it's like, the more you approach the actual use,

02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:26.180
I get very close to using it.

02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:29.420
He's already using Chernobyl, Zaporizhzhia

02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:33.380
and then usually Ukraine's the other nuclear reactor.

02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:36.340
So he's using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb.

02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:40.140
So, you know, it's ironic that he has Sergei Shoigu,

02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:41.460
his defense minister calling people up

02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:42.940
to the Ukraine's are gonna use a dirty bomb.

02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:44.140
They're already doing it.

02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:47.580
I mean, what is kind of more destructive

02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:49.500
than stirring up all the radioactive dust

02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:51.580
in Chernobyl as you send your troops through,

02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:54.900
for example, or shelling the Chernobyl plant

02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:57.140
and the sarcophagus and putting it at risk.

02:52:57.140 --> 02:52:58.740
And Zaporizhzhia, you've got the

02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:00.460
International Atomic Energy Agency

02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:02.100
running out there in utter panic

02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:06.180
and kind of also trying to intervene in the conflict.

02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:09.740
So you're putting civilian nuclear reactors at risk.

02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:11.540
I mean, that also has the great added effect

02:53:11.540 --> 02:53:13.620
of cutting off Ukraine's power supply

02:53:13.620 --> 02:53:16.060
because Zaporizhzhia in particular was,

02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:19.740
what was it, a third of Ukraine's power generation

02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:21.780
or some really high percentage of that.

02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:23.380
I'll have to go back and take a look at that.

02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:25.540
But that's a twofer.

02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:27.620
It's a kind of a double effect there

02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:30.940
of undermining power generation,

02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:32.860
also frightening Germans and others

02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:34.980
who've already been very worried about nuclear power

02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:37.460
and increasing your leverage on that energy front,

02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:41.180
but also scaring people from the perspective

02:53:41.180 --> 02:53:43.460
of the use of nuclear weapon.

02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:46.140
Those reactors also become a nuclear weapon,

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:47.380
tactically deployed.

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:51.420
And as you said, the discussion of using a nuclear weapon

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:53.580
and engendering all those fears.

02:53:53.580 --> 02:53:55.620
And he's already got an effect.

02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:56.620
Everyone's running around talking

02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:59.260
about the Cuban missile crisis and secret diplomacy

02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:01.580
and how we negotiate a way Ukraine in return

02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:03.820
for Putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon.

02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:05.860
So he's got a lot of people already talking about that.

02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:09.740
So sorry for the difficult and dark question.

02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:13.380
It could be for you directly or more like,

02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:15.260
do you think we have a plan for this?

02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:20.260
What happens if he does drop a nuclear weapon?

02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:25.260
Do you have a sense that the United States has a good plan?

02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:29.420
I know we're talking about it.

02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:30.860
I think we probably have several plans

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:34.140
because it depends on what, where, when, how.

02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:39.860
And also don't these things happen very quickly?

02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:44.900
Well, there's also signaling and signs of movement there.

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:46.980
I mean, I want to be very careful about this,

02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:48.780
but then the thing is it's also very important

02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:51.540
that we do this with other nuclear powers.

02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:53.660
So the other thing that's different

02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.580
from how it might've been in the past

02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.700
and particularly different from the Cuban missile crisis

02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:58.580
and the era missile crisis,

02:54:58.580 --> 02:55:00.620
we're not the only nuclear players.

02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:03.100
China, I mean, has a major nuclear arsenal now,

02:55:03.940 --> 02:55:06.540
less on the strategic side, but building it up,

02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:10.420
but very much on the intermediate range and tactical.

02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:13.260
Kim Jong-un is firing off weapons left, right, and center

02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:14.380
at the moment in North Korea.

02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:15.540
We've got other rogue states.

02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:18.140
Putin's behaving like a rogue state just to be very clear.

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:20.820
And this is what we've got with Kim Jong-un in North Korea.

02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:23.740
We've also got India and Pakistan,

02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:25.140
and we've got other states

02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:26.220
that we're not supposed to talk about

02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:27.780
that we know have nuclear capacities

02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:30.660
and others that would like to have nuclear capacity.

02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:34.780
And the whole question here is about also proliferation.

02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:38.460
Getting back to that time when Ukraine had nuclear weapons,

02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:40.180
at least there on its territory

02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:41.580
in sort of Belarus and Kazakhstan,

02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:44.180
you've got to wonder, was it wise for them to give it up?

02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:47.860
We were worried about kind of loose nukes, nuclear weapons,

02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:51.180
kind of getting out of hand proliferation at the time.

02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:53.260
We wanted fewer nuclear powers.

02:55:53.260 --> 02:55:54.820
Russia wanted that too.

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:56.220
Now we're going to have more.

02:55:56.220 --> 02:55:57.220
We've got more.

02:55:57.260 --> 02:55:58.740
And what Putin is saying is,

02:55:58.740 --> 02:55:59.980
well, that was stupid of Ukraine

02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:01.580
to give up the nuclear weapons.

02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:03.300
In fact, my colleagues and I,

02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:04.860
back in our report and back in the USSR,

02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:07.020
kind of suggest they shouldn't give them up.

02:56:07.020 --> 02:56:09.420
And then that's why we had the Budapest memorandum.

02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:11.260
That's why the United States and the United Kingdom

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:13.580
in particular have, you know,

02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:16.460
basically some responsibility and obligation

02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:19.300
going back to 1994 when they promised Ukraine

02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:20.620
that gave up the nuclear weapons,

02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:22.620
that territorial integrity and sovereignty

02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:23.820
would remain intact,

02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:26.060
some obligation to actually do something to step up.

02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:27.540
If we step back from that,

02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:30.460
this is the thing that people are not talking about,

02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:31.940
you know, what about nuclear proliferation?

02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:33.860
If you're South Korea, you're Japan,

02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:35.060
you know, you're any other country

02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.340
that's kind of worrying about your neighbors

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:39.340
and, you know, what might happen to you.

02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:41.300
And just like India and Pakistan are both like,

02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:42.820
whoa, you know, we've got to kind of keep

02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:44.940
our strategic nuclear balance here.

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:46.540
Everything is up for question.

02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:48.180
Saudis will want a nuclear weapon.

02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:49.220
The Turks already want one.

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:50.820
They've talked about one for years.

02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:52.460
You know, why should the Iranians be the only one

02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:54.700
with an Islamic nuclear weapon?

02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:56.900
You know, and if we know that, you know,

02:56:56.900 --> 02:57:00.540
Iran has breakout capacity now,

02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:02.860
the Saudis and all the other, you know,

02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:04.780
states that are in opposition to Iran

02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:06.780
will also want to have some nuclear capacity.

02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:08.580
And the United States before wanted to maintain

02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:10.060
everything under the nuclear umbrella.

02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:11.820
You know, one of the reasons why Sweden and Finland

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:13.580
are joining there too is because of suddenly

02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:15.460
all of these nuclear threats.

02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:17.620
Sweden was actually the last country on the planet

02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:18.660
to want to have nuclear weapons.

02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:20.180
They were actually pushing for a ban

02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:21.700
on nuclear weapons in the United Nations.

02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:25.300
Now that Putin's doing the nuclear saber rattling,

02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:27.260
you know, they're talking about joining

02:57:27.260 --> 02:57:31.260
and on the verge of joining a nuclear alliance.

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:33.060
You know, see what's happening here.

02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:36.100
So we have to make it more and more difficult

02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:37.500
for Putin to even contemplate that.

02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:39.460
That's why people are saying this is reckless.

02:57:39.460 --> 02:57:40.860
This is irresponsible.

02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:42.900
Putin is actually making the world less safe

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.500
for himself down the line either,

02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:46.460
but he's thinking short-term here.

02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.780
He's thinking, what can I do?

02:57:47.780 --> 02:57:49.380
What do I actually have?

02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:52.460
You can also destroy lots of infrastructure as he's doing.

02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:53.580
You can use subversion.

02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:55.620
You know, we're worried about all of the undersea cables,

02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:57.180
all these weird things happening, you know,

02:57:57.180 --> 02:58:00.300
off Orkney or in the Mediterranean or, you know,

02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:01.820
all these other things that are happening,

02:58:01.820 --> 02:58:04.580
Nord Stream 2 pipelines, other infrastructure.

02:58:04.580 --> 02:58:05.580
There's all kinds of other things

02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:07.100
that you can do as well here.

02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:09.300
It's not just, you know, again,

02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:10.780
this is civilian nuclear threat

02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:14.220
of blowing up, you know, one of the reactors.

02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:16.540
Now it's got to be sure about where the wind turns

02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:18.300
and the wind blows.

02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:21.340
And there's all kinds of things to factor in here,

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:23.900
but Putin is definitely sitting around

02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:25.300
calculating with other people,

02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:28.140
what can I do to turn this around?

02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:31.300
I mean, he still thinks that he can win this.

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:35.620
Or in other words, he can end it on his terms,

02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:39.380
Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Herson, Zaporizhzhia.

02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:42.980
And, you know, capitulation

02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:45.260
or recognized as being part of Russia.

02:58:46.140 --> 02:58:49.340
Oh, he can freeze it and then, you know,

02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:51.500
kind of figure out where it goes from there,

02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:52.980
what other pressure he can put on.

02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:54.180
I mean, I'm sure he's confident

02:58:54.180 --> 02:58:56.060
he can get rid of Zelensky

02:58:56.060 --> 02:58:57.620
and he can prevail over us.

02:58:57.620 --> 02:59:00.140
I mean, look, I mean, the UK is going through prime ministers,

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:02.780
you know, faster than I'm changing my socks, you know.

02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:07.020
So it's like, you know, he can prevail on the,

02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:10.620
you know, basically he can have an impact

02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:13.660
on the political scene in Europe and elsewhere.

02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:14.980
I mean, again, everyone's talking

02:59:14.980 --> 02:59:17.500
about winter coming and I know Putin's thinking,

02:59:17.500 --> 02:59:18.540
yeah, great, I've, you know,

02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:21.780
destroyed the infrastructure of Ukraine.

02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:23.580
Are you worried about the winter?

02:59:23.580 --> 02:59:24.700
Well, yeah, but I mean, look,

02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:27.020
the other thing is that we have to start preparing.

02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:28.940
I mean, we have to start thinking about this.

02:59:28.940 --> 02:59:32.060
We've got a wartime economy situation.

02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:33.100
That's where we are.

02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:34.940
We've got the home front to think about as well.

02:59:34.940 --> 02:59:36.940
Putin has declared war on us.

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:38.500
He did that on September 30th

02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:40.260
and he's done it at other points as well.

02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:42.580
We've just not paid attention.

02:59:42.580 --> 02:59:44.820
But he was pretty explicit in September 30th.

02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:47.780
I mean, go back and watch that speech.

02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:50.940
And, you know, he is gambling that, you know,

02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:52.780
people will go back, you know,

02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:55.340
to basically taking Russian gas and oil,

02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:58.020
but it's not gonna be that simple as well.

02:59:58.020 --> 02:59:59.980
And do people, and then, you know,

02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:00.820
the question has to be,

03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:03.540
do we really kind of think he's gonna play fair after that

03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:06.540
when he's kind of also shown that he can leverage that?

03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:09.180
It's such a complicated world.

03:00:09.180 --> 03:00:10.140
It is complicated.

03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:10.980
It's very complicated.

03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:11.980
And it's never, I mean, this,

03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:15.620
it feels like things are heating up, like,

03:00:16.820 --> 03:00:21.220
and China is very quiet right now.

03:00:21.220 --> 03:00:22.740
Because they're watching what happens.

03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:24.260
I mean, for President Xi,

03:00:25.580 --> 03:00:28.220
you know, he's trying to consolidate his power

03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:29.900
even further after the party Congress,

03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:32.300
but he doesn't wanna look like he made a mistake

03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:34.220
by backing Putin.

03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:36.820
I mean, he thought Putin was also gonna be in out

03:00:36.820 --> 03:00:39.820
and Ukraine would probably be open

03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:41.460
for massive Chinese investment.

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:46.460
China was the largest investor in Ukraine before the war.

03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:47.620
Largest single investor.

03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:49.260
I mean, the EU was bigger, of course.

03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:51.820
How do you hope the war ends in Ukraine?

03:00:52.900 --> 03:00:56.820
Well, I mean, I do hope it ends, you know,

03:00:56.820 --> 03:00:59.180
with a ceasefire and a negotiated solution,

03:00:59.180 --> 03:01:02.140
but it has to be with Russia compromising on something.

03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:03.620
And that's not where we are right now.

03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:08.100
Do you think both sides might be willing to compromise?

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:10.460
Most wars always end in that way.

03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:11.780
I mean, nobody's ever happy.

03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:14.220
But they don't seem to, either side,

03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:17.860
like, legitimately doesn't wanna compromise right now.

03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:20.380
Yeah, because, I mean, look, the thing is that

03:01:20.380 --> 03:01:22.500
for Ukraine right now,

03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.020
anything is a compromise at its expense, right?

03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:29.820
Vast devastation, unbelievable casualty rates,

03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:33.620
biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:34.460
Russia's just said,

03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:36.660
sorry, this is our territory, it's not just Crimea.

03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:39.380
I think there could have been a negotiation over there.

03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:40.900
But, you know, Donetsk and Lukhansk,

03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:42.860
I mean, we've got all kinds of formulas we've had

03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:45.580
all the way through history of, you know,

03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:47.460
putting things under a kind of guardianship,

03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:49.580
receivership of territory, the United Nations,

03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:51.740
all kinds of different ways of formulating that.

03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:53.380
We could have easily been creative.

03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:54.220
But Russia's basically saying,

03:01:54.220 --> 03:01:55.940
nope, sorry, we've taken this.

03:01:55.940 --> 03:01:59.020
And any other negotiations, just you recognizing this

03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:01.260
for us not doing more destruction.

03:02:01.260 --> 03:02:04.540
I mean, that is not the basis for a negotiation.

03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.260
And, you know, having, you know, kind of people come

03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:07.700
and just sort of laying those terms down

03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:10.260
is not a starting position.

03:02:10.260 --> 03:02:14.020
I think Russia is also, you know,

03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:16.420
in a dilemma of its own making now

03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:18.460
because Putin has made it very difficult, you know,

03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:21.500
to compromise just by everything that he's said.

03:02:21.500 --> 03:02:25.580
Now for Ukraine, they've already won a great moral,

03:02:25.580 --> 03:02:27.820
political and military victory.

03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:31.180
It's just hard to see it, right, at the particular moment.

03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:34.020
They've done what the Finns did in the Winter War,

03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:36.020
which the Finns were devastated by the Winter War as well,

03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:37.740
they pushed them back.

03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:39.140
Now the Finns lost a lot of territory,

03:02:39.140 --> 03:02:42.020
they lost Karelia and, you know, huge spheres of territory,

03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:44.980
but they got to be Finland.

03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:47.300
And now they're, you know, joining NATO,

03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:49.100
but they've been part of the EU.

03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:51.820
The question is how to, you know,

03:02:51.820 --> 03:02:55.980
get Ukraine to be Ukrainian a success.

03:02:55.980 --> 03:02:58.300
But, you know, is, and that's the challenge.

03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.460
Now, again, they've already won,

03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:02.820
psychologically, politically, militarily,

03:03:02.860 --> 03:03:06.180
because Putin hasn't succeeded in what he wanted to do,

03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:08.180
but he has succeeded in completely and utterly

03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:09.340
devastating them.

03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:12.260
And this is the kind of the old Muscovite,

03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:14.700
the old Russian Imperial, old Soviet mentality,

03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:17.860
you know, going all the way back to when the Muscovites

03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:20.740
were the bag men for the, you know, the Horde,

03:03:20.740 --> 03:03:21.620
for the Mongols.

03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:22.660
It was destruction.

03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:25.900
You know, you don't play with us, we'll destroy you.

03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:28.180
You know, people talk about it as mafia, but it's all,

03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:29.460
you know, all you have to go down,

03:03:29.460 --> 03:03:32.540
is you go and see Tarkovsky's Andrey Rublyov.

03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:33.460
I mean, I remember, you know,

03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:35.780
seeing that film when I was first as a student in Moscow

03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:38.460
and just being, whoa, this is so brutal.

03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:42.540
I mean, this is just unremittingly brutal

03:03:42.540 --> 03:03:46.660
because the whole point is that you show people

03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:48.140
who's the boss.

03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:50.860
The destruction is the point of things as well,

03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:55.860
because, you know, you are emphasizing your domination.

03:03:57.260 --> 03:03:59.020
And that's what Putin is doing right now,

03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:02.620
is saying, okay, you want to go in a different direction,

03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:05.180
so be it, but I'm going to make you suffer.

03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:09.660
Remember when Tarkovsky got out of the penal colony,

03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:11.500
when Putin let him out eventually,

03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.100
he said he suffered enough,

03:04:14.220 --> 03:04:16.340
but he suffered for 10, 11 years.

03:04:17.940 --> 03:04:19.820
I don't think Putin feels that Ukraine

03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:21.260
has suffered enough at this point,

03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:22.100
or we have suffered enough.

03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:24.860
So there's a part of this invasion

03:04:24.860 --> 03:04:27.140
that's punishment for something.

03:04:27.140 --> 03:04:28.420
Yeah, it's medieval.

03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:31.500
I mean, look, we're all capable of the same things, right?

03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.620
There was all that destruction,

03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:36.740
and that's what Assad was like in Syria, like his father.

03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:39.620
You destroy because you teach them a lesson.

03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:41.740
And look, Britain did that in the colonial era.

03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:43.820
I mean, all the history of British colonialism

03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:45.460
is exactly the same.

03:04:45.460 --> 03:04:47.540
I mean, all the Mao Mao, you know, in Kenya,

03:04:47.540 --> 03:04:50.780
you know, up until recent times, brutality.

03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:53.500
Teaching people, you know, teaching them a lesson,

03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:54.780
you have to suffer.

03:04:54.780 --> 03:04:57.020
The US did it, I mean, we did it with the Native Americans,

03:04:57.180 --> 03:04:59.300
we did it all over the place, you know, as well.

03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:02.020
This is kind of what big states do

03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:04.420
at different points in history,

03:05:04.420 --> 03:05:07.420
just that Russia has not moved on from that.

03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:08.780
I mean, we've learned some lessons later.

03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:10.700
I hope we've fully internalized them

03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:12.380
of things that we've done,

03:05:12.380 --> 03:05:14.780
you know, kind of the past United States,

03:05:14.780 --> 03:05:16.100
ideally are trying to do better,

03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:17.900
and most of Europe's trying to do better as well.

03:05:17.900 --> 03:05:20.620
Think about France and Algeria, you know, again,

03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:23.540
we can see this in many different settings.

03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:25.580
But I think, you know, for Putin right now,

03:05:25.620 --> 03:05:28.180
he hasn't taught all of us sufficient a lesson.

03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:32.420
I just, I talked to hundreds of people in Ukraine,

03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:35.620
and the tough thing,

03:05:36.700 --> 03:05:38.620
the inspiring thing is that there's a unity.

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:43.620
The tough thing is a lot of them speak intensely of hate

03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:46.980
towards not just Russia, but Russians.

03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:47.820
Russians.

03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:50.300
That's how Europeans felt about Germany and Germans

03:05:50.300 --> 03:05:51.620
at the end of World War II.

03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:55.340
And generational hate.

03:05:55.340 --> 03:05:59.180
Like, I don't think that hate is gonna pass.

03:05:59.180 --> 03:06:01.100
Well, it might well take a generation.

03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:04.260
I mean, when I was a kid in the 70s,

03:06:04.260 --> 03:06:06.940
I went on exchanges to Germany,

03:06:06.940 --> 03:06:09.340
and that was like, you know, 30 years,

03:06:09.340 --> 03:06:10.940
more than 30 years after the end of the war.

03:06:10.940 --> 03:06:14.060
My grandfather, who'd fought in World War I,

03:06:14.060 --> 03:06:17.220
wouldn't speak to my parents when they sent me on a,

03:06:17.220 --> 03:06:18.220
I mean, he hadn't fought in World War II,

03:06:18.220 --> 03:06:20.700
he fought in World War I, and he hated the Germans.

03:06:21.580 --> 03:06:24.660
And he did not want me going to Germany as an exchange student.

03:06:24.660 --> 03:06:27.420
He refused to meet kind of the German kid

03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:30.940
who came to stay at my house, for example.

03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:35.380
I mean, it takes a long time to get over that.

03:06:35.380 --> 03:06:37.340
But you do, and we have.

03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:40.260
We have in Europe, and that was the whole point

03:06:40.260 --> 03:06:44.300
of all of that kind of exercise of European unity

03:06:44.300 --> 03:06:45.500
after World War II.

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:48.500
Now, the big challenge is, what do we do with Russia?

03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:49.340
Because a lot of people are talking

03:06:49.340 --> 03:06:51.140
that we can't have European security without Russia.

03:06:51.140 --> 03:06:53.580
Other people are saying we can't have a Europe,

03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:56.020
you know, kind of with Russia.

03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:57.900
You know, so how do we deal with this?

03:06:57.900 --> 03:06:59.980
We've got to basically kind of,

03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:03.540
it's gonna be like Japan and Germany after World War II,

03:07:03.540 --> 03:07:06.340
after this, just the level of the atrocities

03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:07.340
that have been carried out.

03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:08.980
As you said, the level of hatred.

03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:12.140
But we found a way of doing it.

03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:16.020
Now, a lot of it will require change

03:07:16.020 --> 03:07:18.220
on the part of Russia as well, and Russians,

03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:19.140
and really thinking about this.

03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:23.140
I mean, Gorbachev before tried to do, in the late 1980s,

03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:26.540
with the black spots in, with glasnost,

03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:29.700
with openness and talking about Russian history,

03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:32.380
just kind of never sort of withered on the vine

03:07:32.380 --> 03:07:33.380
as time went on.

03:07:35.220 --> 03:07:38.380
What gives you hope about the future?

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:39.700
Well, my hope comes into the fact

03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:40.940
that we've done things before,

03:07:40.940 --> 03:07:42.500
that we've got ourselves out of tough times,

03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:45.180
and we've overcome stuff, and in people,

03:07:45.180 --> 03:07:46.900
because I meet amazing people.

03:07:46.900 --> 03:07:48.420
You just talked about hundreds of people

03:07:48.420 --> 03:07:50.780
that you've met within Ukraine.

03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:53.100
And people all think differently.

03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:56.340
Contexts and circumstances change, and people can evolve.

03:07:56.340 --> 03:07:58.940
Some people get stuck, Putin's got stuck,

03:07:58.940 --> 03:08:01.060
but people can evolve.

03:08:01.060 --> 03:08:04.780
And I do think that if we all pull together,

03:08:04.780 --> 03:08:06.620
and we've seen this in so many contexts,

03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:08.340
we can find solutions to things,

03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:10.060
just like we get back again to our discussion

03:08:10.060 --> 03:08:12.820
about scientists and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs

03:08:12.820 --> 03:08:17.820
of what we did on COVID or done on kind of other,

03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:19.340
diseases and things.

03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:22.140
And look, there is some similarities

03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:25.020
as the pathology around war and conflict.

03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:29.740
Years ago in the 1990s, I worked on a lot of projects

03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:31.940
that were funded by the Carnegie Corporation

03:08:31.940 --> 03:08:34.740
of the United States under the then presidency

03:08:34.740 --> 03:08:36.900
of David Hamburg, who was a scientist,

03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:38.740
and actually did see a lot of parallels

03:08:38.740 --> 03:08:40.780
between the sort of like the pathology of disease

03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:45.780
and kind of the pestilence of conflict kind of idea.

03:08:46.660 --> 03:08:48.980
And of course, these parallels had to be very careful

03:08:48.980 --> 03:08:50.540
because they're not neat,

03:08:50.540 --> 03:08:52.140
but there was kind of like an idea in there

03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:53.420
and how do you sort of treat this?

03:08:53.420 --> 03:08:55.340
How do you deal with this?

03:08:55.340 --> 03:08:58.020
And we did come up with all kinds of ideas

03:08:58.020 --> 03:09:00.500
and things that are still out there.

03:09:00.500 --> 03:09:02.940
We've created institutions that have helped to keep the peace.

03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:05.380
We just have neglected them,

03:09:05.380 --> 03:09:08.460
allowed them to degrade just like the United Nations.

03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:12.380
And we've created problems inside of them,

03:09:12.380 --> 03:09:14.940
like the veto power of the permanent powers

03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:19.540
on the UN Security Council, but we can change that.

03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:20.620
You're just gonna have a will.

03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:21.940
And I do think out there,

03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:23.820
there are sufficient people with a will

03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:25.620
and we've just got to get people mobilized.

03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:27.100
I mean, I'm always amazed by how people

03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:29.580
can mobilize themselves around a crisis.

03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:31.900
Remember Winston Churchill, I don't quote all the time

03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:33.540
because I can never remember half his quotes,

03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:34.820
but I do remember the one about

03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:37.300
never let a good crisis go to waste.

03:09:37.300 --> 03:09:38.900
And I always think that that, you know,

03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:43.620
yeah, we shouldn't let this crisis go to waste

03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:45.180
and something else can come out of this.

03:09:45.180 --> 03:09:46.900
Just like in Ukraine, we've worried before

03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:50.740
about corruption in Ukraine, the influence of the oligarchs.

03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:52.340
We've got to run oligarchs here in the US

03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:54.140
we need to deal with as well.

03:09:54.140 --> 03:09:56.980
But this is a chance to do it differently.

03:09:56.980 --> 03:09:59.020
Yeah, it really is a chance to do things differently.

03:09:59.020 --> 03:10:00.860
And a part of that is young people.

03:10:00.860 --> 03:10:02.100
I have to ask you.

03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:02.940
It is young people.

03:10:02.940 --> 03:10:04.500
I mean, I'm feeling a bit on the older side now,

03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:06.900
but I still feel I've got a bit of kind of youth

03:10:06.900 --> 03:10:10.220
within me at 57, I'm not that old, but I'm not that young.

03:10:10.220 --> 03:10:12.740
But we have to work together with younger and older people.

03:10:12.980 --> 03:10:14.580
We've got to work together in coalitions

03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:16.620
of, you know, across generations.

03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:20.340
You remind me of kids who just graduated college

03:10:20.340 --> 03:10:23.700
and say, I feel old.

03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:24.860
So yeah, no.

03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:27.300
I don't actually feel old, but it is a number, age.

03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:29.580
And you know, when you kind of think about, when I was-

03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:30.820
I thought you don't like math.

03:10:30.820 --> 03:10:32.660
Yeah, yeah, I know what it's like and things like that.

03:10:32.660 --> 03:10:34.260
Yeah, but I find it interesting.

03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:35.740
But you know, when I was, I remember when I was a little kid,

03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:37.780
I kept thinking about the year 2000 and I thought,

03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:40.060
oh my God, I'll be dead, I'll be 35.

03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:42.740
22 years ago.

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:46.780
You've overcome a lot of struggle in your life

03:10:47.820 --> 03:10:50.140
based on different reasons as you write about.

03:10:52.060 --> 03:10:54.580
Class being one of them,

03:10:54.580 --> 03:10:57.380
your funny sounding accent being another,

03:10:57.380 --> 03:10:59.380
or just representation of class.

03:11:00.300 --> 03:11:03.500
But in general, through all of that,

03:11:03.500 --> 03:11:06.260
to be at the White House,

03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:11.140
to be one of the most powerful voices in the world,

03:11:11.140 --> 03:11:14.740
what advice would you give from grounded in your life story

03:11:14.740 --> 03:11:16.020
to somebody who's young,

03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:18.300
somebody who's in high school and college,

03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:21.380
thinking of how they can have a big positive impact

03:11:21.380 --> 03:11:22.220
on the world?

03:11:22.220 --> 03:11:24.300
Look, we all have a voice, right?

03:11:24.300 --> 03:11:25.780
We all have agency.

03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:28.260
We all actually have the ability to do something.

03:11:28.260 --> 03:11:30.980
And you can start small in your local community

03:11:30.980 --> 03:11:32.380
or even in your own classroom,

03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:34.140
just helping somebody else out

03:11:34.140 --> 03:11:36.980
or speaking up and advocating on behalf of things.

03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:40.100
When I was about 11 years old,

03:11:40.100 --> 03:11:42.980
I got involved with other kids on Save the Wales.

03:11:42.980 --> 03:11:46.020
We had all this kind of, we were hardly Greta Sundberg,

03:11:46.020 --> 03:11:48.140
but we kind of got together in a kind of network

03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:50.580
writing to people and trying to raise money

03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:52.340
to help save the Wales.

03:11:52.340 --> 03:11:54.580
Now actually the Wales of the world

03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:55.700
are doing somewhat better.

03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:58.340
I can't say that that was because of me and my network,

03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.980
but it was kind of a way of organizing

03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:03.980
and kind of joining in in a larger movement.

03:12:03.980 --> 03:12:06.860
Everybody can be part of something bigger.

03:12:06.860 --> 03:12:09.340
The thing is, it's all about working together with others

03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:11.380
and giving other people a chance as well.

03:12:11.380 --> 03:12:16.100
I think one thing is that our voices have more impact

03:12:16.100 --> 03:12:17.260
when they're amplified.

03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:19.220
They don't have to be the voices of discord

03:12:19.220 --> 03:12:20.580
or the voices of hate.

03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:24.620
You've been trying to do this with your podcasts,

03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:28.020
kind of give people a voice, give them a kind of platform

03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:30.940
and get them to join in with other people.

03:12:30.940 --> 03:12:32.900
And one of the things that I've been trying to do

03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:35.660
is kind of go and talk to just as many people

03:12:35.660 --> 03:12:36.900
as I possibly can and say,

03:12:36.900 --> 03:12:39.420
look, we can all do something here.

03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:41.900
We can all lend our voices to a cause

03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:43.100
that we care deeply about.

03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:44.700
We can be kind to each other.

03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.220
We can give other people a chance.

03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:47.380
We can kind of speak out

03:12:47.380 --> 03:12:49.020
while we see that something is wrong.

03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:51.980
And we can try to explain things to people.

03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:53.900
And what I'm trying to do at the moment

03:12:53.900 --> 03:12:56.460
is just sort of explain what I've learned about things

03:12:56.460 --> 03:13:00.180
and hope that that helps people make informed judgments

03:13:00.180 --> 03:13:02.700
of their own and that kind of maybe take things further

03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:03.860
and learn something more.

03:13:03.860 --> 03:13:06.780
It's like kind of building up on the knowledge

03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:09.740
that I have to try to impart.

03:13:09.740 --> 03:13:11.860
Well, isn't everybody can do that different ways.

03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:13.420
You can kind of reach back.

03:13:13.420 --> 03:13:15.380
If you're 14, help somebody who's seven.

03:13:15.380 --> 03:13:17.420
If you're 21, help somebody who's 14.

03:13:19.820 --> 03:13:22.620
My age now, I'm always trying to reach back

03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:26.340
and work with younger people, listen to younger people,

03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:29.460
help them out, make connections for them,

03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:31.100
listen to what they have to say about something,

03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:34.140
try to incorporate that in things that I'm saying as well.

03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:35.740
The main point is that we've all got a voice.

03:13:35.740 --> 03:13:37.500
We've all got agency.

03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:38.700
And it always works better

03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:40.500
when we work together with other people.

03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:43.100
But sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless.

03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:45.860
It can feel, I mean, there's low points.

03:13:45.860 --> 03:13:50.860
You seem to have a kind of restless energy,

03:13:50.860 --> 03:13:52.500
a drive to you.

03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:54.860
Were there low points in the beginning

03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:59.380
when in your early days,

03:13:59.380 --> 03:14:01.220
when you're trying to get the education

03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:04.100
where it may have not been clear to you

03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:06.260
that you could be at all successful?

03:14:06.260 --> 03:14:07.980
Yeah, there always were.

03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:10.820
I mean, there were lots of points where I was just despondent.

03:14:10.820 --> 03:14:13.660
But then, I'd meet somebody

03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:15.460
who would just suddenly turn things around.

03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:18.060
Now, was this luck or was I out there looking for it?

03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:21.460
Sometimes, if you're open and receptive

03:14:21.460 --> 03:14:24.700
to kind of hearing something from someone else.

03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:27.740
I mean, there are often times where I felt so despondent,

03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:28.700
in such a black mood,

03:14:28.740 --> 03:14:29.900
that I didn't think I'd be able to go on.

03:14:29.900 --> 03:14:32.860
And then I'd have a chance conversation with somebody.

03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:34.660
I mean, I once remember, I was sitting on a bench,

03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:36.660
I was probably 11 or 12, just crying my eyes out,

03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:37.500
just really upset.

03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:39.740
And an old lady just came and sat next to me,

03:14:39.740 --> 03:14:40.740
put her arm around me, said,

03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:42.140
oh, it's all right, pet.

03:14:42.140 --> 03:14:43.460
What's the matter?

03:14:43.460 --> 03:14:44.620
It can't be that bad, can it?

03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:47.300
And it was just this human embrace.

03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:51.020
It's like somebody just basically reaching out to me

03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:52.940
that snapped me out of it.

03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:54.540
And I thought, here's somebody just,

03:14:54.540 --> 03:14:55.380
she didn't know who I was.

03:14:55.380 --> 03:14:57.420
She just felt really bad that I was

03:14:57.420 --> 03:14:58.940
sitting crying.

03:14:58.940 --> 03:15:01.780
And I mean, I can't even remember what it was about anymore.

03:15:01.780 --> 03:15:03.820
Now it just seems inconsequential at the time.

03:15:03.820 --> 03:15:05.700
I probably thought my life was at an end.

03:15:05.700 --> 03:15:07.860
Just sometimes people making out contact

03:15:07.860 --> 03:15:10.180
with you in the street and saying something to you

03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:12.660
can kind of pull you out of something.

03:15:12.660 --> 03:15:14.820
And it's kind of a,

03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:16.940
I think you would just have to open yourself up

03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:18.580
to the prospect that not everyone's bad,

03:15:18.580 --> 03:15:19.660
just like you were saying before,

03:15:19.660 --> 03:15:21.940
that there's good in everybody,

03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:25.860
even during that really difficult period of impeachment.

03:15:25.940 --> 03:15:28.340
I was trying to listen very carefully to people.

03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:29.940
And I thought, look, we always,

03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:32.100
we still have something in common here.

03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:34.100
We need to remember that.

03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:35.780
You know, kind of when people are kind of forgetting

03:15:35.780 --> 03:15:39.580
who they are or, you know, the context in their operating,

03:15:39.580 --> 03:15:41.740
there's always something that can, you know,

03:15:41.740 --> 03:15:42.700
can pull you back again.

03:15:42.700 --> 03:15:44.340
There's always that kind of thread.

03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:49.340
So I'm sure you were probably attacked by a lot of people

03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:54.020
and you were still able to keep that optimism that-

03:15:54.020 --> 03:15:55.500
Well, I kept it into kind of perspective.

03:15:55.580 --> 03:15:56.740
When I was a kid, I mean,

03:15:56.740 --> 03:15:59.300
things I mentioned before, I got bullied, you know, kind of.

03:15:59.300 --> 03:16:02.620
Again, and I tried to understand why they're doing this.

03:16:02.620 --> 03:16:05.740
One of the most amazing things that happened,

03:16:05.740 --> 03:16:08.500
you know, really on was my dad was a pretty incredible person

03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:10.460
and he would always open my eyes to something.

03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:13.820
I was getting bullied really nastily by a girl at school.

03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:16.580
And my dad started asking me questions about her.

03:16:16.580 --> 03:16:20.860
And one day my dad's going to go for a walk.

03:16:20.860 --> 03:16:22.140
And my town's very small.

03:16:22.140 --> 03:16:23.620
Remember, it's very depressed, really, you know,

03:16:23.620 --> 03:16:24.860
a deprived area.

03:16:24.860 --> 03:16:28.180
And we go to this housing estate, public housing place

03:16:28.180 --> 03:16:29.740
that's not too far away from where I live.

03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:30.740
And it's really, you know,

03:16:30.740 --> 03:16:32.460
kind of one of the most rundown places

03:16:32.460 --> 03:16:34.380
and an already rundown place.

03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:35.900
My dad like knocks on the door and I said,

03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:36.980
what are we doing, dad?

03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:39.060
And he says, we're going off to, you know,

03:16:39.060 --> 03:16:42.060
we're going to visit somebody, an old family friend.

03:16:42.060 --> 03:16:44.260
I think they were even, you know, a distant relative.

03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:45.900
Knock on the door, this old man answers the door

03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:47.300
and he says, oh, Alfie.

03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:48.820
My dad's name is Alf Alfie.

03:16:48.820 --> 03:16:50.780
You know, kind of, oh, fancy seeing you here.

03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:51.620
Haven't seen you.

03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:52.580
Come on in, have a cup of tea.

03:16:52.580 --> 03:16:53.420
What are you doing?

03:16:53.420 --> 03:16:54.620
He said, oh, I'm just walking past my daughter.

03:16:54.620 --> 03:16:55.820
We're going for a trip.

03:16:55.820 --> 03:16:57.420
Now we're going for a walk.

03:16:57.420 --> 03:17:00.900
And then suddenly I see that girl and she's in the kitchen.

03:17:00.900 --> 03:17:03.740
And I'm thinking, oh my God, bloody hell.

03:17:03.740 --> 03:17:04.860
You know, British expression.

03:17:04.860 --> 03:17:05.860
What's this?

03:17:05.860 --> 03:17:09.340
And it turns out that dad had figured out who she was

03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:11.020
and he knew her grandfather

03:17:11.020 --> 03:17:12.380
and she was living with her grandfather

03:17:12.380 --> 03:17:14.220
and she'd been abandoned by her parents

03:17:14.220 --> 03:17:16.940
and she was living in, you know, pretty dire circumstances

03:17:16.940 --> 03:17:18.740
and she'd been getting raised by her grandfather

03:17:18.740 --> 03:17:20.540
and she was just miserable.

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:21.780
And the reason she was bullying me

03:17:21.780 --> 03:17:24.100
was to make herself feel better.

03:17:24.100 --> 03:17:25.700
And after that, she never bullied me again.

03:17:25.700 --> 03:17:27.020
I mean, we didn't even talk

03:17:27.980 --> 03:17:29.460
because there was a connection made.

03:17:29.460 --> 03:17:31.660
And suddenly she realized that her grandfather,

03:17:31.660 --> 03:17:33.660
who was the only person she had,

03:17:33.660 --> 03:17:35.380
knew my dad and there was some,

03:17:35.380 --> 03:17:37.380
they were friends or they were even family.

03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:39.700
Some, you know, kind of relationship there.

03:17:39.700 --> 03:17:41.740
I mean, I was related to half of North of England.

03:17:41.740 --> 03:17:43.140
I had no idea how we were related.

03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:44.580
You know, everybody was some relative

03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:45.940
because people have lived there for generations

03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:47.740
to get in this very small area.

03:17:47.740 --> 03:17:49.020
And that turned things around.

03:17:49.020 --> 03:17:50.940
So just remember, you might have,

03:17:50.940 --> 03:17:52.300
and that's kind of suddenly taught to me,

03:17:52.300 --> 03:17:54.660
there's always a reason why somebody's doing something.

03:17:54.660 --> 03:17:56.780
A lot of the times they're really unhappy with themselves.

03:17:56.780 --> 03:17:58.820
Sometimes there's something else going on in their lives.

03:17:58.820 --> 03:18:00.980
Sometimes they just don't know any better.

03:18:00.980 --> 03:18:03.140
And I shouldn't take it personally

03:18:03.140 --> 03:18:04.460
because I don't have a personal connection

03:18:04.460 --> 03:18:05.860
with half these people who are out there

03:18:05.860 --> 03:18:08.580
saying that they want this and that to happen to me.

03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:10.860
Well, thank you for the kindness and the empathy

03:18:10.860 --> 03:18:12.060
you still carry in your heart.

03:18:12.060 --> 03:18:14.180
I can see it through all that you must have gone through

03:18:14.180 --> 03:18:16.620
in the recent couple of years.

03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:18.100
It's really inspiring to see that.

03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:20.700
And thank you for everything you've done,

03:18:20.700 --> 03:18:21.900
for the work you've written,

03:18:22.500 --> 03:18:25.260
for the work you continue to write and to do.

03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:27.780
This seems like a really, really difficult time

03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:29.860
for human civilization on a topic

03:18:29.860 --> 03:18:31.900
that you're a world expert in.

03:18:31.900 --> 03:18:34.020
So don't mess it up.

03:18:34.020 --> 03:18:34.860
No, I know, but that's how I said,

03:18:34.860 --> 03:18:35.700
do everybody have that?

03:18:35.700 --> 03:18:37.420
Let's just keep it together, right?

03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:39.340
Yeah, exactly.

03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:40.260
Let's just keep it together.

03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:42.420
Your words have a lot of power right now.

03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:45.420
So it's a really, really tricky time.

03:18:45.420 --> 03:18:46.820
So thank you so much.

03:18:46.820 --> 03:18:49.460
Given how valuable your time is to sit down with me today,

03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:50.300
it was an honor.

03:18:50.460 --> 03:18:53.380
It's a privilege and a pleasure to talk to you as well.

03:18:53.380 --> 03:18:54.780
Thank you.

03:18:54.780 --> 03:18:57.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Fiona Hill.

03:18:57.300 --> 03:18:58.540
To support this podcast,

03:19:01.460 --> 03:19:03.140
And now let me leave you with some words

03:19:03.140 --> 03:19:05.060
from John Steinbeck.

03:19:05.060 --> 03:19:07.140
Power does not corrupt.

03:19:07.140 --> 03:19:08.700
Fear corrupts.

03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:11.820
Perhaps the fear of the loss of power.

03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:14.140
Thank you for listening.

03:19:14.140 --> 03:19:16.060
I hope to see you next time.

03:19:20.300 --> 03:19:21.140
Thank you.
