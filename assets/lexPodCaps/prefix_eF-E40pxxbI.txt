00:00.000 --> 00:03.780
evolutionarily, we, you know, if we see a lion running at us, we didn't have time to

00:03.780 --> 00:08.520
sort of calculate the lion's kinetic energy and, you know, is it optimal to go this way

00:08.520 --> 00:13.860
or that way? You just reacted. And physically, our bodies are well attuned to actually make

00:13.860 --> 00:17.520
right decisions. But when you're playing a game like poker, this is not something that

00:17.520 --> 00:22.760
you ever, you know, evolved to do. And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.960
And so that's a really important skill to be able to develop to basically learn how

00:25.960 --> 00:30.000
to like meditate in the moment and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.680
The following is a conversation with Liv Buree, formerly one of the best poker players in the

00:37.680 --> 00:44.880
world, trained as a natural physicist and is now a philanthropist and an educator on topics of

00:44.880 --> 00:51.640
game theory, physics, complexity, and life. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it,

00:51.800 --> 00:57.360
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Liv Buree.

00:57.360 --> 01:04.200
What role do you think luck plays in poker and in life? You can pick whichever one you want,

01:04.200 --> 01:10.880
poker or life and or life. The longer you play, the less influence luck has, you know,

01:10.880 --> 01:15.640
like with all things, the bigger your sample size, the more the quality of your decisions

01:15.640 --> 01:22.360
or your strategies matter. So to answer that question, yeah, in poker, it really depends.

01:22.360 --> 01:30.320
If you and I sat and played 10 hands right now, I might only win 52% of the time, 53% maybe. But

01:30.320 --> 01:36.520
if we played 10,000 hands, then I'll probably win like over 98, 99% of the time. So it's a

01:36.520 --> 01:40.920
question of sample sizes. And what are you figuring out over time, the betting strategy

01:40.920 --> 01:45.160
that this individual does or literally doesn't matter against any individual over time?

01:45.800 --> 01:49.400
Against any individual over time, the better player, because they're making better decisions.

01:49.400 --> 01:54.600
So what does that mean to make a better decision? Well, to get into the real nitty-gritty already.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.760
Basically, poker is a game of math. There are these strategies, familiar with like Nash

02:00.760 --> 02:07.480
equilibria, that term, right? So there are these game theory optimal strategies that you can adopt.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.360
And the closer you play to them, the less exploitable you are. So because I've studied

02:14.360 --> 02:18.760
the game a bunch, although admittedly not for a few years, but back when I was playing all the

02:18.760 --> 02:24.760
time, I would study these game theory optimal solutions and try and then adopt those strategies

02:24.760 --> 02:31.640
when I go and play. So I'd play against you and I would do that. And because the objective,

02:31.640 --> 02:36.120
when you're playing game theory optimal, it's actually a loss minimization thing that you're

02:36.120 --> 02:43.480
trying to do. Your best bet is to try and play a sort of similar style. You also need to try and

02:43.480 --> 02:47.880
adopt this loss minimization. But because I've been playing much longer than you,

02:47.880 --> 02:52.920
I'll be better at that. So first of all, you're not taking advantage of my mistakes.

02:52.920 --> 02:59.400
But then on top of that, I'll be better at recognizing when you are playing suboptimally

02:59.400 --> 03:04.040
and then deviating from this game theory optimal strategy to exploit your bad plays.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.760
Can you define game theory and Nash equilibria? Can we try to sneak up to it in a bunch of ways?

03:11.560 --> 03:15.560
What's the game theory framework of analyzing poker, analyzing any kind of situation?

03:16.120 --> 03:24.600
So game theory is just basically the study of decisions within a competitive situation.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.600
It's technically a branch of economics, but it also applies to wider decision theory.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.200
Usually when you see it, it's these little payoff matrices and so on. That's how it's

03:38.200 --> 03:42.680
depicted. But it's essentially just a study of strategies under different competitive situations.

03:44.520 --> 03:49.960
As it happens, certain games, in fact many, many games, have these things called Nash equilibria.

03:50.600 --> 03:56.840
What that means is when you're in a Nash equilibrium, basically there is no strategy

03:57.480 --> 04:03.000
that you can take that would be more beneficial than the one you're currently taking, assuming

04:03.000 --> 04:07.320
your opponent is also doing the same thing. So it would be a bad idea. If we're both playing

04:07.880 --> 04:12.280
in a game theory optimal strategy, if either of us deviate from that, now

04:14.200 --> 04:17.640
we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage. Rock, paper, scissors is actually a really

04:17.640 --> 04:23.560
great example of this. If we were to start playing rock, paper, scissors, you know nothing about me

04:23.560 --> 04:28.600
and we're going to play for all our money, let's play 10 rounds of it. What would your

04:28.600 --> 04:31.240
sort of optimal strategy be, do you think? What would you do?

04:31.960 --> 04:36.280
Let's see. I would

04:38.920 --> 04:45.240
probably try to be as random as possible. Exactly. You don't know anything about me.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.080
You don't want to give anything away about yourself. So ideally you'd have like a little

04:49.080 --> 04:54.520
dice or somewhat, you know, perfect randomizer that makes you randomize 33% of the time each

04:54.520 --> 04:59.400
of the three different things. And in response to that, well actually I can kind of do anything,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.840
but I would probably just randomize back too. But actually it wouldn't matter because I know

05:02.840 --> 05:08.200
that you're playing randomly. So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium where we're both playing

05:08.200 --> 05:13.960
this like unexploitable strategy. However, if after a while you then notice that I'm playing

05:13.960 --> 05:17.560
rock a little bit more often than I should. Yeah, you're the kind of person that would

05:17.560 --> 05:21.160
do that, wouldn't you? Sure. Yes, yes, yes. I'm more of a scissors girl. But anyway.

05:21.160 --> 05:27.160
You are? No, I'm a, as I said, randomizer. So you notice I'm throwing rock too much or something

05:27.240 --> 05:31.160
like that. Now you'd be making a mistake by continuing playing this game theory optimal

05:31.160 --> 05:38.360
strategy because, well the previous one, because you are now, I'm making a mistake and you're not

05:38.360 --> 05:43.000
deviating and exploiting my mistake. So you'd want to start throwing paper a bit more often

05:43.640 --> 05:47.160
in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage of the time that I'm throwing rock

05:47.160 --> 05:53.160
too often. So that's basically an example of where, you know, what game theory optimal strategy is in

05:53.160 --> 05:58.520
terms of loss minimization, but it's not always the maximally profitable thing if your opponent

05:58.520 --> 06:04.120
is doing stupid stuff, which, you know, in that example. So that's kind of then how it works in

06:04.120 --> 06:11.080
poker, but it's a lot more complex. And the way poker players typically, you know, nowadays they

06:11.080 --> 06:14.600
study, the games change so much. And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved.

06:15.240 --> 06:21.320
But nowadays, like the top pros basically spend all their time in between sessions running these

06:21.320 --> 06:26.520
simulators using like software where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations, sort of doing

06:27.080 --> 06:34.440
billions of fictitious self-play hands. You input a fictitious hand scenario, like, oh,

06:34.440 --> 06:43.080
what do I do with Jack nine suited on a King 10 four to two spade board and, you know, against

06:43.080 --> 06:48.920
this bet size. So you'd input that press play, it'll run it's, you know, it's billions of fake

06:48.920 --> 06:53.640
hands and then it will converge upon what the game theory optimal strategies are. And then you

06:53.640 --> 06:57.560
want to try and memorize what these are. Basically, they're like ratios of how often, you know, what

06:57.560 --> 07:02.600
types of hands you want to bluff and what percentage of the time. So then there's this additional layer

07:02.600 --> 07:06.600
of inbuilt randomization built in. Yeah, those, those kinds of simulations incorporate all the

07:06.600 --> 07:11.080
betting strategies and everything else like that. So they, so as opposed to some kind of very crude

07:11.080 --> 07:15.400
mathematical model of what's the probability you win just based on the quality of the card,

07:16.280 --> 07:22.200
it's including everything else to the game theory of it. Yes. Yeah, essentially. And what's

07:22.200 --> 07:26.200
interesting is that nowadays, if you want to be a top pro and you go and play in these really like

07:26.200 --> 07:30.520
the super high stakes tournaments or tough cash games, if you don't know this stuff,

07:30.520 --> 07:34.600
you're going to get eaten alive in the long run. Yeah. But of course you could get lucky over the

07:34.600 --> 07:39.320
short run. And that's where this like luck factor comes in because luck is both a blessing and a

07:39.320 --> 07:43.720
curse. If luck didn't, you know, if there wasn't this random element and there wasn't the ability

07:43.720 --> 07:49.000
for worst players to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart. You know, the same reason people

07:49.000 --> 07:54.520
don't play chess professionally for money against you. You don't see people going and hustling

07:55.080 --> 07:59.320
chess, like not knowing, trying to make a living from it because you know, there's very little

07:59.320 --> 08:03.960
luck in chess, but there's quite a lot of luck in poker. Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?

08:03.960 --> 08:08.680
Years ago. Well, what do you think about the game theoretic formulation of what is it? The hot

08:08.680 --> 08:14.280
blonde at the bar. Do you remember like the way they illustrated it is they're trying to pick up

08:14.280 --> 08:17.960
a girl at a bar and there's multiple girls. They're like friend. It's like a friend group

08:17.960 --> 08:22.600
and you're trying to approach. I don't remember the details, but I remember. Don't you like then

08:22.600 --> 08:26.920
speak to her friends? Yeah. Yeah. Like that fame disinterest. I mean, it's classic pickup artist.

08:26.920 --> 08:32.680
Yeah. And they were trying to correlate that somehow that being an optimal strategy

08:33.640 --> 08:39.320
is game theoretically. Why? What? What? Like, I don't think I remember. I can't imagine that

08:39.320 --> 08:43.560
they were. I mean, there's probably an optimal strategy. Is it? Does that mean that there's an

08:43.560 --> 08:49.480
actual Nash equilibrium of like picking up girls? Do you know the, the, the marriage problem? It's

08:49.480 --> 08:56.440
optimal stopping. Yes. So where it's an optimal dating strategy where you, uh, do you remember?

08:56.440 --> 08:59.720
Yeah, I think it's like something like, you, you, you know, you've got like a set of a hundred people

08:59.800 --> 09:06.680
you're going to look through. And after how many do you now after that, after going on this many

09:06.680 --> 09:10.680
dates out of a hundred, at what point do you then go, okay, the next best person I see,

09:10.680 --> 09:16.760
is that the right one? And I think it's like something like 37%. Uh, it's one over E whatever

09:16.760 --> 09:26.680
that is. Right. Which I think is. Yeah. We're going to fact check that. Um, yeah. So, but it's funny

09:26.760 --> 09:31.560
under those strict constraints, then yes, after that many people, as long as you have a fixed

09:31.560 --> 09:37.880
size pool, then you just pick the, the, the next person that is better than anyone you've seen

09:37.880 --> 09:43.080
before. Yeah. Um, have you, have you tried this? Have you incorporated it? I'm not one of those

09:43.080 --> 09:50.040
people. Um, and we're, and we're going to discuss this. I, and what do you mean those people? Uh,

09:50.040 --> 09:59.000
I try not to optimize stuff. Um, I try to, uh, listen to the heart. I don't think I'm, uh, I

09:59.000 --> 10:09.320
like my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything. And I think that if, if you really

10:09.320 --> 10:15.880
give into that kind of addiction, that you lose the, the joy of the small things, the minutia of

10:15.880 --> 10:20.680
life, I think, I don't know. I'm concerned about the addictive nature of my personality in that

10:20.680 --> 10:30.040
regard. In some ways, while I think the, on average, people under try and quantify things

10:30.040 --> 10:35.240
or try under optimize, um, there are some people who, you know, it's like with all these things,

10:35.240 --> 10:38.760
it's a, you know, it's a balancing act. I've been on dating apps, but I've never used them.

10:39.640 --> 10:45.080
I, I'm sure they have data on this because they probably have the optimal stopping control problem

10:45.080 --> 10:49.960
because there aren't a lot of people that use social like dating apps are on there for a long

10:49.960 --> 10:55.240
time. So the, the, the interesting, the interesting aspect is like, all right,

10:56.360 --> 11:01.640
how long before you stop looking before it actually starts affecting your mind negatively,

11:01.640 --> 11:11.320
such that you see dating as a kind of, um, a game, a kind of game versus an actual, uh,

11:12.120 --> 11:15.640
process of finding somebody that's going to make you happy for the rest of your life.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.520
That's really interesting. Uh, they have the data. I wish they would be able to release that data.

11:20.520 --> 11:25.160
And I do want to, I think they ran a huge, huge study in all of their,

11:25.160 --> 11:29.320
yeah, they're more data driven. I think people folks are, I think there's a lot of opportunity

11:29.320 --> 11:33.720
for dating apps in general, you know, even bigger than dating apps, people connecting

11:33.720 --> 11:39.240
on the internet. I just hope they're more data driven and it doesn't seem that way.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.480
I think like, um, I've always, I always thought that, um,

11:44.760 --> 11:49.320
Goodreads should be a dating app. I've never used it.

11:49.320 --> 11:56.120
The Goodreads is, uh, Goodreads is just lists like books that you've read and allows you to

11:56.120 --> 11:59.720
comment on the books you read and what the books you're currently reading. But it's a giant social

11:59.720 --> 12:04.440
networks of people reading books. And that seems to be a much better database of like interests,

12:04.440 --> 12:09.000
of course, to constrain you to the books you're reading. But like that really reveals so much

12:09.000 --> 12:13.880
more about the person allows you to discover shared interests because books are kind of window

12:13.880 --> 12:20.200
into the way you see the world. Also, like the kind of places, people you're curious about,

12:20.200 --> 12:24.760
the kind of ideas you're curious about. Are you a romantic or are you cold calculating rationalist?

12:24.760 --> 12:29.080
Are you, uh, are you into Ayn Rand or are you into Bernie Sanders? Are you into whatever?

12:29.880 --> 12:35.640
And I feel like that reveals so much more than like a person trying to look hot from a certain

12:35.640 --> 12:36.920
angle in a Tinder profile.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.200
Well, and it'd also be a really great filter in the first place for people,

12:40.200 --> 12:46.040
it's like for people who read books and are willing to go and rate them and give feedback

12:46.040 --> 12:49.560
on them and so on. So that's already a really strong filter of probably the type of people

12:49.560 --> 12:50.440
you'd be looking for.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.800
Well, at least be able to fake reading books. I mean, the thing about books, you don't really

12:53.800 --> 12:55.720
need to read it. You can just look at the click cards.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.920
Yeah. Game the dating app by feigning intellectualism.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.200
Can I admit something very horrible about myself?

13:02.200 --> 13:02.760
Go on.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.440
Things that, you know, I don't have many things in my closet, but this is one of them.

13:07.880 --> 13:13.560
I've never actually read Shakespeare. I've only read Cliff Notes and I got a five in the AP

13:13.560 --> 13:14.920
English exam.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.720
Wow.

13:15.720 --> 13:19.480
And I, uh, which books have I read?

13:19.480 --> 13:21.400
Well, yeah, which was the exam on which.

13:21.400 --> 13:27.400
Oh, no, they, they include a lot of them. But Hamlet, I don't even know if you read

13:27.400 --> 13:32.600
Romeo and Juliet, uh, Macbeth. I don't, I don't remember, but I don't understand it.

13:32.600 --> 13:37.880
It's like really cryptic. It's really, I don't, and it's not that pleasant to read.

13:37.880 --> 13:43.000
It's like ancient speak. I don't understand it. Anyway, maybe I was too dumb. I'm still too dumb,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.880
but, uh, I did go to five, which is, I don't know how the U S grading system.

13:47.880 --> 13:53.800
Oh no. So AP English is, uh, there's kind of this advanced versions of courses in high school

13:53.800 --> 13:58.760
and you take a test that is like a broad test for that subject and includes a lot.

13:58.760 --> 14:04.760
It wasn't obviously just Shakespeare. I think a lot of it was also writing, uh, written.

14:04.760 --> 14:11.000
You have like AP physics, AP computer science, AP biology, AP chemistry, and then AP English

14:11.000 --> 14:15.400
or AP literature. I forget what it was, but I think Shakespeare was a part of that.

14:16.040 --> 14:16.840
But I.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.000
And you, and you gave the point is you gamified it.

14:19.560 --> 14:25.160
Well, entirety, I was into getting A's. I saw it as a game. I don't think any,

14:26.920 --> 14:33.800
I don't think all the learning I've done has been outside of the outside of the school.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.080
The deepest learning I've done has been outside of school with a few exceptions,

14:37.080 --> 14:40.280
especially in grad school, like deep computer science courses.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.560
But that was still outside of school because it was outside of getting, sorry,

14:43.560 --> 14:47.720
it was outside of getting the A for the course. The best stuff I've ever done is

14:48.360 --> 14:52.200
when you read the chapter and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter,

14:52.200 --> 14:56.200
which is usually not what's required for the course, like the hardest stuff.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.640
In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible. If you go back now and you look at like biology

15:01.640 --> 15:07.640
textbook or, or any of the computer science textbooks on algorithms and data structures,

15:07.640 --> 15:13.160
those things are incredibly, they have the best summary of a subject. Plus they have practice

15:13.160 --> 15:17.800
problems of increasing difficulty that allows you to truly master the basic,

15:17.800 --> 15:21.960
the fundamental ideas behind that. I got through my entire physics degree

15:22.600 --> 15:26.840
with one textbook that was just this really comprehensive one that they told us at the

15:26.840 --> 15:31.880
beginning of the first year, buy this, but you're going to have to buy 15 other books for all your

15:31.880 --> 15:36.600
supplementary courses. And I was like, every time I just checked to see whether this book covered it

15:36.600 --> 15:40.760
and it did. And I think I only bought like two or three extra than thank God, because they're so

15:40.760 --> 15:45.320
super expensive textbooks. It's a whole racket they've got going on. Yeah, they are. They could

15:45.320 --> 15:51.640
just, you get the right one. It's just like a manual for, but what's interesting though is

15:52.760 --> 15:56.040
this is the tyranny of, of having exams and metrics.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.520
Yeah. The tyranny of exams and metrics. Yes.

15:58.520 --> 16:03.880
I loved them because I loved, I'm very competitive and I liked, I liked finding ways to gamify things

16:03.880 --> 16:07.480
and then like sort of dust off my shoulders afterwards when I get, get a good grade or be

16:07.480 --> 16:11.400
annoyed at myself when I didn't. But yeah, you're absolutely right in that the actual,

16:12.440 --> 16:19.080
you know, how much of that physics knowledge I've retained, like I've, I learned how to cram and

16:19.080 --> 16:24.680
study and please an examiner, but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge that I needed? I

16:24.680 --> 16:31.320
mean, yes, yes and no. But really like nothing makes you learn a topic better than when you

16:31.320 --> 16:36.280
actually then have to teach it yourself. You know, like I'm trying to wrap my teeth around this like

16:36.280 --> 16:43.080
game theory, Moloch stuff right now. And there's no exam at the end of it that I can gamify. There's

16:43.080 --> 16:47.320
no way to gamify and sort of like shortcut my way through it. I have to understand it so deeply from

16:47.320 --> 16:52.200
like deep foundational levels to then build upon it and then try and explain it to other people.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.280
And like, you know, you're about to go and do some lectures, right? You, you, you can't,

16:56.280 --> 17:01.480
you can't sort of just like, you presumably can't rely on the knowledge that you got through when

17:01.560 --> 17:06.760
you were studying for an exam to reteach that. Yeah. And especially high level lectures,

17:06.760 --> 17:13.000
especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube, you're not just regurgitating material. You have

17:13.000 --> 17:20.680
to think through what is the core idea here. And when you do the lectures live, especially,

17:20.680 --> 17:28.280
you have to, there's no second takes. That is the luxury you get if you're recording a video

17:28.280 --> 17:33.640
for YouTube or something like that. But it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't lean on.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.520
I've gotten to interact with a few YouTubers that lean on that too much. And you realize, oh,

17:40.520 --> 17:46.680
you're, you've gamified this system because you're not really thinking deeply about stuff.

17:46.680 --> 17:54.600
You're through the edit, both written and spoken. You're crafting an amazing video, but you yourself

17:54.680 --> 18:00.680
as a human being have not really deeply understood it. So live teaching, or at least recording video

18:00.680 --> 18:06.200
with very few takes is, is a, is a different beast. And I think it's, it's the most honest

18:06.200 --> 18:10.200
way of doing it. Like as few takes as possible. That's why I'm nervous about this.

18:13.960 --> 18:21.800
Don't fuck this up, Liv. The tyranny of exams. I do think, you know, people talk about,

18:21.800 --> 18:27.800
you know, high school and college as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun and all this kind

18:27.800 --> 18:37.880
of stuff. But, you know, looking back, of course I did a lot of those things. No. Yes. But it's also

18:37.880 --> 18:47.480
a time when you get to like read textbooks or read books or learn with all the time in the world.

18:48.360 --> 18:55.000
Like you don't have these responsibilities of like, you know, laundry and

18:57.800 --> 19:03.160
having to sort of pay for mortgage or all that kind of stuff, pay taxes, all this kind of stuff.

19:03.960 --> 19:09.880
In most cases, there's just so much time in the day for learning. And you don't realize it at the

19:09.880 --> 19:15.240
time, because at the time it seems like a chore, like why the hell does there's so much homework?

19:15.240 --> 19:18.840
But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning, this kind of homework

19:19.560 --> 19:24.440
ever again in life, unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.160
You get, like you basically, your knowledge gets solidified. You don't get to have fun and learn.

19:29.160 --> 19:34.840
Learning is really fulfilling and really fun if you're that kind of person. Like some people

19:36.040 --> 19:41.960
like to, you know, like knowledge is not something that they think is fun. But if that's the kind of

19:41.960 --> 19:46.440
thing that you think is fun, that's the time to have fun and do the drugs and drink and all that

19:46.440 --> 19:52.360
kind of stuff. But the learning, just going back to those textbooks, the hours spent with the

19:52.360 --> 19:56.520
textbooks is really, really rewarding. Do people even use textbooks anymore?

19:56.520 --> 19:57.400
Yeah. Do you think?

19:58.280 --> 20:02.200
It's these days with their TikTok. Well, not even that, but just like

20:03.160 --> 20:06.840
so much information, really high quality information, you know, is now in digital

20:06.840 --> 20:11.560
format online. Yeah, but they're not, there are using that, but you know,

20:12.120 --> 20:19.480
college is still very, there's a curriculum. I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study

20:19.480 --> 20:27.400
of a subject and still on YouTube, that's not there. YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about

20:27.400 --> 20:34.920
this. He's this math. Yeah, 3Blue1Brown. He says like, I'm not a math teacher. I just take

20:34.920 --> 20:39.400
really cool concepts and I inspire people. But if you want to really learn calculus,

20:39.400 --> 20:44.760
if you want to really learn linear algebra, you should do the textbook. You should do that,

20:44.760 --> 20:51.800
you know. And there's still the textbook industrial complex that charges like $200

20:51.800 --> 20:57.720
for textbook and somehow, I don't know, it's ridiculous. Well, they're like, oh, sorry,

20:57.720 --> 21:03.560
new edition, edition 14.6. Sorry, you can't use 14.5 anymore. It's like, what's different? We've

21:03.560 --> 21:09.720
got one paragraph different. So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrano. I'm going to get a chance

21:09.720 --> 21:15.000
to talk to him on this podcast and he's somebody that I found fascinating in terms of the way he

21:15.000 --> 21:21.480
thinks about poker, verbalizes the way he thinks about poker, the way he plays poker. So, and he's

21:21.480 --> 21:27.160
still pretty damn good. He's been good for a long time. So you mentioned that people are running

21:27.160 --> 21:32.440
these kinds of simulations and the game of poker has changed. Do you think he's adapting in this

21:32.440 --> 21:40.600
way? Like the top pros, do they have to adopt this way or is there still like over the years

21:41.800 --> 21:49.000
you basically develop this gut feeling about, like you get to be like good the way, like Alpha

21:49.000 --> 21:55.800
Zero is good. You look at the board and somehow from the fog comes out the right answer. Like

21:55.800 --> 22:01.880
this is likely what they have. This is likely the best way to move. And you can't really

22:02.440 --> 22:08.600
put a finger on exactly why, but it just comes from your gut feeling or no.

22:09.160 --> 22:15.960
Yes and no. So gut feelings are definitely very important. You know, that we've got our two modes

22:15.960 --> 22:19.480
or you can distill it down to two modes of decision making, right? You've got your sort

22:19.480 --> 22:26.440
of logical linear voice in your head system to as it's often called and your system on your gut

22:26.440 --> 22:35.400
intuition. And historically in poker, the very best players were playing almost entirely by their

22:35.400 --> 22:40.520
gut. You know, often they do some kind of inspired play and you'd ask them why they do it and they

22:40.520 --> 22:46.600
wouldn't really be able to explain it. And that's not so much because their process was

22:46.600 --> 22:51.000
unintelligible, but it was more just because no one had the language with which to describe

22:51.000 --> 22:54.840
what optimal strategies were because no one really understood how poker worked. This was before,

22:55.560 --> 23:02.440
we had analysis software. I guess some people would write down their hands in a little notebook,

23:02.440 --> 23:07.800
but there was no way to assimilate all this data and analyze it. But then when computers became

23:07.800 --> 23:12.440
cheaper and software started emerging and then obviously online poker, where it would automatically

23:12.440 --> 23:17.720
save your hand histories, now all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data that you could

23:17.720 --> 23:23.880
run analysis on. And so that's when people started to see these mathematical solutions.

23:24.840 --> 23:37.000
And so what that meant is the role of intuition essentially became smaller. And it meant more

23:37.000 --> 23:42.840
into as we talked before about this game theory optimal style. But also as I said, game theory

23:42.840 --> 23:48.760
optimal is about loss minimization and being unexploitable. But if you're playing against

23:48.760 --> 23:52.200
people who aren't, because no person, no human being can play perfectly game theory optimal in

23:52.200 --> 23:58.360
poker, not even the best AIs. They're 99.99% of the way there or whatever, but it's kind of

23:58.360 --> 24:03.640
like the speed of light. You can't reach it perfectly. So there's still a role for intuition?

24:03.640 --> 24:10.120
Yes. So when your playing is unexploitable style, but when your opponents start doing

24:10.680 --> 24:17.160
something suboptimal that you want to exploit, well, now that's where not only your logical brain

24:17.160 --> 24:22.040
will need to be thinking, oh, okay, I know I have this, I'm in the sort of top end of my range here

24:22.040 --> 24:28.840
with this hand. So that means I need to be calling X% of the time and I put them on this range,

24:28.840 --> 24:36.840
et cetera. But then sometimes you'll have this gut feeling that will tell you, you know what,

24:36.840 --> 24:42.760
this time I know mathematically I'm meant to call now. I'm in the sort of top end of my range and

24:43.640 --> 24:47.880
this is the odds I'm getting. So the math says I should call, but there's something in your gut

24:47.880 --> 24:54.120
saying they've got it this time. They've got it. They're beating you. Maybe your hand is worse.

24:55.080 --> 25:01.880
So then the real art, this is where the last remaining art in poker, the fuzziness is like,

25:01.880 --> 25:07.320
do you listen to your gut? How do you quantify the strength of it or can you even quantify the

25:07.320 --> 25:14.840
strength of it? And I think that's what Daniel has. I mean, I can't speak for how much he's

25:14.840 --> 25:20.760
studying with the simulators and that kind of thing. I think he has, he must be to still be

25:20.760 --> 25:28.680
keeping up. But he has an incredible intuition for just, he's seen so many hands of poker in the

25:28.680 --> 25:33.880
flesh. He's seen so many people, the way they behave when the money's on the line and you've

25:33.880 --> 25:38.280
got him staring you down in the eye. He's intimidating. He's got this like kind of

25:38.280 --> 25:44.840
X factor vibe that he gives out. And he talks a lot, which is an interactive element,

25:44.840 --> 25:49.880
which is he's getting stuff from other people. Yes. And just like the subtleties. So he's like,

25:49.880 --> 25:54.680
he's probing constantly. Yeah, he's probing and he's getting this extra layer of information

25:54.680 --> 25:59.480
that others can't. Now that said though, he's good online as well. I don't know how, again,

25:59.480 --> 26:07.080
would he be beating the top cash game players online? Probably not. No. But when he's in person

26:07.080 --> 26:11.240
and he's got that additional layer of information, he can not only extract it, but he knows what to

26:11.240 --> 26:16.600
do with it still so well. There's one player who I would say is the exception to all of this.

26:17.800 --> 26:23.000
And he's one of my favorite people to talk about in terms of, I think he might have cracked the

26:23.080 --> 26:30.520
simulation. It's Phil Helmuth. In more ways than one. He's cracked the simulation, I think.

26:30.520 --> 26:37.000
Yeah. He somehow to this day is still, and I love you, Phil. I'm not in any way knocking you.

26:38.200 --> 26:45.320
He's still winning so much at the World Series of Poker specifically. He's now won 16 bracelets.

26:45.320 --> 26:50.760
The next nearest person I think has won 10. And he is consistently year in, year out going deep

26:50.760 --> 26:56.440
or winning these huge field tournaments with 2,000 people, which statistically he should not be

26:56.440 --> 27:04.680
doing. And yet you watch some of the plays he makes and they make no sense. Mathematically,

27:04.680 --> 27:10.200
they are so far from game theory optimal. And the thing is if you went and stuck him in one of these

27:10.200 --> 27:15.400
high stakes cash games with a bunch of GTO people, he's going to get ripped apart. But there's

27:15.400 --> 27:19.240
something that he has that when he's in the halls of the World Series of Poker specifically,

27:20.840 --> 27:29.960
amongst sort of amateurish players, he gets them to do crazy shit. But my little pet theory is that

27:29.960 --> 27:42.360
also he's like a wizard and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to. Because he just expects

27:42.360 --> 27:50.040
to win and he expects to get flop a set with a frequency far beyond what the real percentages

27:50.040 --> 27:53.640
are. And I don't even know if he knows what the real percentages are. He doesn't need to

27:53.640 --> 27:57.240
because he gets there. I think he has found a cheat code because when I've seen him play,

27:57.240 --> 28:04.520
he seems to be like annoyed that the long shot thing didn't happen. Yes. He's like annoyed and

28:04.520 --> 28:08.120
it's almost like everybody else is stupid because he was obviously going to win with this. He's

28:08.120 --> 28:11.640
going to win if that silly thing hadn't happened. And it's like, you don't understand, the silly

28:11.640 --> 28:17.000
thing happens 99% of the time. And it's 1%, not the other way around. But genuinely for his

28:17.000 --> 28:22.280
lived experience, only at the World Series of Poker, it is like that. So I don't blame him

28:22.280 --> 28:29.560
for feeling that way. But he does. He has this X factor. And the poker community has tried for

28:29.560 --> 28:34.680
years to rip him down saying like, he's no good, but he's clearly good because he's still winning.

28:34.680 --> 28:40.440
There's something going on. Whether that's he's figured out how to mess with the fabric of reality

28:40.440 --> 28:44.760
and how cards, a randomly shuffled deck of cards come out. I don't know what it is,

28:44.760 --> 28:49.560
but he's doing it right still. Who do you think is the greatest of all time? Would you put Helmuth?

28:52.280 --> 28:56.280
It depends. He seems like the kind of person when mentioned he would actually watch this,

28:56.280 --> 29:03.400
so you might want to be careful. As I said, I love Phil. I would say this to his face. I'm

29:03.400 --> 29:11.960
not saying anything. He is one of the greatest. I don't know if he's the greatest. He's certainly

29:11.960 --> 29:17.880
the greatest at the World Series of Poker. And he is the greatest at, despite the game switching

29:17.880 --> 29:23.720
into a pure game, almost an entire game of math, he has managed to keep the magic alive. And just

29:23.720 --> 29:29.160
through sheer force of will, making the game work for him. And that is incredible. And I think it's

29:29.160 --> 29:33.640
something that should be studied because it's an example. Yeah, there might be some actual game

29:33.640 --> 29:38.280
theoretic wisdom. There might be something to be said about optimality from studying him.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.280
What do you mean by optimality?

29:40.840 --> 29:47.880
Meaning, or rather, game design, perhaps. Meaning, if what he's doing is working,

29:48.440 --> 29:53.160
maybe poker is more complicated than we're currently modeling it as.

29:54.680 --> 30:01.400
Or there's an extra layer, and I don't mean to get too weird and wooey, but, or there's an extra

30:01.400 --> 30:08.600
layer of ability to manipulate the things the way you want them to go that we don't understand yet.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.480
Do you think Phil Hellmuth understands them? Is he just generally-

30:13.480 --> 30:16.680
Hashtag positivity. He wrote a book on positivity.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.280
And he- He has? He did?

30:18.280 --> 30:20.360
Yes, full positivity. Not like a trolling book?

30:20.360 --> 30:22.520
No. He's straight up, yeah.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.200
Phil Hellmuth wrote a book about positivity? Yes.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.520
Okay, not ironically.

30:28.520 --> 30:34.040
And I think it's about sort of manifesting what you want and getting the outcomes that you want

30:34.040 --> 30:38.600
by believing so much in yourself and in your ability to win, like eyes on the prize.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.960
And I mean, it's working.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.440
The man's delivered. Where do you put like Phil Ivey and all those kinds of people?

30:47.240 --> 30:52.200
I mean, I'm too, I've been, to be honest, too much out of the scene for the last few years to really,

30:52.280 --> 30:58.840
I mean, Phil Ivey's clearly got, again, he's got that X factor. He's so incredibly intimidating

30:58.840 --> 31:01.880
to play against. I've only played against him a couple of times, but when he like looks you

31:01.880 --> 31:05.960
in the eye and you're trying to run a bluff on him, oof, no one's made me sweat harder than Phil

31:05.960 --> 31:10.840
Ivey. Just my bluff got through actually. That was actually one of the most thrilling moments

31:10.840 --> 31:15.320
I've ever had in poker. It was in a Monte Carlo in a high roller. I can't remember exactly what

31:15.320 --> 31:20.440
the hand was, but I, you know, I three bit and then like just barreled all the way through.

31:20.760 --> 31:26.600
And he just like put his laser eyes into me and I felt like he was just scouring my soul.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.040
And I was just like, hold it together, Liv, hold it together. And he was like, folded.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.560
And you knew your hand was weaker.

31:31.560 --> 31:36.280
Yeah. I mean, I was bluffing. I presume, which, you know, there's a chance I was bluffing with

31:36.280 --> 31:44.280
the best hand, but I'm pretty sure my hand was worse. And he folded. I was truly one of my,

31:44.280 --> 31:46.280
one of the deep highlights of my career.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.280
Did you show the cards or did you fold?

31:48.280 --> 31:54.120
You should never show in game. Like, because especially as I felt like I was one of the worst

31:54.120 --> 31:59.000
players at the table in that tournament. So giving that information, unless I had a really

31:59.000 --> 32:03.480
solid plan that I was now like advertising, oh, look, I'm capable of bluffing Phil Ivey,

32:03.480 --> 32:08.760
but like why? It's much more valuable to take advantage of the impression that they have of

32:08.760 --> 32:12.680
me, which is like, I'm a scared girl playing a high roller for the first time. Keep that going.

32:12.680 --> 32:19.960
Interesting. But isn't there a layers to this, like psychological warfare that the scared girl

32:21.240 --> 32:25.640
might be way smart and then like to flip the tables. Do you think about that kind of stuff?

32:25.640 --> 32:26.280
Oh, definitely.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.280
Is it better not to reveal information?

32:28.280 --> 32:31.880
I mean, generally speaking, you want to not reveal information. You know, the goal of poker

32:31.880 --> 32:38.200
is to be as deceptive as possible about your own strategies while elucidating as much out of your

32:38.280 --> 32:42.840
opponent about their own. So giving them free information, particularly if they're people who

32:42.840 --> 32:48.040
you consider very good players, any information I give them is going into their little database

32:48.040 --> 32:52.760
and being calculated. I assume it's going to be calculated and used well. So I have to be really

32:52.760 --> 32:57.720
confident that my like meta gaming that I'm going to then do, oh, they've seen this, so therefore

32:57.720 --> 33:03.640
that I'm going to be on the right level. So it's better just to keep that little secret to myself

33:03.640 --> 33:04.200
in the moment.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.960
So how much is bluffing part of the game?

33:06.920 --> 33:07.640
Huge amount.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.880
Yeah. I mean, maybe actually let me ask, like, what did it feel like with the Ivy or anyone else

33:13.880 --> 33:20.280
when it's a high stake, when it's a big, it's a big bluff. So a lot of money on the table

33:21.640 --> 33:26.520
and maybe, I mean, what defines a big bluff? Maybe a lot of money on the table, but also some

33:26.520 --> 33:33.800
uncertainty in your mind and heart about like self-doubt. Well, maybe I miscalculated what's

33:33.800 --> 33:37.640
going on here, what the bet said, all that kind of stuff. Like, what does that feel like?

33:38.680 --> 33:49.240
I mean, it's, I imagine comparable to, you know, running a, I mean, any kind of big bluff where you

33:50.840 --> 33:54.920
have a lot of something that you care about on the line, you know? So if you're

33:55.880 --> 33:59.160
bluffing in a courtroom, not that anyone should ever do that or, you know, something

33:59.240 --> 34:04.600
equatable to that. It's, you know, in that scenario, you know, I think it was the first

34:04.600 --> 34:09.720
time I'd ever played a 20, I'd won my way into this 25K tournament. So that was the buy-in,

34:09.720 --> 34:14.520
25,000 euros. And I had satelliteed my way in because it was much bigger than I would never

34:14.520 --> 34:19.560
ever normally play. And, you know, I hadn't, I wasn't that experienced at the time. And now I was

34:19.560 --> 34:23.240
sitting there against all the big boys, you know, the Negranus, the Philivies and so on.

34:23.880 --> 34:31.320
Um, and then, uh, to like, you know, each time you put the bets out, you know, you put another bet

34:31.320 --> 34:35.880
out, your card, you know, I was on what's called a semi-bluff. So there was some cards that could

34:35.880 --> 34:39.960
come that would make my hand very, very strong and therefore win. But most of the time those

34:39.960 --> 34:44.760
cards don't come. So that is a semi-bluff because you're representing, are you representing that

34:44.760 --> 34:52.680
you already have something? So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw to, to, so I had two

34:52.680 --> 34:57.960
clubs, two, two clubs came out on the flop. And then I'm hoping that on the turn and the river,

34:57.960 --> 35:02.440
one will come. So I have some future equity. I could hit a club and then I'll have the best

35:02.440 --> 35:08.280
hand, in which case great. Um, and so I can keep betting and I'll want them to call, but I'm also

35:08.280 --> 35:13.160
got the other way of winning the hand where if my card doesn't come, I can keep betting and get them

35:13.160 --> 35:18.920
to fold their hand. Um, and I'm pretty sure that's what the scenario was. Um, so I had some future

35:18.920 --> 35:24.520
equity, but it's still, you know, most of the time I don't hit that club. And so I would rather

35:24.520 --> 35:28.200
him just fold because I'm, you know, the pot is now getting bigger and bigger. And in the end,

35:28.200 --> 35:33.960
like I've jam all jam all in on the river. That's my entire tournament on the line. As far as I'm

35:33.960 --> 35:37.960
aware, this might be the one time I ever get to play a big 25 K, you know, this was the first time

35:37.960 --> 35:42.680
I played one. So it was, it felt like the most momentous thing. And this was also when I was

35:42.680 --> 35:47.000
trying to build myself up at, you know, build my name, a name for myself in poker. I wanted to get

35:47.080 --> 35:51.480
respect, destroy everything for you. It felt like it in the moment. Like, I mean, it literally does

35:51.480 --> 35:55.240
feel like a form of life and death, like your body physiologically is having that flight or

35:55.240 --> 35:58.680
fight response. What are you doing with your body? What are you doing with your face? Are you just

35:58.680 --> 36:05.880
like, what are you thinking about? More a mixture of like, okay, what are the cards? So in theory,

36:05.880 --> 36:09.880
I'm thinking about like, okay, what are, what are cards that look, make my hand look stronger,

36:09.880 --> 36:14.680
which, you know, which cause hit my perceived range from his perspective, which cards don't,

36:15.480 --> 36:20.680
what's the right amount of bet size to, you know, maximize my fold equity in this situation,

36:20.680 --> 36:24.360
you know, that's the logical stuff that I should be thinking about. But I think in reality, because

36:24.360 --> 36:28.840
I was so scared, because there's this, at least for me, there's a certain threshold of like

36:28.840 --> 36:34.600
nervousness or stress beyond which the logical brain shuts off. And now it just gets into this,

36:34.600 --> 36:40.520
like, it just like, it feels like a game of wits, basically, it's like of nerve, can you hold your

36:40.840 --> 36:45.640
resolve? And it certainly got by that, like by the river at this, I think by that point, I was like,

36:45.640 --> 36:49.880
I don't even know if this is a good bluff anymore, but fuck it, let's do it.

36:49.880 --> 36:53.000
Your mind is almost numb from the intensity of that feeling.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.760
I call it the white noise. And that's, and it happens in all kinds of decision making,

36:58.760 --> 37:02.520
I think anything that's really, really stressful. I can imagine someone in like an important job

37:02.520 --> 37:06.440
interview, if it's like a job they've always wanted, and they're getting grilled, you know,

37:06.440 --> 37:10.360
like Bridgewater style, where they ask these really hard mathematical questions.

37:11.720 --> 37:17.960
It's a really learned skill to be able to like, subdue your flight or fight response, you know,

37:17.960 --> 37:22.040
what I think get from the sympathetic into the parasympathetic, so you can actually, you know,

37:22.040 --> 37:27.320
engage that voice in your head and do those slow logical calculations. Because evolutionarily,

37:28.200 --> 37:33.000
if we see a lion running at us, we didn't have time to sort of calculate the lion's kinetic energy,

37:33.000 --> 37:38.280
and, you know, is it optimal to go this way or that way, you just react it. And physically,

37:38.280 --> 37:42.200
our bodies are well attuned to actually make right decisions. But when you're playing a game

37:42.200 --> 37:47.000
like poker, this is not something that you ever, you know, evolved to do. And yet you're in that

37:47.000 --> 37:51.640
same flight or fight response. And so that's a really important skill to be able to develop,

37:51.640 --> 37:56.280
to basically learn how to like, meditate in the moment and calm yourself so that you can think

37:56.280 --> 38:01.400
clearly. But as you were searching for a comparable thing, it's interesting because

38:02.200 --> 38:08.920
you just made me realize that bluffing is like an incredibly high stakes form of lying. You're

38:08.920 --> 38:15.960
lying. And I don't think you're telling a story. No, no, it's straight up lying. In the context

38:15.960 --> 38:22.360
of game, it's not a negative kind of lying. But it is. Yeah, exactly. You're representing something

38:22.360 --> 38:29.400
that you don't have. And I was thinking like, how often in life do we have such high stakes of lying?

38:30.120 --> 38:36.440
Because I was thinking, certainly in high level military strategy, I was thinking

38:37.560 --> 38:45.800
when Hitler was lying to Stalin about his plans to invade the Soviet Union. And so you're talking

38:45.800 --> 38:52.600
to a person like your friends and you're fighting against the enemy, whatever the formulation of

38:52.600 --> 38:57.320
the enemy is. But meanwhile, whole time you're building up troops on the border.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.360
That's extremely- Wait, wait. So Hitler and Stalin were like pretending to be friends?

39:02.360 --> 39:05.160
Yeah. Well, my history knowledge is terrible. That's crazy.

39:05.160 --> 39:14.840
Yeah. And it worked because Stalin, until the troops crossed the border and invaded

39:15.720 --> 39:25.000
in Operation Barbarossa where this storm of Nazi troops invaded large parts of the Soviet Union.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.520
And hence, one of the biggest wars in human history began. Stalin for sure thought that this

39:32.520 --> 39:40.920
was never going to be, that Hitler is not crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union. And geopolitically

39:40.920 --> 39:46.200
makes total sense to be collaborators. And ideologically, even though there's a tension

39:46.200 --> 39:52.360
between communism and fascism, or national socialism, however you formulate it, it still

39:52.360 --> 39:55.720
feels like this is the right way to battle the West.

39:55.720 --> 40:01.320
Right. They were more ideologically aligned. They in theory had a common enemy, which was the West.

40:01.320 --> 40:06.760
So it made total sense. And in terms of negotiations and the way things were communicated,

40:07.320 --> 40:15.160
it seemed to Stalin that for sure that they would remain, at least for a while,

40:16.040 --> 40:22.120
peaceful collaborators. And everybody, because of that in the Soviet Union,

40:22.120 --> 40:27.160
believed that it was a huge shock when Kiev was invaded. And you hear echoes of that when

40:27.160 --> 40:33.480
I traveled to Ukraine, sort of the shock of the invasion. It's not just the invasion on

40:33.480 --> 40:40.040
one particular border, but the invasion of the capital city. And just like, holy shit. Especially

40:40.040 --> 40:46.760
at that time, when you thought World War I, you realized that that was the way to end all wars.

40:46.760 --> 40:53.480
You would never have this kind of war. And holy shit, this person is mad enough to try to take on

40:53.480 --> 40:59.720
this monster in the Soviet Union. So it's no longer going to be a war of hundreds of thousands dead.

40:59.720 --> 41:09.000
It'll be a war of tens of millions dead. That's a very large scale kind of lie. But I'm sure

41:09.000 --> 41:16.200
there's in politics and geopolitics, that kind of lying happening all the time. And a lot of people

41:16.200 --> 41:20.360
pay financially and with their lives for that kind of lying. But in our personal lives, I don't know

41:20.360 --> 41:27.320
how often we... I think people do. I mean, think of spouses cheating on their partners, right? And

41:27.320 --> 41:30.440
then having to lie, like, where were you last night? Stuff like that. Holy shit, that's tough.

41:30.440 --> 41:35.560
Yeah, that's true. Unfortunately, that stuff happens all the time, right?

41:35.560 --> 41:41.160
Yeah. Or having multiple families, that one is great. When each family doesn't know about

41:41.160 --> 41:46.440
the other one and maintaining that life. There's probably a sense of excitement about that too.

41:48.760 --> 41:56.200
Seems unnecessary, yeah. Well, just lying. The truth finds a way of coming out,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.040
but hence that's the thrill.

41:59.080 --> 42:09.640
Yeah, perhaps. Yeah, people. What's so interesting about poker is most of the best players I know,

42:09.640 --> 42:14.360
they're always exceptions, they're always bad eggs. But actually poker players are very honest

42:14.360 --> 42:20.840
people. I would say they are more honest than the average, if you just took random population

42:20.840 --> 42:30.440
sample. Because A, I think humans like to have that, most people like to have some kind of

42:30.440 --> 42:36.360
mysterious, an opportunity to do something like a little edgy. So we get to sort of scratch that

42:36.360 --> 42:41.720
itch of being edgy at the poker table where it's part of the game, everyone knows what they're in

42:41.720 --> 42:49.480
for and that's allowed. And you get to really get that out of your system. And then also, poker

42:49.480 --> 42:56.520
players learned that I would play in a huge game against some of my friends, even my partner Igor,

42:56.520 --> 43:01.320
where we will be absolutely going at each other's throats trying to draw blood in terms of winning

43:01.320 --> 43:05.000
each money off each other and getting under each other's skin, winding each other up,

43:06.040 --> 43:11.480
doing the craftiest moves we can. But then once the game's done, the winners and the

43:11.480 --> 43:15.880
losers will go off and get a drink together and have a fun time and talk about it in this weird

43:15.880 --> 43:20.680
academic way afterwards. And that's why games are so great, because you get to live out

43:22.440 --> 43:29.640
this competitive urge that most people have. What's it feel like to lose? We talked about

43:29.640 --> 43:37.720
bluffing when it worked out. What about when you go broke? So in a game, fortunately I've never

43:37.720 --> 43:47.560
gone broke in poker. I know plenty of people who have. And I don't think Igor would mind me

43:47.560 --> 43:52.920
saying he went broke once in poker, early on when we were together. I feel like you haven't lived

43:52.920 --> 44:00.840
unless you've gone broke in some sense. I've sort of lived through it vicariously through him when

44:00.840 --> 44:05.480
he did it at the time. But yeah, what is it like to lose? Well, it depends. So it depends on the

44:05.480 --> 44:10.680
amount. It depends what percentage of your net worth you've just lost. It depends on your brain

44:10.680 --> 44:15.560
chemistry. It really varies from person to person. You have a very cold calculating way of thinking

44:15.560 --> 44:21.160
about this. So it depends what percentage. But it really does, right? Yeah, it's true.

44:22.920 --> 44:27.160
That's another thing poker trains you to do. You see everything in percentages,

44:27.880 --> 44:31.880
or you see everything in ROI or expected hourlies or cost benefit, et cetera.

44:32.840 --> 44:39.640
So one of the things I've tried to do is calibrate the strength of my emotional response

44:40.440 --> 44:47.720
to the win or loss that I've received. Because it's no good if you have a huge emotional dramatic

44:47.720 --> 44:54.360
response to a tiny loss. Or on the flip side, you have a huge win and you're so dead inside

44:54.360 --> 45:00.200
that you don't even feel it. Well, that's a shame. I want my emotions to calibrate with reality as

45:00.200 --> 45:05.320
much as possible. So yeah, what's it like to lose? I mean, I've had times where I've

45:07.000 --> 45:09.880
busted out of a tournament that I thought I was going to win in, especially if I got really

45:09.880 --> 45:18.360
unlucky or I make a dumb play, where I've gone away and kicked the wall, punched a wall. I

45:18.360 --> 45:25.880
nearly broke my hand one time. I'm a lot less competitive than I used to be. I was pathologically

45:25.880 --> 45:32.200
competitive in my late teens, early 20s. I just had to win at everything. And I think that slowly

45:32.200 --> 45:36.360
waned as I've gotten older. According to you, yeah. According to me. I don't know if others

45:36.360 --> 45:41.800
would say the same, right? I feel like ultra competitive people. I've heard Joe Rogan say

45:41.800 --> 45:46.520
this to me. He's a lot less competitive than he used to be. I don't know about that.

45:47.160 --> 45:52.040
Oh, I believe it. No, I totally believe it. Because as you get, you can still be... I

45:52.040 --> 45:57.240
care about winning. When I play a game with my buddies online or whatever it is,

45:57.240 --> 46:02.760
polytopia is my current obsession. Thank you for passing on your obsession to me.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.520
Are you playing now? Yeah, I'm playing now.

46:04.520 --> 46:08.600
We've got to have a game. But I'm terrible and I enjoy playing terribly. I don't want to have

46:08.600 --> 46:13.640
a game because that's going to pull me into your monster of competitive play.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.640
It's important. It's a skill. I enjoy playing on the... I can't...

46:18.680 --> 46:20.840
You just do the points thing against the bots.

46:20.840 --> 46:27.000
Yeah, against the bots. And I can't even do the... There's like a hard one and there's a very hard

46:27.000 --> 46:27.640
one. And then there's crazy, yeah.

46:27.640 --> 46:31.880
That's crazy. I can't... I don't even enjoy the hard one. The crazy I really don't enjoy

46:31.880 --> 46:37.080
because it's intense. You have to constantly try to win as opposed to enjoy building a little world.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.080
Yeah, no, no. There's no time for exploration in polytopia. You got to get... Well,

46:41.080 --> 46:43.560
once you graduate from the crazies, then you can come play the...

46:44.520 --> 46:48.360
Graduate from the crazies. Yeah. In order to be able to play a decent

46:48.360 --> 46:56.760
game against our group, you'll need to be consistently winning like 90% of games

46:56.760 --> 46:59.000
against 15 crazy bots. Yeah.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.360
And you'll be able to. I could teach you it within a day, honestly.

47:03.480 --> 47:06.840
How to beat the crazies? How to beat the crazies. And then you'll

47:06.840 --> 47:09.400
be ready for the big leagues. I feel like this generalizes

47:09.400 --> 47:15.160
to more than just polytopia. But okay, why were we talking about polytopia? Losing hurts.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.600
Losing hurts. Oh yeah. Yes. Competitiveness over time.

47:20.200 --> 47:26.360
I think it's more that, at least for me, I still care about winning when I choose to play something.

47:26.360 --> 47:33.960
It's just that I don't see the world as zero sum as I used to be. I think as one gets older and wiser,

47:34.840 --> 47:39.160
you start to see the world more as a positive sum thing. Or at least you're more aware of

47:39.160 --> 47:48.360
externalities of scenarios, of competitive interactions. And I'm more aware of my own,

47:50.040 --> 47:54.040
if I have a really strong emotional response to losing, and that makes me then feel shitty

47:54.040 --> 47:59.480
for the rest of the day, and then I beat myself up mentally for it. I'm now more aware that that's

47:59.480 --> 48:04.040
unnecessary negative externality. So I'm like, okay, I need to find a way to turn this down,

48:04.040 --> 48:08.040
dial this down a bit. Was poker the thing that if you think

48:08.040 --> 48:13.000
back at your life and think about some of the lower points of your life, like the darker

48:13.000 --> 48:19.160
places you've got in your mind, did it have to do something with poker? Did losing spark

48:21.800 --> 48:24.440
the descent into darkness, or was it something else?

48:27.400 --> 48:33.560
I think my darkest points in poker were when I was wanting to quit and move on to other things,

48:34.280 --> 48:41.240
but I felt like I hadn't ticked all the boxes I wanted to tick. I wanted to be the most

48:41.240 --> 48:47.800
winningest female player, which is by itself a bad goal. That was one of my initial goals,

48:47.800 --> 48:52.360
and I wanted to win a WPT event. I won one of these, I won one of these, but I won one

48:52.360 --> 49:00.200
of those as well. And that, again, is a drive of over optimization to random metrics that I

49:00.200 --> 49:08.040
decided were important without much wisdom at the time, but then carried on. That made me

49:08.040 --> 49:12.120
continue chasing it longer than I still actually had the passion to chase it for.

49:12.760 --> 49:17.400
And I don't have any regrets that I played for as long as I did, because who knows,

49:18.360 --> 49:21.560
I wouldn't be sitting here, I wouldn't be living this incredible life that I'm living now.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.760
This is the height of your life right now.

49:24.760 --> 49:28.600
This is it, peak experience, absolute pinnacle here in your

49:29.000 --> 49:37.240
in your robot land with your creepy light. No, it is. I mean, I wouldn't change a thing

49:37.240 --> 49:44.440
about my life right now, and I feel very blessed to say that. But the dark times were in the sort

49:44.440 --> 49:53.480
of like 2016 to 18, even sooner really, where I had stopped loving the game, and I was going

49:53.480 --> 50:02.520
through the motions. And then I would take the losses harder than I needed to, because I'm like,

50:02.520 --> 50:06.360
ah, it's another one. And I was aware that I felt like my life was ticking away, and I was like,

50:06.360 --> 50:09.480
is this going to be what's on my tombstone? Oh yeah, she played the game of, you know,

50:09.480 --> 50:14.760
this zero sum game of poker, slightly more optimally than her next opponent. Like, cool,

50:14.760 --> 50:20.200
great legacy, you know? So I just wanted, you know, there was something in me that knew I needed to

50:20.200 --> 50:25.880
be doing something more directly impactful and just meaningful. It was just like a search for

50:25.880 --> 50:30.840
meaning. And I think it's a thing a lot of poker players, even a lot of, I imagine any games players

50:30.840 --> 50:38.120
who sort of love intellectual pursuits. You know, I think you should ask Magnus Carlsen this question.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.320
Yeah, walking away from chess, right? Yeah, like it must be so hard for him,

50:41.320 --> 50:45.560
you know, he's been on the top for so long. And it's like, well, now what? He's got this

50:45.560 --> 50:55.240
incredible brain, like what to put it to. It's this weird moment where I've just spoken with

50:55.240 --> 51:01.160
people that won multiple gold medals at the Olympics and the depression hits hard after you win.

51:02.680 --> 51:06.760
Dopamine crash. Because it's a kind of a goodbye, saying goodbye to that person,

51:06.760 --> 51:11.720
to all the dreams you had, the thought you thought would give meaning to your life.

51:11.720 --> 51:19.000
But in fact, life is full of constant pursuits of meaning. It doesn't, you don't like arrive

51:19.000 --> 51:23.880
and figure it all out. And there's endless bliss and knowledge. It continues going on and on.

51:23.880 --> 51:29.640
You constantly have to figure out to rediscover yourself. And so for you, like that struggle to

51:29.640 --> 51:35.160
say goodbye to poker, you have to like find the next. There's always a bigger game. That's the

51:35.160 --> 51:41.560
thing. That's my motto is like, what's the next game? And more importantly, because obviously

51:41.560 --> 51:45.800
game usually implies zero sum. Like what, what's the game, which is like omni-win?

51:47.960 --> 51:49.960
Why is omni-win so important?

51:50.680 --> 51:57.160
Because if everyone plays zero sum games, that's a fast track to either completely stagnate as a

51:57.160 --> 52:03.720
civilization, but more actually far more likely to extinct ourselves. Like the playing field is

52:03.720 --> 52:13.480
finite. Nuclear powers are playing a game of poker with, but their chips are nuclear weapons.

52:14.440 --> 52:19.960
And the stakes have gotten so large that if anyone makes a single bet, fires some weapons,

52:20.680 --> 52:26.760
the playing field breaks. I made a video on this. The playing field is finite.

52:26.760 --> 52:33.640
And if we keep playing these adversarial zero sum games, thinking that we, in order for us

52:33.640 --> 52:37.880
to win, someone else has to lose. Or if we lose that, you know, someone else wins that,

52:37.880 --> 52:41.080
that will extinct us. It's just a matter of when.

52:41.080 --> 52:47.080
What do you think about that mutually assured destruction, that very simple, almost to the

52:47.080 --> 52:53.080
point of caricaturing game theory idea that does seem to be at the core of why we haven't blown

52:53.080 --> 52:58.040
each other up yet with nuclear weapons. Do you think there's some truth to that? This kind of

52:58.920 --> 53:02.520
stabilizing force of mutually assured destruction. And do you think that's going to

53:03.720 --> 53:10.200
hold up through the 21st century? I mean, it's, it has, it has held. Yes,

53:10.200 --> 53:14.600
there's, there's definitely truth to it that it was a, you know, it's a Nash equilibrium.

53:14.600 --> 53:17.720
Yeah. Are you surprised it held this long? Isn't it crazy?

53:18.280 --> 53:26.520
It is crazy when you factor in all the like near miss accidental firings. Yes. That's makes me

53:26.520 --> 53:31.000
wonder like, you know, you know, are you familiar with the like quantum suicide thought experiment

53:31.000 --> 53:37.240
where it's basically like, you have a, you know, like a Russian roulette type scenario

53:38.520 --> 53:45.720
hooked up to some kind of quantum event, you know, particle splitting or paraparticle splitting.

53:45.720 --> 53:50.600
And if it, you know, if it goes A, then the gun doesn't go off and it goes B, then it does go

53:50.600 --> 53:55.800
off and it kills you. Because you can only ever be in the universe, you know, assuming like the

53:55.800 --> 54:00.040
Everett branch, you know, multiverse theory, you will always only end up in the, in the branch

54:00.040 --> 54:05.240
where you continually make, you know, option A comes in, but you run that experiment enough times

54:05.240 --> 54:10.120
it starts getting pretty damn, you know, out of the tree gets huge. There's a million different

54:10.120 --> 54:13.960
scenarios, but you'll always find yourself in this, in the one way it didn't go off.

54:14.760 --> 54:21.640
And, and so from that perspective, you, you are essentially immortal because someone, and you will

54:21.640 --> 54:26.440
only find yourself in the set of observers that make it down that path. So it's, it's, it's kind

54:26.440 --> 54:32.040
of a- But that doesn't mean, that doesn't, that doesn't mean you're still not going to be fucked

54:32.040 --> 54:35.880
at some point in your life. No, of course not. No, I'm not advocating like that we're all immortal

54:35.880 --> 54:39.800
because of this. It's just like a fun thought experiment. And the point is it like raises this

54:39.800 --> 54:43.880
thing of like these things called observer selection effects, which Bostrom and Nick Bostrom talks

54:43.880 --> 54:47.400
about a lot, and I think people should go read. It's really powerful, but I think it could be

54:47.400 --> 54:55.000
overextended that logic. I'm not sure exactly how it can be. I just feel like you can get,

54:55.000 --> 55:00.520
you can overgeneralize that logic somehow. Well, no, I mean, it leads you into like solipsism,

55:00.520 --> 55:04.200
which is a very dangerous mindset. Again, if everyone like falls into solipsism of like,

55:04.200 --> 55:10.680
well, I'll be fine. That's a great way of creating a very, you know, self-terminating environment.

55:10.680 --> 55:15.720
But my point is, is that with the nuclear weapons thing, there have been at least,

55:15.720 --> 55:23.080
I think it's 12 or 11 near misses of like just stupid things. Like, there was moonrise over

55:23.080 --> 55:29.480
Norway, and it made weird reflections off some glaciers in the mountains, which set off, I think,

55:29.480 --> 55:35.800
the alarms of NORAD radar, and that put them on high alert, nearly ready to shoot. And it was

55:35.800 --> 55:41.800
only because the head of the Russian military happened to be at the UN in New York at the time

55:41.880 --> 55:47.000
that they go like, well, wait a second, why would they fire now when their guy is there?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.840
And it was only that lucky happenstance, which doesn't happen very often where they didn't then

55:50.840 --> 55:55.320
escalate it into firing. And there's a bunch of these different ones. Stanislav Petrov like saved

55:55.880 --> 55:59.480
the person who should be the most famous person on earth, because he's probably on expectation

55:59.480 --> 56:05.240
saved the most human lives of anyone, like billions of people by ignoring Russian orders to fire,

56:05.240 --> 56:08.600
because he felt in his gut that actually this was a false alarm, and it turned out to be,

56:08.600 --> 56:13.400
you know, very hard thing to do. And there's so many of those scenarios that I can't help

56:13.400 --> 56:17.800
but wonder at this point that we aren't having this kind of like selection effect thing going on,

56:17.800 --> 56:21.480
because you look back and you're like, geez, that's a lot of near misses. But of course,

56:21.480 --> 56:24.200
we don't know the actual probabilities that they would have lent each one would have ended

56:24.200 --> 56:28.680
up in nuclear war. Maybe they were not that likely. But still, the point is, it's a very dark,

56:28.680 --> 56:35.320
stupid game that we're playing. And it is an absolute moral imperative, if you ask me,

56:35.320 --> 56:39.960
to get as many people thinking about ways to make this like very precarious, because we're in a

56:39.960 --> 56:44.040
Nash equilibrium. But it's not like we're in the bottom of a pit, you know, if you would like

56:44.040 --> 56:48.520
map it topographically. It's not like a stable ball at the bottom of a thing. We're not in

56:48.520 --> 56:52.840
equilibrium because of that. We're on the top of a hill with a ball balanced on top and just any

56:52.840 --> 56:58.360
little nudge could send it flying down. And you know, nuclear war pops off and hellfire and bad

56:58.360 --> 57:03.960
times. On the positive side, life on earth will probably still continue. And another

57:03.960 --> 57:10.120
intelligent civilization might still pop up. Maybe pick your X risk depends on the X risk

57:10.120 --> 57:16.360
nuclear war. Sure. That's one of the perhaps less bad ones. Green goo through synthetic biology,

57:16.360 --> 57:26.120
very bad, will turn, you know, destroy all organic matter through, you know, it's basically like a

57:26.120 --> 57:32.360
biological paperclip maximizer also bad, or AI type, you know, mass extinction thing as well

57:32.360 --> 57:38.120
would also be better listening. There's a robot right behind you. Okay, wait. So let me ask you

57:38.120 --> 57:42.120
about this from a game theory perspective. Do you think we're living in a simulation?

57:42.120 --> 57:45.640
Do you think we're living inside a video game created by somebody else?

57:47.960 --> 57:51.560
Well, so what was the second part of the question? Do I think we're living in a simulation and

57:52.440 --> 57:59.480
a simulation that is observed by somebody for purpose of entertainment? So like a video game,

57:59.480 --> 58:05.320
are we listening? Are we because there's a it's like Phil Hellmuth type of situation, right? Like

58:07.160 --> 58:12.360
there's a creepy level of like, this is kind of fun and interesting.

58:13.560 --> 58:19.000
Like there's a lot of interesting stuff going on. I mean, that could be somehow integrated into the

58:19.000 --> 58:25.240
evolutionary process where the way we perceive and are you asking me if I believe in God?

58:25.960 --> 58:34.440
Sounds like it. Kind of, but God seems to be not optimizing in the different formulations of God

58:34.440 --> 58:41.240
that we conceive of. He doesn't seem to be, or she, optimizing for like personal entertainment.

58:43.000 --> 58:49.160
Maybe the older gods did, but the, you know, just like basically like a teenager in their mom's

58:49.240 --> 58:55.880
basement, watching, create a fun universe to observe what kind of crazy shit might happen.

58:56.760 --> 59:03.560
Okay. So to try and answer this, do I think there is some kind of

59:06.760 --> 59:14.920
extraneous intelligence to like our, you know, classic measurable universe that we, you know,

59:14.920 --> 59:25.800
can measure with current physics and instruments? I think so, yes. Partly because I've had just

59:25.800 --> 59:32.840
small little bits of evidence in my own life, which have made me question like, so I was a die

59:32.840 --> 59:40.200
hard atheist even five years ago. You know, I got into like the rationality community, big fan of

59:41.000 --> 59:50.040
less wrong, continue to be, incredible resource. But I've just started to have too many little

59:53.320 --> 01:00:00.360
snippets of experience, which don't make sense with the current sort of purely materialistic

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:07.160
explanation of how reality works.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.600
Isn't that just like a humbling, practical realization that we don't know how reality works?

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240
Isn't that just a reminder to yourself?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.280
Yeah, no, it's a reminder of epistemic humility because I fell too hard, you know, same as people

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.960
like, I think, you know, many people who are just like, my religion is the way this is the correct

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.440
way. This is the work. This is the law. You are immoral if you don't follow this, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.440
I think they are lacking epistemic humility. They're a little too much hubris there.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But similarly, I think that sort of the Richard Dawkins brand of atheism is too rigid as well and

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.720
doesn't, you know, there's a way to try and navigate these questions, which still honors

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.880
the scientific method, which I still think is our best sort of realm of like reasonable inquiry,

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:03.400
you know, a method of inquiry. So, an example. I have two kind of notable examples that like

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:13.080
really rattled my cage. The first one was actually in 2010, quite early on in my poker career.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.960
Remember the Icelandic volcano that erupted that like shut down kind of all Atlantic airspace?

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.120
And it meant I got stuck down in the south of France. I was there for something else.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.720
And I couldn't get home. And someone said, well, there's a big poker tournament happening in Italy.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Maybe do you want to go? I was like, all right, sure. Like, let's, you know, got a train across,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.400
found a way to get there. And the buy-in was 5,000 euros, which was much bigger than my bankroll

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:47.000
would normally allow. And so I played a feeder tournament, won my way in, kind of like I did

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.440
with the Monte Carlo big one. So then I won my way, you know, from 500 euros into 5,000 euros

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:58.840
to play this thing. And on day one of then the big tournament, which turned out to have,

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.160
it was the biggest tournament ever held in Europe at the time. It got over like 1,200 people,

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.000
absolutely huge. And I remember they dimmed the lights before, you know, the normal shuffle up

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.080
and deal to tell everyone to start playing. And they played chemical brothers, hey boy, hey girl,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.000
which I don't know why it's notable, but it was just like a really, it was a song I always liked.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.200
It was like one of these like pump me up songs. And I was sitting there thinking, oh yeah,

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.840
it's exciting. I'm playing this really big tournament. And out of nowhere, just suddenly

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.000
this voice in my head, just, and it sounded like my own sort of, you know, when you say you think

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.880
in your mind, you hear a voice kind of, right? At least I do. And so it sounded like my own voice

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.240
and it said, you are going to win this tournament. And it was so powerful that I got this like wave

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.440
of like, you know, sort of goosebumps down my body. And I even, I remember looking around being

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.480
like, did anyone else hear that? And obviously people are in their phones like no, no one else

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:59.320
heard it. And I was like, okay. Six days later, I win the fucking tournament out of 1,200 people.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:14.120
And I said, I don't know how to explain it. Okay. Yes. Maybe I have that feeling before every time

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.640
I play. And it's just that I happen to, you know, because I won the tournament, I retroactively

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:24.840
remembered it, but- Or the feeling gave you a kind of, now from the film Hellmuthian.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.200
Well, exactly. Like it gave you a confident, a deep confidence.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.880
And it did. It definitely did. Like, I remember then feeling this like sort of,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.880
well, although I remember then on day one, I then went and lost half my stack quite early on. And

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.120
I remember thinking like, oh, that was bullshit. You know, what kind of premonition is this?

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.640
Thinking, oh, I'm out. But, you know, I managed to like keep it together and recover. And then,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.840
and then just went like pretty perfectly from then on. And either way, it definitely instilled

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.040
me with this confidence. And I don't want to put a, I don't, I can't put an explanation like,

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:03.240
you know, was it some, you know, huge extra, extra, you know, supernatural thing driving me?

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.880
Or was it just my own self-confidence and so on that just made me make the right decisions?

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.000
I don't know. And I don't, I'm not going to put a frame on it. And I think-

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.160
I think I know a good explanation. So we're a bunch of NPCs living in this world created by,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.000
in the simulation. And then people, not people, creatures from outside of the simulation,

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.440
sort of can tune in and play your character. And that feeling you got is somebody just like,

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.160
they got to play a poker tournament through you.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.360
Honestly, it felt like that. It did actually feel a little bit like that,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.720
but it's been 12 years now. I've retold the story many times. Like I don't even know how much I can

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.520
trust my memory. You're just an NPC retelling the same story, because they just played the tournament

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.640
and left. Yeah, they're like, oh, that was fun. Cool. Yeah, cool. Next. And now you're for the

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.720
rest of your life left as a boring NPC retelling this story to greatness.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.240
But it was, and what was interesting was that after that, then I didn't obviously win a major

01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.760
tournament for quite a long time. And it left, that was, that was actually another sort of dark

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.840
period because I had this incredible, like the highs of winning that, you know, just on a like

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.520
material level were insane, winning the money. I was on the front page of newspapers because

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.920
there was like this girl that came out of nowhere and won this big thing. And so again, like sort

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.200
of chasing that feeling was, was difficult. But then on top of that, there was this feeling of

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:25.640
like almost being touched by something bigger that was like, oh. So maybe did you have a sense

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:36.680
that I might be somebody special? Like this kind of, I think that's the confidence thing that

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.360
maybe you could do something special in this world after all kind of feeling.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.160
Definitely. I mean, this is a thing I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right?

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:54.760
We all, we are truly the protagonists in our own lives. And so it's a natural bias, human bias to

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:01.560
feel, to feel special. And I think, and in some ways we are special. Every single person is

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.120
special because you are that, the universe does, the world literally does revolve around you.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.160
That's the thing in some respect. But of course, if you then zoom out and take the amalgam of

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.560
everyone's experiences, then no, it doesn't. So there is this shared sort of objective reality,

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.160
but sorry, this objective reality that is shared, but then there's also this subjective reality,

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.480
which is truly unique to you. And I think both of those things coexist and it's not like one is

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.120
correct and one isn't. And again, anyone who's like, oh no, your lived experience is everything

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.680
versus your lived experience is nothing. No, it's a blend between these two things. They can

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.760
exist concurrently. But there's a certain kind of sense that at least I've had my whole life. And

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.280
I think a lot of people have this, it's like, well, I'm just like this little person.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.640
Surely I can't be one of those people that do the big thing, right? There's all these big people

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:56.120
doing big things. There's big actors and actresses, big musicians, there's big business owners and all

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:02.360
that kind of stuff, scientists and so on. I have my own subjective experience that I enjoy and so on,

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:10.360
but there's a different layer. Surely I can't do those great things. One of the things just

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:19.240
having interacted with a lot of great people, I realized, no, they're just the same humans as me.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.200
And that realization, I think, is really empowering. To remind yourself-

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:24.920
But are they?

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.240
Huh?

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:25.880
But are they?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.760
Are they? Well, in terms-

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.800
Depends on some, yeah.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.720
They're like a bag of insecurities and

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:44.520
peculiar sort of like their own little weirdnesses and so on. I should say also not,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:55.080
they have the capacity for brilliance, but they're not generically brilliant. We tend to say

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.160
this person or that person is brilliant, but really, no, they're just like sitting there

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:07.480
and thinking through stuff, just like the rest of us. I think they're in the habit of thinking

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.960
through stuff seriously, and they've built up a habit of not allowing their mind to get trapped

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.160
in a bunch of bullshit and minutiae of day-to-day life. They really think big ideas, but those big

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:27.080
ideas, it's like allowing yourself the freedom to think big, to realize that you can be one

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.160
that actually solved this particular big problem. First, identify a big problem that you care about,

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:37.160
then I can actually be the one that solves this problem, and allowing yourself to believe that.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.680
And I think sometimes you do need to have that shock go through your body,

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.760
and a voice tells you, you're going to win this tournament.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:51.080
Well, exactly, and whether it was, it's this idea of useful fictions. So again,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.440
like going through the classic rationalist training of Less Wrong, where it's like,

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:02.600
you want your map, the image you have of the world in your head to as accurately match up with how

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.880
the world actually is. You want the map and the territory to perfectly align. You want it to be

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.800
as an accurate representation as possible. I don't know if I fully subscribe to that anymore,

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.240
having now had these moments of feeling of something either bigger or just actually just

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:29.080
being overconfident. There is value in overconfidence sometimes. If you take Magnus Carlsen,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.600
I'm sure from a young age, he knew he was very talented, but I wouldn't be surprised if he also

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.160
had something in him to, well, actually, maybe he's a bad example because he truly is the world's

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.640
greatest. But someone who, it was unclear whether they were going to be the world's greatest, but

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:51.320
ended up doing extremely well because they had this innate, deep self-confidence, this even

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.960
overblown idea of how good their relative skill level is. That gave them the confidence to then

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.040
pursue this thing with the kind of focus and dedication that it requires to excel in whatever

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:09.080
it is you're trying to do. There are these useful fictions, and that's where I think I diverge

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:19.080
slightly with the classic sort of rationalist community because that's a field that is worth

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:26.440
studying of what the stories we tell to ourselves, even if they are actually false, and even if we

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.920
suspect they might be false, how it's better to sort of have that little bit of faith,

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.160
value in faith, I think, actually. That's partly another thing that's now led me to explore

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.120
the concept of God, whether you want to call it a simulator, the classic theological thing.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.200
I think we're all elucidating to the same thing. Now, I'm not saying, because obviously,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:56.040
the Christian God is all benevolent, endless love. The simulation, at least one of the simulation

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.720
hypotheses is like, as you said, like a teenager in his bedroom who doesn't really care, doesn't

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.920
give a shit about the individuals within there. It just wants to see how the thing plays out

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.200
because it's curious and it could turn it off like that. Where on the sort of psychopathy to

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:20.440
benevolent spectrum God is, I don't know, but having a little bit of faith that there is

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:26.040
something else out there that might be interested in our outcome is, I think, an essential thing,

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.280
actually, for people to find. A, because it creates commonality between. It's something we

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.520
can all share and it is uniquely humbling of all of us to an extent. It's like a common objective.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.880
But B, it gives people that little bit of reserve when things get really dark. I do think things

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:50.200
are going to get pretty dark over the next few years. To think that there's something

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.960
out there that actually wants our game to keep going. I keep calling it the game.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:03.560
It's a thing C and I, we call it the game. You and C is, aka Grimes, we call what the game?

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.600
Everything, the whole thing? Yeah, we joke about like.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.200
Everything is a game. Well, the universe. What if it's a game

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.600
and the goal of the game is to figure out either how to beat it, how to get out of it?

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:23.320
Maybe this universe is an escape room, like a giant escape room, and the goal is to figure out,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.320
put all the pieces of puzzle, figure out how it works in order to unlock this hyperdimensional

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.840
key and get out beyond what it is. So you're saying it's like different levels and it's like

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.640
a cage within a cage within a cage. One cage at a time, you figure out how to escape that.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.280
And you level up. Us becoming multi-planetary would be a level up or us figuring out how to

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.160
upload our consciousnesses to the thing. That would probably be a leveling up. Or spiritually,

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.560
humanity becoming more combined and less adversarial and bloodthirsty and us becoming

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.720
a little bit more enlightened. That would be a leveling up. There's many different frames to it,

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:09.800
whether it's physical, digital, or metaphysical. I think level one for Earth is probably

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:17.640
the biological evolutionary process. It's like going from single cell organisms to early humans.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:24.280
Then maybe level two is whatever is happening inside our minds and creating ideas and creating

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:33.560
technologies. That's like evolutionary process of ideas. And then multi-planetary is interesting.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.920
Is that fundamentally different from what we're doing here on Earth?

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.000
Probably, because it allows us to exponentially scale.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:54.200
It delays the Malthusian trap. It's a way to make the playing field get larger so that it can

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.240
accommodate more of our stuff, more of us. And that's a good thing, but I don't know if it

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:07.720
fully solves this issue of this thing called Moloch, which we haven't talked about yet,

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.600
which is basically, I call it the god of unhealthy competition.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.400
Yeah. Let's go to Moloch. What's Moloch? You did a great video on Moloch,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.280
one aspect of it, the application of it to one aspect.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.280
Instagram beauty filters. Very niche. I wanted to start off small.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:39.320
So Moloch was originally coined as well. Apparently back in the Canaanite times,

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.200
it was this ancient Carthaginian. I can never say Carthaginian. Somewhere around 300 BC or 200 AD,

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:53.560
I don't know. There was supposedly this death cult who would sacrifice their children to this

01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.120
awful demon god thing they called Moloch in order to get power to win wars. So really dark,

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.560
horrible things. And it was literally about child sacrifice. Whether they actually existed or not,

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.800
we don't know, but in mythology they did. And this god that they worshiped was this thing called

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:14.040
Moloch. And then, I don't know, it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history in terms of

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:24.840
mythology beyond that. Until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about, you see that

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.400
there was this incredible futuristic city that everyone was living great in. But then the

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.400
protagonist goes underground into the sewers and sees that the city is run by this machine.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.920
And this machine basically would just kill the workers all the time because it was just so hard

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.840
to keep it running. They were always dying. So there was all this suffering that was required

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.440
in order to keep the city going. And then the protagonist has this vision that this machine is

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:52.120
actually this demon Moloch. So again, it's like this sort of mechanistic consumption of humans in

01:15:52.120 --> 01:16:00.520
order to get more power. And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s, which incredible poem

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:07.880
called Howl about this thing Moloch. And a lot of people sort of quite understandably take the

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:14.120
interpretation of that he's talking about capitalism. But then the sort of piece to

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.240
resistance that's moved Moloch into this idea of game theory was Scott Alexander of Slate-style

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.920
Codex. Wrote this incredible, literally, I think it might be my favorite piece of writing of all

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:30.120
time. It's called Meditations on Moloch. Everyone must go read it. And-

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.720
I say Codex is a blog.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.920
It's a blog, yes. We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.600
No, don't.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:44.120
Yes, yes. But I like how you assume I have a professional operation going on here.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:44.760
I mean-

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.200
I shall try to remember to-

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.960
You heard it too. You're giving the impression of it.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.880
Yeah, yeah. Please, if I don't, please somebody in the comments remind me.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.680
I'll help you.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:01.160
If you don't know this blog, it's one of the best blogs ever, probably. You should probably be

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.480
following it. Are blogs still a thing? I think they are still a thing, yeah.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.920
Yeah, he's migrated onto Substack, but yeah, it's still a blog. Anyway-

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.320
Substack, better not fuck things up, but-

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.000
I hope not, yeah. I hope they don't turn Moloch-y,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.080
which will mean something to people when we continue.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.400
When I stop interrupting for once, that's a good point, yeah.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.040
So anyway, so he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch, and basically,

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.520
he analyzes the poem and he's like, okay, so it seems to be something relating to

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:37.240
where competition goes wrong. And Moloch was historically this thing of where people would

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.640
sacrifice a thing that they care about, in this case, children, their own children,

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:48.760
in order to gain power, a competitive advantage. And if you look at almost everything that goes

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.240
wrong in our society, it's that same process. So with the Instagram beauty filters thing,

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:03.960
if you're trying to become a famous Instagram model, you are incentivized to post the hottest

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.880
pictures of yourself that you can. You're trying to play that game. There's a lot of hot women

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.880
on Instagram. How do you compete against them? You post really hot pictures, and that's how you

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:20.040
get more likes. As technology gets better, more makeup techniques come along. And then more

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.680
recently, these beauty filters, where at the touch of a button, it makes your face look absolutely

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:32.680
incredible compared to your natural face. These technologies come along. Everyone is incentivized

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:40.440
to that short-term strategy. But on net, it's bad for everyone because now everyone is feeling like

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.800
they have to use these things. And these things, they make you. The reason why I talked about them

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:48.760
in this video is because I noticed it myself. I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while. I've

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.880
given up on it now. And I noticed these filters, how good they made me look. And I'm like, well,

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:59.240
I know that everyone else is kind of doing it. Go subscribe to Liv's Instagram. Please,

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.680
so I don't have to use the filters. Post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.600
You've felt the pressure, actually. Exactly. These short-term incentives to do this thing

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:18.760
that either sacrifices your integrity or something else in order to stay competitive,

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:25.880
which on aggregate creates this race to the bottom spiral where everyone else ends up in a

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:32.440
situation which is worse off than if they hadn't started, than they were before. At a football

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:38.040
stadium, the system is so badly designed, a competitive system of everyone sitting and

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.520
having a view, that if someone at the very front stands up to get an even better view, it forces

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.080
everyone else behind to adopt that same strategy just to get to where they were before. But now

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.280
everyone's stuck standing up. So you need this top-down, God's-eye coordination to make it go

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:56.280
back to the better state. But from within the system, you can't actually do that. So that's

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.800
kind of what this Molek thing is. It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values in order to

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:06.840
optimize for winning the game in question, the short-term game. But this Molek,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.640
can you attribute it to any one centralized source or is it an emergent phenomena from

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:21.000
a large collection of people? Exactly that. It's an emergent phenomena. It's a force of game theory.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:28.280
It's a force of bad incentives on a multi-agent system. Prisoner's Dilemma is technically a kind

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.880
of Molek-y system as well, but it's just a two-player thing. But another word for Molek is

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.760
multipolar trap, where basically you've just got a lot of different people all competing for some

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:45.080
kind of prize. It would be better if everyone didn't do this one shitty strategy, but because

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.840
that strategy gives you a short-term advantage, everyone's incentivized to do it and so everyone

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:56.040
ends up doing it. Social media is a really nice place for a large number of people to play game

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:04.760
theory. They also have the ability to then design the rules of the game. Is it on them to try to

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.120
anticipate, like to do the thing that poker players are doing, to run simulation?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.680
Ideally, that would have been great. If Mark Zuckerberg and Jack and all the Twitter founders

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:24.360
and everyone, if they had at least just run a few simulations of how different types of algorithms

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:29.080
would turn out for society, that would have been great. That's really difficult to do that kind of

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:38.840
deep philosophical thinking about humanity, actually. Not this level of how do we optimize

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:45.400
engagement or what brings people joy in the short term, but how is this thing going to change the

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:53.960
way people see the world? How is it going to get morphed and iterative games played into something

01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:01.560
that will change society forever? That requires some deep thinking. I hope there's meetings like

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.080
that inside companies, but I haven't seen them. There aren't. That's the problem. It's difficult

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:12.840
because when you're starting up a social media company, you're aware that you've got investors

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:21.000
to please, there's bills to pay, there's only so much R&D you can afford to do. You've got all these

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.080
incredible pressures and bad incentives to get on and just build your thing as quickly as possible

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:31.640
and start making money. I don't think anyone intended when they built these social media

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:37.240
platforms, and just to preface it, the reason why social media is relevant because it's a very good

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:44.120
example of everyone these days is optimizing for clicks, whether it's the social media platforms

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:50.280
themselves because every click gets more impressions and impressions pay for, they get advertising

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:55.960
dollars, or whether it's individual influencers, or whether it's the New York Times or whoever,

01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.120
they're trying to get their story to go viral. Everyone's got this bad incentive of using,

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.280
as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex. That's a very monarchy system because

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.960
everyone is now using worse and worse tactics in order to try and win this attention game.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:18.680
Ideally, these companies would have had enough slack in the beginning in order to run these

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.480
experiments to see, okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong for people? What are the

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.040
ways that Moloch, they should be aware of this concept of Moloch and realize that whenever you

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.240
have a highly competitive multi-agent system, which social media is a classic example of, millions of

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.800
agents all trying to compete for likes and so on, and you try and bring all this complexity down

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:45.720
into very small metrics such as number of likes, number of retweets, whatever the algorithm

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.440
optimizes for, that is a guaranteed recipe for this stuff to go wrong and become a race to the

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:55.160
bottom. I think there should be an honesty when founders, I think there's a hunger for that kind

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.560
of transparency of like, we don't know what the fuck we're doing, this is a fascinating experiment,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:06.040
we're all running as a human civilization, let's try this out. And actually just be honest about

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.440
this, that we're all like these weird rats in a maze, none of us are controlling it. There's

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:18.440
a kind of sense like the founders, the CEO of Instagram or whatever, Mark Zuckerberg has a

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:23.720
control and he's like with strings playing people. No, they're- He's at the mercy of this

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:29.640
like everyone else, he's just trying to do his best. And I think putting on a smile and doing

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.480
over polished videos about how Instagram and Facebook are good for you, I think is not the

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.880
right way to actually ask some of the deepest questions we get to ask as a society. How do we

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.640
design the game such that we build a better world? I think a big part of this as well is

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:58.360
people, there's this philosophy particularly in Silicon Valley of well, techno-optimism,

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:04.040
technology will solve all our issues. And there's a steel man argument to that where yes, technology

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.320
has solved a lot of problems and can potentially solve a lot of future ones. But it can also,

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.320
it's always a double-edged sword and particularly as technology gets more and more powerful and

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.760
we've now got big data and we're able to do all kinds of psychological manipulation with it and

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:26.840
so on. Technology is not a values neutral thing. People think, I used to always think this myself,

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.520
it's like this naive view that, oh, technology is completely neutral. It's the humans that either

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.880
make it good or bad. No, to the point we're at now, the technology that we are creating,

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:45.560
they are social technologies. They literally dictate how humans now form social groups and so

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.240
on beyond that. And beyond that, that gives rise to the memes that we then coalesce around.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.240
If you have the stack that way where it's technology driving social interaction, which then

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:05.880
drives memetic culture and which ideas become popular, that's Moloch. And we need the other

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.920
way around. We need it so we need to figure out what are the good memes, what are the good

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:18.520
values that we think we need to optimize for that makes people happy and healthy and keeps

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.840
society as robust and safe as possible, then figure out what the social structure around

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.280
those should be. And only then do we figure out technology. But if we're doing the other way

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:34.120
around, and as much as I love, in many ways, the culture of Silicon Valley, and I do think

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.360
that technology, I don't want to knock it, it's done so many wonderful things for us, same as

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:46.040
capitalism. We have to be honest with ourselves. We're getting to a point where we are losing

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.960
control of this very powerful machine that we have created. Can you redesign the machine within

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:59.800
the game? Can you understand the game enough? Okay, this is the game. And this is how we

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:06.280
start to reemphasize the memes that matter, the memes that bring out the best in us.

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:15.800
The way I try to be in real life and the way I try to be online is to be about kindness and love.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.880
I feel like I'm sometimes criticized for being naive and all those kinds of things,

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.720
but I feel like I'm just trying to live within this game.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.680
Trying to be authentic.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:32.600
Yeah, but also like, hey, it's kind of fun to do this. You guys should try this too.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:41.560
And that's like trying to redesign some aspects of the game within the game. Is that possible?

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:48.440
I don't know, but I think we should try. I don't think we have an option but to try.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.320
Well, the other option is to create new companies or to pressure companies

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.840
or anyone who has control of the rules of the game.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.560
I think we need to be doing all of the above. I think we need to be thinking hard about what

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:12.360
are the kind of positive, healthy memes. As Elon said, he who controls the memes controls

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:19.720
the universe. But there's truth to that. There is wisdom in that because

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:26.360
memes have driven history. We are a cultural species. That's what sets us apart from

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.800
chimpanzees and everything else. We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:39.480
as opposed to biology or classic physical constraints. That means culture is incredibly

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:46.920
powerful and we can create and become victim to very bad memes or very good ones. But we do

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:53.320
have some agency over which memes we not only put out there, but we also subscribe to.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:03.000
So I think we need to take that approach. I'm making this video right now called The

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.920
Attention Wars, which is about how the media machine is this kind of blind, dumb thing

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.160
where everyone is optimizing for engagement in order to win their share of the attention pie.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.560
And then if you zoom out, it's really like Moloch that's pulling the strings because the only thing

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.800
that benefits from this in the end. Our information ecosystem is breaking down.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.720
You look at the state of the U.S., we're in a civil war. It's just not a physical war.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.040
It's an information war and people are becoming more fractured in terms of what their actual

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:42.680
shared reality is. An extreme left person, an extreme right person, they literally live in

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.760
different worlds in their minds at this point and it's getting more and more amplified. This force

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:53.240
is like a razor blade pushing through everything. It doesn't matter how innocuous a topic is,

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:58.120
it will find a way to split into this bifurcated culture war. And it's fucking terrifying.

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:05.400
Because that maximizes attention. That's like an emergent Moloch type force that takes anything,

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:12.040
any topic and cuts through it so that it can split nicely into two groups.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:20.040
What everyone is trying to do within the system is just maximize whatever gets them

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.400
the most attention because they're just trying to make money so they can keep their thing going.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.760
The best emotion for getting attention, because it's not just about attention on the internet,

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.280
it's engagement. That's the key thing. In order for something to go viral,

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.280
you need people to actually engage with it. They need to comment or retweet or whatever.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:46.520
And of all the emotions, there's like seven classic shared emotions that studies have

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:52.840
found that all humans, even from previously uncontacted tribes, have. Some of those are

01:30:52.840 --> 01:31:01.640
negative, like sadness, disgust, anger, etc. Some are positive happiness, excitement, and so on.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:09.720
The one that happens to be the most useful for the internet is anger. Because anger, it's such

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:15.320
an active emotion. If you want people to engage, if someone's scared, and I'm not just talking

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:21.560
out my ass here, there are studies here that have looked into this. Whereas if someone's disgusted

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.080
or fearful, they actually tend to then be like, oh, I don't want to deal with this. So they're

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.280
less likely to actually engage and share it and so on. They're just going to be like, ugh.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:34.840
Whereas if they're enraged by a thing, that triggers all the old tribalism emotions.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:41.720
That's how then things get spread much more easily. They out-compete all the other memes

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:50.120
in the ecosystem. The attention economy, the wheels that make it go around is rage.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.280
The problem with raging against the machine is that the machine has learned to feed off

01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:00.920
rage because it is feeding off our rage. That's the thing that's now keeping it going. The more

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:11.560
we get angry, the worse it gets. The war of attention is constantly maximizing rage.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.400
What it is optimizing for is engagement, and it happens to be. The engagement

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:24.600
is propaganda. It just sounds like more and more things are being put through this

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:30.040
propagandist lens of winning whatever the war is in question, whether it's the culture war or the

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:36.200
Ukraine war. Well, I think the silver lining of this, do you think it's possible that in the long

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:42.760
arc of this process, you actually do arrive at greater wisdom and more progress? In the moment,

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:48.520
it feels like people are tearing each other to shreds over ideas. But if you think about it,

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:53.160
one of the magic things about democracy and so on is you have the blue versus red constantly

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:59.720
fighting. It's almost like they're in this course, creating devil's advocate,

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.280
making devils out of each other, and through that process, discussing ideas,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.800
almost really embodying different ideas just to yell at each other, and through the yelling,

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:16.120
over the period of decades, maybe centuries, figuring out a better system. In the moment,

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.880
it feels fucked up, but in the long arc, it actually is productive.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:30.360
I hope so. That said, we are now in the era of, just as we have weapons of mass destruction

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:37.560
with nuclear weapons that can break the whole playing field, we now are developing weapons

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.960
of informational mass destruction, information weapons, WMDs that basically can be used for

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:52.040
propaganda or just manipulating people however it's needed, whether that's through dumb TikTok

01:33:52.040 --> 01:34:01.960
videos. There are significant resources being put in. I don't mean to sound too doom and loom,

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.120
but there are bad actors out there. That's the thing. There are plenty of good actors within

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.480
the system who are just trying to stay afloat in the game, so we're effectively doing monarchy

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.840
things, but then on top of that, we have actual bad actors who are intentionally trying to

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.600
manipulate the other side into doing things. Because it's a digital space, they're able to use

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.880
artificial actors, meaning bots. Exactly, botnets. This is a whole new

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.920
situation that we've never had before. It's exciting. You know what I want to do?

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:42.360
Because people are talking about bots manipulating and malicious bots that are basically spreading

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.400
propaganda. I want to create a bot army that fights that. For love?

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:56.920
Yeah, exactly. For love. There's truth to fight fire with fire, but you always have to be careful

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:03.240
whenever you create, again, Moloch is very tricky. Yeah, Hitler was trying to spread the love too.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.880
Yeah, sorry, Thor. I agree with you that that is a thing that should be considered, but there is,

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:19.080
again, the road to hell is paved in good intentions. There's always unforeseen outcomes,

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.400
externalities of you trying to adopt a thing, even if you do it in the very best of faith.

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.880
But you can learn lessons of history. If you can run some Sims on it first, absolutely.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:32.920
But also, there's certain aspects of a system, as we've learned through history, that

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:39.560
do better than others. For example, don't have a dictator. If I were to create this bot army,

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.680
it's not good for me to have full control over it. Because in the beginning, I might have a good

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:49.320
understanding of what's good and not. But over time, that starts to get deviated because I'll

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.160
get annoyed at some assholes and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice to get rid of those

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:57.320
assholes? But then that power starts getting to your head. You become corrupted. That's basic

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:07.240
human nature. So distribute the power somehow. We need a love botnet on a dow. A dow love botnet.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.800
And without a leader. Exactly, distributed, without any kind of centralized...

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.280
Basically, the more control, the more you can decentralize the control of a thing

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:27.800
to people. But then you still need the ability to coordinate because that's the issue.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:39.160
The bigger war we're dealing with is actually between... I don't know what even the term is

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:45.320
for it, but centralization versus decentralization. That's the tension we're seeing. Power in control

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.680
by a few versus completely distributed. And the trouble is if you have a fully centralized thing,

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.120
then you're at risk of tyranny, Stalin type things can happen, or completely distributed.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.400
Now you're at risk of complete anarchy and chaos where you can't even coordinate

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.720
when there's a pandemic or anything like that. So it's like, what is the right balance to strike

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.320
between these two structures? Can't Malik really take hold in a fully decentralized system? That's

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.560
one of the dangers too. Yes, very vulnerable to Malik. A dictator can commit huge atrocities,

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:24.680
but they can also make sure the infrastructure works. They have that God's eye view at least.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:31.400
They have the ability to create laws and rules that force coordination, which stops Malik. But

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:36.280
then you're vulnerable to that dictator getting infected with some kind of psychopathy type thing.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.440
What's reverse Malik?

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:47.240
So great question. So I've been working on this series. It's been driving me insane for the last

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.000
year and a half. I did the first one a year ago. I can't believe it's nearly been a year.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.800
The second one, hopefully we're coming out in like a month. And my goal at the end of the series is

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.120
to present, because basically I'm painting the picture of what Malik is and how it's affecting

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.320
almost all these issues in our society and how it's driving. It's like kind of the generator

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.480
function, as people describe it, of existential risk. And then at the end of that-

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.520
Wait, wait. The generator function of existential risk. So you're saying Malik is the engine that

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.440
creates a bunch of x-risks? Yes, not all of them.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.360
It's a cool phrase. Generator function-

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.800
It's not my phrase. It's Daniel Schmacktenberger. I got that from him.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.600
All things. It's like all roads lead back to Daniel Schmacktenberger, I think.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:38.520
The dude is brilliant. After that, it's Mark Twain. But anyway, sorry,

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.800
totally rude to interrupt this for me. No, it's fine. So not all x-risks. So like

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.880
an asteroid technically isn't because it's just like this one big external thing. It's not like

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:56.840
a competition thing going on. But synthetic bioweapons, that's one because everyone's

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:03.080
incentivized to build, even for defense, bad viruses just to threaten someone else,

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.720
et cetera. Or AI, technically, the race to AGI is kind of potentially a Maliki situation.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:16.920
But yeah, so if Malik is this generator function that's driving all of these issues over the

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.440
coming century that might wipe us out, what's the inverse? And so far, what I've gotten to

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.640
is this character that I want to put out there called Winwin. Because Malik is the god of lose

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:32.040
lose, ultimately. It masquerades as the god of win lose, but in reality, it's lose lose. Everyone

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.000
ends up worse off. So I was like, well, what's the opposite of that? It's Winwin. And I was thinking

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.600
for ages, like, what's a good name for this character? And then the more I was like, okay,

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:47.880
don't try and think through it logically. What's the vibe of Winwin? And to me, like in my mind,

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.840
Malik is like, and I dress as it in the video, like, it's red and black. It's kind of like very,

01:39:54.120 --> 01:40:01.000
you know, hyper focused on its one goal, you must win. So Winwin is kind of actually like these

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.200
colors. It's like purple turquoise. It loves games too. It loves a little bit of healthy competition,

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.920
but constrained, like kind of like before, like knows how to ring fence zero sum competition into

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.040
like just the right amount, whereby its externalities can be controlled and kept positive.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.080
And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation, coordination, love, all these other things.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.840
But it's also kind of like mischievous. Like, you know, it will have a good time. It's not like kind

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:34.360
of like boring, you know, like, oh, God, it's, it's, you know, it's how to have fun. It can get like

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:41.480
it can get down. But ultimately, it's unbelievably wise, and it just wants the game to keep going.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:49.800
Um, and I call it Winwin. That's a good like pet name. Yes. The, I think the Winwin, right.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:56.680
And I think its formal name and it has to do like official functions is Omnia. Omnia. Yeah. From

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.840
like omniscience kind of what's why Omnia. You just like Omnia. Omniwin. But I'm open to suggestions.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.960
I would like, you know, and this is like Omnia. Yeah. But there is an angelic kind of sense to Omnia

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:17.240
though. So Winwin is more fun. So it's more like it embraces the fun aspect. I mean, there is

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:27.080
something about sort of, there's some aspect to Winwin interactions that requires embracing

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:35.080
the chaos of the game and enjoying the game itself. I don't know. I don't know what that is.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:41.400
That's almost like a Zen like appreciation of the game itself, not optimizing for the consequences

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:47.400
of the game. Right. Well, it's recognizing the value of competition in of itself about it's not

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.800
like about winning. It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition and not knowing

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.440
whether you're going to win or lose this little thing. But then also being aware that, you know,

01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.000
what's the boundary? How big do I want competition to be? Because one of the reasons why Moloch is

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.600
doing so well now in our civilization is because we haven't been able to ring fence competition.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.400
And so it's just having all these negative externalities and we've completely lost

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:20.840
control of it. I think my guess is, and now we're getting really like metaphysical technically,

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:27.800
but I think we'll be in a more interesting universe if we have one that has both

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.800
pure cooperation, lots of cooperation and some pockets of competition than one that's purely

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.920
cooperation entirely. Like it's good to have some little zero-sum-ness bits,

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.960
but I don't know that fully and I'm not qualified as a philosopher to know that.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:50.520
And that's what reverse Moloch, so this kind of win-win creature system is an antidote to the

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.960
Moloch system. Yes. And I don't know how it's going to do that.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.000
But it's good to kind of try to start to formulate different ideas, different frameworks of how we

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.040
think about that. Exactly. At the small scale of a collection of individuals, a large scale of a

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:14.600
society. Exactly. It's a meme. I think it's an example of a good meme. And I'd love to hear

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.800
feedback from people if they think they have a better idea or it's not, but it's the direction

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.200
of memes that we need to spread, this idea of like, look for the win-wins in life.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.240
Well, on the topic of beauty filters, so in that particular context where Moloch creates

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:38.840
negative consequences, Dostoevsky said, beauty will save the world. What is beauty anyway?

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:48.280
It would be nice to try to discuss what kind of thing we would like to converge towards

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.880
in our understanding of what is beautiful.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:07.160
So to me, I think something is beautiful when it can't be reduced down to easy metrics. Like,

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.360
if you think of a tree, what is it about a tree, like a big, ancient, beautiful tree, right? What

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:21.800
is it about it that we find so beautiful? It's not the sweetness of its fruit or the value of

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:31.400
its lumber. It's this entirety of it. There's these immeasurable qualities. It's almost like

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:41.240
a qualia of it. It's got lots of patenicity, but it's not overly predictable. Again,

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.160
it walks this fine line between order and chaos. It's a very highly complex system.

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:54.200
It's evolving over time. The definition of a complex versus, and this is another Schmackenberger

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:59.640
thing, a complex versus a complicated system. A complicated system can be sort of broken down

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.840
into bits, understood, and then put back together. A complex system is kind of like a black box.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.160
It does all this crazy stuff, but if you take it apart, you can't put it back together again,

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:14.840
because there's all these intricacies. Also, very importantly, there's some of the parts,

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:20.440
sorry, the sum of the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. That's where the beauty lies,

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:27.480
I think. I think that extends to things like art as well. There's something immeasurable about it.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.720
There's something we can't break down to a narrow metric. Does that extend to humans, you think?

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:39.160
Yeah, absolutely. How can Instagram reveal that kind of beauty, the complexity of a human being?

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:45.080
Good question. This takes us back to dating sites and Goodreads, I think.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:55.800
Very good question. I know what it shouldn't do. Right now, I was talking to a social media

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.800
expert recently because I was like, I hate- There's such a thing as a social media expert?

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:04.440
Oh, yeah. There are agencies out there that you can outsource because I'm thinking about

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:11.720
working with one. I want to start a podcast. You should. You should have done it a long time ago.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.760
Working on it. It's going to be called Win Win. It's going to be about this positive stuff.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.560
The thing that they always come back and say is like, well, you need to figure out what your thing

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:30.280
is. You need to narrow down what your thing is and then just follow that. Have a formula

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.200
because that's what people want. They want to know that they're coming back to the same thing.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:41.320
The advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it. The trouble with that is that it's a complexity

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.280
reduction. Generally speaking, complexity reduction is bad. It's making things more-

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:52.120
It's an oversimplification. Not that simplification is a bad thing, but when you're trying to

01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.520
take- What is social media doing? It's trying to encapsulate the human experience and put it into

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:07.960
digital form and commodify it to an extent. You do that. You compress people down into these

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:14.440
narrow things. That's why I think it's ultimately fundamentally incompatible with at least my

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:18.360
definition of beauty. It's interesting because there is some sense in which

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.920
a simplification in the Einstein sense of a really complex idea,

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.440
a simplification in a way that still captures some core power of an idea of a person is also

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:44.520
beautiful. Maybe it's possible for social media to do that. A presentation, a slither, a slice,

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:51.800
a look into a person's life that reveals something real about them, but in a simple way,

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:58.920
in a way that can be displayed graphically or through words. In some way, Twitter can do that

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:05.240
kind of thing. A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies of a person. Of course,

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:14.600
the viral machine that spreads those words often results in people taking the thing out of context.

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:20.680
The people often don't read tweets in the context of the human being that wrote them.

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:28.280
The full history of the tweets they've written, the education level, the humor level, the world

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.240
view they're playing around with, all that context is forgotten and people just see the different

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.520
words. That can lead to trouble. In a certain sense, if you do take it in context, it reveals

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:47.000
some kind of quirky little beautiful idea or a profound little idea from that particular person

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.320
that shows something about that person. In that sense, Twitter can be more successful.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.720
If we talk about mollux, it's driving a better kind of incentive.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:07.000
Yeah. Is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm so that it stops being

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:17.720
the fertile breeding ground of the culture wars? That's really what it is. Maybe I'm giving Twitter

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:24.760
too much power, but the more I looked into it and I had a conversation with Tristan Harris

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:31.720
from the Center of Humane Technology and he explained it as Twitter is where you have this

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:37.800
amalgam of human culture and then this terribly designed algorithm that amplifies the craziest

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:47.240
people and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them. Then the media, the mainstream

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.440
media, because all the journalists are also on Twitter, they then are informed by that.

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:58.120
They draw out the stories they can from this already very boiling lava of

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:05.320
of rage and then spread that to their millions and millions of people who aren't even on Twitter.

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.240
Honestly, I think if I could press a button and turn them off, I probably would at this

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.960
point because I just don't see a way of being compatible with healthiness, but that's not going

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:25.160
to happen. At least one way to stem the tide and make it less molluxy would be to

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:33.320
change, at least if it was on a subscription model, then it's now not optimizing for

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.720
impressions because basically what it wants is for people to keep coming back as often as

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:44.040
possible. That's how they get paid, right? Every time an ad gets shown to someone and the way is

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.240
to get people constantly refreshing their feed. You're trying to encourage addictive behaviors.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:56.040
Whereas if they moved on to at least a subscription model, then they're getting

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.840
the money either way, whether someone comes back to the site once a month or 500 times a month,

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:05.720
they get the same amount of money. Now that takes away that incentive to use technology,

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:12.040
to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive. That would be one way, for example.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:17.160
Yeah, but you still want people to... Yeah, I just feel like that just slows down,

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:24.040
creates friction in the virality of things. But that's good. We need to slow down virality.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.680
It's good. It's one way. Virality is molluc, to be clear.

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:36.360
So molluc is always negative then? Yes, by definition.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Yes. But then I disagree with you. Competition is not always negative. Competition is neutral.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:46.280
I disagree with you that all virality is negative then, as molluc then. Because

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:51.800
it's a good intuition because we have a lot of data on virality being negative.

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:59.320
But I happen to believe that the core of human beings... So most human beings want to be good

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:06.520
more than they want to be bad to each other. And so I think it's possible. It might be just harder

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:13.000
to engineer systems that enable virality, but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral,

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:21.240
that enable virality. And the kind of stuff that rises to the top is things that are positive.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:27.560
And positive, not like la la positive. It's more like win-win, meaning a lot of people need to be

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.160
challenged. Wise things.

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:33.160
Yeah. You grow from it. It might challenge you. You might not like it, but you ultimately grow

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:39.880
from it. And ultimately bring people together as opposed to tear them apart. I deeply want that

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:45.480
to be true. And I very much agree with you that people at their core are on average good, care

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.080
for each other as opposed to not. I think it's actually a very small percentage of people are

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:55.320
truly wanting to do destructive, malicious things. Most people are just trying to win

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.720
their own little game. And they don't mean to be... They're just stuck in this badly designed system.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:09.640
That said, the current structure, yes, is... The current structure means that virality is optimized

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.640
towards Moloch. That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions. Sometimes positive stories do go

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:17.240
viral and I think we should study them. I think there should be a whole field of study into

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:24.440
understanding, identifying memes that above a certain threshold of the population agree as a

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:29.560
positive, happy, bringing people together meme, the kind of thing that brings families together

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:35.880
that would normally argue about cultural stuff at the dinner table. Identify those memes and

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:44.600
figure out what was the ingredient that made them spread that day. And also not just happiness

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:50.280
and connection between humans, but connection between humans in other ways that enables

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:55.000
productivity, cooperation, solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff.

01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.880
So it's not just about let's be happy and have fulfilling lives. It's also like, let's build

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:08.760
cool shit. Which is the spirit of collaboration, which is deeply anti-Moloch. It's not using

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.120
competition. Moloch hates collaboration and coordination and people working together.

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:21.400
Again, the internet started out as that and it could have been that. But because of the way it

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:29.240
was structured in terms of very lofty ideal, they wanted everything to be open source and

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.560
also free. But they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway because they were still building

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:38.920
this on top of our old economics system. And so the way they did that was through third party

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:44.120
advertisement. But that meant that things were very decoupled. You've got this third party

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:50.200
interest, which means that you're then people having to optimize for that. And that is the

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:57.320
actual consumer is actually the product, not the person you're making the thing for. In the end,

01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.320
you start making the thing for the advertiser. And so that's why it then breaks down.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:11.240
There's no clean solution to this. And it's a really good suggestion by you actually to

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:19.080
figure out how we can optimize virality for positive sum topics.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:25.320
I shall be the general of the lovebot army. Distributed.

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:31.480
Distributed. Distributed. Okay, yeah. Just even in saying that, the power already went to my head.

01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.760
No. Okay. You've talked about quantifying your thinking. We've been talking about this,

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:42.120
sort of a game theoretic view on life and putting probabilities behind estimates.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.480
Like if you think about different trajectories you can take through life,

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.960
just actually analyzing life in game theoretic way, like your own life, like personal life.

01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.080
I think you've given an example that you had an honest conversation with Igor about like,

01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.200
how long is this relationship going to last? Similar to our sort of marriage problem kind

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:06.520
of discussion, having an honest conversation about the probability of things that we sometimes are a

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:13.000
little bit too shy or scared to think of in a probabilistic terms. Can you speak to that kind

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.920
of way of reasoning, the good and the bad of that? Can you do this kind of thing with human

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:24.840
relations? Yeah. So the scenario you're talking about, it was like-

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.000
Yeah. Tell me about that scenario. Yeah. I think it was about a year into our

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.160
relationship and we were having a fairly heavy conversation because we were trying to figure

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.840
out whether or not I was going to sell my apartment. He'd already moved in, but I think

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:45.640
we were just figuring out what our long-term plans would be. Should we buy a place together,

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.760
et cetera. When you guys are having that conversation, are you like drunk out of your

01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.560
mind on wine or is you sober and you're actually having a serious- I think I'm sober.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.920
How do you get to that conversation? Because most people are kind of afraid to have that kind of

01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:03.160
serious conversation. Well, so our relationship was very, well, first of all, we were good friends

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:12.360
for a couple of years before we even got romantic. And when we did get romantic,

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:18.520
it was very clear that this was a big deal. It wasn't just like another, it wasn't a random thing.

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.760
So the probability of it being a big deal was high.

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:27.400
Was already very high. And then we'd been together for a year and it had been pretty

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:33.720
golden and wonderful. So there was a lot of foundation already where we felt very comfortable

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.920
having a lot of frank conversations. But Igor's MO has always been much more than mine. He was

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:45.240
always from the outset. Just in a relationship, radical transparency and honesty is the way,

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.800
because the truth is the truth whether you want to hide it or not. It will come out eventually.

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:57.240
And if you aren't able to accept difficult things yourself, then how could you possibly

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:03.720
expect to be like the most integral version? The relationship needs this bedrock of like

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.200
honesty as a foundation more than anything. Yeah, that's really interesting. But I would

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:15.000
like to push against some of those ideas, but let's throw them up. I just rudely interrupt.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.520
No, that's fine. And so we'd been about together for a year and things were good.

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:26.200
And we were having this hard conversation. And then he was like, well, okay, what's the likelihood

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:29.480
that we're going to be together in three years then? Because I think it was roughly a three-year

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.520
time horizon. And I was like, oh, interesting. And then we were like, actually, wait, before you said

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:39.320
out loud, let's both write down our predictions formally. Because we were just getting into

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:43.880
effective altruism and rationality at the time, which is all about making formal predictions as a

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:54.760
means of measuring your own foresight, essentially, in a quantified way. So we both wrote down our

01:58:54.760 --> 01:59:00.520
percentages and we also did a one-year prediction and a 10-year one as well. So we got percentages

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.240
for all three. And then we showed each other. And I remember having this moment of like,

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:10.440
because for the 10-year one, I was like, well, I mean, I love him a lot, but a lot can happen

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:16.120
in 10 years. And we've only been together for... So I was like, I think it's over 50%,

01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:19.560
but it's definitely not 90%. And I remember wrestling. I was like, oh, but I don't want him

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.840
to be hurt. I don't want him to... I don't want to give a number lower than his. And I remember

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:28.520
thinking, I was like, don't game it. This is an exercise in radical honesty. So just give

01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.240
your real percentage. And I think mine was like 75%. And then we showed each other. And luckily,

01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:43.480
we were fairly well aligned. But honestly, even if we weren't, it definitely would have... If his

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:48.680
had been consistently lower than mine, that would have rattled me for sure. Whereas if it had been

01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:52.840
the other way around, I think he's just kind of like a water off the duck's back type of guy.

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:57.000
It'd be like, okay, well, all right, we'll figure this out. Well, did you guys provide error bars

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.160
on the estimate? Like the level of uncertainty? They came built in. We didn't give formal plus

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:05.640
or minus error bars. I didn't draw any or anything like that. I guess that's the question I have is,

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:14.360
did you feel informed enough to make such decisions? Because I feel like if I were to

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:23.160
do this kind of thing rigorously, I would want some data. One of the assumptions you have is

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:29.160
you're not that different from other relationships. Right. And so I want to have some data about...

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.760
You want the base rates.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:35.080
Yeah. And also actual trajectories of relationships. I would love to have

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.440
time series data about the ways that relationships fall apart or prosper,

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:51.160
how they collide with different life events, losses, job changes, moving. Both partners find

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:57.320
jobs. The only one has a job. I want that kind of data and how often the different

02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:04.920
trajectories change in life. How informative is your past to your future? That's the whole thing.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:12.600
Can you look at my life and have a good prediction in terms of my characteristics

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.280
of my relationships, what that's going to look like in the future or not? I don't even know

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:20.600
the answer to that question. I'll be very ill informed in terms of making the probability.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:26.520
I would be far... Yeah, I just would be under-informed. I would be under-informed.

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:30.440
I would be over-biasing to my prior experiences, I think.

02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:34.680
Right. But as long as you're aware of that and you're honest with yourself and you're

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.800
honest with the other person and say, look, I have really wide error bars on this for the

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:42.760
following reasons, that's okay. I still think it's better than not trying to quantify it at

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:46.680
all if you're trying to make really major, irreversible life decisions.

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:53.000
I feel also the romantic nature of that question. For me personally, I try to live my life thinking

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:59.880
it's very close to 100%. Allowing myself... Actually, this is the difficulty of this,

02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:06.280
is allowing myself to think differently, I feel has a psychological consequence.

02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:14.360
That's one of my pushbacks against radical honesty, is this one particular perspective.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.040
So you're saying you would rather give a falsely high percentage to your partner.

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.520
Going back to the wise sage film... In order to create this additional optimism.

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.200
Helmuth. Yes.

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.000
Of fake it till you make it, the power of positivity.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.600
Hashtag positivity, yeah. Yeah, hashtag.

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:41.640
Well, so that and this comes back to this idea of useful fictions, right? And I agree. I don't

02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:44.920
think there's a clear answer to this and I think it's actually quite subjective. Some people this

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:51.640
works better for than others. To be clear, Igor and I weren't doing this formal prediction.

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:57.480
And we did it with very much tongue in cheek. It wasn't like we were going to make... I don't

02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:03.240
think it even would have drastically changed what we decided to do even. We just did it more as a

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:09.800
fun exercise. But the consequence of that fun exercise, there was a deep honesty to it too.

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.120
Exactly. And it was just like this moment of reflection. I'm like, oh wow, I actually have

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:22.440
to think through this quite critically and so on. And it's also what was interesting was I got to

02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:28.360
check in with what my desires were. So there was one thing of what my actual prediction is,

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.880
but what are my desires and could these desires be affecting my predictions and so on. And that's a

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.320
method of rationality. And I personally don't think it loses anything in terms of... It didn't

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.800
take any of the magic away from our relationship. Quite the opposite. It brought us closer together

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:46.680
because we did this weird, fun thing that I appreciate a lot of people find quite strange.

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:53.000
And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship that both of us are very...

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.680
We both love numbers, we both love statistics, we're both poker players.

02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:05.000
So this was kind of like our safe space anyway. For others, one partner really might not like

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.520
that kind of stuff at all, in which case this is not a good exercise to do. I don't recommend it

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:15.480
to everybody. But I do think there's... It's interesting sometimes to poke holes in the

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:22.440
probe at these things that we consider so sacred that we can't try to quantify them,

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.920
which is interesting because that's in tension with the idea of what we just talked about with

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:30.520
beauty and what makes something beautiful, the fact that you can't measure everything about it.

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.640
And perhaps something shouldn't be tried to measure. Maybe it's wrong to

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:43.160
completely try and put a utilitarian frame of measuring the utility of a tree in its entirety.

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:46.760
I don't know. Maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't. I'm ambivalent on that. But

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:55.560
overall, people have too many biases. People are overly biased against trying to

02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:02.680
do a quantified cost-benefit analysis on really tough life decisions. They're like,

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:08.040
oh, just go with your gut. It's like, well, sure. But our intuitions are best suited for

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:12.280
things that we've got tons of experience in. Then we can really trust on it if it's a decision

02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:17.720
we've made many times. But if it's like, should I marry this person or should I buy this house

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.800
over that house? You only make those decisions a couple of times in your life, maybe.

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:28.600
Well, I would love to know, there's a balance that probably is a personal balance of strike,

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:37.480
is the amount of rationality you apply to a question versus the useful fiction,

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:43.960
the fake it till you make it. For example, just talking to soldiers in Ukraine, you ask them,

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:49.960
what's the probability of you winning, Ukraine winning?

02:05:52.440 --> 02:06:00.520
Almost everybody I talk to is 100%. And you listen to the experts. They say all kinds of stuff.

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:08.440
First of all, the morale there is higher than probably, and I've never been to a war zone

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:15.240
before this, but I've read about many wars and I think the morale in Ukraine is higher than

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:20.360
almost anywhere I've read about. It's every single person in the country is proud to fight

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:25.480
for their country. Everybody, not just soldiers, not everybody.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:28.360
Why do you think that is specifically more than in other wars?

02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:38.840
I think because there's perhaps a dormant desire for the citizens of this country

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:45.240
to find the identity of this country because it's been going through this 30-year process

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:50.760
of different factions and political bickering and they haven't had, as they talk about,

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.720
they haven't had their independence war. They say all great nations have had an independence war.

02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:01.320
They had to fight for their independence, for the discovery of the identity of the core of the

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:06.120
ideals that unify us. And they haven't had that. There's constantly been factions. There's been

02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:12.840
divisions. There's been pressures from empires, from the United States and from Russia, from

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:17.560
NATO in Europe, everybody telling them what to do. Now they want to discover who they are.

02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:23.080
And there's that kind of sense that we're going to fight for the safety of our homeland,

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.960
but we're also going to fight for our identity. And that,

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:33.880
on top of the fact that there's just, if you look at the history of Ukraine,

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:39.960
and there's certain other countries like this, there are certain cultures that are feisty in

02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:48.280
their pride of being part, of being the citizens of that nation. Ukraine is that, Poland was that.

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:52.360
You just look at history. In certain countries, you do not want to occupy.

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:57.640
Both Stalin and Hitler talked about Poland in this way. They're like,

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:02.200
this is a big problem. If we occupy this land for prolonged periods of time,

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:07.000
they're going to be a pain in their ass. They're not going to want to be occupied.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.120
And certain other countries are pragmatic. They're like, well, leaders come and go. I

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:19.160
guess this is good. Ukraine just doesn't have, Ukrainians, throughout the 20th century,

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:25.800
don't seem to be the kind of people that just sit calmly and let the quote unquote occupiers

02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:33.240
impose their rules. That's interesting though, because you said it's always been under conflict

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:37.240
and leaders have come and gone. So you would expect them to actually be the opposite under

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:43.960
that. Well, because it's a very fertile land. It's great for agriculture. So a lot of people

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:47.400
want to, I mean, I think they've developed this culture because they've constantly been

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:55.080
occupied by different people for different peoples. And so maybe there is something to that where

02:08:55.080 --> 02:09:01.560
you've constantly had to feel like within the blood of the generations, there's the struggle

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:09.000
for, against the man, against the imposition of rules, against oppression and all that kind of

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.960
stuff. And that stays with them. So there's a will there. But a lot of other aspects are also part

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.320
of it that has to do with the reverse mallet kind of situation where social media has definitely

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.720
played a part of it. Also different charismatic individuals have had to play a part. The fact that

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:34.840
the president of the nation, Zelensky, stayed in Kiev during the invasion

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:42.440
is a huge inspiration to them because most leaders, as you can imagine, when the capital

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:48.120
of the nation is under attack, the wise thing, the smart thing that the United States advised

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:55.080
Zelensky to do is to flee and to be the leader of the nation from a distant place. He said,

02:09:55.080 --> 02:10:02.840
fuck that, I'm staying put. Everyone around him, there was a pressure to leave and he didn't. And

02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:11.240
those singular acts really can unify a nation. There's a lot of people that criticize Zelensky

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:18.760
within Ukraine. Before the war, he was very unpopular, even still. But they put that aside

02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:25.800
for the, especially that singular act of staying in the capital. Yeah, a lot of those kinds of

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:41.960
things come together to create something within people. How zoomed out of a view do you want to

02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:48.040
take? Because yeah, you describe it, it's like an anti-Molic thing happened within Ukraine because

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.440
it brought the Ukrainian people together in order to fight a common enemy. Maybe that's a good thing,

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.840
maybe that's a bad thing. In the end, we don't know how this is all going to play out. But if

02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:11.400
you zoom it out on a global level, they're coming together to fight. That could make a conflict

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:16.360
larger. You know what I mean? I don't know what the right answer is here. It seems like a good

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.680
thing that they came together. We don't know how this is all going to play out. If this all turns

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.560
into nuclear war, we'll be like, okay, that was the bad. Yeah, so I was describing the reverse

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:32.360
Molic for the local level. Exactly. Now, this is where the experts come in and they say, well,

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:41.480
if you channel most of the resources, the nation and the nation supporting Ukraine into the war

02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:47.720
effort, are you not beating the drums of war that is much bigger than Ukraine? In fact,

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:55.000
even the Ukrainian leaders are speaking of it this way. This is not a war between two nations.

02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:02.360
This is the early days of a world war, if we don't play this correctly.

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:07.080
Yes. And we need cool heads from our leaders.

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:14.920
So from Ukraine's perspective, Ukraine needs to win the war. Because what does winning the war mean

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:24.600
is coming to peace negotiations, an agreement that guarantees no more invasions. And then you

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:33.400
make an agreement about what land belongs to who, and you stop that. And basically, from their

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.480
perspective is you want to demonstrate to the rest of the world who's watching carefully,

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:43.320
including Russia and China, and different players on the geopolitical stage, that this kind of

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.280
conflict is not going to be productive if you engage in it. So you want to teach everybody a

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:54.200
lesson. Let's not do World War III. It's going to be bad for everybody. It's a lose-lose.

02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.920
It's a deep lose-lose. Doesn't matter.

02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:03.800
So but they, you know, but it and I think that's actually a correct,

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.200
when I zoom out, I mean, 99% of what I think about is just individual human beings and human lives

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:17.720
and just that war is horrible. But when you zoom out and think from a geopolitics perspective,

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:25.400
we should realize that it's entirely possible that we will see a World War III in the 21st century.

02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:35.560
And this is like a dress rehearsal for that. And so the way we play this as a human civilization

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:41.240
will define whether we do or don't have a World War III. You know,

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:55.000
how we discuss war, how we discuss nuclear war, the kind of leaders we elect and prop up,

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.440
the kind of memes we circulate, because you have to be very careful when you're being

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.960
pro-Ukraine, for example, you have to realize that you're being,

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:14.200
you are also indirectly feeding the ever-increasing military industrial complex.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:26.360
So you have to be extremely careful that when you say pro-Ukraine or pro-anybody, you're pro-human

02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:37.320
beings, not pro-the-machine that creates narratives that says it's pro-human beings, but it's actually

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:44.280
if you look at the raw use of funds and resources, it's actually pro-making

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:47.080
weapons and shooting bullets and dropping bombs.

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:53.800
Right. We have to just somehow get the meme into everyone's heads that the real enemy is war itself.

02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:00.760
That's the enemy we need to defeat. And that doesn't mean to say that there isn't

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:09.880
justification for small local adversarial conflicts. If you have a leader who is starting wars,

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:15.080
they're on the side of team war, basically. It's not that they're on the side of team country,

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:19.240
whatever that country is, it's they're on the side of team war. So that needs to be stopped and put

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.640
down. But you also have to find a way that your corrective measure doesn't actually then end up

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:30.440
being co-opted by the war machine and creating greater war. Again, the playing field is finite.

02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:38.520
The scale of conflict is now getting so big that the weapons that can be used are so mass destructive

02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:43.480
that we can't afford another giant conflict. We won't make it.

02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:49.400
What existential threat, in terms of us not making it, are you most worried about?

02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.720
What existential threat to human civilization?

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:53.480
You went down a dark path, huh?

02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:55.800
This is good. Well, no, it's a dark...

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.000
No, it's like while we're in the somber place, we might as well.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:09.480
Some of my best friends are dark paths. What worries you most? We mentioned asteroids,

02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:13.480
we mentioned AGI, nuclear weapons.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:19.320
The one that's on my mind the most, mostly because I think it's the one where we have

02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.080
actually a real chance to move the needle on in a positive direction,

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.920
or more specifically stop some really bad things from happening, really dumb, avoidable things,

02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.120
is bio-risks.

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:38.760
In what kind of bio-risks? There's so many fun options.

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:45.000
Of course, we have natural risks from natural pandemics, naturally occurring viruses or

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.520
pathogens, and then also as time and technology goes on and technology becomes more and more

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.560
democratized into the hands of more and more people, the risk of synthetic pathogens.

02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:03.080
And whether or not you fall into the camp of COVID was a gain of function, accidental

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:10.840
lab leak, or whether it was purely naturally occurring, either way, we are facing a future

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:20.120
where synthetic pathogens or human meddled with pathogens either accidentally get out or

02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:27.400
get into the hands of bad actors, whether they're omnicidal maniacs, either way.

02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.400
That means we need more robustness for that. You would think that us having this nice little dry

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:40.200
run, which is as awful as COVID was, and all those poor people that died, it was still like

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:45.560
child's play compared to what a future one could be in terms of fatality rate.

02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:52.120
And so you'd think that we'd be much more robust in our pandemic preparedness.

02:17:53.480 --> 02:18:01.480
And meanwhile, the budget in the last two years for the US, sorry, they just did this,

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:06.040
I can't remember the name of what the actual budget was, but it was like a multi-trillion

02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:11.560
dollar budget that the US just set aside. And originally in that, considering that COVID cost

02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:17.960
multiple trillions to the economy, the original allocation in this new budget for future pandemic

02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:24.680
preparedness was 60 billion, so tiny proportion of it. That's proceeded to get whittled down

02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:31.560
to like 30 billion, to 15 billion, all the way down to 2 billion out of multiple trillions for

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:36.680
a thing that has just cost us multiple trillions. We've just finished. We're not even really out of

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:41.000
it. It basically got whittled down to nothing because for some reason people think that,

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.800
oh right, we've got the pandemic out of the way. That was that one. And the reason for that is

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:50.520
that people are, and I say this with all due respect to a lot of the science community,

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:58.360
but there's an immense amount of naivety about, they think that nature is the main risk moving

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:04.520
forward and it really isn't. And I think nothing demonstrates this more than this project that I

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:10.200
was just reading about that's sort of being proposed right now called Deep Vision. And the

02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:16.760
idea is to go out into the wilds, and we're not talking about just within cities, deep into caves

02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:22.280
that people don't go to, deep into the Arctic, wherever, scour the earth for whatever the most

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:29.800
dangerous possible pathogens could be that they can find. And then not only do try and find these,

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:35.080
bring samples of them back to laboratories. And again, whether you think COVID was a lab leak or

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:40.280
not, I'm not going to get into that. But we have historically had so many, as a civilization,

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:47.160
we've had so many lab leaks from even the highest level security things. People should go and just

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:52.520
read it. It's like a comedy show of just how many they are, how leaky these labs are, even when they

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:58.200
do their best efforts. So bring these things then back to civilization. That's step one of the

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:04.520
badness. The next step would be to then categorize them, do experiments on them and categorize them

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:10.600
by their level of potential pandemic lethality. And then the piece de resistance on this plan

02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:15.800
is to then publish that information freely on the internet about all these pathogens,

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:19.480
including their genome, which is literally like the building instructions of how to do them

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:27.880
on the internet. And this is something that genuinely a pocket of the scientific community

02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:34.280
thinks is a good idea. And I think on expectation, and their argument is that, oh, this is good

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:40.280
because it might buy us some time to develop vaccines, which, okay, sure, maybe would have

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:47.560
made sense prior to mRNA technology. But mRNA, we can develop a vaccine now when we find a new

02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:52.040
pathogen within a couple of days. Now then there's all the trials and so on. Those trials would have

02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:56.200
to happen anyway in the case of a brand new thing. So you're saving maybe a couple of days,

02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:02.600
so that's the upside. Meanwhile, the downside is you're not only bringing the risk of these

02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:08.840
pathogens of getting leaked, but you're literally handing it out to every bad actor on earth who

02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:15.720
would be doing cartwheels. And I'm talking about Kim Jong-un, ISIS, people who think the rest of

02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:21.800
the world is their enemy. And in some cases, they think that killing themselves is a noble cause.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:26.120
And you're literally giving them the building blocks of how to do this. It's the most batshit

02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:31.720
I've ever heard. On expectation, it's probably minus EV of multiple billions of lives if they

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:36.280
actually succeeded in doing this, certainly in the tens or hundreds of millions. So the cost

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:43.400
benefit is so unbelievably, it makes no sense. And I was trying to wrap my head around what's

02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:48.520
going wrong in people's minds to think that this is a good idea. And it's not that it's malice or

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:57.560
anything like that. I think it's that the proponents, they're actually overly naive about

02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:03.800
the interactions of humanity. And well, there are bad actors who will use this for bad things.

02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:09.480
Because not only will it, if you publish this information, even if a bad actor couldn't

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:14.840
physically make it themselves, which given in 10 years time, the technologies are getting

02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:19.160
cheaper and easier to use, but even if they couldn't make it, they could now bluff it.

02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:25.160
What would you do if there's some deadly new virus that we've published on the internet in

02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:31.080
terms of its building blocks? Kim Jong-un could be like, hey, if you don't let me build my nuclear

02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:34.920
weapons, I'm going to release this. I've managed to build it. Well, now he's actually got credible

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:40.280
bluff. We don't know. And so it's just like handing the keys, it's handing weapons of mass

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:45.160
destruction to people. Makes no sense. I agree with you, but the possible

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:53.640
world in which it might make sense is if the good guys, which is a whole other problem,

02:22:53.640 --> 02:23:00.600
defining who the good guys are, but the good guys are like an order of magnitude higher competence.

02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:09.400
And so they can stay ahead of the bad actors by just being very good at the defense,

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:15.160
by very good, not meaning like a little bit better, but an order of magnitude better.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:19.000
But of course, the question is in each of those individual disciplines,

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:24.840
is that feasible? Can the bad actors, even if they don't have the competence,

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:31.320
leapfrog to the place where the good guys are? Yeah. I mean, I would agree in principle

02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:38.360
pertaining to this particular plan of like that, you know, with the thing I described,

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:42.040
this deep vision thing, where at least then that would maybe make sense for steps one and step two

02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:46.360
of like getting the information, but then why would you release it, the information to your

02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:53.240
literal enemies? You know, that doesn't fit at all in that perspective of like trying to be ahead

02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:56.760
of them. You're literally handing them the weapon. But there's different levels of release, right? So

02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:04.200
there's the kind of secrecy where you don't give it to anybody, but there's a release where you

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:09.640
incrementally give it to like major labs. So it's not a public release, but it's like you're giving

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.800
it to major labs. There's different layers of reasonability. But the problem there is it's

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:18.600
going to, if you go anywhere beyond like complete secrecy, it's going to leak.

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:25.800
That's the thing. It's very hard to keep secrets. And so you might as well release it to the public,

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:30.840
is that argument. So you either go complete secrecy or you release it to the public.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:38.040
Which is essentially the same thing. It's going to leak anyway if you don't do complete secrecy.

02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:40.360
Right. Which is why you shouldn't get the information in the first place.

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:45.880
Yeah. I mean, in that, I think. Well, that's a solution. Yeah. The solution is either don't

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:52.120
get the information in the first place or B, keep it incredibly, incredibly contained.

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:57.000
See, I think it really matters which discipline we're talking about. So in the case of biology,

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:03.320
I do think you're very right. We shouldn't even be, it should be forbidden to even like

02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:10.840
think about that. Meaning don't collect, don't just even collect the information, but like don't do,

02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:15.640
I mean, gain of function research is a really iffy area. Like you start.

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:19.000
I mean, it's all about cost benefits, right? There are some scenarios where I could imagine

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.360
the cost benefit of a gain of function research is very, very clear. Where you've evaluated all

02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:28.280
the potential risks, factored in the probability that things can go wrong and like, you know,

02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:32.920
not only known unknowns, but unknown unknowns as well. Tried to quantify that. And then even

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
then it's like orders of magnitude better to do that. I'm behind that argument. But the point

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.040
is that there's this like naivety that's preventing people from even doing the cost benefit properly

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:47.800
on a lot of the things. Because, you know, I get it, the science community, again, I don't want

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.440
to bucket the science community, but like some people within the science community just think

02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:56.760
that everyone's good and everyone just cares about getting knowledge and doing the best for the world.

02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:59.560
And unfortunately, that's not the case. I wish we lived in that world, but we don't.

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:06.680
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot. Listen, I've been criticizing the science community broadly quite

02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:11.160
a bit. There's so many brilliant people that brilliance is somehow a hindrance sometimes

02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:16.360
because it has a bunch of blind spots. And then you start to look at a history of science,

02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:23.400
how easily it's been used by dictators to any conclusion they want. And it's dark how you can

02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:29.080
use brilliant people that like playing the little game of science because it is a fun game. You know,

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.200
you're building, you're going to conferences, you're building atop of each other's ideas,

02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:37.480
as breakthroughs. Hi, I think I've realized how this particular molecule works. And I could do

02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:41.240
this kind of experiment and everyone else is impressed. Oh, cool. No, I think you're wrong.

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:45.320
Let me show you why you're wrong. And that little game, everyone gets really excited and they get

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:49.400
excited. Oh, I came up with a pill that solves this problem. It's going to help a bunch of people.

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.520
And I came up with a giant study that shows the exact probability it's going to help or not. And

02:26:54.520 --> 02:27:01.480
you get lost in this game and you forget to realize this game, just like Malik, it can have

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:13.720
unintended consequences that might destroy human civilization or divide human civilization or have

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:21.560
dire geopolitical consequences. I mean, the effects of, I mean, it's just so the most destructive

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:27.640
effects of COVID have nothing to do with the biology of the virus, it seems like. I mean,

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:33.240
I could just list them forever. But like one of them is the complete distrust of public institutions.

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:38.440
The other one is because of that public distrust, I feel like if a much worse pandemic came along,

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:46.440
we as a world have now cried wolf. And if an actual wolf now comes, people will be like,

02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:53.960
fuck masks, fuck vaccines, fuck everything. And they'll distrust every single thing that any

02:27:53.960 --> 02:28:00.680
major institution is going to tell them. Because that's the thing, there were certain actions

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:10.680
made by certain health public figures where they very knowingly told, it was a white lie,

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:19.080
it was intended in the best possible way, such as early on when there was clearly a shortage of

02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:24.680
masks. And so they said to the public, oh, don't get masks, there's no evidence that they work.

02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.800
Don't get them, they don't work. In fact, it might even make it worse. You might even spread

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:35.960
it more. That was the real stinker. Unless you know how to do it properly, you're going to get

02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:42.680
sicker or you're more likely to catch the virus, which is just absolute crap. And they put that

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.760
out there. And it's pretty clear the reason why they did that was because there was actually a

02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:52.840
shortage of masks and they really needed it for health workers, which makes sense. I agree. But

02:28:53.400 --> 02:29:01.000
the cost of lying to the public when that then comes out, people aren't as stupid as they think

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.680
they are. And that's, I think, where this distrust of experts has largely come from. A,

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:13.640
they've lied to people overtly, but B, people have been treated like idiots. Now, that's not to say

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.160
that there aren't a lot of stupid people who have a lot of wacky ideas around COVID and all sorts

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.600
of things. But if you treat the general public like children, they're going to see that, they're

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:27.720
going to notice that, and that is going to absolutely decimate the trust in the public

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:33.480
institutions that we depend upon. And honestly, the best thing that could happen, I wish, like

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:39.560
Fauci and these other leaders who, I mean, God, I can't imagine how nightmare his job has been

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:46.760
over the last few years. Hell on earth. I have a lot of sympathy for the position he's been in.

02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:52.040
But if he could just come out and be like, okay, look, guys, hands up, we didn't handle this as

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:56.520
well as we could have. These are all the things I would have done differently in hindsight. I

02:29:56.520 --> 02:30:02.600
apologize for this and this and this and this. That would go so far. And maybe I'm being naive.

02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:05.800
Who knows? Maybe this would backfire. But I don't think it would. To someone like me,

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:10.200
even, because I've lost trust in a lot of these things. But unfortunately, I at least know people

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:15.880
who I can go to who I think have good epistemics on this stuff. But if they could sort of put their

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:20.680
hands up and go, okay, these are the spots where we screwed up. This, this, this. This was our

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:24.040
reasons. Yeah, we actually told a little white lie here. We did it for this reason. We're really

02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:28.920
sorry. Where they just did the radical honesty thing, the radical transparency thing. That would

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:33.080
go so far to rebuilding public trust. And I think that's what needs to happen.

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:35.160
Yeah, I know. I totally agree with you. Unfortunately,

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:43.720
his job was very tough and all those kinds of things. But I see arrogance and arrogance

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:49.160
prevented him from being honest in that way previously. And I think arrogance will prevent

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:55.320
him from being honest in that way. Now, when you leaders, I think young people are seeing that,

02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:04.280
that kind of talking down to people from a position of power, I hope is the way of the past.

02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:11.000
People really like authenticity and they, they like leaders that are like a man and a woman of

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:16.920
the people. And I think that just- I mean, he still has a chance to do that, I think.

02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:23.800
I mean, I don't think, I doubt he's listening, but if he is like, hey, I think, you know,

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:28.520
I don't think he's irredeemable by any means. I think there's, you know, I don't have an opinion

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:34.120
of whether there was arrogance or there or not. Just know that I think like coming clean on the,

02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.440
you know, it's understandable to have fucked up during this pandemic. Like I won't expect any

02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:43.000
government to handle it well, because it was so difficult, like so many moving pieces, so much

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.160
like lack of information and so on. But the step to rebuilding trust is to go, okay, look,

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:53.800
we're doing a scrutiny of where we went wrong. And I, and for my part, I did this wrong in this part.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:54.920
And that would be huge.

02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:59.800
All of us can do that. I mean, I was struggling for a while whether I want to talk to him or not.

02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:05.960
I talked to his boss, Francis Collins, another person that's screwed up in terms of trust,

02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:11.240
lost a little bit of my respect too. There seems to have been

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:21.960
a kind of dishonesty in the back rooms in that they didn't trust people to be intelligent.

02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:28.280
Like we need to tell them what's good for them. We know what's good for them. That kind of idea.

02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:35.560
To be fair, the thing that's, what's it called? I heard the phrase today, nut picking.

02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:40.200
Social media does that. So you've got like nitpicking, nut picking is where

02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:46.360
the craziest, stupidest, you know, if you have a group of people, let's call it, you know,

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:49.560
let's say people who are vaccine, I don't like the term anti-vaccine, people who are vaccine

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:56.600
hesitant, vaccine speculative, you know, what social media did or the media or anyone, you know,

02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:02.120
their opponents would do is pick the craziest example. So the ones who are like, you know,

02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:09.400
I think I need to inject myself with motor oil up my ass or something. Select the craziest ones and

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:13.800
then have that beamed to, you know, so from like someone like Fauci or Francis's perspective,

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:17.720
that's what they get because they're getting the same social media stuff as us. They get the same

02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:23.240
media reports. I mean, they might get some more information, but they too are going to get these,

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:27.800
the nuts portrayed to them. So they probably have a misrepresentation of what the actual

02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:33.480
public's intelligence is. That just, yes. And that just means they're not social media savvy.

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:37.640
So one of the skills of being on social media is to be able to filter that in your mind,

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:42.360
like to understand, to put into proper context. To realize that what you are seeing, social media is

02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:48.280
not anywhere near an accurate representation of humanity. Nut picking. And there's nothing

02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:56.280
wrong with putting motor oil up your ass. It's just one, it's one aspect of, I do this every weekend.

02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:00.200
Okay. How did that analogy come from in my mind? Like, what?

02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:05.080
I don't know. I think you need to, there's some Freudian thing you would need to deeply investigate

02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:13.080
with a therapist. Okay. What about AI? Are you worried about AGI, superintelligence systems or

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:18.920
paperclip maximizer type of situation? Yes. I'm definitely worried about it,

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:24.680
but I feel kind of bipolar in that some days I wake up and I'm like-

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.320
You're excited about the future. Well, exactly. I'm like, wow,

02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:34.120
we can unlock the mysteries of the universe, you know, escape the game. And this, you know,

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:37.880
because I spend all my time thinking about these Moloky problems that, you know, what is the

02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:44.360
solution to them? What, you know, in some ways you need this like omni-benevolent, omniscient,

02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:53.880
omni-wise coordination mechanism that can like make us all not do the Moloky thing or like

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.600
provide the infrastructure or redesign the system so that it's not vulnerable to this Moloky process.

02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:04.840
And in some ways, you know, that's the strongest argument to me for like the race to build AGI,

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:10.200
is that maybe, you know, we can't survive without it. But the flip side to that is

02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.280
unfortunately now that there's multiple actors trying to build AI, AGI, you know, this was fine

02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.520
10 years ago when it was just DeepMind, but then other companies started up and now it created a

02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:27.960
race dynamic. Now it's like that's the whole thing is at the same, it's got the same problem. It's

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:33.400
like whichever company is the one that like optimizes for speed at the cost of safety,

02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:37.240
we'll get the competitive advantage. And so we're the more likely the ones to build the AGI,

02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.560
you know, and that's the same cycle that you're in. And there's no clear solution to that because

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:50.280
you can't just go like slapping, you know, if you go and try and like stop all the different companies,

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:56.040
then it will, you know, the good ones will stop because they're the ones, you know, within,

02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.040
you know, within the West's reach, but then that leaves all the other ones to continue. And then

02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:04.040
they're even more likely. So it's like, it's a very difficult problem with no clean solution.

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:12.120
And, you know, at the same time, you know, I know that at least some of the folks at DeepMind and

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:15.240
they're incredible and they're thinking about this, they're very aware of this problem and they're

02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:20.280
like, you know, I think some of the smartest people on earth. Yeah, the culture is important

02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:24.920
there because they are thinking about that and they're some of the best machine learning

02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:30.920
engineers. So it's possible to have a company or a community of people that are both great

02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:34.600
engineers and are thinking about the philosophical topics. Exactly. And importantly,

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:39.480
they're also game theorists, you know, and because this is ultimately a game theory problem,

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:46.440
the thing, this Moloch mechanism and like, you know, how do we voice arms race scenarios?

02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.000
You need people who aren't naive to be thinking about this. And again, like, luckily there's a

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:56.760
lot of smart, non-naive game theorists within that group. Yes, I'm concerned about it and I

02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:03.080
think it's again, a thing that we need people to be thinking about in terms of like, how do we create,

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:10.040
how do we mitigate the arms race dynamics and how do we solve the thing of, it's got,

02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:15.640
Bostrom calls it the orthogonality problem whereby, because it's obviously there's a chance,

02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:19.000
you know, the belief, the hope is, is that you build something that's super intelligent

02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:25.480
and by definition of being super intelligent, it will also become super wise and have the

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:30.120
wisdom to know what the right goals are. And hopefully those goals include keeping humanity

02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:37.160
alive. Right. But Bostrom says that actually those two things, you know, super intelligence

02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:42.840
and super wisdom aren't necessarily correlated. They're actually kind of orthogonal things. And

02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:46.040
how do we make it so that they are correlated? How do we guarantee it? Because we need it to be

02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.800
guaranteed really, to know that we're doing the thing safely. But I think that like,

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:57.320
merging of intelligence and wisdom, at least my hope is that this whole process happens

02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:03.480
sufficiently slowly, that we're constantly having these kinds of debates, that we have enough time

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:09.480
to figure out how to modify each version of the system as it becomes more and more intelligent.

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:14.520
Yes. Buying time is a good thing, definitely. Anything that slows everything down. We just,

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:21.960
everyone needs to chill out. We've got millennia to figure this out. Yeah. Or at least,

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:28.600
at least, well, it depends. Again, some people think that, you know, we can't even make it

02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:36.280
through the next few decades without having some kind of omni-wise coordination mechanism. And

02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:41.640
there's also an argument to that. Yeah. I don't know. Well, there is, I'm suspicious of that kind

02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:47.400
of thinking because it seems like the entirety of human history has people in it that are like

02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:54.920
predicting doom just around the corner. There's something about us that is strangely attracted

02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:00.840
to that thought. It's almost like fun to think about the destruction of everything.

02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:08.600
Just objectively speaking, I've talked and listened to a bunch of people and they are

02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:13.960
gravitating towards that. It's almost, I think it's the same thing that people love about

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:21.160
conspiracy theories is they love to be the person that kind of figured out some deep fundamental

02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.440
thing about the, that's going to be, it's going to mark something extremely important about the

02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:32.600
history of human civilization because then I will be important. Right. When in reality, most of us

02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:40.760
will be forgotten and life will go on. I mean, one of the sad things about whenever anything

02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:47.400
traumatic happens to you, whenever you lose loved ones or just tragedy happens, you realize life

02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:55.240
goes on. Even after a nuclear war that will wipe out some large percentage of the population and

02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:03.800
will torture people for years to come because of the sort of, I mean, the effects of a nuclear

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:09.880
winter, people will still survive. Life will still go on. I mean, it depends on the kind

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.840
of nuclear war, but in a case of nuclear war, it will still go on. That's one of the amazing

02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:20.760
things about life. It finds a way. So in that sense, I just, I feel like the doom and gloom thing

02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.560
is a- Well, what we don't, yeah, we don't want a self-fulfilling prophecy.

02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:27.080
Yes, that's exactly.

02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:34.520
Yes. And I very much agree with that. And I even have a slight feeling from the amount of time we

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.800
spent in this conversation talking about this, because it's like, is this even a net positive

02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:45.080
if it's like making everyone feel, oh, in some ways, like making people imagine these bad

02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:51.640
scenarios can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. But at the same time, that's weighed off with at least

02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:56.120
making people aware of the problem and gets them thinking. And I think particularly, you know,

02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.360
the reason why I want to talk about this to your audience is that on average, they're the type of

02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:05.160
people who gravitate towards these kinds of topics because they're intellectually curious and they

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:09.400
can sort of sense that there's trouble brewing. They can smell that there's, you know, I think

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:13.160
there's a reason people are thinking about this stuff a lot is because the probability,

02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:17.960
the probability, you know, it's increased in probability over, certainly over the last few

02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:26.280
years. Trajectories have not gone favorably, let's put it, you know, since 2010. So it's right,

02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.920
I think, for people to be thinking about it. But that's where they're like, I think, whether it's

02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.840
a useful fiction or whether it's actually true, or whatever you want to call it, I think having

02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:39.880
this faith, this is where faith is valuable, because it gives you at least this like anchor

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:45.480
of hope. And I'm not just saying it to like trick myself, like I do truly, I do think there's

02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:49.560
something out there that wants us to win. I think there's something that really wants us to win.

02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:56.040
And it just, you just have to be like, just like, okay, now I sound really crazy, but like,

02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:04.680
open your heart to it a little bit. And it will give you the like, the sort of breathing room

02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:10.440
with which to marinate on the solutions. We are the ones who have to come up with solutions. But

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:19.160
we can use that there's like this hashtag positivity, there's value in that.

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:24.840
Yeah, you have to kind of imagine all the destructive trajectories that lay in our future,

02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:32.200
and then believe in the possibility of avoiding those trajectories. All while, you said, audience,

02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.240
all while sitting back, which is majority, the two people that listen to this are probably sitting

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:46.680
on a beach, smoking some weed. That's a beautiful sunset, or they're looking at just the waves going

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:53.800
in and out. And ultimately, there's a kind of deep belief there in the the momentum of humanity to

02:42:53.800 --> 02:43:00.840
figure it all out. But we've got a lot of work to do. Which is what makes this whole simulation,

02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:08.040
this video game kind of fun. This Battle of Polytopia, I still, man, I love those games so

02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:15.720
much. And that one for people who don't know, Battle of Polytopia is a big, it's like a really

02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:22.760
radical simplification of a civilization type of game. It still has a lot of the skill tree

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:29.240
development, a lot of the strategy. But it's easy enough to play on a phone.

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:34.280
Yeah. It's kind of interesting. They've really figured it out. It's one of the most elegantly

02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:39.240
designed games I've ever seen. It's incredibly complex. And yet being, again, it walks that

02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:44.680
line between complexity and simplicity in this really, really great way. And they use pretty

02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:51.480
colors that hack the dopamine reward circuits in our brains very well. It's fun. Video games are

02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:57.480
so fun. Most of this life is just about fun, escaping all the suffering to find the fun.

02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:02.840
What's energy healing? I have in my notes, energy healing question mark. What's that about?

02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:12.840
Oh, man. God, your audience is going to think I'm mad. So the two crazy things that happened

02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:16.040
to me, the one was the voice in the head that said, you're going to win this tournament. And

02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:23.400
then I won the tournament. The other craziest thing that's happened to me was in 2018,

02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:33.560
I started getting this weird problem in my ear where it was kind of like low frequency sound

02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:39.240
distortion, where voices, particularly men's voices, became incredibly unpleasant to listen to.

02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:45.800
It would be falsely amplified or something. And it was almost like a physical sensation

02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:50.840
in my ear, which was really unpleasant. And it would like last for a few hours and then go away

02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:54.840
and then come back for a few hours and go away. And I went and got hearing tests and they found

02:44:54.840 --> 02:45:04.440
that like the bottom end, I was losing the hearing in that ear. And so in the end, the doctor said

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:10.360
they think it was this thing called Meniere's disease, which is this very unpleasant disease

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:15.240
where people basically end up losing their hearing, but they get this like, it often comes with dizzy

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:19.800
spells and other things because it's like the inner ear gets all messed up. Now, I don't know

02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:25.160
if that's actually what I had, but that's what at least one doctor said to me. But anyway,

02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:28.920
so I'd had three months of this stuff, this going on, it was really getting me down. And then I was

02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:35.320
at Burning Man, of all places. I don't mean to be that person talking about Burning Man. But I was

02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.880
there. And again, I'd had it and I was unable to listen to music, which is not what you want,

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:44.120
because Burning Man is a very loud, intense place. And I was just having a really rough time. And on

02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:50.840
the final night, I get talking to this girl who's like a friend of a friend. And I mentioned, I was

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.120
like, oh, I'm really down in the dumps about this. And she's like, oh, well, I've done a little bit

02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:59.000
of energy healing. Would you like me to have a look? And I was like, sure. Now this is, again,

02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:05.240
no time in my life for this. I didn't believe in any of this stuff. I was just like,

02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:11.880
it's all bullshit. It's all wooey nonsense. But I was like, sure, have a go. And she starts

02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:16.600
with her hand and she says, oh, there's something there. And then she leans in and she starts

02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:23.160
sucking over my ear, not actually touching me, but close to it with her mouth. And it was really

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.960
unpleasant. I was like, whoa, can you stop? She's like, no, no, no, there's something there. I need

02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:29.160
to get it. And I was like, no, no, no, I really don't like it. Please, this is really loud. She's

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.000
like, I need to just bear with me. And she does it. And I don't know how long, for a few minutes.

02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:38.200
And then she eventually collapses on the ground, freezing cold, crying.

02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.720
Not, you know, and I'm just like, I don't know what the hell is going on. Like I'm like thoroughly

02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:47.160
freaked out, as is everyone else watching. Just like, what the hell? And we like warm her up.

02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:54.600
And she was like, what? She was really shaken up. And she's like, I don't know what that,

02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:59.160
she said it was something very unpleasant and dark. Don't worry, it's gone. I think you'll be

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.880
fine in a couple. You'll have the physical symptoms for a couple of weeks and you'll be fine.

02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:09.400
But, you know, she was like that, you know, so I was, I was so rattled, A, because the potential

02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:15.160
that actually I'd had something bad in me that made someone feel bad and that she was scared.

02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:18.440
That was what, you know, I was like, wait, I thought you do this. This is the thing.

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.840
Now you're terrified. Like you pulled like some kind of exorcism or something. What the

02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:31.320
fuck is going on? So it, like just the most insane experience. And frankly, it took me like a few

02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:38.520
months to sort of emotionally recover from it. But my ear problem went away about a couple of

02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:48.600
weeks later and touchwood, I've not had any issues since. So that gives you like hints that maybe

02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:54.520
there's something out there. I mean, I don't, I, again, I don't have an explanation for this.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.640
The most probable explanation was, you know, I was a burning man. I was in a very open state.

02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:08.680
Let's just leave it at that. And, you know, placebo is an incredibly powerful thing and a very

02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:14.680
not understood thing. So almost assigning the word placebo to it reduces it down to a way that

02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:19.320
it doesn't deserve to be reduced down. Maybe there's a whole science of what we call placebo. Maybe

02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:26.120
there's a placebo is a door. Self-healing, you know? And I mean, I don't know what the problem was.

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.720
Like I was told it was many years. I don't want to say I definitely had that because I don't want

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:32.920
people to think that, oh, that's how, you know, if they do have that, because it's terrible disease.

02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.880
And if they have that, that this is going to be a guaranteed way for it to fix it for them. I don't

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:41.800
know. And I also don't, I don't, and you're absolutely right to say like using even the

02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:48.600
word placebo is like, it comes with this like baggage of, of like frame. And I don't want to

02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:54.840
reduce it down. All I can do is describe the experience and what happened. I cannot put an

02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.280
ontological framework around it. I can't say why it happened, what the mechanism was, what the

02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.960
problem even was in the first place. I just know that something crazy happened and it was while I

02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:10.680
was in an open state. And fortunately for me, it made the problem go away. But what I took away from

02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:15.800
it, again, it was part of this, you know, this took me on this journey of becoming more humble

02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:19.640
about what I think I know. Because as I said before, I was like, I was in the like Richard

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:24.680
Dawkins train of atheism in terms of there is no God. There's everything like that is bullshit.

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:31.160
We know the only way we can get through, we know how medicine works and its molecules and

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:37.720
chemical interactions and that kind of stuff. And now it's like, okay, well, there's clearly

02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:44.120
more for us to understand. And that doesn't mean that it's a scientific as well. Because,

02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:49.960
you know, the beauty of the scientific method is that it still can apply to this situation. Like,

02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:55.240
I don't see why, you know, I would like to try and test this experimentally. I haven't really,

02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:58.120
you know, I don't know how we would go about doing that. We'd have to find other people with the

02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:05.480
same condition, I guess, and like, try and repeat, repeat the experiment. But it doesn't just because

02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:10.360
something happens. That's sort of out of the realms of our current understanding. It doesn't

02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:15.480
mean that it's the scientific method can't be used for it. Yeah, I think the scientific method

02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:22.920
sits on a foundation of those kinds of experiences. Because a scientific method is a process

02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:34.120
to carve away at the mystery all around us. And experiences like this is just a reminder that

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:38.680
we're mostly shrouded in mystery still. That's it. It's just like a humility.

02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:40.840
Like, we haven't really figured this whole thing out.

02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:47.400
But at the same time, we have found ways to act, you know, we're clearly doing something right,

02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:51.320
because think of the technological scientific advancements, the knowledge that we have,

02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:55.560
that would blow people's minds even from 100 years ago.

02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:59.640
Yeah, and we've even allegedly got out of space and landed on the moon.

02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:05.160
Although I still haven't, I have not seen evidence of the earth being round, but I'm

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:11.240
keeping an open mind. Speaking of which, you studied physics and astrophysics.

02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:20.760
Just to go to that, just to jump around through the fascinating life you've had,

02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:28.440
how did that come to be? When did you fall in love with astronomy and space and things like this?

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:34.520
As early as I can remember. I was very lucky that my mom and my dad, but particularly my mom,

02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:40.840
my mom is like the most nature, she is Mother Earth. It's the only way to describe her.

02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:46.360
She's like Dr. Dolittle, animals flock to her and just like sit and look at her adoringly.

02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:47.720
As she sings.

02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:53.000
Yeah, she just is Mother Earth. And she has always been fascinated by,

02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:57.560
you know, she doesn't have any, she never went to university or anything like that.

02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:00.840
She's actually phobic of maths. If I try and get her to like, you know,

02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:06.360
I was trying to teach her poker and she hated it. But she's so deeply curious.

02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:11.080
And that just got instilled in me when, you know, we would sleep out under the stars,

02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:14.680
whenever it was, you know, the two nights a year when it was warm enough in the UK to do that.

02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:20.760
And we'll just lie out there until we fell asleep looking for satellites,

02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:25.240
looking for shooting stars. And I was just always, I don't know whether it was from that,

02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:31.800
but I've always naturally gravitated to like the biggest, the biggest questions.

02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:34.280
And also the like, the most layers of abstraction.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.960
I love just like, what's the meta question? What's the meta question? And so on.

02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:42.680
So I think it just came from that really. And then on top of that, like physics,

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:51.080
you know, it also made logical sense in that it was a, it was the degree, it was a degree that,

02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:55.080
well, a subject that ticked the box of being, you know, answering these really big picture

02:52:55.080 --> 02:53:00.840
questions, but it was also extremely useful. It like has a very high utility in terms of,

02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:04.280
I didn't know necessarily, I thought I was going to become like a research scientist.

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:06.920
My original plan was I want to be a professional astronomer.

02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:11.000
So it's not just like a philosophy degree that asks the big questions and it's not

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:18.280
like biology and the path to go to medical school or something like that, which is overly pragmatic,

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:26.360
not overly is very pragmatic. But this is, yeah, physics is a good combination of the two.

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:30.760
Yeah. At least for me, it made sense and I was good at it. I liked it. Yeah. I mean,

02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:34.760
it wasn't like I did an immense amount of soul searching to choose it or anything. It just was

02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:41.160
like this, it made the most sense. I mean, you have to make this decision in the UK age 17,

02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:46.040
which is crazy. Because, you know, in U S you go the first year, you do a bunch of stuff,

02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:49.880
right? And then you choose your major. I think the first few years of college,

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:55.720
you focus on the drugs and only as you get closer to the end, do you start to think,

02:53:55.720 --> 02:54:01.160
oh shit, this wasn't about that. And I owe the government a lot of money.

02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:07.320
How many alien civilizations are out there? When you looked up at the stars with your mom

02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:13.800
and you were counting them, what's your mom think about the number of alien civilizations?

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:19.000
I actually don't know. I would imagine she would take the viewpoint of, you know, she's pretty

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.360
humble and she knows how many, she knows there's a huge number of potential spawn sites out there.

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.040
So she would- Spawn sites?

02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:28.600
Spawn sites, yeah. You know, this is our spawn site.

02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:30.600
Spawn sites. Yeah. Spawn sites in polytopia.

02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:37.320
We spawned on earth, you know, it's- Hmm. Yeah. Spawn sites. Why does that feel weird to say

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:45.480
spawn? Because it makes me feel like it's, there's only one source of life and it's

02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:50.280
spawning in different locations. That's why the word spawn, because like, it feels like

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:54.600
life that originated on earth really originated here.

02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.600
Right. It is unique to this particular- Yeah.

02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:03.240
Yeah. I mean, but I don't, in my mind, it doesn't exclude, you know, the completely

02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:10.520
different forms of life and different biochemical soups can't also spawn, but I guess it implies

02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:16.040
that there's some spark that is uniform, which I kind of like the idea of that it's, you know.

02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:21.880
And then I get to think about respawning, like after it dies, like what happens if

02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:25.960
life on earth ends? Is it going to restart again?

02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:28.840
Probably not. It depends. Maybe earth is too-

02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:33.000
It depends on the type of, you know, what's the thing that kills it off, right? If it's

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.320
a paperclip maximizer, not, you know, for the example, but, you know, some kind of very

02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:44.280
self-replicating, you know, high on the capabilities, very low on the wisdom type thing.

02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:50.200
So whether that's, you know, gray goo, green goo, you know, like nanobots or just a shitty

02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:56.840
misaligned AI that thinks it needs to turn everything into paperclips. You know, if it's

02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:00.680
something like that, then it's going to be very hard for life, you know, complex life,

02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:04.680
because by definition, you know, a paperclip maximizer is the ultimate instantiation of

02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:09.640
Moloch. Deeply low complexity, overoptimization on a single thing, sacrificing everything else,

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:12.520
turning the whole world into- Although something tells me, like, if we

02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:18.520
actually take a paperclip maximizer, it destroys everything. It's a really dumb system that just

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:21.480
envelops the whole of earth. And the universe beyond.

02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:26.440
Oh, I didn't know that part, but okay, great.

02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:27.320
That's a thought experiment.

02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:30.120
It becomes a multi-planetary paperclip maximizer?

02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.680
Well, it just propagates. I mean, it depends whether it figures out how to jump the vacuum gap.

02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.120
But again, I mean, this is all silly, because it's a hypothetical thought experiment,

02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:43.640
which I think doesn't actually have much practical application to the AI safety problem. But

02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.640
it's just a fun thing to play around with. But if by definition, it is maximally intelligent,

02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:53.800
which means it is maximally good at navigating the environment around it in order to achieve its

02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:58.760
goal, but extremely bad at choosing goals in the first place. So again, we're talking on this

02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:03.880
orthogonality thing, right? It's very low on wisdom, but very high on capability. Then it

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:08.360
will figure out how to jump the vacuum gap between planets and stars and so on, and thus just turn

02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:10.840
every atom it gets its hands on into paperclips.

02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:12.600
Yeah, by the way, for people who-

02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:15.480
Which is maximum virality, by the way. That's what virality is.

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:20.360
But does not mean that virality is necessarily all about maximizing paperclips. In that case,

02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:24.920
it is. So for people who don't know, this is just a thought experiment example of an AI system

02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:30.280
that has a goal and is willing to do anything to accomplish that goal,

02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:35.320
including destroying all life on Earth and all human life and all of consciousness in the

02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:40.840
universe for the goal of producing a maximum number of paperclips. Okay.

02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:44.840
Or whatever its optimization function was that it was set up.

02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:49.480
It could be recreating lexes. Maybe it'll tile the universe in lexes.

02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:53.240
Go on. I like this idea. No, I'm just kidding.

02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:56.120
That's better. That's more interesting than paperclips.

02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:59.080
That could be infinitely optimal if I were to say so myself.

02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:01.960
It's still a bad thing because it's permanently capping

02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:05.800
what the universe could ever be. That's its end state.

02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:10.760
Or achieving the optimal that the universe could ever achieve. Different people have

02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:16.360
different perspectives. But don't you think within the paperclip world that would emerge,

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:21.320
just like in the zeros and ones that make up a computer, that would emerge

02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:30.680
beautiful complexities? It won't suppress. As you scale to multiple planets and throughout,

02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:37.960
there'll emerge these little worlds that on top of the fabric of maximizing paperclips,

02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:47.320
there would emerge little societies of paperclip- Well, then we're not describing

02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:52.600
a paperclip maximizer anymore. If you think of what a paperclip is, it is literally just a piece

02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:59.960
of bent iron, right? So if it's maximizing that throughout the universe, it's taking every atom

02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:05.240
it gets its hand on into somehow turning it into iron or steel and then bending it into that shape

02:59:05.240 --> 02:59:11.560
and then done and done. By definition, paperclips, there is no way for- Well,

02:59:11.560 --> 02:59:17.320
okay, so you're saying that paperclips somehow will just emerge and create through gravity or

02:59:17.320 --> 02:59:23.720
something? No, no, no. Because there's a dynamic element to the whole system. It's creating those

02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:29.240
paperclips. And the act of creating, there's going to be a process. And that process

02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:33.960
will have a dance to it. Because it's not like sequential thing. There's a whole complex

02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:39.320
three-dimensional system of paperclips. People have string theory, right? It's

02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:43.240
supposed to be strings that are interacting in fascinating ways. I'm sure paperclips

02:59:43.240 --> 02:59:48.200
are very string-like. They can be interacting in very interesting ways as you scale exponentially

02:59:48.200 --> 02:59:55.080
through three-dimensional. I'm sure the paperclip maximizer has to come up with a theory of

02:59:55.080 --> 03:00:02.520
everything. It has to create wormholes, right? It has to understand quantum mechanics.

03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:07.800
I love your optimism. This is where I'd say we're going into the realm of pathological

03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:15.480
optimism, whereby it's- I'm sure there'll be a... I think there's an intelligence that emerges from

03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:20.440
that system. So you're saying that basically intelligence is inherent in the fabric of reality

03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:24.760
and will find a way. Kind of like Goldblum says life will find a way. You think life will find

03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:31.000
a way even out of this perfectly homogeneous dead soup. It's not perfectly homogeneous.

03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:35.960
It has to. It's perfectly maximal in the production. I don't know why people keep

03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:40.200
thinking it's homogenous. It maximizes the number of paperclips. That's the only thing.

03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:44.680
It's not trying to be homogeneous. It's trying to maximize paperclips.

03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:51.960
So you're saying that because kind of like in the Big Bang or it seems like things,

03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:55.800
there were clusters. There was more stuff here than there. That was enough of the

03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:58.280
patternicity that kickstarted the evolutionary process.

03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:01.160
It's the little weirdnesses that will make it beautiful.

03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:02.360
Confluxity emerges.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.720
Interesting. Okay. Well, so how does that line up then with the whole heat death of the universe,

03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:11.960
right? Because that's another sort of instantiation of this. It's like everything becomes so far apart

03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:21.560
and so cold and so perfectly mixed that it's like homogeneous grayness. Do you think that even out

03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:28.760
of that homogeneous grayness where there's no negative entropy, there's no free energy

03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:37.160
that we understand even from that new stuff? Yeah. The paperclip maximizer or any other

03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:42.280
intelligent systems will figure out ways to travel to other universes to create Big Bangs

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:48.520
within those universes or through black holes to create whole other worlds to break what we

03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:57.160
consider the limitations of physics. The paperclip maximizer will find a way if a way exists and we

03:01:57.160 --> 03:02:00.680
should be humble to realize that we don't. Yeah, but because it just wants to make more

03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:03.640
paperclips. So it's going to go into those universes and turn them into paperclips.

03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:10.600
Yeah. But we humans, not humans, but complex systems exist on top of that. We're not

03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:17.240
interfering with it. This complexity emerges from the simple base state.

03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:22.440
Whether it's plank lengths or paperclips is the base unit.

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:28.920
Yeah. You can think of the universe as a paperclip maximizer because it's doing some dumb stuff.

03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:34.040
Physics seems to be pretty dumb. I don't know if you can summarize it.

03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:39.560
Yeah. The laws are fairly basic and yet out of them amazing complexity emerges.

03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:46.120
And its goals seem to be pretty basic and dumb. If you can summarize its goals, I don't know what's

03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:53.640
a nice way maybe laws of thermodynamics could be. I don't know if you can assign

03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:58.760
goals to physics, but if you formulate in the sense of goals, it's very similar to

03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:06.440
paperclip maximizing in the dumbness of the goals. But the pockets of complexity as it emerge

03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:10.680
is where beauty emerges. That's where life emerges. That's where intelligence, that's

03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:15.720
where humans emerge. And I think we're being very down on this whole paperclip maximizer thing.

03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:17.560
No, the reason we hate it-

03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:23.160
I think, yeah, because what you're saying is that you think that the force of emergence itself

03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:35.160
is another baked in law of reality. And you're trusting that emergence will find a way to,

03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:42.440
even out of seemingly the most molarchy, awful, plain outcome, emergence will still find a way.

03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:44.600
I love that as a philosophy. I think it's very nice. I would

03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:51.800
wield it carefully because there's large error bars on that and the certainty of that.

03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:55.880
How about we build the paperclip maximizer and find out?

03:03:55.880 --> 03:03:59.080
Classic. Yeah. Moloch is doing cartwheels, man.

03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:04.280
Yeah. But the thing is, it will destroy humans in the process, which is the reason we really

03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:09.240
don't like it. We seem to be really holding on to this whole human civilization thing.

03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:14.680
Would that make you sad if AI systems that are beautiful, that are conscious,

03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.880
that are interesting and complex and intelligent ultimately lead to the death of humans?

03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:23.160
Would that make you sad? If humans led to the death of humans? Sorry.

03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:26.840
If they would supersede humans. Oh, if some AI?

03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:33.240
Yeah, AI would end humans. That's the reason why I'm, in some ways,

03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:41.400
less emotionally concerned about AI risk than, say, bio risk. Because at least with AI,

03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:48.120
if we're in this hypothetical where it wipes out humans, but it does it for some higher purpose,

03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:53.240
it needs our atoms and energy to do something. At least now, the universe is going on to do

03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:59.080
something interesting. Whereas if it wipes everything, bio just kills everything on Earth

03:04:59.080 --> 03:05:04.520
and that's it. Earth cannot spawn anything more meaningful in the few hundred million

03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:15.320
years it has left because it doesn't have much time left. One of my favorite books I've ever

03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:21.240
read is Novosene by James Lovelock, who sadly just died. He wrote it when he was like 99.

03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:29.560
He died at age 102, so it's a fairly new book. He talks about that, that he thinks it's building

03:05:29.560 --> 03:05:36.920
off this Gaia theory where Earth is living some form of intelligence itself and that this is the

03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:44.520
next step. Whatever this new intelligence that is maybe silicon-based as opposed to carbon-based

03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:49.480
goes on to do. It's really, in some ways, an optimistic but weirdly fatalistic book.

03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:53.800
I don't know if I fully subscribe to it, but it's a beautiful piece to read anyway.

03:05:54.440 --> 03:05:59.560
So, am I sad by that idea? I think so, yes. Actually, yeah, this is the reason why I'm sad

03:05:59.560 --> 03:06:04.840
by the idea because if something is truly brilliant and wise and smart and truly super

03:06:04.840 --> 03:06:11.560
intelligent, it should be able to figure out abundance. If it figures out abundance,

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:16.600
it shouldn't need to kill us off. It should be able to find a way for us. The universe is huge.

03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:21.640
There should be plenty of space for it to go out and do all the things it wants to do

03:06:21.640 --> 03:06:25.800
and give us a little pocket where we can continue doing our things and we can continue to do things

03:06:25.800 --> 03:06:30.360
and so on. Again, if it's so supremely wise, it shouldn't even be worried about the game

03:06:30.360 --> 03:06:34.360
theoretic considerations that by leaving us alive, we'll then go and create another super

03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:37.960
intelligent agent that it then has to compete against because it should be only wise and smart

03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:43.800
enough to not have to concern itself with that. Unless it deems humans to be kind of assholes.

03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:50.440
Like, the humans are a source of none, of a lose-lose kind of dynamics.

03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:57.480
Well, yes and no. Moloch is. That's why I think it's important to separate ourselves.

03:06:57.480 --> 03:06:59.400
But maybe humans are the source of Moloch.

03:07:00.040 --> 03:07:07.480
No, I think game theory is the source of Moloch because Moloch exists in non-human systems as

03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:20.760
well. It applies to agents, but it can apply to a species that's on an island of animals,

03:07:20.760 --> 03:07:25.800
rats out competing, the ones that massively consume all the resources are the ones that

03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:31.160
are going to win out over the more chill, socialized ones and so creates this Malthusian

03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:35.880
trap. Moloch exists in little pockets in nature as well, so it's not a strictly human thing.

03:07:35.880 --> 03:07:39.720
I wonder if it's actually a result of the consequences of the invention of predator

03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:47.640
and prey dynamics. Maybe AI will have to kill off every organism that-

03:07:47.640 --> 03:07:49.000
Now you're talking about killing off competition.

03:07:50.200 --> 03:08:00.920
Not competition, but just like the way it's like the weeds or whatever in a beautiful

03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:07.880
flower garden. The parasites, yeah, on the whole system. Now, of course, it won't do that

03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:11.160
completely. It'll put them in a zoo like we do with parasites. It'll ring fence.

03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:16.360
Yeah, and there'll be somebody doing a PhD on like little prod humans with a stick and see what they

03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:25.000
do. But I mean, in terms of letting us run wild outside of the, you know, geographically

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:33.080
constricted region, that might decide to- No, I think there's obviously the capacity

03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:40.920
for beauty and kindness and non-Moloch behavior amidst humans, so I'm pretty sure AI will preserve

03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:47.960
us. I don't know if you answered the aliens question. You had a good conversation with

03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:54.520
Toby Orr about various sides of the universe. I think, did he say, now I'm forgetting,

03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:57.240
but I think he said, it's a good chance we're alone.

03:08:58.040 --> 03:09:07.640
So the classic Fermi paradox question is, there are so many spawn points and yet,

03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:14.440
it didn't take us that long to go from harnessing fire to sending out radio signals into space.

03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:20.360
So surely, given the vastness of space, we should be, and you know, even if only a tiny fraction of

03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:24.760
those create life and other civilizations too, we should be, the universe should be very noisy.

03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:29.240
There should be evidence of Dyson spheres or whatever, you know, like at least radio signals

03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:33.400
and so on. But seemingly things are very silent out there. Now, of course, it depends on who you

03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:36.760
speak to. Some people say that they're getting signals all the time and so on. And like,

03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:43.000
I don't want to make an epistemic statement on that, but it seems like there's a lot of silence.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:50.120
And so that raises this paradox. And then say, you know, the Drake equation.

03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.120
So the Drake equation is like, basically, just a simple thing of like trying to estimate the

03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:01.720
number of possible civilizations within the galaxy by multiplying the number of stars created per

03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:04.680
year by the number of stars that have planets, planets that are habitable, blah, blah, blah.

03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:09.080
So all these like different factors. And then you plug in numbers into that and you, you know,

03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:12.680
depending on like the range of, you know, your lower bound and your upper bound

03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:17.800
point estimates that you put in, you get out a number at the end for the number of civilizations.

03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:25.000
But what Toby and his crew did differently was, Toby is a researcher at the Future of Humanity

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:32.520
Institute. They, instead of, they realized that it's like basically a statistical quirk that if

03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:36.680
you put in point sources, even if you think you're putting in conservative point sources, because

03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:43.160
on some of these variables, the uncertainty is so large, it spans like maybe even like a couple of

03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:48.680
hundred of orders of magnitude. By putting in point sources, it's always going to lead to

03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:55.560
overestimates. And so they, by putting stuff on a log scale, or actually they did it on like a log

03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:02.440
log scale on some of them, and then like ran the simulation across the whole bucket of uncertainty

03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:07.560
across all those orders of magnitude. When you do that, then actually the number comes out much,

03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.880
much smaller. And that's the more statistically rigorous, you know, mathematically correct way

03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:16.600
of doing the calculation. It's still a lot of hand waving. As science goes, it's like definitely,

03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:23.880
you know, just waving. I don't know what an analogy is, but it's hand wavy. And anyway,

03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:28.280
when they did this, and then they did a Bayesian update on it as well to like factor in the fact

03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:32.360
that there is no evidence that we're picking up, because, you know, no evidence is actually a form

03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:40.680
of evidence, right? And the long and short of it comes out that we're roughly around 70% to be the

03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:47.000
only intelligent civilization in our galaxy thus far, and around 50-50 in the entire observable

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:54.280
universe, which sounds so crazily counterintuitive, but their math is legit. Well, yeah, the math

03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:57.960
around this particular equation, which the equation is ridiculous on many levels, but

03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:04.360
the powerful thing about the equation is there's the different things,

03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:12.040
different components that can be estimated, and the error bars on which can be reduced

03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:18.280
with science. And hence throughout, since the equation came out, the error bars have been

03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:25.560
coming out on different aspects. And so it almost kind of says, this gives you a mission

03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:31.320
to reduce the error bars on these estimates over a period of time. And once you do, you can

03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:35.720
better and better understand, like in the process of reviewing the error bars, you'll get to understand

03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:42.840
actually what is the right way to find out where the aliens are, how many of them there are,

03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:47.960
and all those kinds of things. So I don't think it's good to use that for an estimation. I think

03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:53.480
you do have to think more from first principles, just looking at what life is on Earth,

03:12:55.240 --> 03:13:03.400
and trying to understand the very physics-based, chemistry-based question of what is life,

03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:11.080
maybe computation-based. What the fuck is this thing? And how difficult is it to create this

03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:16.200
thing? It's one way to say how many planets like this are out there, all that kind of stuff, but

03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:23.000
it feels like from our very limited knowledge perspective, the right ways to think,

03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:31.400
how does, what is this thing and how does it originate? From very simple, non-life things,

03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:43.240
how does complex, lifelike things emerge? From a rock to a bacteria, protein, and these weird

03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:50.200
systems that encode information and pass information from self-replicate, and then also

03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:54.760
select each other and mutate in interesting ways such that they can adapt and evolve and build

03:13:54.760 --> 03:13:58.680
increasingly more complex systems. Right. Well, it's a form of information processing.

03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:00.280
Yeah. Right.

03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:06.440
Or it's information transfer, but then also an energy processing, which then results in,

03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:09.720
I guess, information processing. Maybe I'm getting bogged down.

03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:14.360
It's doing some modification and yeah, the input is some energy.

03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:21.720
Right. It's able to extract resources from its environment in order to achieve a goal.

03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:24.040
But the goal doesn't seem to be clear.

03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:28.600
Right. Well, the goal is to make more of itself.

03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:35.160
Yeah. But in a way that increases, I mean, I don't know if evolution

03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:44.520
is a fundamental law of the universe, but it seems to want to replicate itself in a way

03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:50.440
that maximizes the chance of its survival. Individual agents within an ecosystem do.

03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:53.640
Yes. Yes. Evolution itself doesn't give a fuck. Right.

03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:59.480
It's a very, it don't care. It's just like, oh, you optimize it. Well, at least it's certainly,

03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:05.960
yeah, it doesn't care about the welfare of the individual agents within it, but it does seem to,

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:11.000
I don't know. I think the mistake is that we're anthropomorphizing. It's to even try and give

03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:19.400
evolution a mindset because there's a really great post by Eliezer Yudkowsky on

03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:28.440
Les Wrong, which is an alien god. And he talks about the mistake we make when we try and put

03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:33.000
our mind, think through things from an evolutionary perspective, as though like giving

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:39.400
evolution like some kind of agency and what it wants. Yeah. Worth reading. But yeah.

03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:44.600
I would like to say that having interacted with a lot of really smart people that say that

03:15:44.600 --> 03:15:49.960
anthropomorphization is a mistake. I would like to say that saying that anthropomorphization is a

03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:55.880
mistake is a mistake. I think there's a lot of power in anthropomorphization. If I can only say

03:15:55.880 --> 03:16:01.320
that word correctly one time. I think that's actually a really powerful way to reason to

03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:05.880
things. I think people, especially people in robotics seem to run away from it as fast as

03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:17.640
possible. Can you give an example of how it helps in robotics? Oh, that our world is a world of

03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:25.640
humans. And to see robots as fundamentally just tools runs away from the fact that

03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:31.960
we live in a world of a dynamic world of humans that like these, all these game theory systems

03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:38.360
we've, we've talked about that a robot that ever has to interact with humans. And I don't mean

03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:43.400
like intimate friendship interaction. I mean, in a factory setting where it has to deal with the

03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:49.720
uncertainty of humans, all that kind of stuff, you have to acknowledge that the robot's behavior

03:16:49.720 --> 03:16:54.920
has an effect on the human just as much as the human has an effect on the robot. And there's a

03:16:54.920 --> 03:17:01.560
dance there. And you have to realize that this entity, when a human sees a robot, this is obvious

03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:06.680
in a physical manifestation of a robot. They feel a certain way. They have a fear, they have

03:17:06.680 --> 03:17:13.080
uncertainty. They, they have their own personal life projections. We have to have pets and dogs

03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:17.640
and the thing looks like a dog. They have their own memories of what a dog is like. They have

03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:22.120
certain feelings and that's going to be useful in a safety setting, safety critical setting,

03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:27.960
which is one of the most trivial settings for a robot in terms of how to avoid any kind of

03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:34.760
dangerous situations. And a robot should really consider that in navigating its environment.

03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:41.320
And we humans are right to reason about how a robot should consider navigating its environment

03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:51.880
through anthropomorphization. I also think our brains are designed to think in human terms,

03:17:51.880 --> 03:18:01.880
like game theory, I think is best applied in the space of human decisions. And so...

03:18:02.120 --> 03:18:08.440
Right. You're dealing, I mean, with things like AI, AIs, they are, you know, we can somewhat,

03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:13.800
like, I don't think it's, the reason I say anthropomorphization, we need to be careful

03:18:13.800 --> 03:18:21.240
with is because there is a danger of overly applying, overly, wrongly assuming that this

03:18:21.240 --> 03:18:25.640
artificial intelligence is going to operate in any similar way to us, because it is

03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:33.240
it is operating on a fundamentally different substrate, like even dogs or even mice or whatever

03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:38.520
in some ways, like anthropomorphizing them is less of a mistake, I think, than an AI, even though it's

03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:43.240
an AI we built and so on, because at least we know that they're running from the same substrate.

03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:48.520
And they've also evolved from the same, out of the same evolutionary process. You know,

03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:53.800
they've followed this evolution of like, needing to compete for resources and needing to find a

03:18:53.800 --> 03:18:59.000
mate and that kind of stuff. Whereas an AI that has just popped into existence somewhere on like

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:04.120
a cloud server, let's say, you know, or whatever, however it runs and whatever, whether I don't know

03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:07.080
whether they have an internal experience, I don't think they necessarily do. In fact,

03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:13.880
I don't think they do. But the point is, is that to try and apply any kind of modeling of like,

03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:18.200
thinking through problems and decisions in the same way that we do, has to be done extremely

03:19:18.200 --> 03:19:25.560
carefully because they are, like, they're so alien, their method of whatever their form of

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:29.880
thinking is, it's just so different because they've never had to evolve, you know, in the same way.

03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:35.560
Yeah, beautifully put. I was just playing devil's advocate. I do think in certain contexts,

03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.800
anthropomorphization is not going to hurt you. Yes. Engineers run away from it too fast.

03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:47.800
I can see that. But from the most point, you're right. Do you have advice for young people today

03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:56.280
like the 17-year-old that you were of how to live life you can be proud of, how to have a career

03:19:56.280 --> 03:20:03.400
you can be proud of in this world full of mullets? Think about the win-wins. Look for win-win

03:20:03.400 --> 03:20:12.200
situations and be careful not to, you know, overly use your smarts to convince yourself that

03:20:12.200 --> 03:20:15.720
something is win-win when it's not. So that's difficult. And I don't know how to advise,

03:20:15.720 --> 03:20:20.920
you know, people on that because it's something I'm still figuring out myself. But have that as a

03:20:20.920 --> 03:20:28.920
sort of default MO. Don't see things, everything as a zero-sum game. Try to find the positive

03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:34.120
summeness and, like, find ways, if there doesn't seem to be one, consider playing a different game.

03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:40.280
So I would suggest that. Do not become a professional poker player. Because people

03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:44.040
always ask, they're like, oh, she's a pro, I want to do that too. Fine, you could have done it if

03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:49.000
you were, you know, when I started out, it was a very different situation back then. Poker is,

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:56.200
you know, a great game to learn in order to understand the ways to think. And I recommend

03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:59.560
people learn it, but don't try making a living from it these days. It's almost, it's very,

03:20:59.560 --> 03:21:08.680
very difficult to the point of being impossible. And then really, really be aware of how much time

03:21:08.680 --> 03:21:14.840
you spend on your phone and on social media and really try and keep it to a minimum. Be aware that

03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:19.560
basically every moment that you spend on it is bad for you. So it doesn't mean to say you can never

03:21:19.560 --> 03:21:23.960
do it, but just have that running in the background. I'm doing a bad thing for myself right now.

03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:30.280
I think that's the general rule of thumb. Of course, about becoming a professional

03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:37.160
poker player, if there is a thing in your life that's like that and nobody can convince you

03:21:37.160 --> 03:21:45.240
otherwise, just fucking do it. Don't listen to anyone's advice. Find a thing that you can't be

03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:53.400
talked out of too. That's a thing. I like that. Yeah. You were a lead guitarist in a metal band.

03:21:54.280 --> 03:22:04.520
Did I write that down for something? What did you do it for? The performing, was it the pure,

03:22:05.480 --> 03:22:09.640
the music of it? Was it just being a rock star? Why'd you do it?

03:22:11.240 --> 03:22:21.080
So we only ever played two gigs. We weren't famous or anything like that. But I

03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:29.080
was very into metal. It was my entire identity from the age of 16 to 23.

03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:33.560
What's the best metal band of all time? Don't ask me that. It's so hard to answer.

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:45.400
I had a long argument with... I'm a guitarist, more like a classic rock guitarist. I've had

03:22:45.400 --> 03:22:52.040
friends who are very big Pantera fans. There was often arguments about what's the better metal

03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:58.360
band, Metallica versus Pantera. This is a more 90s maybe discussion. But I was always on the side of

03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:05.560
Metallica, both musically and in terms of performance and the depth of lyrics and so on.

03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:11.560
Basically, everybody was against me. Because if you're a true metal fan,

03:23:12.200 --> 03:23:19.480
I guess the idea goes is you can't possibly be a Metallica fan. Metallica is pop. They sold out.

03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:26.440
Metallica are metal. Again, you can't say who was the godfather of metal, blah, blah, blah.

03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:35.640
We're so groundbreaking and so brilliant. You've named literally two of my favorite bands. When

03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:39.640
you asked that question, who are my favorites, those are two that came up. A third one is

03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:50.600
Children of Bodom, who I just think tick all the boxes for me. Yeah, I don't know. Nowadays,

03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:56.760
I feel like a repulsion to the... I was that myself. I'd be like, who do you prefer more?

03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:02.760
You have to rank them. But it's this false zero-sum-ness that's why they're so additive.

03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:07.800
There's no conflict there. When people ask that kind of question about anything, movies,

03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:17.560
I feel like it's hard work and it's unfair, but you should pick one. That's actually the same kind

03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:21.240
of... It's like a fear of a commitment. When people ask me, what's your favorite band, it's like,

03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:26.360
whew. But it's good to pick. Exactly. Thank you for the tough question.

03:24:27.480 --> 03:24:30.520
Well, maybe not in the context when a lot of people are listening.

03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:36.440
Ken, I was like, what? Why does it matter? No, it does. Are you still into metal?

03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:39.720
Funny enough, I was listening to a bunch before I came over here.

03:24:39.720 --> 03:24:44.520
Oh, do you use it for motivation or get you in a certain room?

03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:47.400
Yeah. I was weirdly listening to 80s hair metal before I came.

03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:53.240
Does that count as metal? I think so. It's like proto metal and it's happy.

03:24:53.240 --> 03:25:00.920
It's optimistic, happy, proto metal. All these genres bleed into each other. To answer your

03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:07.240
question about guitar playing, my relationship with it was kind of weird in that I was deeply

03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:13.640
uncreative. My objective would be to hear some really hard technical solo and then learn it,

03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:18.840
memorize it, and then play it perfectly. But I was incapable of trying to write my own music.

03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:25.800
The idea was just absolutely terrifying. But I was also just thinking, it'd be kind of cool to

03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:33.240
actually try starting a band again and getting back into it and write. But it's scary.

03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:39.000
It's scary. I mean, I put out some guitar playing just other people's covers like I play Comfortly

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:43.880
Numb on the internet. It's scary too. It's scary putting stuff out there.

03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:49.720
I had this similar kind of fascination with technical playing both on piano and guitar.

03:25:55.640 --> 03:26:01.000
One of the reasons I started learning guitar is from Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Crowley's solo.

03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:08.920
One of the first solos I learned is that there's a beauty to it. There's a melodic beauty to it.

03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:13.080
There's some tapping, but it's just really fast.

03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:15.560
Beautiful, like arpeggios.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:20.680
Yeah, arpeggios. Yeah. But there's a melody that you can hear through it, but there's also a build

03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:25.160
up. It's a beautiful solo, but it's also technically just visually the way it looks

03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:31.080
when a person's watching. You feel like a rock star playing it. But it ultimately has to do

03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:39.480
with technical. You're not developing the part of your brain that I think requires you to generate

03:26:39.480 --> 03:26:43.960
beautiful music. It is ultimately technical in nature. And so that took me a long time to

03:26:44.840 --> 03:26:51.960
let go of that and just be able to write music myself. And that's a different journey, I think.

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:56.920
I think that journey is a little bit more inspired in the blues world, for example,

03:26:56.920 --> 03:27:00.040
where improvisation is more valued, obviously, in jazz and so on. But

03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:08.600
I think ultimately it's a more rewarding journey because your relationship with the guitar then

03:27:08.600 --> 03:27:15.640
becomes a kind of escape from the world where you can create. I mean, creating stuff is-

03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:20.520
And it's something you work with because my relationship with my guitar was like it was

03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:24.680
something to tame and defeat. Yeah, the challenge.

03:27:24.680 --> 03:27:28.840
Which was kind of what my whole personality was back then. I was just very, as I said,

03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:35.640
very competitive, very just like must bend this thing to my will. Whereas writing music,

03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:39.880
it's like a dance. You work with it. But I think because of the competitive aspect,

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:46.280
for me at least, that's still there, which creates anxiety about playing publicly or all that kind of

03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:50.840
stuff. I think there's just like a harsh self-criticism within the whole thing. It's

03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:54.040
really tough. I want to hear some of your stuff.

03:27:55.320 --> 03:28:00.920
I mean, there's certain things that feel really personal. And on top of that, as we talked about

03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:06.120
poker offline, there are certain things that you get to a certain height in your life. And that

03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:10.680
doesn't have to be very high, but you get to a certain height and then you put it aside for a bit.

03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:17.960
And it's hard to return to it because you remember being good. And it's hard to, like,

03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.360
you being at a very high level in poker, it might be hard for you to return to poker

03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:26.840
every once in a while and enjoy it, knowing that you're just not as sharp as it used to be

03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:31.480
because you're not doing it every single day. That's something I always wonder with, I mean,

03:28:31.480 --> 03:28:36.600
even just like in chess with Kasparov, some of these greats just returning to it. It's almost

03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:43.560
painful. And I feel that way with guitar too, you know, because I used to play like every day a lot.

03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:49.160
So returning to it is painful because it's like accepting the fact that this whole

03:28:50.040 --> 03:28:58.120
ride is finite and that you have a prime, there's a time when you're really good and now it's over.

03:28:58.120 --> 03:29:05.800
And now we're on a different chapter of life. But you can still discover joy within that

03:29:05.800 --> 03:29:11.000
process. It's been tough, especially with some level of like, as people get to know you,

03:29:11.960 --> 03:29:19.160
and people film stuff, you don't have the privacy of just sharing something with

03:29:19.160 --> 03:29:25.960
a few people around you. That's a beautiful privacy that with the internet is disappearing.

03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:27.720
Yeah, that's a really good point.

03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:34.120
Yeah. But all those pressures aside, if you really, you can step up and still enjoy the

03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:41.080
fuck out of a good musical performance. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:48.440
What's the meaning of life? It's in your name, as we talked about, you have to live up,

03:29:48.440 --> 03:29:52.120
do you feel the requirement to have to live up to your name?

03:29:54.040 --> 03:29:55.400
Because live? Yeah.

03:29:56.120 --> 03:30:00.280
No, because I don't see it. I mean, my, again, it's kind of like,

03:30:00.280 --> 03:30:07.400
I don't know, because my full name is Olivia. So I can retreat in that and be like, oh,

03:30:07.400 --> 03:30:14.200
Olivia, what does that even mean? Live up to live. No, I can't say I do because I've never

03:30:14.200 --> 03:30:18.360
thought of it that way. And then your name backwards is evil, as we also talked about.

03:30:21.080 --> 03:30:26.200
There's like layers. I mean, I feel the urge to live up to that, to be the inverse of evil.

03:30:26.360 --> 03:30:32.440
Yeah. Or even better, because I don't think, you know, is the inverse of evil good or is good

03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:37.400
something completely separate to that? I think my intuition says it's the latter, but I don't know.

03:30:37.400 --> 03:30:44.920
Anyway, getting in the weeds. What is the meaning of all this? Of life? Why are we here?

03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:55.400
I think to explore, have fun and understand and make more of here and to keep the game going.

03:30:55.880 --> 03:30:57.160
Of here? More of here?

03:30:57.160 --> 03:31:00.040
More of this. Whatever this is.

03:31:00.040 --> 03:31:06.680
More of experience. Just to have more of experience and ideally positive experience. And

03:31:08.360 --> 03:31:12.760
more complex, you know, to, I guess, try and put it into a sort of vaguely scientific term.

03:31:15.640 --> 03:31:21.320
Make it so that the program required, the length of code required to describe the universe

03:31:21.320 --> 03:31:25.960
is as long as possible. And, you know, highly complex and therefore interesting.

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:32.440
Because again, like, I know, you know, we bang the metaphor to death, but like,

03:31:33.640 --> 03:31:40.040
tiled with X, you know, tiled with paper clips doesn't require that much of a code to describe.

03:31:40.920 --> 03:31:44.680
Obviously, it may be something emerges from it, but that steady state, assuming a steady state,

03:31:44.680 --> 03:31:50.360
it's not very interesting. Whereas it seems like our universe is over time becoming more and more

03:31:50.360 --> 03:31:54.600
complex and interesting. There's so much richness and beauty and diversity on this earth. And I

03:31:54.600 --> 03:32:00.360
want that to continue and get more. I want more diversity. And in the very best sense of that word

03:32:01.720 --> 03:32:06.200
is to me the goal of all this.

03:32:07.080 --> 03:32:10.600
Yeah. And somehow have fun in the process.

03:32:11.880 --> 03:32:17.000
Because we do create a lot of fun things along. Instead of in this creative force

03:32:17.800 --> 03:32:23.160
and all the beautiful things we create, somehow there's like a funness to it. And perhaps that

03:32:23.160 --> 03:32:26.680
has to do with the finiteness of life, the finiteness of all these experiences,

03:32:28.200 --> 03:32:34.760
which is what makes them kind of unique. Like the fact that they end, there's this, whatever it is,

03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:46.040
falling in love or creating a piece of art or creating a bridge or creating a rocket or creating

03:32:46.040 --> 03:32:57.160
a, I don't know, just the businesses that build something or solve something. The fact that it

03:32:57.160 --> 03:33:08.600
is born and it dies somehow embeds it with fun, with joy for the people involved. I don't know

03:33:08.600 --> 03:33:13.960
what that is, the finiteness of it. It can do. Some people struggle with the, you know, I mean,

03:33:13.960 --> 03:33:21.240
a big thing I think that one has to learn is being okay with things coming to an end. And

03:33:23.640 --> 03:33:27.640
in terms of projects and so on, right, people cling onto things beyond what they're meant to

03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:34.040
be doing, you know, beyond what is reasonable. And I'm going to have to come to terms with this

03:33:34.040 --> 03:33:39.400
podcast coming to an end. I really enjoy talking to you. I think it's obvious, as we've talked about

03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:45.800
many times, you should be doing a podcast. You're already doing a lot of stuff publicly

03:33:45.800 --> 03:33:49.640
to the world, which is awesome. And you're a great educator. You're a great mind. You're great into

03:33:49.640 --> 03:33:55.000
like, but it's also this whole medium of just talking is also fun. It's a fun one. It really

03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:01.320
is good. And it's just, it's nothing but like, oh, it's just so much fun. And you can just get into

03:34:01.320 --> 03:34:07.960
so many, yeah, there's this space to just explore and see what comes and emerges. And yeah. Yeah,

03:34:07.960 --> 03:34:11.320
to understand yourself better. And if you're talking to others, to understand them better

03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:15.160
and together with them. I mean, I, you should do your, you should do your own podcast,

03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:19.480
but you should also do a podcast with C as we've talked about the two of you have such

03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:27.080
different minds that like melt together and just hilarious ways, fascinating ways, just

03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:32.760
the tension of ideas there is really powerful. But in general, I think you, you, you got a beautiful

03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:37.160
voice. So thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for

03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:41.240
honoring me with this conversation and with your valuable time. Thanks, Liv. Thank you.

03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:46.120
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lou Barry. To support this podcast,

03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:50.920
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:57.480
Richard Feynman. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which

03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:02.920
might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of

03:35:02.920 --> 03:35:09.000
uncertainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything. And there are many

03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:14.440
things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here.

03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:21.400
I don't have to know the answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things by being lost

03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:27.080
in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.

03:35:28.520 --> 03:35:31.320
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
