WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
It was just like one of those moments where

00:02.360 --> 00:05.520
we saw it at the same time and we're standing

00:05.520 --> 00:10.700
by the tail and the snake was so big that, I

00:10.700 --> 00:13.480
mean, this must've been a 25 foot Anaconda

00:13.580 --> 00:16.760
dead asleep with a, with a, probably a 16 foot

00:16.760 --> 00:19.660
Anaconda like sprawled across her and they're

00:19.660 --> 00:21.660
laying in the starlight and we're floating on

00:21.660 --> 00:23.600
top of a lake standing there in the middle of

00:23.600 --> 00:27.320
the Amazon and JJ just, I just, I could feel the

00:27.320 --> 00:28.780
blood drain out of his face.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.200
And as like a, however old I was, you know,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.580
maybe 20 years old, I just said, if I, if we

00:34.580 --> 00:39.000
could somehow show people this, we'll be on the

00:39.000 --> 00:41.280
front cover of national geographic and we can

00:41.280 --> 00:42.680
protect all the jungle that we want.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.880
And so I tried to catch it.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
So I jumped on the snake and the only

00:49.960 --> 00:51.740
measurement I have of this animal is that when

00:51.740 --> 00:53.360
I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch

00:53.360 --> 00:56.840
my fingers and so I was, you know, my, my, my

00:56.840 --> 00:58.780
feet were dragging and to her credit, this

00:58.780 --> 01:00.440
Anaconda did not turn around and eat me

01:00.440 --> 01:02.880
because her head was, you know, this way and,

01:02.960 --> 01:05.360
and she went and she reached the edge of the

01:05.600 --> 01:08.180
grass Island and she starts plunging into the

01:08.180 --> 01:11.660
dark and so I'm watching the stars vibrate as

01:11.660 --> 01:13.300
this Anaconda is going and I had to make the

01:13.300 --> 01:17.320
choice of either going head first down into the

01:17.320 --> 01:21.840
black, which no thank you, or stopping and just

01:21.920 --> 01:24.140
keeping my hand on this thing as it raced by me.

01:24.140 --> 01:26.040
And I just felt the scales and the muscle and the

01:26.040 --> 01:28.960
power go by and then eventually taper down to

01:28.960 --> 01:31.080
the tail until it slipped away into the darkness.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.280
And I was laying there just panting.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.100
The following is a conversation with Paul

01:38.120 --> 01:41.520
Rosalie, a conservationist, explorer, author,

01:41.520 --> 01:45.160
filmmaker, and real life Tarzan since for much of

01:45.160 --> 01:48.040
the past 17 years, Paul has lived deep in the

01:48.040 --> 01:50.380
Amazon rainforest, protecting endangered

01:50.380 --> 01:53.540
species and trees from poachers, loggers, and

01:53.540 --> 01:54.840
foreign nations funding them.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.560
He is the founder of jungle keepers, which today

01:58.560 --> 02:02.800
protects over 50,000 acres of threatened habitat.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.480
And Paul is one of the most incredible human

02:06.480 --> 02:07.520
beings I've ever met.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.560
I hope to travel with him in the Amazon jungle

02:10.560 --> 02:15.040
one day because in his eyes, I saw truth that can

02:15.040 --> 02:17.960
only be discovered directly by spending time among

02:17.960 --> 02:21.560
the immensity and power of nature at its purest.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.400
This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.760
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.760
And now to your friends.

02:30.280 --> 02:35.880
Here's Paul Rosalie in 2006 at 18 years old, you

02:35.880 --> 02:37.800
fled New York and traveled to the Amazon.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.440
This started a journey that I think lasts to this day.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.360
Tell me about this first leap.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.520
What in your heart pulled you towards the Amazon jungle?

02:47.400 --> 02:50.760
From the time I was, you know, three years old, I'd say,

02:50.760 --> 02:54.520
you know, it was dinosaurs, wildlife documentaries,

02:54.520 --> 02:55.680
Steve Irwin, you name it.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.080
And like when my parents had, you know, nature

02:59.080 --> 03:01.200
versus nurture, they, they nurtured my nature.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.880
I was always just drawn to streams, forests.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.960
I wanted to go explore where the little, little

03:06.960 --> 03:07.480
creek led.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.040
I wanted to see the turtles and the snakes.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.280
And so I was a kid that hated school, did not

03:12.280 --> 03:13.080
get along with school.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.440
I was dyslexic and didn't know it undiagnosed.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.240
I didn't read until I was like 10 years old, like

03:18.320 --> 03:19.000
way behind.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.600
And so for me, the forest was safety.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.640
Like I remember one time in first grade, they had

03:24.640 --> 03:26.040
you doing those, you know, those multiplication

03:26.040 --> 03:28.400
sheets that was pure hell for me.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.880
And so I actually got so upset that I couldn't do

03:30.880 --> 03:33.520
it, that I ran out the classroom, ran out the

03:33.520 --> 03:35.920
door and went to the nearest woods and I stayed

03:35.920 --> 03:36.960
there because that was safe.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.360
And so for me, like once I got to the point where

03:39.360 --> 03:41.600
I was like high school, isn't working out, I had

03:41.600 --> 03:43.440
incredibly supportive parents that were like,

03:43.440 --> 03:46.720
look, just get out, take your GED, get out of high

03:46.720 --> 03:47.800
school after 10th grade.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.000
You got to go to college, but like start doing

03:51.000 --> 03:51.760
something you love.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.840
And so I saved up and bought a ticket to the

03:54.840 --> 03:56.880
Amazon and met some indigenous guys.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.200
And the second I walked in that forest, it was

04:00.200 --> 04:01.920
like, it's like the first scene in Jurassic Park

04:01.920 --> 04:03.360
when they see the dinosaurs and they go, oh,

04:03.360 --> 04:03.960
this is it.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.120
I walked in there and just, I looked at those

04:06.120 --> 04:06.680
giant trees.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.680
I saw leaf cutter ants in real life and I just

04:08.680 --> 04:11.720
went, oh, it was like the movie just started.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.400
You know, that was when, that was when like I

04:13.400 --> 04:14.280
came online.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.880
Can you put it into words?

04:15.920 --> 04:19.120
What is it about that place that felt like home?

04:19.160 --> 04:20.560
What was it that drew you?

04:20.560 --> 04:24.440
What aspect of nature, the streams, the water,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.160
the, the forest, the jungle, the animals, what

04:28.200 --> 04:28.880
what drew you?

04:29.880 --> 04:31.840
I just, it's always been in my blood.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.840
I mean, for any forest, I mean, whether it's,

04:33.840 --> 04:36.320
you know, upstate New York or, or India or

04:36.320 --> 04:39.520
Borneo, but the Amazon it's, it's, it's all of

04:39.520 --> 04:41.960
that turned up to this level where everything

04:41.960 --> 04:43.800
is superlatively diverse.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.520
You know, you have more plants and animals than

04:45.520 --> 04:48.120
anywhere else on earth, not just now, but in

04:48.120 --> 04:49.440
the entire fossil record.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.360
It's the Andes Amazon interface.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.600
There's just that's terrestrially.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
That's, that's where it is.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.680
That's the greatest library of life that has

04:55.680 --> 04:56.480
ever existed.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.840
And so you're just, you're so stimulated.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.280
You're so overwhelmed with color and diversity

05:01.280 --> 05:03.880
and beauty and this overwhelming sense of

05:03.880 --> 05:06.320
natural majesty of these, you know, thousand

05:06.320 --> 05:08.920
year old trees and half the life is up in the

05:08.920 --> 05:10.160
canopy of those trees.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.360
We don't even have access to it.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.720
There's stuff without names walking around on

05:13.720 --> 05:14.360
those branches.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.560
And it's like, it just takes you somewhere.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.280
And so going there, it was like, you know, the

05:19.280 --> 05:21.000
guys I met just opened the door and they were

05:21.000 --> 05:22.520
like, you know, how far do you want to go down

05:22.520 --> 05:23.120
the rabbit hole?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.400
How, how, how much of this do you want to see?

05:25.720 --> 05:28.440
You mentioned Steve Irvin, uh, you list a bunch

05:28.440 --> 05:29.920
of heroes that you have.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.880
He's one of them.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.360
And you said that when you're unsure about a

05:33.360 --> 05:36.640
decision, you ask yourself, uh, WWSD, what

05:36.640 --> 05:37.840
would Steve do?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.880
Why is that such a good heuristic for life?

05:40.920 --> 05:41.680
What would Steve do?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.160
He's, he's a human being that like everything we

05:45.160 --> 05:47.080
saw from Steve Irwin was positive.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.000
Everything was with a smile on his face.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.200
If he was getting bitten by a reticulated

05:51.200 --> 05:52.400
Python, he was smiling.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.440
If he was, you know, getting destroyed in the

05:55.440 --> 05:57.640
news for feeding a crocodile with his son too

05:57.640 --> 05:59.560
close, he was trying to explain to people why

05:59.560 --> 06:01.880
it's okay and why we have to love these animals.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.080
And everything was about love.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.640
Everything was about, you know, wildlife and

06:05.640 --> 06:06.240
protecting.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.640
And to me, a person like that, that where you

06:09.680 --> 06:11.240
only see positive things.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.720
That's, that's a role model.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.720
And it's just like an endless curiosity and

06:14.720 --> 06:17.120
hunger to explore this, this world of nature.

06:17.200 --> 06:17.480
Yeah.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.920
And then insatiable madness for, for, for

06:19.920 --> 06:20.600
wildlife.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.040
I mean, the guy was just so much fun.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.800
I got, uh, if it's okay, uh, read to you a few

06:25.800 --> 06:26.760
of your own words.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.640
You open the book, mother of God with the

06:30.640 --> 06:32.880
passage that I think beautifully paints a

06:32.880 --> 06:35.600
scene before he died.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.600
Santiago Duran told me a secret.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.840
It was late at night in a Palm thatched hut on

06:40.840 --> 06:44.120
the bank of the Tampa Potter river, deep in

06:44.120 --> 06:46.240
the Southwestern corner of the Amazon Basin.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.640
Besides a mud oven, two wild boar heads

06:49.640 --> 06:53.160
sizzling, sizzled in a cradle of embers.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.640
They're protruding tusks, curling in static

06:56.640 --> 06:57.920
agony as they cooked.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.760
The smell of burning, sacropia wood and

07:02.760 --> 07:04.520
cinched flesh filled the air.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.240
Woven basket containing monkey skulls hung

07:08.240 --> 07:10.800
from the rafters, where stars speak through

07:10.800 --> 07:12.000
the gaps in the thatching.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.560
A pair of chickens huddled in the corner,

07:14.600 --> 07:15.760
conversing softly.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.480
We sat facing each other on sturdy benches

07:20.000 --> 07:22.800
across a table hewn from a single cross section

07:23.080 --> 07:26.080
of some massive tree now nearly consumed by

07:26.080 --> 07:26.800
termites.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.800
The song of a million insects and frogs filled

07:30.800 --> 07:31.320
the night.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.160
Santiago's cigarette trembled in the aged

07:34.160 --> 07:36.680
fingers as he leaned close over the candlelight

07:37.000 --> 07:39.600
to describe a place hidden in the jungle.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.760
That line, the songs of a million insects and

07:43.760 --> 07:45.680
frogs filled the night for some reason hit me.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.320
What's it like sitting there conversing among

07:49.320 --> 07:51.480
so many living creatures all around you?

07:52.160 --> 07:54.720
Every night in the jungle, you live in constant

07:54.720 --> 07:59.360
awareness of that out there in the darkness are

07:59.640 --> 08:02.040
literally millions of heartbeats around you.

08:02.400 --> 08:07.360
And so like, we exist in this, in this, you

08:07.360 --> 08:10.000
know, domesticated paved world most of the time.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.360
But when you go out there past the roads and the

08:13.360 --> 08:15.640
telephone poles and the hospitals and you make it

08:15.960 --> 08:19.920
out into earth, just wild earth, and there's no,

08:19.920 --> 08:21.160
there's no, there's not, it's not like this is a

08:21.160 --> 08:21.800
national park.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.480
There's no rescue helicopter waiting to come

08:23.480 --> 08:23.720
get you.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.040
You are out there and you're surrounded at night

08:27.560 --> 08:30.440
by, I mean, there are snakes and jaguars and

08:30.440 --> 08:32.440
frogs and insects and all this stuff just

08:32.440 --> 08:34.320
crawling through the swamps and through the

08:34.320 --> 08:35.680
trees and through the branches.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.360
And we put on headlamps and go out into the night

08:38.360 --> 08:41.000
and just absolutely fall to our knees with wonder

08:41.000 --> 08:41.920
of the things that we see.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.680
It's, it's absolutely incredible.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.680
And most of it doesn't make sounds like the

08:45.680 --> 08:46.480
insects do.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.760
The insects do, the frogs do.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.640
You have some of the night birds making sounds,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.800
but a lot of it, everything has evolved to be

08:52.800 --> 08:54.600
silent, invisible.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.800
I mean, everything there is in the, on, on the

08:57.800 --> 08:58.120
list.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.000
Like, like I, there's another line in mother of

09:00.000 --> 09:01.520
God where I said, like, you know, like life is

09:01.520 --> 09:03.600
just like a temporary moment of stasis and like

09:03.600 --> 09:05.720
the churning recycling death march.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.600
That is the Amazon.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.200
Like it's, it's been called the greatest natural

09:10.200 --> 09:11.280
battlefield on earth.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.520
I mean, if any, in any square acre, there's more

09:13.520 --> 09:16.400
stuff eating other things than anywhere else.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.680
And, and you go through a swamp in the Amazon and

09:19.680 --> 09:21.720
there's like, there's tarantulas floating on the

09:21.720 --> 09:22.040
water.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.400
There's frogs in the trees.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.120
There's, there's, there's tadpoles hanging from

09:27.320 --> 09:29.520
leaves waiting to drop into the water.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.080
There's fish waiting to eat them.

09:31.080 --> 09:31.920
There's birds in the trees.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.320
You sit, you literally are surrounded by so many

09:34.320 --> 09:36.080
things that your brain can't process it.

09:36.640 --> 09:42.160
It's, it's just overwhelming life churning

09:42.160 --> 09:43.080
death march.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.680
Some of the creatures are waiting and some of them

09:46.680 --> 09:48.680
are being a bit more proactive about it.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.480
What do you make of that churning death march?

09:54.680 --> 09:56.480
That the amount of murder that's happening all

09:56.480 --> 09:58.600
around you at all scales, what is that?

09:58.840 --> 10:02.000
You know, we, uh, we dramatize wars and the

10:02.000 --> 10:03.960
millions of people that were lost in world war

10:03.960 --> 10:07.240
two, uh, some of them tortured, some of them

10:07.280 --> 10:10.200
dying, uh, with a gun in hand, some of them

10:10.200 --> 10:14.560
civilians, but it's just millions of people.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.840
What about the billions and billions and billions

10:17.840 --> 10:19.800
of organisms that are just being murdered all

10:19.800 --> 10:20.240
around you?

10:20.520 --> 10:23.880
Does that, um, do you, does that change your view

10:23.880 --> 10:26.400
of nature of life here?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.320
It, I've always kind of wondered like that, like

10:29.320 --> 10:31.520
when you see like a, you know, a wildebeest taken

10:31.520 --> 10:34.960
down by lions and eaten from behind while it's

10:34.960 --> 10:37.800
alive and it makes you question God, you know,

10:37.800 --> 10:39.560
you go, how could, how could, how could they

10:39.560 --> 10:40.440
let this happen?

10:41.160 --> 10:46.800
Um, in the Amazon, I find personally that these

10:46.800 --> 10:51.640
natural processes make up almost a religion that

10:51.720 --> 10:55.440
it reminds you how temporary we are that, you

10:55.440 --> 10:57.480
know, the, the, the bot flies that are trying to

10:57.480 --> 10:59.560
get into your skin and the mosquitoes that are

10:59.560 --> 11:02.320
trying to suck your blood and the, you know, that

11:02.320 --> 11:04.720
when you sweat, you see, you see the, you

11:04.720 --> 11:06.960
literally can like hold out your arm and watch

11:06.960 --> 11:09.520
the condensation come off of your skin and rise up

11:09.520 --> 11:11.840
into the canopy and join the clouds and rain back

11:11.840 --> 11:12.880
down in the afternoon.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.000
And, and then you drink the river and start it all

11:15.000 --> 11:15.480
over again.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.320
And it's like, it's flowing through you.

11:17.320 --> 11:22.440
So the Amazon reminds me that, that there's a lot

11:22.440 --> 11:23.640
that we don't understand.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.560
And so when it comes to that overwhelming and

11:26.560 --> 11:29.960
collective murder, as Werner Herzog put it, um,

11:30.440 --> 11:31.960
it's just, it's just part of the show.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.760
It's part of the freak show of the Amazonian

11:33.760 --> 11:34.120
night.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.680
I see you, I, you in certain moments able to

11:39.680 --> 11:42.160
feel one with a mosquito that's trying to kill

11:42.160 --> 11:42.800
you slowly.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.120
One with the mosquito is a stretch.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.160
Is it always the enemy?

11:48.280 --> 11:50.000
What I mean is like, you're part of the machine

11:50.000 --> 11:50.720
there, right?

11:50.760 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.920
And it's like fair play.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.080
It's like fair play.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.520
So like we have bullet ants and like, you know,

11:54.520 --> 11:56.400
you get, you get nailed by a bullet ant and you

11:56.400 --> 11:58.080
just go, yeah, well, well done.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.480
Today's over.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.720
I'm going back to bed and I'm taking a pile of

12:01.720 --> 12:02.600
Tylenol and you know,

12:02.760 --> 12:07.200
do you think in that sense, when you're out there,

12:07.240 --> 12:09.200
are you a part of nature or are you separate

12:09.200 --> 12:09.640
from nature?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.240
Is man a part of nature or separate?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.280
I think that's what's so refreshing about it is

12:13.280 --> 12:14.720
that out there you truly are.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.800
And so whether we're bringing researchers or

12:17.800 --> 12:20.040
film crews or, or whether we're just out there

12:20.040 --> 12:23.880
ourselves on an expedition, um, you truly are

12:23.880 --> 12:24.560
a part of nature.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.600
And so one of the things that the, my team and I

12:27.600 --> 12:29.400
started doing when I became friends with these

12:29.400 --> 12:31.720
guys, you know, this is a family of indigenous

12:32.120 --> 12:34.440
people from the community of Infierno and they

12:34.640 --> 12:38.280
took me in and as we got close, they started

12:38.280 --> 12:40.360
saying, you know, you can come with us on our

12:40.360 --> 12:41.720
like annual hunting trip.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.640
And I went, okay.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.840
And it's four guys in a boat and you don't want

12:45.840 --> 12:46.760
to get your clothes wet.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.360
So we're all in like our boxers in a canoe with

12:49.360 --> 12:52.000
the motor going out past the places that have

12:52.000 --> 12:54.640
names and you're out in the middle of the jungle.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.440
And the thing is like, when you're, when your

12:57.440 --> 13:01.960
motor breaks, you are so quickly reminded of.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.400
The inerrant truths, like the things that

13:06.400 --> 13:08.840
nobody can argue with.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.680
And we live in such a human world where

13:10.680 --> 13:13.400
everything is debatable, religion and politics

13:13.400 --> 13:14.720
and perspectives on everything.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.120
And then you get down to this point where it's

13:16.120 --> 13:20.320
like, if we don't figure something out, the river

13:20.320 --> 13:22.000
is going to rise and take the boat.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.240
That's the truth.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.480
And ain't nobody going to like argue with that.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.680
And it's like, to me, there's a beauty in that

13:27.680 --> 13:30.480
truth because then all of us are united there in

13:30.480 --> 13:32.320
that, in that truth against like the natural

13:32.320 --> 13:33.440
facts around us.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.840
And so to me, I, that's, that's, that's a state

13:36.840 --> 13:38.600
where I feel very, very at home.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.280
And the Amazon is more efficient than most

13:41.280 --> 13:43.560
places on earth at swallowing you up.

13:44.240 --> 13:44.560
God.

13:44.560 --> 13:44.840
Yeah.

13:44.920 --> 13:45.320
Okay.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.360
So just to linger on that, because you've, you've

13:49.360 --> 13:53.520
spoken about Francisco de Aralana, who's this

13:53.520 --> 13:57.800
explorer in, in 1541 and 42 that sailed the

13:57.800 --> 13:58.720
length of the Amazon.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.000
Probably one of the first, and there's just a

14:01.000 --> 14:03.400
few things I should probably read.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.680
I should probably find a good book on him

14:05.680 --> 14:07.120
because the guy seems like a gangster.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.920
Yes, there's some great books on him.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.400
So he sailed, he led the expedition that sailed

14:13.400 --> 14:15.520
all the way from one end to the other.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.760
There's like a rebuilding of a ship, which is

14:18.760 --> 14:19.680
insanity.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.240
Yeah.

14:20.280 --> 14:20.520
Yeah.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.000
So you, cause it speaks to the thing is like

14:23.000 --> 14:24.400
nobody's going to come and rescue you.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.000
No, you have to, if your boat dies, you got

14:28.000 --> 14:28.840
to have to rebuild it.

14:28.960 --> 14:29.200
Yeah.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.600
So they came down the Andes, entered in the

14:31.600 --> 14:33.920
headwaters of the Amazon, constructed some sort

14:33.920 --> 14:37.840
of raft, boat craft, something, and made it

14:37.840 --> 14:39.480
down the entire Amazon basin.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.240
Of course, his stories are the ones that led to

14:42.240 --> 14:44.200
the Amazon being called the Amazon because he

14:44.200 --> 14:45.320
reported tribes of women.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.720
He reported these large cities, places where

14:47.720 --> 14:50.320
the tribes lived on farms of river turtles that

14:50.320 --> 14:51.880
they corralled and they lived off of that

14:51.880 --> 14:52.400
protein.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
And then when they came out to the mouth of the

14:54.400 --> 14:56.520
Amazon, if I remember it correctly, that just

14:56.520 --> 14:58.840
through navigation and the stars, they were able

14:58.840 --> 15:01.960
to calculate where the way was back to Spain and

15:01.960 --> 15:05.000
make a boat seaworthy enough to bring them home.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.560
Incredible.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.360
Absolutely.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.080
Do people like that inspire you, your own

15:10.080 --> 15:10.520
journey?

15:10.880 --> 15:15.640
Like what gives you kind of strength that in these

15:15.640 --> 15:18.320
harshest of times and harshest of conditions you

15:18.320 --> 15:19.120
can persevere?

15:19.680 --> 15:19.920
Yeah.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.880
I mean, you look at the stories of people that

15:21.880 --> 15:23.760
are so, you know, these stories of people that

15:23.760 --> 15:27.160
have overcome incredible suffering like that or

15:27.160 --> 15:29.040
like, you know, what Shackleton did or something

15:29.040 --> 15:29.360
like that.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.320
And so like when you're, you know, I've been, you

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
know, your tent gets washed away, you go to

15:33.320 --> 15:35.800
sleep and the river rises 20 feet and washes away

15:35.800 --> 15:37.480
your tent and you crawl out and all you have is

15:37.480 --> 15:40.280
a machete and a headlamp, literally no bag, no

15:40.280 --> 15:41.360
food, no nothing.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.680
And you go, wow, the next six days before I reach

15:43.680 --> 15:46.560
it back to a town is going to be just pure hell.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.360
I'm going to be sleeping on the ground, covered in

15:48.360 --> 15:49.960
ants, destroyed by mosquitoes.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.440
And then it becomes, you know, am I in any

15:53.440 --> 15:57.600
capacity, any percentage as tough and resilient as

15:57.600 --> 15:59.960
the people that I've read about that have made it

15:59.960 --> 16:01.480
through things far worse than this?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.040
And then that's the game you play.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.440
What goes through your head when all you got is the

16:05.440 --> 16:06.520
headlamp and the machete.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.360
So are you thinking at all?

16:10.280 --> 16:13.000
Like I've, I've gotten a chance to interact quite

16:13.000 --> 16:15.120
a lot with Elon Musk and he constantly puts out

16:15.120 --> 16:17.600
fires, having to run several companies.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.040
There's never a kind of, uh, whiny deliberation

16:22.040 --> 16:22.800
about issues.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.360
You just always want one step forward, how to

16:26.360 --> 16:27.160
solve, right?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.160
This is the situation.

16:28.160 --> 16:28.840
How do you solve it?

16:29.240 --> 16:32.000
Or do you also have a kind of self motivating,

16:32.720 --> 16:35.920
almost egotistical, like I'm a bad motherfucker.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.040
I can handle anything, almost like trying to fake

16:39.040 --> 16:40.240
it till you make it kind of thing.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.960
There's, there was a little bit of your machete.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.560
And I got a sword.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.600
Um, there, there may be, may have been a little

16:48.600 --> 16:51.240
bit of that when I was like, you know, like 14,

16:51.240 --> 16:53.320
15 years old, I'd like, you know, have like a

16:53.320 --> 16:55.440
hunting knife and my dog and I'd go out into the

16:55.440 --> 16:57.320
woods, like the cat skills and survive for a

16:57.320 --> 16:59.320
weekend with my rule was one match.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.840
You know, you get one match and you got to make

17:01.840 --> 17:03.760
shelter and then, you know, I'd bring like a

17:03.760 --> 17:05.840
steak and like make a fire and stuff.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.400
And like at that point there may be with some

17:07.400 --> 17:11.440
ego, but in the Amazon, you get stripped down so

17:11.440 --> 17:14.320
completely that you, it's like that thing, like,

17:14.360 --> 17:16.600
you know, watch the atheism leave everyone's

17:16.600 --> 17:18.200
body when they think they're about to die.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.520
It's like when you find yourself staring up at the

17:21.520 --> 17:23.640
Amazon at night and you go, there is no hope of

17:23.640 --> 17:24.200
getting out of here.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.680
I mean, I was once lost in a swamp where it took

17:26.680 --> 17:28.280
me days to get out of there.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.000
And there was, there was moments where I just

17:31.000 --> 17:32.720
said, this is, you know, this is clearly it.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.960
There's no, there's no ego there.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
There's just hope.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.360
You, you start, you start realizing what you

17:37.360 --> 17:41.800
believe in and praying that you'll be okay.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.000
And then trying to, trying to summon whatever

17:44.000 --> 17:45.400
you know about how to survive.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.080
And, and that's it.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.800
And so it's, it's actually, again, it's kind of,

17:48.800 --> 17:50.160
it's kind of a blissful state.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.680
If you can walk that line between like adventure

17:52.680 --> 17:55.200
and tragedy and sort of keep yourself right at

17:55.200 --> 17:57.680
that very, very fine line without going over.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.240
Ever fear of death, fear, ever fear, terror?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.160
No, I don't want to die.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.560
I want to, I want to, you know, I love the

18:06.560 --> 18:08.120
people in my life and there's a lot of things

18:08.120 --> 18:08.640
I want to do.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.920
But every time I've been, every time I've been

18:10.920 --> 18:12.600
certain that I'm going to die, it's been, I've

18:12.600 --> 18:17.360
been very, very calm, very calm and just sort of

18:17.360 --> 18:19.600
like, okay, well, if this is how the movie goes

18:19.600 --> 18:20.480
and this is how it goes.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.280
Almost accepting.

18:21.600 --> 18:21.920
Yeah.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.080
Which is, which is reassuring.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.560
You mentioned Herzog just to venture down this

18:29.560 --> 18:31.720
road of death and fear and so on.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.560
There's been a few mad men like you in this world.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.400
Uh, he's documented a couple of them.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.360
Uh, what lessons do you draw from grizzly man or

18:42.360 --> 18:44.440
into the wild, those kinds of stories?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.240
I, were you ever afraid that you would be one

18:47.240 --> 18:48.040
of those stories?

18:48.680 --> 18:49.280
Oh yeah.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.160
I actually think that that's in mother of God

18:51.160 --> 18:53.440
where I said I almost into the wild did myself.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.520
Like I went out there and really I got so lost

18:56.520 --> 18:59.120
and so destroyed that I said, this is, this is,

18:59.120 --> 19:00.320
this is going to be the next one.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.600
You know, this is going to be the next story of

19:01.600 --> 19:03.160
some idiot kid from New York who went to the

19:03.160 --> 19:06.040
Amazon thinking he was Percy Fawcett and then

19:06.040 --> 19:08.280
vanished because if you, if you do vanish out

19:08.280 --> 19:10.280
there, your body's going to be consumed in a

19:10.280 --> 19:13.800
matter of days, like, like two, you know, if we

19:13.800 --> 19:15.640
see, if we see an animal dead on the trail,

19:15.640 --> 19:18.880
it's you got dung beetles and fly larva and

19:18.880 --> 19:20.600
vultures and there's a whole pecking order.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.920
You know, you get the black vultures, the yellow

19:21.920 --> 19:23.440
vultures, the King vulture, they all come in.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.720
That thing is picked clean in a couple of days.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.240
What would be the creature that eats most of you

19:28.240 --> 19:29.000
in that situation?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
Probably the vultures.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.440
Probably the vultures and the, and the, and the

19:32.440 --> 19:35.040
maggots, it's, it's really quick.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.160
It's really, really quick.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.720
Like, like, like you, even as far as like you

19:38.720 --> 19:40.440
can't leave food out, you know, like if you have

19:40.440 --> 19:42.640
like a piece of chicken, you say, I'll eat it in

19:42.640 --> 19:43.520
the morning, you leave it out.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.200
You can't do that.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.240
It's not, it's not good by morning.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.240
Grizzly Matt, for example, like what, because

19:49.240 --> 19:50.560
that's a beautiful story.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.560
It's both comical and genius and especially the

19:54.560 --> 19:55.520
way Herzog tells it.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.840
Well, first of all, do you like the way he

19:56.840 --> 19:57.440
told the story?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.200
Do you like Herzog?

19:58.400 --> 19:58.800
I do.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.400
I love Herzog and I love his, his documentary,

20:01.400 --> 20:03.760
The Burden of Dreams, which is, which is in the

20:03.760 --> 20:05.920
Amazon, not very far from where I work.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.280
And the sheer madness that you see this man

20:09.280 --> 20:11.680
undergoing of just trying to recreate hauling a

20:11.680 --> 20:16.280
boat over a mountain is, is, is wild.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.160
And, and the, you know, the extras that he hired

20:19.160 --> 20:22.320
to be, to play the natives are, are the, I think

20:22.320 --> 20:24.560
they're Machiganga tribesmen and they're just,

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
they just look like all the guys that I hang out

20:27.320 --> 20:28.520
with and it's like, you know, they're, they're

20:28.520 --> 20:31.560
doing all this stuff in the jungle that months

20:31.560 --> 20:33.000
and months and months, and you can just see him

20:33.000 --> 20:35.240
deteriorating with madness because the jungle,

20:35.640 --> 20:37.480
you know, your boat, you know, how many times

20:37.480 --> 20:39.160
I've tied up a boat to the side of the river.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.920
This just happened like a year and a half ago.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.560
I tied up a lot through COVID.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.040
I pretty much just lived in the jungle for a

20:44.040 --> 20:46.240
while and there was nobody there and there was

20:46.240 --> 20:48.720
no support and I tied up my boat and the rain is

20:48.720 --> 20:51.560
just hammering like, like, like the universe is

20:51.560 --> 20:53.160
trying to rip the earth in half.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.520
The rain is just going and the river is rising

20:55.520 --> 20:56.400
and I tied up the boat.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.240
But then you go to sleep and you got to wake up

20:59.240 --> 21:01.440
every two hours to go check the boat and the

21:01.440 --> 21:02.960
boat is thrashing back and forth.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.920
And so all night, every two hours I'd wake up

21:05.200 --> 21:07.680
barefoot in driving rain, like, you know, golf

21:07.680 --> 21:09.480
ball raindrops and just go down and check the

21:09.480 --> 21:09.760
boat.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.600
And then by morning I was like, I fell asleep,

21:13.120 --> 21:14.320
woke up, check the boat.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.440
And then I was like, I'm just going to go

21:15.440 --> 21:16.040
make coffee.

21:16.040 --> 21:16.800
I was so done.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.320
I was so like at the end of my rope every time

21:18.320 --> 21:19.520
bailing the boat out and stuff.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.200
And then we got 15 minutes of heavy rain that

21:23.200 --> 21:24.120
filled the boat, sank it.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.840
So now I'm stuck up river with no boat.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.920
And it's like that type of thing where it's like,

21:28.920 --> 21:30.840
no matter how hard you try the jungle is just

21:30.840 --> 21:33.400
like, listen, you ain't, you're nothing.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.600
You are nothing.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.880
And so it's that constant reminder.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.200
And so Herzog really threw himself into that,

21:39.640 --> 21:40.360
in that film.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.520
And it's, it's brilliant to watch.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.520
What do you think you meant by the line that

21:44.520 --> 21:45.640
you include in your book?

21:46.040 --> 21:49.120
It's a land that God, if he exists, has

21:49.120 --> 21:50.880
created in anger.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.640
Said in German accent.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.600
Yeah, overwhelming and collective murder.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.000
So that's, that's, so you didn't really

22:03.000 --> 22:05.200
appreciate the beauty of the, of the murder.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.840
I think he appreciated it, but to him, it

22:07.840 --> 22:10.880
was very dark, you know, I think he saw the

22:10.880 --> 22:12.400
darkness in it and that's there.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.040
It sure is.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.880
As soon as you do ayahuasca, you, that door

22:14.880 --> 22:16.720
opens and you see the darkness because that

22:16.720 --> 22:18.320
brings you right into the jungle, like the,

22:18.320 --> 22:19.040
the heart of it.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.600
But I think that for him, it, it is, I think

22:23.600 --> 22:26.400
that darkness is something that he embraces

22:26.440 --> 22:27.280
and that he loves.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.760
There's another film of his, and I don't

22:28.760 --> 22:30.800
know if this is accurate, but my memory has

22:30.800 --> 22:33.280
it, that there's a penguin and I think it's

22:33.280 --> 22:35.600
in Antarctica and the penguins going in the

22:35.600 --> 22:38.240
wrong direction, away from the ocean.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.520
And I feel like he goes on this monologue

22:40.520 --> 22:42.120
about how like he's just had enough.

22:42.200 --> 22:42.440
Yeah.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.120
He's, you know, this one penguin is just

22:45.120 --> 22:46.320
marching towards, you know.

22:46.360 --> 22:46.640
Yeah.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.280
Well, he, his, cause I remember that clip

22:49.280 --> 22:53.240
from that documentary and what Werner says

22:53.240 --> 22:55.560
is that the penguin is deranged.

22:55.720 --> 22:55.960
Yes.

22:55.960 --> 22:56.960
He's lost his mind.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.200
And I took offense to that.

23:00.240 --> 23:00.720
Yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.960
Because maybe that's a brave explorer.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.320
Like how do you, how do you know there's

23:04.320 --> 23:06.240
not a lot more going on?

23:06.480 --> 23:09.720
Like it could be a love story.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.600
Those penguins get super attached.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.120
Maybe his mate was over there and he had

23:13.120 --> 23:13.720
to go find her.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.160
Like, or it's a lost mate.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.040
And he, last time he saw her was going

23:17.040 --> 23:17.880
in that direction.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.280
Exactly.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.960
So this is like the great explorer.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.640
They, we, we assume animals are like

23:22.640 --> 23:24.760
the average of the bell curve.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.400
Like every animal we interact with is

23:26.400 --> 23:27.920
just the average, but there's special ones.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.240
Just like there's special humans.

23:29.320 --> 23:29.640
Yeah.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.000
That could be a special penguin.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.400
It could have been.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.760
And I had the same thought where I was

23:33.760 --> 23:35.520
like, as like he's, I, I found it

23:35.520 --> 23:37.200
beautiful how he interpreted it.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.680
What I took away from that was I found

23:38.680 --> 23:42.480
that Werner Herzog's monologue there was,

23:42.520 --> 23:45.880
was brilliantly dark and also comedic,

23:46.800 --> 23:49.480
but, but maybe irrelevant biologically

23:49.480 --> 23:50.440
speaking towards penguins.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.200
Like, you know, um, which, which happens

23:52.200 --> 23:53.000
a lot with animals.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.720
I find like, there's so many times

23:54.720 --> 23:55.960
where I'll find people be like, do you

23:55.960 --> 23:57.800
think that animals can show compassion?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.120
And you hear like a bunch of people that

23:59.120 --> 24:01.320
have never left the pavement talking

24:01.320 --> 24:03.800
about like, wow, this, this one animal

24:03.800 --> 24:05.240
helped another and it's like, it's

24:05.240 --> 24:07.200
like, go ask Jane Goodall if animals

24:07.200 --> 24:09.480
can show compassion, go, go talk to

24:09.480 --> 24:11.880
anybody that works on a daily basis

24:11.880 --> 24:12.560
with animals.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.280
And they'll, and so like, to me, there's

24:14.280 --> 24:15.280
a, there's always a little bit of

24:15.280 --> 24:17.440
frustration and hearing people sort

24:17.440 --> 24:19.880
of like pleasantly surprised that

24:19.880 --> 24:23.320
animals aren't just, you know, these,

24:23.320 --> 24:25.240
you know, these automatons of, you

24:25.240 --> 24:27.960
know, just, just what's the word like,

24:28.320 --> 24:30.560
like programmed, you know, nothingness.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.120
First of all, what have you learned

24:32.120 --> 24:33.360
about life from Jane Goodall?

24:33.360 --> 24:35.200
Cause she spoke highly of your book

24:35.200 --> 24:37.520
and you listed as, as one of the

24:37.520 --> 24:39.640
mentors, but what, what kind of wisdom

24:39.640 --> 24:41.000
about animals do you draw from her?

24:41.960 --> 24:44.600
The wisdom from Jane is so diverse.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.320
It's, I mean, she, first of all, she's

24:46.320 --> 24:47.760
someone that, you know, the work that

24:47.760 --> 24:49.480
she did at, at the time she did, it

24:49.480 --> 24:51.720
was so incredible because I mean, she,

24:51.720 --> 24:53.400
she was out there at a very young

24:53.400 --> 24:54.960
age doing that field work.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.120
She was naming her subjects, which

24:57.120 --> 24:58.480
everyone said you shouldn't do.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
She broke every rule.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.000
She broke every rule.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.400
She was assigning and everyone said,

25:02.400 --> 25:03.720
you know, you're anthropomorphizing

25:03.720 --> 25:04.880
these animals by saying that they're

25:04.880 --> 25:05.800
doing this and that.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.960
And she, she was like, no, they're,

25:08.040 --> 25:09.080
they're, they're interacting.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.120
They're showing love, they're showing

25:10.120 --> 25:11.240
compassion, they're showing hate,

25:11.240 --> 25:12.040
they're showing fear.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.280
And, and she broke straight through

25:15.280 --> 25:16.360
all of those things.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.600
Um, and, and it paid off in dividends

25:18.600 --> 25:19.000
for her.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.360
Do you see the animals as having all

25:21.360 --> 25:25.000
those human-like emotions of anger,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.720
of compassion, of longing, of loneliness

25:29.040 --> 25:31.080
from what you've seen with, especially

25:31.080 --> 25:33.040
with mammals or different species

25:33.040 --> 25:34.320
out there, do they have all that?

25:34.720 --> 25:35.720
It depends on the animal.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.760
You know, if you're talking, you know,

25:36.760 --> 25:38.280
on the, on the scale of a cockroach

25:38.280 --> 25:39.880
to an elephant, you know, it's like a

25:39.880 --> 25:40.720
lot of these things.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.120
And I wonder about this stuff all

25:42.120 --> 25:43.520
the time, you know, I'll, I'll have

25:43.520 --> 25:44.920
a praying mantis on my hand and just

25:44.920 --> 25:46.400
go, what is going through your mind?

25:46.440 --> 25:47.680
You know, or you'll see it.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.480
You'll see a spider make a complex

25:49.480 --> 25:50.560
decision and go, I'm going to make

25:50.560 --> 25:52.640
my web there, you know, and you go,

25:52.640 --> 25:54.240
how, how, how are you, how are you

25:54.240 --> 25:54.800
doing this?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.320
How are you?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.080
Cause he, he made a calculation

25:57.080 --> 25:58.080
there, you know, it's smart.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.720
I was in the jungle not that long

25:59.720 --> 26:01.240
ago and I'm, I was walking and all

26:01.240 --> 26:02.600
of a sudden this dove comes flying

26:02.600 --> 26:04.400
through the jungle right up to my

26:04.400 --> 26:06.480
face lands on a branch, like right

26:06.480 --> 26:07.200
here, right next to me.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.520
I look at the dove, dove looks at me

26:08.840 --> 26:10.640
and she's like, Hey, and she's clearly

26:10.640 --> 26:12.160
like panting and I'm like, I'm like,

26:12.160 --> 26:13.760
why, why are you, why are you so

26:13.760 --> 26:14.880
close to this is weird?

26:15.080 --> 26:15.680
And she's like, I know.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.080
And then, and then an ornate hawk

26:18.080 --> 26:20.680
eagle flies up 10 feet away, looks

26:20.680 --> 26:22.440
at both of us and just like scowls

26:22.440 --> 26:23.880
and like sticks up its head feathers

26:23.880 --> 26:25.160
and then just like flies off.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.960
And the dove was like, sweet, thanks.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.360
And then flew in the other direction.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.520
And I was like, dude, you just used

26:29.520 --> 26:30.600
me to save your life.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.000
Yeah.

26:31.080 --> 26:31.720
The dove knew.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.960
See, this is what, because there's

26:35.960 --> 26:36.840
different, you know, there's Mike

26:36.840 --> 26:38.680
Tyson and there's Albert Einstein.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.240
Yeah.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.560
And I, sometimes I wonder when I

26:40.560 --> 26:41.800
look at different creatures, even

26:41.800 --> 26:43.600
insects, like, is this Mike Tyson

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
or is this Einstein?

26:44.640 --> 26:44.840
Yeah.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.800
Like, cause one or other kinds of

26:48.800 --> 26:49.960
personnel, like there, is this a

26:49.960 --> 26:52.680
New Yorker or is this a midwesterner

26:52.720 --> 26:54.920
or is this like a San Francisco

26:54.920 --> 26:56.640
barista of the insects?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.120
Like there's all kinds of

26:58.120 --> 26:59.400
personalities you never know.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.920
So you can't like project.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.000
Like you could, if you run into a

27:04.000 --> 27:05.480
bear and it's very angry, it could

27:05.480 --> 27:06.880
be just the asshole New Yorker.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.840
Yeah, sure.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.720
As opposed to what he's saying

27:09.720 --> 27:10.480
about New Yorkers, man.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.000
Exactly.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.240
Point well made.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.920
Uh, so speaking about communicating

27:15.920 --> 27:19.440
with a dove, um, you, uh, first met

27:19.440 --> 27:21.280
the crew in the Amazon, you talk

27:21.280 --> 27:22.880
about JJ as somebody who can

27:22.960 --> 27:24.160
communicate with animals.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.200
What do you think, uh, JJ is able

27:26.200 --> 27:29.880
to see and hear and feel that

27:29.880 --> 27:31.080
others don't, that he's able to

27:31.080 --> 27:32.240
communicate with animals?

27:32.360 --> 27:35.160
When I say this is the most

27:35.480 --> 27:37.800
skilled jungle man I've ever seen.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.280
And I know so many guys in the

27:39.280 --> 27:43.680
region, um, he has libraries of

27:43.680 --> 27:46.200
information in his cranium that

27:46.200 --> 27:47.000
we cannot fathom.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.280
It's just, it's just stunning.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.640
Like, you know, I have seen him

27:51.040 --> 27:52.520
use medicinal plants to cure

27:52.520 --> 27:54.480
things that Western doctors

27:54.480 --> 27:55.080
couldn't cure.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.760
I've seen him navigate in such

27:56.760 --> 27:58.240
a way that he's not using the

27:58.240 --> 27:58.680
stars.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.960
He's not using any, any

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
discernible, you know, it's like,

28:01.960 --> 28:03.440
it's like when elephants, sometimes

28:03.440 --> 28:04.200
like you'll watch a herd of

28:04.200 --> 28:05.120
elephants and they'll be like,

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
yo, let's go, we're going this

28:06.120 --> 28:07.160
way and you'll see them sort of

28:07.160 --> 28:08.000
communicate, but there's no

28:08.000 --> 28:08.920
audible sound.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.520
They'll just decide that they're

28:10.520 --> 28:11.600
going that when they all do it.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.840
JJ has this way in the jungle of,

28:15.320 --> 28:16.680
you know, he'll stop and he'll go

28:16.680 --> 28:18.040
wait and you go, what is it?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.880
And he goes, there's a herd of

28:20.880 --> 28:21.600
peccary coming.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.880
And I'm like, where, based on

28:24.880 --> 28:26.360
what, you know, and he's like,

28:26.360 --> 28:27.360
just wait, you'll see.

28:27.760 --> 28:28.520
And he'll sit there.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.600
Um, you think that's just

28:30.600 --> 28:31.360
experience?

28:31.480 --> 28:33.080
It's incredible experience.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.240
It's, it's, it's growing up

28:34.240 --> 28:36.280
barefoot in the Amazon and the

28:36.280 --> 28:38.000
gift is that he can speak fluent

28:38.000 --> 28:38.520
English.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.120
And so when I bring tourists and

28:41.120 --> 28:43.480
scientists or news reporters down

28:43.480 --> 28:45.400
there, he can communicate with

28:45.400 --> 28:45.680
them.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.920
He's actually good on camera

28:46.920 --> 28:48.040
because he doesn't care about

28:48.040 --> 28:48.640
cameras.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.520
Um, and like, you know, for

28:51.520 --> 28:52.760
instance, we were, we were, we

28:52.760 --> 28:53.960
were walking up a stream a few

28:53.960 --> 28:55.640
months ago and I went, Hey, look,

28:55.640 --> 28:56.400
Jaguar tracks.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.200
And he went, and I was like,

28:58.200 --> 28:59.320
what Jaguar tracks?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.280
And he's like, no, look, look

29:01.280 --> 29:01.720
harder.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.680
And I was like, the, the toes are

29:04.680 --> 29:05.680
deeper than the back.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.680
And he was like, uh-huh.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.480
And where are they?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.720
And I was like, by the water.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.120
And I was like, the Jaguar is

29:10.120 --> 29:10.520
drinking.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.880
It was leaning to drink.

29:11.880 --> 29:12.800
And he was like, that's right.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.840
He's like, now look behind you.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.760
I look behind me and there's scat.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.360
There's a big log of Jaguar shit

29:17.360 --> 29:18.320
sitting there and it's got

29:18.320 --> 29:19.440
butterflies all over it.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.360
Fresh, pretty fresh.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.400
And then there's another one

29:22.400 --> 29:23.360
that's less fresh.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.680
And so he's, he's teaching me as

29:24.680 --> 29:25.600
he does, he's going, look at

29:25.600 --> 29:26.200
this, look at this.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.480
Is that one as fresh as this one?

29:27.880 --> 29:28.400
No.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.840
And then he goes, now look up,

29:29.920 --> 29:32.080
look up, there's three vultures

29:32.080 --> 29:32.720
above us.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.360
The kill is near us.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.840
The Jaguar has been coming

29:36.840 --> 29:38.160
multiple times to the river to

29:38.160 --> 29:39.440
drink as it's feasting on

29:39.440 --> 29:40.360
whatever it killed.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.840
And he's going, it's within

29:41.840 --> 29:43.040
30 feet of us right now.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.120
And it's like, I'm like, oh,

29:45.120 --> 29:46.360
look, impressions in the sand.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.560
He's like, I just drew 19

29:47.560 --> 29:48.480
conclusions from that.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.720
It's like watching Sherlock

29:49.720 --> 29:50.520
Holmes at work.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
It's just constructing the

29:51.520 --> 29:52.160
crime scene.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.040
Incredible.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.280
Does that apply also to be able

29:56.280 --> 29:58.200
to communicate with the actual

29:58.200 --> 30:00.520
animals, like read into their

30:00.520 --> 30:03.520
body movements directly, uh,

30:03.560 --> 30:05.440
into their, whatever that dove

30:05.440 --> 30:07.000
was saying to you, you'd be able

30:07.000 --> 30:08.880
to understand, or is that all

30:08.880 --> 30:10.000
just kind of taken in the

30:10.000 --> 30:12.240
complex structure of the crime

30:12.240 --> 30:13.920
scene of the interactions of the

30:13.920 --> 30:14.760
different animals of the

30:14.760 --> 30:15.600
environment and so on?

30:15.840 --> 30:16.760
Like, what is that that you're

30:16.760 --> 30:18.120
able to communicate with another

30:18.120 --> 30:19.640
creature that he was able to

30:19.640 --> 30:20.360
communicate with another

30:20.360 --> 30:20.760
creature?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.200
He knows the intention of pose.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.440
He knows the habits.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.640
He knows the perspective.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.800
When, when, when he talks about

30:27.800 --> 30:29.520
animals, he'll talk about each

30:29.520 --> 30:31.960
species as if it's a person.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.200
So he'll say, Oh, the Jaguar, she

30:35.200 --> 30:36.800
never likes to let you see her.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.400
And so he'll come back from the

30:38.400 --> 30:39.240
jungle and he'll go, Oh, I was

30:39.240 --> 30:40.960
watching monkeys and this, I,

30:40.960 --> 30:42.280
this Jaguar was also watching

30:42.280 --> 30:43.560
the monkeys, but I was being so

30:43.560 --> 30:43.960
quiet.

30:43.960 --> 30:44.600
She didn't see me.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.800
And then when she see me, she

30:45.800 --> 30:47.680
feels so embarrassed and she go.

30:48.040 --> 30:48.960
And he'll tell you this story,

30:48.960 --> 30:49.920
like, as if he had this

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
interaction with like his

30:50.920 --> 30:53.640
neighbor and, you know, and he'll

30:53.640 --> 30:54.960
be like, Oh, the puka kunga, it

30:54.960 --> 30:56.040
never does that.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.080
You won't see it do that.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.640
And so one time, one time he

30:58.640 --> 31:00.840
caught a fish and I, I was such

31:00.840 --> 31:01.560
a big fish.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.040
It was a big, beautiful pseudo

31:03.040 --> 31:04.840
platystoma, this tiger catfish,

31:04.840 --> 31:06.920
this amazing old fish, and they're

31:06.920 --> 31:07.840
all excited to eat it.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.160
And I felt so bad watching this

31:09.160 --> 31:10.280
thing gasp on the sand.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.120
And I went, you know what?

31:11.400 --> 31:12.360
We don't need this.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.080
This is for fun.

31:13.880 --> 31:14.600
Threw it back.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.840
And then I took my hand and I

31:16.840 --> 31:19.320
went, and I made like drag marks

31:19.320 --> 31:20.760
like, so I could say, Oh, it, it

31:20.800 --> 31:21.840
snuck back in the water.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.680
And so he walks up, he looks at

31:23.680 --> 31:25.840
it and he was like, I hate you.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.200
And I went, what?

31:27.200 --> 31:29.040
No, I said, I must've, it must've

31:29.040 --> 31:30.720
just, he went, that's not what

31:30.720 --> 31:31.160
happens.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.720
He goes, it goes like this.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.400
When it go, he knew the track of

31:34.400 --> 31:34.720
a fish.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.760
And I was like, I, I was like,

31:36.760 --> 31:37.920
all right, JJ, I'm sorry.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.040
I'll catch you another fish.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.040
Uh, so stepping back to that way

31:42.040 --> 31:45.120
you opened mother of God, uh, who

31:45.120 --> 31:46.800
was Santiago Duran and what secret

31:46.800 --> 31:47.440
did he tell you?

31:47.800 --> 31:50.840
JJ's father was, uh, at some

31:50.840 --> 31:52.240
point he was a policeman.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.720
At some point when he was a

31:53.720 --> 31:56.000
teenager, he was working on the

31:56.000 --> 31:57.840
boats that before this little

31:57.880 --> 31:59.320
gold mining city of Puerto

31:59.320 --> 32:02.520
Maldonado, uh, grew, the only

32:02.520 --> 32:04.800
way to get supplies in was to

32:04.800 --> 32:06.480
take canoes up the Tambopata

32:06.480 --> 32:08.160
river up to the next state, which

32:08.160 --> 32:10.520
is Puno and, and where the mules

32:10.520 --> 32:11.680
would come down from the mountains

32:11.680 --> 32:13.120
with supplies and then he'd pilot

32:13.120 --> 32:14.120
the boats down, but they didn't

32:14.120 --> 32:15.080
have motors at that time.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.400
So he would be pulling the boat.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.080
So he was, he became this

32:18.080 --> 32:20.480
physically terrifying man.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.200
And I met him in it when he was

32:22.200 --> 32:23.400
in his eighties and he was still

32:23.400 --> 32:24.400
living out in the jungle by

32:24.400 --> 32:24.960
himself.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.280
And I mean, he's seen an Anaconda

32:27.280 --> 32:29.040
eat a taper, which is the, you

32:29.040 --> 32:30.640
know, a cow sized mammal in the

32:30.640 --> 32:31.240
Amazon.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.720
He'd seen uncontacted tribes

32:33.720 --> 32:34.520
face to face.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.760
He once killed an 11 foot electric

32:37.760 --> 32:39.880
eel, opened the back of the

32:39.880 --> 32:41.760
thing's neck, removed the nerve

32:41.760 --> 32:43.240
that he says was the source of

32:43.240 --> 32:43.880
the electric.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.960
Then he cut his forearm, placed

32:45.960 --> 32:47.440
that nerve into his forearm,

32:47.960 --> 32:50.400
wrapped it with a dead toad and

32:50.400 --> 32:51.400
claimed that it would give him

32:51.400 --> 32:52.680
strength through the rest of his

32:52.680 --> 32:54.680
life and continued to be a

32:54.680 --> 32:57.640
jungle badass until the day he

32:57.880 --> 32:59.840
quietly leaned back at a barbecue

32:59.840 --> 33:01.360
and ceased to be alive.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.640
The man was incredible, but the

33:03.640 --> 33:06.240
secret that he told us was that

33:06.240 --> 33:09.440
if you want to find big Anacondas,

33:09.840 --> 33:11.440
you know, if you want to see the

33:11.440 --> 33:13.640
Yakumama, he was like, you have

33:13.640 --> 33:15.440
to go to the bow, the place of

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
boas, the place that we came to

33:17.440 --> 33:18.760
call the floating forest.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.480
And so he sent us there and it

33:20.480 --> 33:22.280
became like this, this

33:22.280 --> 33:22.960
pilgrimage.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.240
And, you know, in the Amazon,

33:24.240 --> 33:25.960
the, a lot of the creation myths

33:25.960 --> 33:27.280
are based around the Anaconda

33:27.280 --> 33:28.640
coming down from the heavens and

33:28.640 --> 33:30.240
carving the rivers across the

33:30.240 --> 33:30.720
jungle.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.160
And if you look at the rivers, it

33:32.160 --> 33:32.800
looks like that.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.200
It looks like the path of an

33:35.200 --> 33:36.440
Anaconda crawling through the

33:36.440 --> 33:36.760
jungle.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.760
It's even the right color.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.040
And so from the reference to the

33:40.080 --> 33:42.160
tribes of women, the Amazons to

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
the Anaconda mother, everything

33:44.600 --> 33:45.880
in the Amazon is very feminine

33:45.880 --> 33:46.200
based.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.080
Even the, even the trees, the

33:48.080 --> 33:49.360
largest trees in the jungle, the

33:49.360 --> 33:50.880
mother of the forest, the Madre

33:50.880 --> 33:53.000
de la Selva is the K-Pak tree.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.800
And it's just this monster tree,

33:54.800 --> 33:56.440
these beautiful ancient trees.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.280
And that was the beginning of the

34:00.280 --> 34:03.040
transition that we made from me

34:03.120 --> 34:04.960
being like, I hate school.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.320
I want to go on adventures.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.640
You know, Jane Goodall got to do

34:07.640 --> 34:08.560
all this amazing stuff.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.960
I'm just a kid stuck here to, to

34:12.480 --> 34:14.560
eventually becoming something

34:14.560 --> 34:15.800
that had to do with where my

34:15.800 --> 34:17.160
identity became the jungle, where

34:17.160 --> 34:18.440
my life became the jungle.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.160
The, the secret that he told us

34:21.320 --> 34:23.680
opened that door because when we

34:23.680 --> 34:24.920
started working with these giant

34:24.920 --> 34:25.760
snakes, it started getting

34:25.760 --> 34:26.320
attention.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.480
It started getting people to go,

34:28.760 --> 34:30.120
what are you doing?

34:30.960 --> 34:33.160
Um, and it started, it started

34:33.520 --> 34:35.200
allowing me to have experiences

34:35.200 --> 34:37.800
that, that solidified and nailed

34:37.800 --> 34:39.120
down the fact that this wasn't

34:39.120 --> 34:40.800
just like a weekend retreat.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.960
This was, this was something that,

34:43.120 --> 34:44.480
that I was born to do.

34:44.680 --> 34:45.640
And gave you more and more

34:45.640 --> 34:47.360
motivation to go into these

34:47.400 --> 34:50.560
uncharted territory, um, of the

34:50.560 --> 34:54.720
yuck Yakko mama, which, uh, just

34:54.720 --> 34:55.440
a step back.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.080
What nations are we talking about

34:57.080 --> 34:57.280
here?

34:57.280 --> 34:58.760
Is there some, some geography?

34:59.320 --> 35:00.400
What are we talking about?

35:00.920 --> 35:01.680
Where is this?

35:01.680 --> 35:02.520
So I'm in Peru.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.560
Yeah, we're in Peru.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.040
And so which is a South American

35:05.040 --> 35:06.680
nation proves a South American

35:06.680 --> 35:07.120
nation.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.200
Brazil has 60% of the Amazon,

35:09.200 --> 35:10.480
which is unfortunate because

35:10.480 --> 35:11.640
anything that happens politically

35:11.640 --> 35:13.640
in Brazil has a massive impact

35:14.080 --> 35:15.320
impact on the Amazon.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.240
Peru has the Western Amazon and

35:19.240 --> 35:20.280
Ecuador has a little bit of the

35:20.280 --> 35:23.120
Western Amazon and the Western

35:23.120 --> 35:25.400
Amazon is where the Andes

35:25.400 --> 35:27.800
mountains, the cloud forests,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.520
which is a mega biodiverse biome

35:29.800 --> 35:31.720
falls into the Western Amazon

35:31.720 --> 35:32.520
lowlands.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.440
And so you have these, the

35:33.440 --> 35:34.960
meeting of these two incredible

35:34.960 --> 35:37.120
biomes and that's what makes this

35:37.120 --> 35:39.080
like superlative, incredible, you

35:39.080 --> 35:40.960
know, glowing moment of life on

35:40.960 --> 35:41.280
earth.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.600
So yeah, we're in Peru in the

35:43.600 --> 35:45.400
mother of the deals, which is the

35:45.400 --> 35:46.840
mother of God, which I always

35:46.840 --> 35:47.960
thought was such a beautiful,

35:48.560 --> 35:50.080
you know, the jungle is the

35:50.080 --> 35:51.440
source of all life.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.840
And so we were with the SAA people

35:54.920 --> 35:56.240
and they belong to a community

35:56.240 --> 35:57.600
that's called Infierno, which is

35:57.600 --> 35:59.560
given by the missionaries who,

35:59.560 --> 36:00.840
when they tried to go bring these

36:00.840 --> 36:02.480
people, Jesus got so many arrows

36:02.480 --> 36:03.680
shot at them that it just called

36:03.680 --> 36:04.160
it hell.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.800
Um, and so, so Santiago Duran

36:07.800 --> 36:10.160
helped unite these tribes that

36:10.160 --> 36:11.360
were, that were sort of scattered

36:11.360 --> 36:12.400
through the jungle and get them

36:12.400 --> 36:14.200
status, government recognized

36:14.200 --> 36:15.520
status as indigenous people.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.840
So he was sort of a hero.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.560
He was sort of a legend for a lot

36:18.560 --> 36:19.920
of the stuff he'd done out bare

36:19.920 --> 36:21.080
foot with just like a rifle and a

36:21.080 --> 36:22.200
machete in the jungle.

36:22.640 --> 36:27.760
He, he had 19 children and the

36:27.760 --> 36:29.200
last one, the, the, I think the

36:29.200 --> 36:32.040
20th child that he adopted was a

36:32.040 --> 36:33.720
refugee from the shining path

36:33.720 --> 36:34.840
that floated down the river.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.720
And he just took him in.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.640
And you know, this is, this is

36:36.640 --> 36:38.480
just a guy that was a, you know,

36:38.480 --> 36:39.560
everything he did, like when he

36:39.560 --> 36:41.240
died, the whole, the whole, the

36:41.240 --> 36:42.400
whole region showed up.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.360
It was, it was, he was somebody.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.600
So just the fact that I know him

36:45.600 --> 36:46.560
gives me street credit.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.920
Like the fact that I knew him, I

36:47.920 --> 36:49.320
can go like, Oh, I knew Santiago

36:49.320 --> 36:51.000
and people like, no, I'm

36:51.920 --> 36:53.280
So you have to get integrated to

36:53.280 --> 36:54.600
the culture, to the place that

36:54.600 --> 36:55.800
I mean, in every single way,

36:55.800 --> 36:57.040
which is, which is tough for you

36:57.040 --> 37:00.000
for the being from, from New York.

37:00.040 --> 37:00.280
Yeah.

37:01.000 --> 37:01.440
Yeah.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.120
Maybe it could have been tough,

37:03.120 --> 37:04.320
but it was, I took to it, you

37:04.320 --> 37:06.200
know, the jungle, they, they were

37:06.200 --> 37:07.760
very, uh, you know, JJ is teaching

37:07.760 --> 37:09.040
me about medicines and we were

37:09.040 --> 37:10.920
doing bird surveys and, you know,

37:11.040 --> 37:13.000
taking data on Macaw populations.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.960
And JJ was just like, you really

37:14.960 --> 37:16.480
want to like, he goes, you got to

37:16.480 --> 37:18.040
sleep and I was like, I only have

37:18.040 --> 37:19.040
a few weeks here and I don't know

37:19.040 --> 37:19.880
if I'm ever going to come back.

37:19.880 --> 37:20.840
I'm never going to sleep.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.520
So we'd be out every night looking

37:22.520 --> 37:23.760
for all the wildlife we could.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.760
I wanted to take photos.

37:24.760 --> 37:25.720
I wanted to see things.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.720
And, and then, you know, the, the

37:27.720 --> 37:28.880
exchange came with that.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.200
He was like, you know, I'm terrified

37:30.200 --> 37:31.320
of snakes and I said, well, I've

37:31.320 --> 37:32.240
always worked with snakes.

37:32.240 --> 37:32.960
I said, I'll teach you how to

37:32.960 --> 37:33.800
handle snakes.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.160
And then we just had this like

37:35.160 --> 37:35.840
little exchange.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.240
And when I left after my first time

37:38.240 --> 37:41.920
back in 2006, you know, I said, I

37:41.920 --> 37:43.040
said, how can I help?

37:43.880 --> 37:45.200
And, and they were like, look, you

37:45.200 --> 37:46.480
know, we're out here trying to

37:46.480 --> 37:49.520
protect this, this little island

37:49.520 --> 37:51.560
of forests that is going to be

37:51.560 --> 37:54.280
bulldozed and, and the more people

37:54.280 --> 37:55.320
that you can bring, the more

37:55.320 --> 37:56.680
knowledge and the more awareness

37:56.680 --> 37:58.400
that you can bring to this, it'll

37:58.400 --> 37:58.760
help.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.760
And so really at that age, at 18

38:00.760 --> 38:03.440
years old, I sort of started

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
dabbling with the idea of that.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.600
I could be part of helping these

38:07.600 --> 38:09.200
people to protect this place that

38:09.200 --> 38:09.720
I loved.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.720
And of course, at that time, that

38:11.720 --> 38:14.320
idea seemed like too large of a

38:14.320 --> 38:16.120
dream or too large of a, of a, of

38:16.120 --> 38:17.480
a challenge to that I could

38:17.480 --> 38:18.720
actually impact it.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.280
So what was the journey of looking

38:22.280 --> 38:25.800
for these giant snakes of looking

38:25.800 --> 38:29.160
for anacondas and what are

38:29.160 --> 38:29.960
anacondas?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.000
Anaconda is the largest snake on

38:34.000 --> 38:34.320
earth.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.840
So you have reticulated pythons

38:35.840 --> 38:36.640
in Southeast Asia.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.440
They're actually longer, but

38:38.440 --> 38:41.360
anacondas are these massive boas

38:41.400 --> 38:43.960
that give live birth and unlike a

38:43.960 --> 38:45.120
lot of other species.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.600
So an anaconda starts off, you

38:46.600 --> 38:48.000
know, a little two foot anaconda,

38:48.000 --> 38:48.920
just a little thicker than your

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
finger, a little baby.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.880
And they're food for cane toads,

38:52.880 --> 38:54.560
herons, crocodiles, you name it.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.440
They're, they're, they're pretty

38:55.440 --> 38:58.400
harmless, defenseless, but as they

38:58.400 --> 39:00.440
grow, they're eating the fish,

39:00.520 --> 39:01.800
they're eating the crocs and then

39:01.800 --> 39:02.720
they grow a little more and

39:02.720 --> 39:04.240
they're eating things like capybara

39:04.240 --> 39:05.960
and they're eating larger prey.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.840
And then at the end of their life,

39:08.000 --> 39:09.440
a female anaconda, you're talking

39:09.440 --> 39:12.920
about a 25, 30 foot, 300, 400

39:12.920 --> 39:15.200
pounds snake with a head bigger

39:15.200 --> 39:16.160
than a football.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.880
And these things, that means that

39:18.880 --> 39:20.720
they impact the entire ecosystem,

39:20.720 --> 39:22.360
which is very unique moves up the

39:22.360 --> 39:24.000
food chain to become basically

39:24.160 --> 39:26.000
an apex predator, apex predator.

39:26.040 --> 39:26.280
Yeah.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.280
The, the, the apex predator of

39:28.280 --> 39:28.760
the rivers.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.120
And so that's how interesting it's

39:30.120 --> 39:31.960
just eating your way up to your

39:31.960 --> 39:32.840
way of the food chain.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.200
If you can survive and like that,

39:34.200 --> 39:35.280
you know, they're constantly at,

39:35.280 --> 39:36.480
at war with everything else.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.960
But, you know, so I showed up in

39:38.960 --> 39:39.840
the Amazon, I was like, so where

39:39.840 --> 39:41.200
the anaconda is at and they were

39:41.200 --> 39:42.040
like, oh, no, no, no, it's not

39:42.040 --> 39:42.400
like that.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.800
They're like, it's you, you have

39:43.800 --> 39:45.200
to find these things.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.040
They're, they're subterranean.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.360
They're living in the special

39:48.360 --> 39:48.840
swamps.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.400
They're people kill them.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.160
And so we went to the floating

39:53.160 --> 39:54.960
forest after we'd come back from

39:55.720 --> 39:56.800
an expedition, we'd call it like

39:56.800 --> 39:58.560
a 12 foot anaconda and it's now

39:58.560 --> 39:59.880
it's become like this like classic

39:59.880 --> 40:01.080
photo of me and JJ with this

40:01.080 --> 40:02.360
anaconda over our shoulders.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.200
And we were like, we, you know,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.680
we 12 days out in the jungle on a

40:05.680 --> 40:07.360
hunting trip and we came back and

40:07.360 --> 40:09.480
we showed his dad and, uh,

40:09.840 --> 40:11.040
Santiago looked at us and he was

40:11.040 --> 40:12.000
like, that's the smallest

40:12.000 --> 40:13.640
anacondita I've ever seen.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.840
He's like, you guys are pathetic.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.280
And he was like, look, you

40:18.280 --> 40:19.040
go to the, go.

40:19.240 --> 40:19.880
He was like, go.

40:19.880 --> 40:20.600
He's like, I'm giving you

40:20.600 --> 40:21.040
permission.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.080
Go to the boy or go to the

40:22.080 --> 40:22.920
floating forest.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.360
And so we went to this place and

40:24.800 --> 40:26.640
we reached there at night and it

40:26.640 --> 40:28.440
was me, JJ and one of his

40:28.440 --> 40:30.480
brothers and his brother took one

40:30.480 --> 40:31.840
look at it and was like, I'm out.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.240
And he started walking back and me

40:34.240 --> 40:35.360
and JJ get to the edge of this

40:35.360 --> 40:35.600
thing.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.760
And this is our friendship.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.120
It's both this two idiots pushing

40:38.120 --> 40:39.240
each other farther and farther.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.440
And like, I like put a foot on

40:41.440 --> 40:43.720
the, on the ground and it all

40:43.720 --> 40:45.960
shook and the stars are

40:45.960 --> 40:47.640
reflecting on the ground.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.720
And what we realized is that it's

40:48.720 --> 40:52.120
a lake with floating grass on top

40:52.120 --> 40:54.680
of it and there's islands of grass

40:54.680 --> 40:56.160
floating on this lake, very life

40:56.160 --> 40:58.640
of pie and the tops of trees are

40:58.640 --> 41:00.200
coming out of the surface of the

41:00.200 --> 41:00.520
water.

41:00.520 --> 41:01.880
And so we start walking across

41:01.880 --> 41:05.000
this and JJ is going, these are

41:05.000 --> 41:06.240
big anacondas.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.880
And I'm going, JJ, that's a two

41:07.880 --> 41:10.520
foot wide, smooth path, snaking

41:10.520 --> 41:11.960
through the grass and there's no

41:11.960 --> 41:13.080
anaconda that big.

41:13.160 --> 41:13.400
Yeah.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.680
He was going, they're listening.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.920
I said, they don't have ears.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.160
He goes, they're listening.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.960
And it's like, we're, we're walking

41:19.960 --> 41:20.560
and we're walking.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.800
And then it's like, maybe it's

41:21.800 --> 41:22.480
like 1 a.m.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.080
or something.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.320
And it was just like one of those

41:26.560 --> 41:27.920
moments where we saw it at the

41:27.920 --> 41:30.520
same time and we're standing by

41:30.520 --> 41:34.360
the tail and the snake was so big

41:34.920 --> 41:36.400
that, I mean, this must've been a

41:36.400 --> 41:40.000
25 foot anaconda dead asleep with

41:40.000 --> 41:41.640
a, with a, probably a 16 foot

41:41.640 --> 41:43.880
anaconda like sprawled across her

41:44.280 --> 41:45.640
and they're laying in the starlight

41:45.640 --> 41:47.040
and we're floating on top of a

41:47.040 --> 41:48.440
lake standing there in the middle

41:48.440 --> 41:51.560
of the Amazon and JJ just, I just,

41:51.560 --> 41:52.960
I could feel the blood drain out

41:52.960 --> 41:53.720
of his face.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.960
And as like a, however old I was,

41:56.960 --> 41:58.320
you know, maybe 20 years old, I

41:58.320 --> 41:59.800
just said, if I, if we could

42:00.200 --> 42:03.760
somehow show people this, we'll be

42:03.760 --> 42:04.760
on the front cover in National

42:04.760 --> 42:06.680
Geographic and we can protect all

42:06.680 --> 42:07.640
the jungle that we want.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.800
And so I tried to catch it.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.720
So I jumped on the snake and the

42:14.720 --> 42:15.920
only measurement I have of this

42:15.920 --> 42:17.160
animal is that when I wrapped my

42:17.160 --> 42:18.280
arms around it, I couldn't touch

42:18.280 --> 42:18.880
my fingers.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.760
And so I was, you know, my, my, my

42:21.760 --> 42:23.120
feet were dragging and to her

42:23.120 --> 42:24.720
credit, this anaconda did not turn

42:24.720 --> 42:25.840
around and eat me cause her head

42:25.840 --> 42:28.160
was, you know, this way and, and

42:28.480 --> 42:29.960
she went and she reached the edge

42:29.960 --> 42:32.120
of the grass Island and she starts

42:32.120 --> 42:33.560
plunging into the dark.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.680
And so I'm watching the stars

42:35.760 --> 42:37.720
vibrate as this anaconda is going.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.920
And I had to make the choice of

42:40.440 --> 42:42.120
either going head first down into

42:42.120 --> 42:43.840
the black, which no thank you.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.560
Or stopping and just keeping my hand

42:47.560 --> 42:49.080
on this thing as it raced by me.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.400
And I just felt the scales and the

42:50.400 --> 42:52.440
muscle and the power go by.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.880
And then eventually taper down to

42:53.880 --> 42:55.440
the tail until it slipped away into

42:55.440 --> 42:56.000
the darkness.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.240
And I was laying there just panting.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.080
And then I turned around and

43:00.080 --> 43:01.200
went, JJ, what the fuck?

43:01.320 --> 43:02.400
Like, where were you, man?

43:02.880 --> 43:04.440
He was just like completely white

43:04.440 --> 43:05.240
circuits blown.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.280
And I had to go then like, kind

43:06.280 --> 43:07.120
of like take care of him.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.000
I was like, are you okay?

43:08.520 --> 43:11.520
And he was like, no, he, you know,

43:11.520 --> 43:12.160
he just couldn't.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.920
And so we came back with that.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.880
And then after that, we were like,

43:15.880 --> 43:17.720
okay, clearly, clearly the

43:17.720 --> 43:19.160
parameters of reality that we

43:19.160 --> 43:21.080
thought were possible are, are,

43:21.120 --> 43:22.600
are just a tiny fraction of what's

43:22.600 --> 43:22.960
out there.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.440
Like we, we now that, that sort

43:24.440 --> 43:25.520
of recalibrated us.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.120
We were like, okay, we're, we're

43:27.120 --> 43:28.320
rubbing up against things that are

43:28.320 --> 43:29.360
bigger than we thought were ever

43:29.360 --> 43:29.920
possible.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.160
And so we were like, okay, now we

43:31.160 --> 43:33.680
need to, we need to concentrate

43:33.680 --> 43:34.000
on this.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.400
So how dangerous is that creature

43:36.760 --> 43:39.760
to you, to, to humans, to humans?

43:39.760 --> 43:40.400
Not at all.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.120
I mean, Mike, um, one, our, our

43:43.120 --> 43:45.320
cook's, uh, father-in-law was,

43:45.320 --> 43:46.720
was eaten by an anaconda, but

43:46.720 --> 43:48.720
like, you know, then again, like

43:48.960 --> 43:50.800
the way you could say that story,

43:50.960 --> 43:51.920
sometimes it happens.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.600
It happens.

43:52.600 --> 43:53.040
I mean, come on.

43:53.040 --> 43:53.880
Every now and then somebody gets

43:53.880 --> 43:54.960
stung by a bee and dies.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.320
Like, you know, it's it once in a

43:56.320 --> 43:58.000
while it happens, but you got to

43:58.000 --> 44:00.200
have a really big anaconda really

44:00.200 --> 44:02.760
hungry and like anybody that

44:02.760 --> 44:03.560
works in the wild.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.320
I mean, just, you know, if you,

44:05.920 --> 44:07.200
you walk up to a crocodile, even

44:07.200 --> 44:08.880
a giant Nile crocodile, you walk

44:08.880 --> 44:09.800
up to the most of the time they're

44:09.800 --> 44:11.000
going to run into the water.

44:11.040 --> 44:12.040
They don't want confrontation.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.160
They hunt in their way on their

44:14.160 --> 44:15.520
terms, sneaky, you're not going

44:15.520 --> 44:15.960
to see him.

44:16.680 --> 44:17.800
And so with an anaconda, it's

44:17.800 --> 44:19.240
like, yeah, if you're, I mean, the

44:19.240 --> 44:20.480
guy who got eaten, like if you're

44:20.480 --> 44:22.440
drunk and you go to the edge of

44:22.440 --> 44:23.760
the water and you go for midnight

44:23.760 --> 44:25.960
swim by yourself in an Amazonian

44:25.960 --> 44:27.520
lake, I mean, whose fault is that?

44:28.160 --> 44:29.560
But if you jump on an anaconda

44:29.560 --> 44:32.320
and try to, uh, hold on, then

44:32.320 --> 44:33.000
you're safe.

44:33.640 --> 44:34.280
Apparently.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.800
I mean, I think I've, I think at

44:35.800 --> 44:37.480
this point we've, you know, the

44:37.480 --> 44:38.840
research we've done, I think I've

44:38.840 --> 44:40.320
handled or caught, you know, over

44:40.320 --> 44:41.720
80 anacondas in the field.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.000
And, um, not one of them has bitten

44:44.000 --> 44:44.200
me.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.520
They always choose flight over

44:46.520 --> 44:46.800
fight.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.120
They're like, just leave me alone.

44:48.120 --> 44:48.680
Let me go.

44:48.680 --> 44:49.840
I'm just going to crawl under this

44:49.840 --> 44:50.240
thing.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.160
Um, they're not an aggressive

44:53.320 --> 44:53.680
animal.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.520
I mean, no snake, no, I actually

44:55.520 --> 44:56.800
like, I kind of like the only time

44:56.800 --> 44:58.720
I get particular with like, you

44:58.720 --> 44:59.800
know, the words is like, people

44:59.800 --> 45:01.480
go, that's an aggressive black

45:01.480 --> 45:02.440
mambas are aggressive.

45:02.440 --> 45:03.360
And I go, no, no snake is

45:03.360 --> 45:03.920
aggressive.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.680
A rattlesnake is going to rattle

45:05.680 --> 45:06.760
to say, Hey, back up.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.440
Cobra is going to stand up and

45:08.440 --> 45:09.280
show you its hood.

45:09.760 --> 45:10.600
And people go, Oh, look, he's

45:10.600 --> 45:11.120
being aggressive.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.120
No, he's not being aggressive.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.680
He's going, don't step on me.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.840
Don't make me do this.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.200
They're actually being very

45:16.200 --> 45:16.720
peaceful.

45:17.840 --> 45:18.640
That's the way I look at it.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.640
Cause if there was a Cobra in the

45:19.640 --> 45:20.760
corner of this room right now, he

45:20.760 --> 45:21.920
would crawl under the curtain and

45:21.920 --> 45:22.800
we'd never see him again.

45:23.360 --> 45:23.560
Yeah.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.720
It's like a Genghis Khan before

45:25.720 --> 45:26.760
conquering the villages.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.360
He always offered for them to

45:28.360 --> 45:29.160
join the army.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.240
Doesn't need to be like this.

45:30.280 --> 45:30.400
Yeah.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.080
Join us.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.600
Nobody gets destroyed.

45:32.920 --> 45:35.080
If you want to be proud and

45:35.440 --> 45:38.240
fight for your country, then, uh,

45:38.600 --> 45:40.760
then we're going to oblige him.

45:41.480 --> 45:42.040
Exactly.

45:42.040 --> 45:42.360
Okay.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.600
So how do you, how do you catch,

45:44.640 --> 45:46.280
uh, actually let's step back

45:46.280 --> 45:49.360
because there is, in part, you

45:49.360 --> 45:50.960
are a bit of a snake whisperer.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.160
So what, what is it that, that

45:54.160 --> 45:55.800
others don't understand that you

45:55.800 --> 45:58.320
do about snakes was maybe a

45:58.320 --> 46:01.640
misconception or what, what is,

46:01.640 --> 46:02.760
uh, what have you learned from

46:02.760 --> 46:04.880
the language you speak that

46:04.880 --> 46:05.920
snakes understand?

46:06.400 --> 46:06.960
I don't know.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.520
It's just, it's an animal that

46:08.880 --> 46:10.800
has, has many times in my life,

46:10.800 --> 46:12.920
I've been responsible for helping.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.320
Um, the, you know, I started

46:15.320 --> 46:16.520
catching snakes when I was very

46:16.520 --> 46:17.800
young, I'd watch Steve Irwin and

46:17.800 --> 46:18.920
go out and catch a garter snake

46:18.920 --> 46:20.400
or a black rat snake in New York.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.560
And, um, and then I had a rule.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.640
I said, I have to catch a hundred

46:24.640 --> 46:25.760
nonvenomous snakes before I'm

46:25.760 --> 46:26.720
allowed to handle a venomous

46:26.720 --> 46:27.960
snake, if I ever need to handle

46:27.960 --> 46:28.560
a venomous snake.

46:28.560 --> 46:29.880
And then, you know, I was on a

46:29.880 --> 46:31.040
trail one time, I think in

46:31.040 --> 46:32.520
Harriman state park and some guy,

46:32.520 --> 46:34.400
you know, like some big hero, he

46:34.400 --> 46:35.120
tells us, you know, he's like

46:35.120 --> 46:37.160
back up, I'm going to get this.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.400
And he like picks up a stick and

46:38.400 --> 46:40.000
he like goes like assault this

46:40.000 --> 46:41.320
poor copperhead that's sitting on

46:41.320 --> 46:41.880
the trail.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.560
And so like at like 16 years old,

46:44.560 --> 46:45.720
I had to go and like shoulder this

46:45.720 --> 46:46.400
guy out of the way.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.520
And I like got the thing by the

46:47.520 --> 46:49.280
tail and used a stick to very

46:49.280 --> 46:51.000
gently just put it off the trail.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.800
Copperhead was not going to do

46:52.800 --> 46:54.000
anything to him, but he wanted to,

46:54.000 --> 46:55.280
you know, beat his chest and show

46:55.280 --> 46:56.360
his wife that he was tough.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.160
Um, but then in India, you know,

46:59.160 --> 47:01.200
I've lived in India for five years

47:01.200 --> 47:02.560
at this point in and out, you

47:02.720 --> 47:05.640
know, periodically and, and snakes

47:05.640 --> 47:06.720
are always getting into people's

47:06.720 --> 47:07.480
kitchens.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.640
Um, one time we had a King Cobra

47:10.200 --> 47:11.480
get into someone's kitchen, an

47:11.480 --> 47:13.600
11 foot snake, like a monster,

47:13.600 --> 47:14.840
like a God of a snake.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.040
This thing stood up, you know,

47:16.040 --> 47:16.640
it would stand up.

47:16.640 --> 47:17.560
It'd be able to look at you over

47:17.560 --> 47:20.560
the table and this terrifying

47:20.560 --> 47:23.880
monster thing, um, giant gorilla

47:23.880 --> 47:24.520
dog thing.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.680
Like we caught it with one of the

47:27.680 --> 47:29.240
local snake catchers and we brought

47:29.240 --> 47:31.840
it out and he goes, you know, I

47:31.840 --> 47:33.120
wonder why I was in the kitchen.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.360
I went, yeah, looking for food.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.680
And they go, no, they eat snakes,

47:36.720 --> 47:38.120
King Cobra, Ophiophagus hana.

47:38.120 --> 47:38.960
They eat snakes.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.360
And he goes, she's thirsty.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.360
And so we got a bottle of water

47:44.360 --> 47:45.680
and we got footage of this and we,

47:45.800 --> 47:46.600
she's standing up.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
She's going, don't make me kill

47:47.600 --> 47:47.720
you.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.520
Don't make me kill you.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.640
You're scaring me right now.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.440
I don't want to kill you.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.320
We took the bottle of water and we

47:52.320 --> 47:53.920
poured it on her nose and she

47:53.920 --> 47:55.360
started, she started drinking.

47:55.640 --> 47:56.760
You could see, you could see her

47:57.240 --> 47:58.680
just drinking and the snake just

47:58.680 --> 47:59.760
took this long drink.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.000
She drank a whole water bottle.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.280
And then said, thank you so much

48:03.840 --> 48:04.600
and crawled off.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.880
And it's like, to me, the fact

48:06.880 --> 48:08.440
that people are scared of snakes,

48:08.440 --> 48:10.320
they have symbolic hatred of

48:10.320 --> 48:11.560
snakes, you know, you, you know,

48:11.640 --> 48:13.120
someone's evil and sneaky.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.040
We call them a snake.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.200
And like, to me, it's like when I

48:16.200 --> 48:18.560
take volunteers or researchers or

48:18.560 --> 48:19.960
students out into the jungle and

48:19.960 --> 48:22.560
we find an Emerald tree boa or an

48:22.560 --> 48:24.760
Amazon tree boa or, or a vine

48:24.760 --> 48:25.120
snake.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.360
And it's like, there's this, it's

48:26.400 --> 48:27.640
one of the few animals that you

48:27.640 --> 48:29.560
can't really catch a bird and show

48:29.560 --> 48:29.960
it to people.

48:29.960 --> 48:30.920
You're going to scare the bird.

48:30.920 --> 48:31.680
Its feathers are going to come

48:31.680 --> 48:32.440
out. You might give it a heart

48:32.440 --> 48:34.760
attack. Snakes, you can lift up a

48:34.760 --> 48:35.920
snake. You know, if there's a

48:35.920 --> 48:36.760
snake in the room right now, I

48:36.760 --> 48:37.760
could lift it up and say, Lex,

48:37.760 --> 48:39.000
here, this is how you hold it.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.560
And we can interact calmly with

48:40.560 --> 48:41.600
this thing and then put it back

48:41.600 --> 48:43.080
on its branch and then it'll go.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.720
And I've seen what that does to

48:44.720 --> 48:46.840
people. I've seen how the wonder

48:46.840 --> 48:47.720
in their eyes.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.040
And so to me, snakes have always

48:49.040 --> 48:50.840
been this incredible link to

48:50.840 --> 48:52.360
teach people about wildlife,

48:52.360 --> 48:53.200
about nature.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.800
Because they have naturally a lot

48:54.800 --> 48:57.120
of fear towards this creature and

48:57.120 --> 48:59.000
to realize that the fear is not

48:59.000 --> 49:01.480
justified, is not grounded or

49:02.000 --> 49:03.480
is not as deeply grounded in

49:03.480 --> 49:04.200
reality.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.320
Of course, there's always New

49:05.320 --> 49:06.360
Yorker snakes, right?

49:06.480 --> 49:07.360
There's always going to be an

49:07.360 --> 49:08.560
asshole snake here and there.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.320
Coming for me, man.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.160
Well, OK, so back to the Anaconda.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.320
How do you catch an Anaconda?

49:16.320 --> 49:16.800
Like what?

49:17.800 --> 49:18.360
How do you handle it?

49:18.360 --> 49:20.720
Because it's such a 25 foot or

49:20.720 --> 49:23.400
even 12 foot giant snakes.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.000
How do you how do you deal with

49:26.000 --> 49:26.560
this creature?

49:26.560 --> 49:27.440
How do you interact with them?

49:27.560 --> 49:28.800
We had to learn how to do that

49:28.800 --> 49:30.120
because one of the first ones we

49:30.120 --> 49:31.280
caught that I would say maybe

49:31.280 --> 49:32.760
like a 16 footer, which is no

49:32.760 --> 49:33.800
joke of a snake, you know,

49:33.840 --> 49:35.320
girth of a basketball, let's say.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.920
You know, we're on the canoe and

49:38.960 --> 49:40.760
this is this is the early days.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.520
Like, you know, now we're at a

49:42.520 --> 49:43.480
whole different level, but this

49:43.480 --> 49:44.800
is back when we were barefoot and

49:44.800 --> 49:47.040
shirtless and just guys in the

49:47.040 --> 49:50.560
Amazon and JJ is like, you know,

49:50.560 --> 49:51.440
I just listened to him.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.640
He'd be like, get off the boat.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.520
You come from the top.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.240
We're going to come from the

49:54.240 --> 49:54.440
bottom.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.960
So OK, I just did as I was told.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.280
I came in, the snake is all

49:59.280 --> 50:00.520
curled up dead asleep.

50:00.520 --> 50:01.680
She's got some butterflies on

50:01.680 --> 50:02.960
her eyes trying to get salt and

50:02.960 --> 50:03.360
stuff.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.520
And all of a sudden I see the

50:04.520 --> 50:05.160
tongue soon.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.800
So I'm like, she's awake.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.440
And I'm like, guys, guys, guys.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.480
She's and it's like they're

50:09.560 --> 50:10.640
they're paying attention to not

50:10.640 --> 50:11.760
crashing the boat to getting

50:11.760 --> 50:12.360
over there.

50:12.680 --> 50:13.600
We're all trying to run.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.040
Snake starts going into the

50:15.040 --> 50:15.360
water.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.560
So I run ahead, grab this snake,

50:17.840 --> 50:18.720
get her by the head.

50:18.720 --> 50:19.680
So you got her by the head.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.400
You think, OK, can't she can't

50:21.400 --> 50:21.800
get me.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.640
I got it right behind the head

50:23.680 --> 50:24.760
and it's about this thick, the

50:24.760 --> 50:25.080
neck.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.400
What's that feel like side to

50:26.400 --> 50:28.200
interrupt like grabbing this

50:28.200 --> 50:30.440
thing with his giant head?

50:30.480 --> 50:31.080
It's exciting.

50:31.120 --> 50:31.760
It's amazing.

50:31.800 --> 50:32.960
It's it's scary.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.600
How hard is it to hold?

50:34.760 --> 50:35.640
It's not that hard to hold.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.920
The scary part is the moment of

50:37.960 --> 50:39.080
it's like if you ever done like

50:39.080 --> 50:40.160
a cliff dive or something, it's

50:40.160 --> 50:41.840
that moment where you go, do it,

50:42.240 --> 50:43.640
do it the time, like do it.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.320
And if your body's going, do not

50:45.320 --> 50:45.720
do that.

50:45.760 --> 50:45.960
Yeah.

50:46.040 --> 50:46.840
And then you're like, I got to

50:46.840 --> 50:48.760
do it and you do it because you

50:48.760 --> 50:50.200
can't just gently like flirt

50:50.200 --> 50:50.400
with it.

50:50.400 --> 50:50.960
You have to grab.

50:51.000 --> 50:51.480
No.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.480
And it's like it's like crossing

50:52.480 --> 50:53.400
the street when there's a bus

50:53.400 --> 50:53.680
coming.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.600
It's like you hesitate.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.480
It's more dangerous, you know.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.360
So like you just, you go for it

50:58.360 --> 50:59.280
and I got her and I was like, I

50:59.280 --> 51:01.600
got her and then a coil goes over

51:01.600 --> 51:03.200
my wrists and all of a sudden my

51:03.200 --> 51:05.640
wrists slap together and you feel

51:05.640 --> 51:06.920
this squeeze that can crush the

51:06.920 --> 51:08.120
bones out of an animal bigger

51:08.120 --> 51:08.600
than me.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.360
And the next coil comes very

51:10.360 --> 51:12.840
quickly over my neck and now I'm

51:12.840 --> 51:14.600
on my knees with my arms tied.

51:14.600 --> 51:15.560
If I wanted to let go of the

51:15.560 --> 51:16.960
snake, I couldn't and my

51:16.960 --> 51:18.080
shoulders are coming together.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.080
My collarbone is about to break

51:20.720 --> 51:22.120
and I tried to yell for JJ and

51:22.120 --> 51:23.920
all that came out was there's

51:23.920 --> 51:24.280
nothing.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.320
And so that's what they do to

51:25.320 --> 51:25.960
their prey, you know?

51:25.960 --> 51:27.520
So I attacked as far as the

51:27.520 --> 51:28.680
snake knows, I attacked.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.320
She doesn't know that I just

51:29.320 --> 51:30.160
want to measure her.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.840
You, you started out as the big

51:31.840 --> 51:33.960
spoon, but then the snake became

51:33.960 --> 51:35.560
the big spoon, very much became

51:35.560 --> 51:36.240
the big spoon.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.440
And, uh, I was, I would say I

51:38.440 --> 51:40.080
was 15 seconds away from having

51:40.080 --> 51:41.400
my entire rib cage collapsed.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.240
And then JJ showed up and grabbed

51:43.240 --> 51:44.200
the tail and just started

51:44.240 --> 51:45.320
unwrapping this thing.

51:45.320 --> 51:46.680
And then we got, but now we have

51:46.680 --> 51:47.080
a system.

51:47.080 --> 51:48.440
Now we know like, you know, I'm

51:48.440 --> 51:50.120
always, I've done, I've gotten

51:50.120 --> 51:51.880
more head catches than anybody.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.880
So I'm usually point guy and you

51:54.880 --> 51:56.640
you're the, you're the, the first,

51:56.640 --> 51:59.320
the, the point guy on the, okay.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.000
The, the, the, taking the big

52:01.000 --> 52:02.640
risky first step.

52:02.680 --> 52:02.960
Yes.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.320
Although it could be argued that

52:04.320 --> 52:06.240
there's a similarly large risk for

52:06.240 --> 52:07.480
the tail guy because the

52:07.480 --> 52:09.440
Anaconda's defense is to take a

52:09.440 --> 52:10.880
giant projectile shit.

52:11.400 --> 52:12.480
And so the person that gets the

52:12.480 --> 52:14.160
tail is going to smell like

52:14.160 --> 52:15.400
Anaconda for like at least a

52:15.400 --> 52:15.800
week.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.200
Yes.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.720
It's the least pleasant, you're

52:17.720 --> 52:19.320
taking the most dangerous one

52:19.320 --> 52:19.560
there.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.720
Um, they have the least pleasant

52:21.720 --> 52:21.920
job.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.040
This is fascinating.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.200
But what's really fascinating

52:24.200 --> 52:25.280
though, is that because of the

52:25.280 --> 52:27.280
apex predator, they're, they're

52:27.280 --> 52:28.320
eating the fish, they're eating

52:28.320 --> 52:29.080
the birds, they're eating

52:29.080 --> 52:29.560
everything.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.960
And everything in this riparian

52:30.960 --> 52:33.640
ecosystem is absorbing the

52:33.640 --> 52:34.840
mercury that's coming off the

52:34.840 --> 52:36.040
gold mining in the region.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.440
And so Anaconda's can be

52:38.160 --> 52:40.080
indicative for us of how is

52:40.080 --> 52:41.840
mercury moving through this

52:41.880 --> 52:42.720
ecosystem.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.480
And this is a region where we've

52:44.480 --> 52:45.640
lost hundreds of thousands of

52:45.640 --> 52:47.120
acres to artisanal gold mining,

52:47.120 --> 52:49.240
where they use mercury to bind

52:49.240 --> 52:49.760
the gold.

52:49.760 --> 52:50.920
They cut the forest, burn the

52:50.920 --> 52:53.400
forest, and then they run water

52:53.400 --> 52:54.760
through the sand and the sand

52:54.760 --> 52:56.440
particles have bits of gold in

52:56.440 --> 52:58.000
it, not chunks, but just little,

52:58.080 --> 52:59.600
almost microscopic flecks of

52:59.600 --> 53:00.000
gold.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.560
And then they use the mercury to

53:02.920 --> 53:04.600
bind that and then they burn off

53:04.600 --> 53:06.120
the mercury and that vapor goes

53:06.120 --> 53:07.560
up into the clouds, just like

53:07.560 --> 53:08.200
everything else.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.360
It's all connected down there

53:09.880 --> 53:10.880
and then rains down into the

53:10.880 --> 53:11.240
rivers.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.760
And so the people in the region

53:13.080 --> 53:14.440
are having birth defects from

53:14.440 --> 53:16.600
the amount of mercury that's in

53:16.600 --> 53:17.000
the water.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.680
And so we were starting at one

53:18.680 --> 53:19.920
point when we were doing most of

53:19.920 --> 53:21.640
our anaconda research, we were

53:21.640 --> 53:22.680
learning things like these

53:22.680 --> 53:24.000
animals actually aren't just

53:24.000 --> 53:25.240
ambush predators, which is what

53:25.240 --> 53:26.360
most of the literature would tell

53:26.360 --> 53:27.600
you is that anacondas are ambush

53:27.600 --> 53:27.960
predators.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.000
No, they actually go hunting.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.560
They'll go find clay licks and

53:31.560 --> 53:32.880
salt deposits and they'll wait

53:32.880 --> 53:33.200
there.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.720
They'll actually pursue animals.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.080
And we were trying to take tissue

53:37.080 --> 53:39.040
samples to find out if anacondas

53:39.040 --> 53:40.400
could be used to study how

53:40.880 --> 53:41.840
mercury is moving through the

53:41.840 --> 53:42.720
ecosystem.

53:42.960 --> 53:43.840
And so that was really, it

53:43.840 --> 53:45.960
became, can we use these animals

53:45.960 --> 53:47.600
not only as ambassadors for

53:47.600 --> 53:48.960
wildlife, because everybody wants

53:48.960 --> 53:51.600
to see the anacondas, but also,

53:52.440 --> 53:53.720
you know, what can we learn from

53:53.720 --> 53:55.400
studying this very, very little

53:55.400 --> 53:56.600
understood apex predator?

53:56.640 --> 53:57.480
And one of the things you can

53:57.480 --> 53:58.920
learn is how mercury moves

53:58.920 --> 54:00.400
through, through the ecosystem,

54:00.440 --> 54:01.800
which can damage the ecosystem

54:01.800 --> 54:03.200
in all kinds of different ways.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.480
Yeah, it's, it's brutal, man.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.640
The gold mining that's happening

54:06.640 --> 54:08.520
down there is, it's funny because

54:08.520 --> 54:09.760
we've been hearing a lot recently

54:09.760 --> 54:11.400
about like the cobalt mines in

54:11.400 --> 54:11.920
Africa.

54:12.360 --> 54:13.480
And it's like where we are in the

54:13.480 --> 54:16.760
Amazon, we were down there with

54:16.760 --> 54:19.080
ABC News, I want to say like a

54:19.080 --> 54:21.560
year and a half ago with my

54:21.560 --> 54:22.960
friend, Matt Gutman, who's the

54:23.000 --> 54:24.440
chief correspondent for ABC.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.120
And we, he wanted to see the

54:26.120 --> 54:27.000
Amazon fires.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.800
He wanted to see some wildlife.

54:28.800 --> 54:29.720
He wanted to see the areas that

54:29.720 --> 54:30.400
we're protecting.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.520
And then he goes, I want to see

54:32.360 --> 54:33.520
the gold mining areas.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.160
And, and I'd never gotten in so

54:36.160 --> 54:37.440
deep, but we, we met these

54:37.440 --> 54:37.920
rushing guys.

54:37.920 --> 54:38.960
You can't go with the proving

54:38.960 --> 54:39.600
they will kill you.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.120
Like our lawyer's father was, was

54:41.120 --> 54:42.360
assassinated for standing up to

54:42.360 --> 54:43.080
the gold miners.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.400
There was two Russian guys though,

54:45.400 --> 54:47.440
who had a legal mining concession

54:47.440 --> 54:50.240
somehow way out past the machine

54:50.240 --> 54:52.240
gun guarded limit of the pump us,

54:52.240 --> 54:53.400
which is where they do all this

54:53.400 --> 54:53.920
gold mining.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.720
And we got in there and took

54:55.720 --> 54:57.760
footage of the desert that is

54:57.760 --> 55:00.640
forming in what used to be the

55:00.640 --> 55:01.800
headwaters of the Amazon

55:01.800 --> 55:02.480
rainforest.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.720
And it's like, there is a massive

55:04.720 --> 55:06.840
global scale ecological crime

55:06.840 --> 55:08.960
happening down there that you can

55:08.960 --> 55:11.120
see from space, from this

55:11.160 --> 55:12.640
unregulated gold mining and the

55:12.640 --> 55:14.000
cops can't go there because they

55:14.000 --> 55:14.760
will be murdered.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.320
It's completely lawless.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.640
What's the machine gun limit?

55:17.760 --> 55:18.320
Exactly.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.800
It's the border of this area that

55:20.800 --> 55:22.000
they call the pump us, which is

55:22.000 --> 55:23.560
where the rainforest has been cut

55:23.600 --> 55:24.760
and completely destroyed.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.120
And it looks like Mars is just

55:26.120 --> 55:30.280
sand and inside of this area are

55:30.440 --> 55:31.280
gold miners.

55:31.360 --> 55:33.400
And we, you know, we tried to get

55:33.400 --> 55:35.360
in there to film years ago and

55:35.360 --> 55:36.400
there's just a lot of guys with

55:36.400 --> 55:37.480
machine guns who don't let that

55:37.480 --> 55:37.880
happen.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.880
And what the Russian guys had

55:40.880 --> 55:41.760
access somehow.

55:41.760 --> 55:42.640
They'd come down with a bit of

55:42.640 --> 55:44.200
money and they had a new system.

55:44.200 --> 55:44.600
Yeah.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.680
And actually what was interesting

55:46.680 --> 55:47.760
is while I was in there, they're

55:47.760 --> 55:49.640
very friendly and really, really

55:49.640 --> 55:51.480
two friendly gold miners.

55:51.960 --> 55:53.880
And they, one of them, while I

55:53.880 --> 55:55.840
was there, he, you know, he kind

55:55.840 --> 55:56.720
of tapped me on the shoulder.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
He was like, you know, look at

55:57.720 --> 55:58.480
those guys.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.880
He was like, those guys over

55:59.880 --> 56:00.120
there.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.680
He goes, I just heard them say

56:01.680 --> 56:02.240
your name.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.560
And he goes, that's not a good

56:04.560 --> 56:04.840
thing.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.320
He goes, they know exactly who

56:06.320 --> 56:06.800
you are.

56:07.240 --> 56:08.480
He goes, I wouldn't keep posting

56:08.480 --> 56:09.920
to Instagram about gold mining

56:09.920 --> 56:10.600
and the Amazon.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.200
And I was like, thanks for the

56:12.600 --> 56:13.120
warning.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.640
And then, you know, uh, in June,

56:15.640 --> 56:16.880
somebody pulled up beside me on a

56:16.880 --> 56:18.600
motorcycle and I got a more stern

56:18.600 --> 56:20.040
warrant warning, but they pay

56:20.040 --> 56:20.960
attention to the flow of

56:20.960 --> 56:21.960
information because they don't

56:21.960 --> 56:24.400
want the world to, uh, to find

56:24.400 --> 56:24.720
out.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.200
Oh, the last thing they want is

56:26.200 --> 56:27.080
to be shut down.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.400
But the gold miners are notorious

56:29.400 --> 56:32.520
for, you know, just, uh, whacking

56:32.520 --> 56:33.600
people and throwing them in a,

56:33.680 --> 56:36.160
in a pile of, you know, gold

56:36.160 --> 56:37.160
mining leftovers.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.880
It's really like, like the

56:38.880 --> 56:40.200
Peruvian government has to get

56:40.200 --> 56:41.960
the military to go after them.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.040
Like the work we've done with

56:43.040 --> 56:44.920
gold miners converting them into

56:44.920 --> 56:46.280
conservationists has all been

56:46.280 --> 56:47.320
like, I mean, I've seen the

56:47.320 --> 56:48.760
Peruvian Navy come down and

56:49.520 --> 56:51.400
literally blow up gold mining

56:51.400 --> 56:51.920
barges.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.160
And, you know, it's, it's, it's a

56:53.160 --> 56:53.520
war.

56:53.600 --> 56:54.680
It's a war being fought in the

56:54.680 --> 56:55.200
Amazon.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.160
So it's a, it's possible to

56:57.160 --> 56:57.840
convert them into

56:57.840 --> 56:58.800
conservationists.

56:59.440 --> 57:01.520
What's that process like, or is

57:01.520 --> 57:03.320
that like, uh, you say that in

57:03.320 --> 57:03.800
jest?

57:04.080 --> 57:05.640
No, I say that in absolute

57:05.640 --> 57:06.200
sincerity.

57:06.200 --> 57:08.360
We, we went up river, uh, up the

57:08.360 --> 57:09.880
Malinowski river several years

57:09.880 --> 57:11.440
ago, and I think it was 2018.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.440
And everyone, everyone was like,

57:13.440 --> 57:14.400
you are going to die.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.200
Like you will be shot and killed.

57:16.280 --> 57:19.680
And, uh, the reason we were able

57:19.680 --> 57:21.800
to do it with relative safety was

57:21.800 --> 57:23.160
that the gold miner that we were

57:23.160 --> 57:26.520
going with was the brother-in-law

57:26.560 --> 57:28.160
of one of my closest friends down

57:28.160 --> 57:30.120
there, our, our expedition chef

57:30.120 --> 57:31.040
and one of the directors of

57:31.040 --> 57:31.760
jungle keepers.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.320
And they said, look, you can go,

57:33.320 --> 57:34.560
just keep a low profile.

57:34.560 --> 57:35.320
And so I went up with a

57:35.320 --> 57:36.720
photographer and we spent a week

57:36.720 --> 57:39.360
there and dead animals everywhere,

57:39.520 --> 57:40.840
deforestation everywhere.

57:40.840 --> 57:41.920
I mean, the things that we saw

57:41.920 --> 57:44.120
were so horrible and we're living

57:44.120 --> 57:45.600
with these gold miners that are,

57:46.160 --> 57:47.200
you know, they're, they're, they're

57:47.200 --> 57:47.960
getting their gold.

57:47.960 --> 57:49.200
They're burning off the mercury.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.240
I watched the guy smoking a

57:50.240 --> 57:52.880
cigarette, burning the mercury off

57:52.880 --> 57:55.320
of his gold with the, with the

57:55.320 --> 57:57.240
vapor going straight into his face

57:57.720 --> 57:59.160
with his child right there.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.960
I mean, unbelievable negligence

58:01.960 --> 58:04.640
of just sanity, just, and then, and

58:04.640 --> 58:06.240
then towards the end of the week,

58:06.240 --> 58:08.000
the Peruvian Navy comes down the

58:08.000 --> 58:09.760
river and everyone starts scrambling.

58:09.760 --> 58:10.840
And I was like, I'm just going to

58:10.840 --> 58:11.800
sit here with my hands up.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.160
Cause you know, and they didn't even

58:14.160 --> 58:15.880
stop, they, they found the gold

58:15.880 --> 58:17.080
mining barge, you know, they have a

58:17.080 --> 58:18.680
floating thing in the river that

58:18.680 --> 58:20.040
just plums the bottom of the river,

58:20.040 --> 58:21.120
just sucks all the, all the

58:21.120 --> 58:23.200
sediments up and they stopped and

58:23.200 --> 58:25.200
they strapped a bunch of explosives

58:25.200 --> 58:28.000
to this motor and good Lord, the,

58:28.000 --> 58:29.680
the, the sound of this explosion.

58:29.680 --> 58:30.840
And there was just hot metal

58:30.840 --> 58:32.280
raining down all over the place.

58:32.280 --> 58:33.440
And then they just went a bunch of

58:33.440 --> 58:34.600
guys in fatigues and they just kind

58:34.600 --> 58:35.920
of like, looked at us like peace.

58:36.840 --> 58:37.880
And I sat there with this gold

58:37.880 --> 58:39.080
miner and I went, now what?

58:39.840 --> 58:40.920
And he went, well, now I got to

58:40.920 --> 58:41.720
go get a new motor.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.000
And I went, why don't you just do

58:44.000 --> 58:44.800
something else?

58:45.560 --> 58:47.040
And he goes, what else is there?

58:47.160 --> 58:48.360
And I went, look what we do.

58:48.360 --> 58:49.440
And I sat there with my phone and

58:49.440 --> 58:51.200
I was like, see this, these are

58:51.200 --> 58:53.200
pretty tourists and we feed them

58:53.200 --> 58:54.920
food and we show them tarantulas

58:54.920 --> 58:55.880
and macaws and things.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.400
And he looked at this and he went,

58:57.400 --> 58:57.920
wow.

58:58.760 --> 59:00.560
He goes, you because that looks

59:00.560 --> 59:01.560
like so much fun.

59:01.560 --> 59:02.720
And I went, it is so much fun.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.680
I said, we show people, we bring

59:03.680 --> 59:05.000
students to the jungle.

59:05.960 --> 59:06.840
He goes, so you're saying if I

59:06.840 --> 59:08.680
build you a lodge, you'll bring

59:08.680 --> 59:09.000
people.

59:09.000 --> 59:09.560
I said, yeah.

59:09.960 --> 59:11.320
And I came back a year later and

59:11.320 --> 59:12.800
he sat there with a, with a

59:12.800 --> 59:15.120
chainsaw, a hand saw and some

59:15.120 --> 59:17.040
nails and he cut down like 17

59:17.040 --> 59:18.320
palm trees and he built an

59:18.320 --> 59:19.360
ecotourism lodge.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.240
So you give them another channel

59:22.240 --> 59:24.160
of survival of making money.

59:24.800 --> 59:26.240
And that's what we've been doing

59:26.320 --> 59:27.400
through jungle keepers for

59:27.400 --> 59:29.080
loggers and for all kinds of

59:29.080 --> 59:30.480
extractors is just saying, look,

59:30.840 --> 59:31.520
what do you make?

59:31.560 --> 59:33.600
You make $15 a day, destroying

59:33.600 --> 59:34.960
the ancient trees of the jungle.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.560
What if we paid you $35 a day?

59:39.120 --> 59:41.840
To have a uniform and a job and

59:41.840 --> 59:43.880
health insurance and security.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.720
And you just protect it and use

59:45.720 --> 59:46.800
all of the jungle knowledge

59:46.800 --> 59:48.000
you've gained as a logger to

59:48.000 --> 59:49.120
protect this place.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.000
Who are the loggers trying to,

59:51.320 --> 59:52.920
to, uh, destroy the Amazon?

59:53.920 --> 59:55.000
Can you say a little bit more

59:55.000 --> 59:55.440
about it?

59:56.040 --> 59:58.440
Is that as a threat to the, the

59:58.440 --> 59:59.800
Amazon rainforest?

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.880
A lot of them are really close

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.400
friends of mine.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.680
They're, they're, they're people

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.520
that need to make a living and

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.040
they're jungle people who, you

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.920
know, the rainforest is a very

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.120
challenging, especially the

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.360
Amazon is a very challenging

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:13.880
environment.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.560
So you have these people who they

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.040
have a chainsaw, they have a job

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.280
opportunity, they go out and they

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:19.960
cut the trees.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.080
And a lot of these guys grew up

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.160
fishing, they grew up in the

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.440
jungle, they know how to do it.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.840
And so for them, it's a way to

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.240
like, they also love it.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.640
So this is the thing, these are

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.760
outdoorsmen, these are guys that

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.880
love the jungle.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.840
And so they, you know, in the

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.200
nineties, we had the mahogany

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.400
boom where they went out after

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.480
the mahogany and you can almost

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.880
can't find a mahogany tree in the

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.560
jungle anymore.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.600
And, and if you want to talk

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.400
about like carbon

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.360
sequestration in the rainforest,

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880
the ancient hardwoods hold like

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.760
60% of the carbon of the whole

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.240
rainforest.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.320
They have an outsized

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.880
disproportionate mass from, from

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.480
that ancient density of the

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:53.840
wood.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.960
And so these, these, these

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.160
lagers go out and they cut the

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.560
wood that's most valuable and

01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.760
then they bring it back to town

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.360
and they sell it.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.520
And then people like us buy it

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.440
and put it on our kitchen

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:02.920
floors.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.120
And, you know, and so the

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.200
thing is, is I, you know, when I

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.400
got to the Amazon, it was, you

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.800
know, loggers are the bad guys.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.080
And if you talk to, you know, a

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.240
lot of like the PhDs that I

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.280
worked with down there were, you

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.520
know, always very at odds with

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.920
the miners at odds with the, with

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.560
the loggers.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.920
And then I'd be with JJ and JJ

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.120
would sit down and he'd be like,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.040
Hey, let's pour a drink.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.000
Oh, they have Masato.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.760
Let's all sit down.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.640
And like, we'd all be chilling

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.080
and throwing them back with a

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.200
bunch of loggers and, and then

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.400
those, the opportunity through,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.760
through not vilifying these

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.400
people came to be like, Oh, these

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.360
are, these are, these guys are

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.560
great, you know?

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.360
And then of course out in the

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.200
wild, every now and then

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.760
something will happen.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.240
You'll see somebody's boat flipped

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.520
over and you go, you go help them

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:45.720
out.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.760
And then that, that creates a

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.840
certain type of kinship.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.520
So they're ultimately people who

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.600
love, who love the same thing you

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.800
love often.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.080
Yeah.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.080
Even if they don't love it,

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.600
they're people that aren't

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.200
necessarily looking to destroy

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:58.400
it.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.960
I've met loggers who have looked

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
at, at trees, they're about to

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.080
cut and gone, ah, this is a

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.600
shame.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.120
Started up, you know, they're

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.040
just like, this is where the

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040
paycheck comes from.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.400
Let's come back briefly to

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.200
Anacondas.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.240
Can you tell me, uh, this whole

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.520
situation with discovery is

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.280
eaten alive.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.200
There's some drama and

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.480
controversy around that.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.000
Can you explain that whole saga

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.800
with discovery, with, um, with

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.960
your whole effort, maybe outside

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.680
of even the drama, the, the

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.240
initial thing, which I now feel

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.720
you're sufficiently insane to

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.040
actually do a being eaten by

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:37.560
Anaconda.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.640
Is that actually possible to

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.640
survive something like that?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.000
I mean, if Anaconda swallows you

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.040
while you're wearing the suit

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.720
that they made, maybe, but that

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.000
was in hindsight, that was the

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.880
result of, look, I go to the

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.760
jungle and you start seeing these

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.120
beautiful places, these incredible

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.600
species.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.400
You start developing a

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.800
relationship with these animals

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.520
and then you watch it get

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.080
destroyed every year.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.320
We watch it burn every year.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.000
Places that are, are crucial to

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.960
my soul.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.440
I have seen leveled and turned to

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.680
ash and at some point we started

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.920
going, someone has to do

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.160
something about this and you

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.120
look to your right and you look

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.520
to your left and there is no one

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.360
because it's the middle of the

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.000
Amazon and the rainforests have

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.360
been being destroyed since the

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:27.880
seventies.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.800
It's a cliche.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.560
And so we started trying to do

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.640
something about it.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.720
And so I started putting a little

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.400
bit more emphasis on, on

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.560
publicity, a little bit more

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.920
emphasis on getting the message

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.240
out there.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.480
And so I started trying to see

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.520
how, what was going to work.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.880
You know, you just start firing

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.080
shots in the dark and seeing,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.000
and you know, JJ is going, you

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.280
have to help us do something.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.520
And I'm going, okay.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.600
You know, and so from 18 years

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.280
old now, now I'm 23 years old.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.000
And all of a sudden this place

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.400
isn't, isn't foreign to me

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:57.760
anymore.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.640
It's, it's home.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.240
And, and so when you're trying

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.360
to think of all the different

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.600
ways you can bring attention to

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.840
this place that you care about

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.720
that's being destroyed.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.120
Yeah.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.840
You're standing next to a boulder

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.480
of progress of, of destruction

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.640
and it's about to roll onto the

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.200
forest and just destroy it and

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.360
snuff out all that life.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.960
And no one's there to do

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.720
anything about it.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.160
And so you go, is there any way

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.800
that I could put myself in front

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.000
of this boulder and hold it back?

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.080
And you're talking about, you

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.480
know, the, the globe, the global

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.640
economic reality, it's just, it's

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.800
just such a massive, it's

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.520
systemic.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.280
So what's the most dramatic

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.400
possible thing I could do?

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:36.880
Exactly.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.840
So when you find yourself flown

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.880
to LA as a 23 year old dude, and

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.040
you're sitting there with some

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.600
guy, you know, who's like spinning

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.920
a pen and got his feet up on the

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.680
desk and going, you know, what

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.720
can you show us down there?

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
And you go, I could show you the

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.920
biggest Anacondas in the world.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.120
And we could talk about Mercury

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.520
and bioaccumulation, and we could

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.760
show people how these animals are

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.840
misunderstood and we go on a big

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.960
expedition and we could be the

01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.760
coolest show ever.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.320
And he goes, yeah, not good enough.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.760
Okay.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.960
And so those that, that, that, that

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.320
cycled through a bunch of times.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.360
Then someone at some point in one

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.120
of those meetings said, you know,

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.560
what if we show people that

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.200
Anacondas really can't eat humans?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.640
And I went, how is that a good show?

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.760
You want me to feed someone to an

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.160
Anaconda?

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.000
And I said, I said, I mean, I kind

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.600
of joked like, what if, you know,

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.440
I was like, the only way that's

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.880
feasible is if you like, make a suit

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.840
with a breathing apparatus and let

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.280
the snake eat you and then come back

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.440
out safely and make sure you don't

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.080
hurt the snake.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080
And they were like, kid, you're on.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.720
And I was like, oh shit.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.680
So I should mention as a small

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.280
tangent, I think I mentioned to you

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.920
offline, uh, due to travel troubles

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.160
where I traveled to the totally

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.560
wrong part of the United States.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.280
Um, on my way to Boston, uh, and

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.040
on my way to Boston, I did a

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.720
conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.560
And I've gotten a chance to hang

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.800
out with him for the day.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.840
And one of the things we did is have

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.360
a lengthy brainstorm session with

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.600
his team or I was, I was observing

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.720
it, but it was interesting because

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.120
he's probably way better at that

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.360
conversation that you had with a,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.720
with a guy in LA and the guy in LA,

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.200
obviously because he's made, he's

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.160
revolutionizing entertainment and

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.880
he's also doing philanthropy, which

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.760
he's trying to figure out how to help

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.040
the world with that kind of stuff.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.480
So I would love to actually, I'll

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.080
send him a message to see what, what

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.720
his thoughts just brainstorm.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.320
He's so strong at this.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:31.560
Yeah.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.080
Literally taking the situation you're

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.200
facing here's the place that I really

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.600
care about is being burned down.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.400
It's being destroyed.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.680
Um, what's the sexy video?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.280
Yeah.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.680
Well, how do you get, how do you

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.280
get people to watch something that's,

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.280
you know, we all change the channel

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.880
when they show us the kids in Africa

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.120
with the swollen stomachs, nobody

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:50.840
wants to see it.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.960
And it's like, with the rainforest,

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
like we know, we know, we know.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.640
And I'm going, I could give data all day

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.480
long, I could show photos of burning

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.040
forest.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.960
And so I was looking for what would do

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.040
it.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.160
And so the eating alive thing without

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.640
spending too much time on a, on a

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.440
massive misstep was I agreed to do it.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.880
They paid me at the time, more money

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.680
than I had made before, which I very

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.040
much needed because nobody pays you

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.160
to be a conservationist.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.280
Um, so I was a very poor 23 year old.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.440
It was like, yes, I would love that.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:20.840
Please.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.040
And I thought, you know what, this is

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.320
the start of a TV career.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.960
Yeah.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.640
Um, we got, we got shafted so bad.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.760
I mean, they used, somehow they

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.720
changed our voices.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.000
They changed the things we said.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.760
They changed the message of the film.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.760
There was one point where we had caught

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.600
a 19 foot snake and I was holding her

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.880
head and I said, this is such a

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.040
beautiful animal, the queen of the

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.000
Amazon.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.440
This is such a great moment for me.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.400
I kissed her on the head.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.760
I said, she's made so many babies.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.720
Look at the scars.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.800
I was talking about just the poetry

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.160
of this incredible dragon.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.000
And then the producer goes, yeah, yeah,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.560
that's great.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.640
Listen, if that was to bite you,

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.280
what would happen?

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.240
And I was like, oh, well, if it

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.600
bit you, you know, you'd bleed out

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.960
because it would lacerate down to the.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.800
That's what they put in the film.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.680
And so they have, they, they didn't

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.880
show me the film until the night

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.640
before I went on Matt Lauer's show.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.000
And I said, I am not endorsing this film.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.400
And they had called it expedition

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.040
on the call sheet.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.800
They'd called it expedition EA

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.920
expedition Amazon.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.160
All of a sudden they changed it to

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:19.720
eaten alive.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.400
And I went, wait, guys, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.440
I said, you're going to make people

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.400
think that it actually happened,

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.520
not that we're attempting it.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.680
And they, and I said, I'm not.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.960
And then they called me and they said,

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.640
you better you're going on live TV

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:29.960
tomorrow.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.400
They said, you let us know what level

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.680
of control we need to show for you.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:32.840
Right.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.280
It was very threatening phone call.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.440
And so I had to go out and smile

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.320
for the cameras and endorse

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.920
something that was a train wreck.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.200
And the scientific community was like,

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.480
you're an idiot.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.760
We don't want to ever see you again

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.600
I lost a lot of opportunities.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.040
PETA came, which, you know, PETA,

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.320
whatever, but PETA came out.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.680
People were like, you were trying

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.200
to hurt a snake, which I would never do.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.360
And then the American public was like,

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.400
you know, you said you were going

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.080
to get eaten by a snake and you didn't.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.440
And so everyone was pissed.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.720
I basically had to exile myself

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.320
to India for like six months and just,

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.000
I mean, I had death threats coming

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:05.800
through all my messages.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.240
People were furious with me.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.560
What gave you strength to that?

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.520
How difficult was that psychologically?

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.920
Just everything you care about

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.600
being completely kind of flipped

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.160
upside down.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.440
I've spent so much time on the ground

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.880
with the local people learning

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.760
from the wildlife.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.480
It's such a devout and important thing to me.

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.200
And it got turned into a sideshow.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.800
It got turned into a joke and then

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.680
not just a joke.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.960
It got turned into that.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.920
I'm somehow bad to animals.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.920
You know, I'm, I'm irresponsible

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.880
scientifically.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.200
Jimmy Kimmel told me to have sex

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.800
with a hippo as my next stunt.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.760
Like it was like, it got really ugly

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.600
and it misfired so bad.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.840
And when you hear these like motivational

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.760
speakers talk about, you know, you just

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.560
got to keep trying.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.920
And sometimes you're going to fail hard.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.960
It was like that one.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.800
I got hit in the head with a baseball bat.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.760
That one was tough.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.720
And at the time I was like, I'm fine.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.840
And I was like, I'm going to go away

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.280
for a while, you know?

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.600
And I learned a lot though.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.920
Like at this point, I'm still glad I did it

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.920
because man, did I learn a lot about

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.680
what a room full of people that you

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.040
don't know who could look you in the eye

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.880
and shake your hand and say, trust us.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:17.800
Ooh boy.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.080
Do you have on a human level of resentment

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.200
towards discovery, towards the people

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.840
involved, be able to forgive them?

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.400
I don't care.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.520
It literally, that's what they do.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.200
You know, they literally put out a documentary

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.400
saying that mermaids were real.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:34.680
You know, it's funny.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.160
Wait a minute.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:35.640
Wait a minute.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.040
They're not.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.400
Listen, I said that I'm not even touching

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:41.640
that one.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.120
It is true.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.760
There is a documentary where they duped

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.840
a bunch of scientists who are like oceanographers

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.440
and they like showed them ancient footage

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.400
of mariners saying that seals were mermaids.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:53.880
Who cares?

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.760
I was young, I got brought to Hollywood

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.440
and I got spit out the other side.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.560
And that's on me.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.440
That's not their fault.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.680
There's that parable about the frog

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.240
who gives the scorpion a ride across the water.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.520
And then at the end he says, I'll give you

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:10.920
a ride.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.640
Just don't sting me.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.520
And they get to the other side

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.480
and the scorpion stings them.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.840
And the frog goes, why did you do that?

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.280
And the scorpion goes, I'm a scorpion.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.240
It's not their fault.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.680
That's my nature.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.840
But now that you've become much more well-known

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.440
and much more successful, what you do,

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.880
you have a platform.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.080
Can you return to those people and use it,

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.720
the machine, to get more and more attention?

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.840
Is that something you work on?

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.640
Or do you prefer to work completely outside?

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.120
I think that most of the success that we've had now

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.360
in protecting the rainforest

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.200
and the levels that we've reached are so far.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.720
I think back to those barefoot days

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.360
of catching snakes with JJ on the boat

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.560
and now the massive ecological reserve we have

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.800
and the team of rangers and the converted loggers.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.640
And all of that is because of the ability

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640
to communicate and to show people.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.560
But that's all been through social media.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.120
And so I'm open to the fact,

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.120
if somebody came and gave a sort of like Bourdainian pass

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.560
where they said, look, you can be yourself,

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.640
you can swear, you can fart, you can smoke,

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.160
you can do whatever you wanna do.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.720
Go out there and show us the real thing.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.920
I would love to.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.640
But now I know how those contracts need to be.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.160
I need to have right to refusal

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.600
and they can't change them.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.440
And so I'd almost rather just do it

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.080
like the way I think like Mr. Beast does stuff

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.760
where it's like you get a crew of guys

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.000
and some seed money and go film the episodes

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.040
and put it out.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.560
I mean, a committee never helped real art be better.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.280
It has to come from the source of inspiration.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.920
So I think you get JJ and a crew of people

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.760
or the guys in Africa that I'm working with right now

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.360
doing elephant conservation and like,

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.280
but you gotta show real.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.440
I mean, look, that's why Joe Rogan is important right now.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.720
That's why you're important right now

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.800
is because it's not being filtered through

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.080
this ridiculous system of polishing it and dumbing it down.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.160
Yeah, that's why Joe has been an inspiration.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.360
You don't need a crew of a bunch of people.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.480
You don't need a crew period.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.160
All you need is one or two other people and that's it.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.760
And in my case, you don't need anybody.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.520
I've been doing this by requirement.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.880
I just need to be by myself.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.880
There's a few other folks now that help

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.400
with the editing and so on,

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.640
but it's just they make life more awesome

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.400
as opposed to a boss that's a creative director.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.880
Somebody told me, actually, I was visiting LA.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.160
I think it was in LA.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.520
They were saying that now for all intimate scenes

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.920
in Hollywood movies, there's an intimacy director.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.560
So when there's two people having sex,

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.520
there's a third person that ensures that on film,

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.600
so it's not real, but there's still intimacy.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.480
There's a third person that ensures that like,

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.520
everyone is comfortable and the actors say

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.600
that this like always ruins the chemistry of the scene.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:04.920
Yeah.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.200
And so it's a very Hollywood thing.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.720
I understand there's creepy people and so on.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.520
Yeah, I understand.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:11.880
Thanks, Harvey Weinstein.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.400
It's usually, I think, comes from the director

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.440
pushing things too hard.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.640
If you just leave it to the actors,

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.680
they know their boundaries.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.960
They can control their own boundaries.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.440
So the intimacy director is more for like

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.960
the director pushing things.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.720
You know, there's Warner Herzog.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.280
I understand the logic.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.280
Let's make sure that we don't have anything happen here

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.000
that shouldn't be happening.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.120
I get it, but yeah.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.240
But no, I think that authenticity is the greatest currency.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.280
And I think that in order for me to tell the stories

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.360
that I can tell, like what changed the game for me was,

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.440
I want to tell you this story.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:53.640
So in 2019, the Amazon fire started popping off

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:58.040
and we had just gone to film like a month earlier,

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.640
we'd filmed like a small documentary

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.120
and they'd been following me as if I was on a solo,

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.320
which we did the best we could.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.680
I lived on my own, but as we were driving,

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.800
we passed a spot where the flames were 70 feet tall.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.320
The forest was being destroyed.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.840
And I went out there with my phone,

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.720
which overheated in like two minutes and said,

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.360
you can't use it.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.160
But for a second, I was out there in the flames

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.000
picking up animals and throwing them off

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.520
to try and just get them cooled off.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.880
I was trying to get snakes out of there.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.560
Everything was the birds are flying and I fucking lost it.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.760
I was red-eyed.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.280
I was crying and I was going,

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.200
this is happening every fucking day.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.880
I was screaming and it's the first time

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.960
that I'd done that because I've seen the burning

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
so many times and I just lost it that day.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.520
And I don't know what made me pull out my phone

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.960
because usually in those intense moments,

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.880
I say, forget the documentation.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.600
This is real life.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.720
We got stuff to do and I'm doing, I'm not documenting.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.200
And then a month later, I'm home and I'm in New York

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.680
and all of a sudden I see these articles like,

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.240
the Amazon's burning worse this year than it was last year

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.120
and blah, blah, blah.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.800
And I was like, this fucking...

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.520
And I threw it up on Instagram like eight o'clock at night.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.160
And I'd never cursed on Instagram.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.240
I don't know why, I just never did.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.280
And my phone was on 100% and I put it on top

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.720
of the refrigerator and I went to bed.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.480
I woke up in the morning and my phone was on the floor on 2%

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.680
and it was ringing off the hook.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.640
And it was like the news and they're like,

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.560
are you the guy that posted that viral video

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.280
about the Amazon?

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.000
And I was like, what?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.640
And that was the start.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.920
That's where it broke.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.040
And that's where we went from barefoot in the Amazon

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.040
to all of a sudden, I was a talking head for three weeks

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040
and going around on all these news stations

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.720
and all of a sudden I was like the spokesperson

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.880
for the Amazon and JJ's calling me and he was like,

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.080
go, go, go, go, go, get us that support.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:52.200
And it was just, so communicating with people

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.800
and bringing them into that reality

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.520
and whether it's rhino poaching and elephant poaching

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.760
or the Amazon being destroyed, it's like to me,

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.960
it's like being able to take people into that

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.360
is something that I would love to do.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.880
Yeah, and you do it directly with authenticity

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.520
on your Instagram.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.200
People should definitely follow your Instagram.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.920
I think Rogan follows your Instagram too.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.400
Well, the end of that story actually kind of involves him

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.320
because yeah, because I went to all these news outlets

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.480
and I was living in green rooms and traveling around

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.400
and I was all strung out and I hadn't seen anybody

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.920
I actually know in a few weeks,

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.200
which was starting to get to me.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.640
And I finally got home and I went to like a family party

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.480
and everyone was like, dude, you've been, it's been crazy.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.200
And I was like, yup.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.360
And then I left and my cousin Michael calls me

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.600
and he's screaming and I'm going, what, what, what, what?

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.600
And he goes, Joe Rogan just shared it.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.640
Joe Rogan, you shared it.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.200
Oh, nice.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.480
And everyone was losing their shit

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.440
and it was so amazing.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.200
And it was like, that's when it really took off.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.440
And what happened as a result of all of this

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.200
is that a Canadian entrepreneur who started Lightspeed

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.400
reached out and several months later after COVID,

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.280
after that boom, I'd been in the game

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.360
for maybe 13 years or something.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.840
I had no money, no savings, no job, no nothing.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.960
And after that great publicity thing, nothing happened.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.920
The waves came and everything got real exciting.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.840
Everybody reached out and they said, we care so much.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.880
Nothing happened though.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.960
We can run into battle, but if we don't have our arrows

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.880
in the quiver, what can we do?

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.320
And I actually, I made a phone call to my friend Mohsen

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.280
right at the start of COVID.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.840
And I was going through a divorce and I was broke.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.840
And I said, I'm going to get a job.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:34.840
I said, I give up.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.600
So this is stupid.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.200
I said, the ecotourism business is done.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.480
Jungle keepers has dried up.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.080
We're done.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.800
And then this guy, Dax De Silva called me on the phone

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.800
and said, listen, I'm in, what do we got to do?

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.680
And so if the analogy was me and JJ

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.840
and a few other people trying to hold this boulder back

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.280
from just destroying the rainforest,

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.440
all of a sudden Dax comes in like a Titan

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.680
and just puts his arm out and just goes, I'm going to help.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.040
And he gave us the funding to start actually developing

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.680
a ranger program, to start actually bringing loggers

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.520
to be protectors of the forest,

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.680
to be supporting smaller conservation things.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.960
And now we're protecting 50,000 acres of rainforest.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.400
We're protecting entire streams and ecosystems that I love

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.920
and we're soon going to double that.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.440
And it's like this whole thing.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.440
So yeah, the communication of these things is crucial

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.880
and I actually think it's incredible

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.680
that social media has played such a big role in it.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.920
Well, I mean, just because I know Joe well

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.080
and I love him so much, I definitely think

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.240
you should do his podcast,

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.760
but also just be friends with him.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.560
I think you guys, he's one, not to meme,

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.480
but he's one with nature.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.920
And I'm much more with the, I'm one,

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.800
while I do appreciate and love nature,

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.760
I also love technology and robots and so on.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.120
So we're in that meme type of way,

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.720
we're very, very different, but-

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.200
Well, either way, at some point,

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.480
make sure you tell the guy thank you

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.800
because it definitely really helped push us over

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.320
that limit where if enough people see it,

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.880
you get someone like Dax who says,

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.040
I can help and I have the resources to help.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.360
And that changed our whole lives.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.080
It changed everything.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.440
Back to the jungle,

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.880
you had a bunch of interactions with jaguars.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.920
How are you still alive?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.160
Man, dude, jags aren't the, jags,

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.560
I'll tell you this, jags are not the danger,

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.000
the falling trees are the danger.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.400
I'll tell you some elephant stories

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.400
and then you'll wonder why I'm still alive.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.600
But jags, I've, so JJ started and Santiago,

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.080
his dad started challenging me to do solos,

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.720
go out alone into the wild style.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.600
I'd have a hammock, a headlamp,

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.080
three days worth of food, some fish hooks,

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.240
a machete, that's it.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.680
And so like one of the stories that happened early on

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.080
was I was out there and it was raining and I was lost.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.840
And this is how we test your jungle knowledge.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.880
Can you survive out there?

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.000
Do you know how to find food?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.920
Have you listened to the things that we taught you?

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.440
And there was one night that I was in a hammock

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.440
and a jaguar came up and I was asleep when it happened

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.040
and she came up right next to my head

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.640
and she was, and I could hear her smelling me.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.800
And then my first instinct was to turn on my headlamp

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.800
and just the sound of my arm moving against the material.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.960
And she just, like she just right here,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.800
I could feel her breath and I just laid there in the dark.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.880
And that's one of those moments where you go,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.800
you really learn a lot about yourself

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.760
because I wasn't scared.

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.200
I felt like I understood the intentions of the cat.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.920
If she was hunting, I'd already be dead.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.880
She was curious and I was lost and I didn't know

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.400
if I was ever going to get out of that jungle.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.680
But what she did was energize me

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.800
because it was an experience like the giant anaconda

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.440
where I said, this is so wild

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.560
that it's so almost cinematically outside the realm

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.640
of what I thought my life could be like,

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.560
that it made me like, wait,

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.560
because the previous day I was lost, tired, confused,

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.640
kind of devastated, tail between my legs.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.560
After that, I was like, man,

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.440
you've been waiting for this your whole life, go get it.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.680
And I like woke up and I was like, I am going to navigate.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.200
Even though I've been in this swamp for three days,

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.720
I'm going to find my way out of this swamp.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.200
And like, she just like breathed fire into me

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.920
where it was like, it was like, if that's possible,

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.320
if I could be six inches away from a jaguar's face,

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.200
then I got that energy from her.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.400
So that you're able to start to really hear

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.840
and feel the jungle around you.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.160
Yeah.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.080
That was a sign.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.120
Do you know what you're doing?

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.160
It really felt like a sign.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.800
I really did.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.560
How do you survive in a solo hike through the jungle?

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.400
What are the different components?

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.760
What are the different dangers?

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.840
So you said you had a hammock, you had some food.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.720
What kind of food, by the way, are we talking about?

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.920
Nuts, stuff that won't go bad because you can't,

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.400
so you can't really start a fire in the Amazon.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.440
Like I'm a good, I mean, I camp all over the place.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.400
I'm a wilderness guide.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.600
Starting a fire in the Amazon is futile.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.360
In fact, a lot of survival manuals will tell you,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.040
don't do it because if you're really lost,

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.000
it'll break your spirit.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.000
You're not going to be able to do it.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.800
That's dark.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.120
Yeah.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.320
They're like, don't even try it.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.640
But you can still get like hypothermia from if you get wet

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.040
and you lay out in the jungle, you could still,

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.240
exposure can still get you.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.200
So you want fire.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880
In the beginning, I used to bring like ramen noodles,

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.160
which is nutritionally is irrelevant.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.920
And so I started bringing like nuts

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.520
and then supplementing that with fish,

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.600
which forced me to become a very good fisherman.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.640
Now, of course, JJ knows that he can like,

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.800
they can cut certain roots and they bash it up

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.680
and they put it in the stream and the fish just float

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.120
to the top and they take with it.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.120
So like, he's got like, he's got all the cheat codes.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.280
Whereas like, I'm sitting there with a hook

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.240
and then he's like, he'll go now find bait.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.080
And I go bait in the most competitive ecosystem on earth.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.520
Good luck finding a worm.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.400
You can't do it.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.000
What does JJ do?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.480
He takes the machete, looks at his foot,

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.880
cuts a slug of callus off of his heel

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.960
because he's got this thick rhino skin.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:21.240
Puts that on the hook, catches a six inch fish,

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.840
chops it in half, puts it on a bigger hook.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.000
And in 15 minutes, he's got a four foot giant catfish

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.720
that could feed a family of 16 and he's happy.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.240
I'm sitting there and I'm like,

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.200
I'm gonna try to like stick a beetle on a fishing hook.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.480
Do you have just a line and a hook or is there a rod too?

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.360
Just a line and a hook.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.120
And then you just chop a rod and tie it to the,

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.640
you just chop a little sapling.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.040
So are you still able to start a fire or no?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.800
I like for the food that I bring to not be fire dependent.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.320
And so if I have some nuts, I can shove in a few,

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.920
enough calories to get me through the night

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.000
or like, and leave a fishing line out

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.440
and there'll be something there in the morning.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.760
But yes, I can start a fire, but a lot of times

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.120
what I'll do is I'll bring a flask

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.040
and not with like alcohol, but with diesel.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.000
And so you have a tuna can and you put the diesel

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.680
and this is what the local guys do.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.760
Everything I do, I'm sure there's gonna be someone

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.560
listening to this and they're like,

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.440
how could you do that?

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.840
And it's like, this is what we do down there, sorry.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.120
It's a tuna can, you pour a little bit of diesel in it,

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.200
it burns slow, you light it and you put your sticks,

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.320
you make your pyramid over that

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.240
and eventually that will burn through the moisture.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.280
And finally you'll get a very reluctant little fire

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.760
enough to make yourself like a cup of tea

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.040
or to pour that into the noodles, something, something.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.160
Or you just eat a fish raw.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.320
How important is it to stay dry?

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.280
Is it basically impossible?

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.320
It's impossible to stay dry.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.680
You're wet all the time.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.960
You're wet all the time.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.680
What does that mean?

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.920
That means infections are more efficient?

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.640
Yeah, I don't know if you saw the picture in my book

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.520
where I have the-

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.400
The yellow spots?

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:53.900
Yeah.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.720
So yeah, there's a picture with your entire face

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.800
consumed with yellow spots is basically,

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.840
I guess that's MRSA.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.340
Yep.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:04.920
Oh boy.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.160
So how did that happen?

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.800
What was the infection like?

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.640
Yeah, and how crazy are you for letting that infection

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.960
stay in you for a prolonged period of time

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960
without treating it or you had no choice?

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.240
No, I did have a choice.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.920
I was 19 years old and I was taking care

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.760
of a giant anteater that was orphaned.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.560
And this is like my dream animal and she was mine.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.480
And my job was to teach her the jungle.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.000
And so when I started noticing that I had an infection

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.320
and that I had, I think I had dengue at the time too,

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.080
I went back to town,

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.760
probably picked up MRSA in the hospital where I got tested,

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.240
came back into the jungle

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.320
and then got progressively sicker and sicker

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.320
weaker and weaker as I was two weeks,

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.280
three weeks in the jungle.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.240
And it got to the point where my vision went black and white

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.000
and I passed out one day and I don't know why,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.400
but at the time I had shaved that day.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.360
And when I woke up the next morning,

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.880
I couldn't open my eyes because the pus had come out of my eyes

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.120
and out of the pores in my face,

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.680
all those little micro cuts and the pillow was stuck to my face.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.360
And I was stuck up river with no help at 19 years old.

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.280
And also when you see that picture,

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.520
you can imagine that I assumed that my life was over

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.880
because I didn't know what it was.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.240
And I also didn't assume that,

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.120
or at the very least,

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.880
I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of my life.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.640
I didn't think there was any getting better from that.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.520
And so I remember sitting by the side of the river

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.880
praying that a boat would come by,

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.080
but it was the rainy season

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.280
and there aren't going to be any boats

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.720
because the river is psychotic.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.840
And so it was a long time before I got back to town

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.040
and I didn't want to leave the anteater,

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.120
but it became like I was like, I realized I was dying.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.680
And then I finally got a boat with some loggers,

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.800
a death boat just loaded with these guys

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.920
had gone into the jungle and shot everything they could

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.960
and taken all the babies

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.000
and they were going to go sell them.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.800
And so it was like baby monkeys and toucans

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.040
and birds in cages and pieces of crocodiles

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.160
and anaconda skins and jaguar skins rolled up.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.880
And it was just like,

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.840
I was just laying there with all these dead animals in the boat

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.520
with all the flies on my face and got back to the hotel,

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.760
called my mother, said,

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.640
please book me a flight out like today, like today.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.960
And then I sat on the plane

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.720
and somebody sat next to me on the plane

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.520
and I had a hood on.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.560
And I do remember that in the haze,

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.640
at this point I was having trouble staying conscious,

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.520
but I do remember that she looked over

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.360
trying to see what was sitting next to her

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.280
and then she got up and never came back.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.960
And when I got to immigration in New York,

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.320
the cop, he takes my passport and he goes,

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.680
so what were you doing in Peru?

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.480
He's looking down and he goes,

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.680
yeah, and he like holds up the passport,

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.960
looks at the passport, looks at my face, he goes,

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.120
oh buddy, what the fuck?

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.120
And I said, no, that's what he,

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.200
I was like, I'm trying to get home to go to the hospital.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.320
And he goes, he stamps it.

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.720
He goes, go, go, go, go, God bless, God bless.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.840
He's like, oh shit.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.320
And then they put me in the room in the hospital

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.440
with like the hazmat suits

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.240
and they didn't know what it was.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.720
And I spent like five days on IV antibiotics

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.640
with like four different things running through my veins.

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:07.480
And the doctors were like, don't let it go that close.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.160
They're like, you went real close on that one.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:10.440
Yeah, that's what that picture,

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.200
I mean, people should check out the book

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.160
just to see the picture.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.160
Because I imagine you just laying there,

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.360
unable to see, have a fever probably.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.880
So you're like half hallucinating.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.680
And there's no boat, there's no way out.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.640
There's no help coming.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.680
Plus there's this creature

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.280
who you've become a parent of that you love.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.920
Boy, that's a dark place to be as a 19 year old.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.280
Most people will never be in a place like that.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.960
Like where did you find strength in that place?

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.080
I don't know.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.320
I just remember writing like a goodbye letter to my parents

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.880
because I said, if I die out here, it was really dark.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.280
Like it was terrifying.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.720
It really felt like it was the end.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.280
And I was writing, if you find me out here, I'm sorry.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.120
And all that type of stuff.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.480
And it was, I don't know about strength.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.280
There was no strength.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.560
It was just like move forward.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.720
And at some point it was like, if you'll take me down river,

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.440
take me down river.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.720
You just got lucky with the loggers

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.800
with the death boat that they found you.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.520
Well, how did the infection start by the way?

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:20.920
I don't know.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.200
I really don't know.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.720
I mean, we always have some sort of little shit,

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.480
but the thing is now JJ taught me

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.000
that there's like three different trees

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.200
that can cure infections.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.160
I didn't know this at the time.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.680
I didn't know the cheat codes.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.160
Now there's, if you have a small infection,

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.800
you can use Sangre de Drago and it'll cure it right away.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.920
Like, let's say you have a botfly

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.280
and it gets a little pussy.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.720
There's a fly living in your skin.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.080
You put that on there.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.800
Not only will it kill the fly, but it'll heal the infection.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.240
Now, if you have a worse infection,

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.400
you can go to Ohay, which is ficus insipida

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.200
and you can use that and that will completely heal.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.000
That will murder.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:51.800
It's like crocodile blood.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.160
It will murder infections.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.840
So like, forget Neosporin.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.480
That's a joke.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.800
These are heavy chemical compounds

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.880
running through these trees and they know all about them.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.560
And so whatever it is.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.720
So now at this point, that's no longer an issue.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.840
Because we know how to handle it, which at that time,

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.640
if JJ had been there, I would have been fine.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.240
Well, learn the hard way.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.760
So these are open wounds

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.000
and then there's creatures that start living in them.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.280
It's basically, what is it?

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:16.920
Well, that's separate.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.720
That's botflies.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:21.080
Yeah, there's a creature that unfortunately,

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.000
very, very, very unfortunately,

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.400
likes to make its home inside the flesh of mammals.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.040
And so the flies attach their eggs to mosquitoes.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.400
The mosquitoes go and seek out warm-blooded animals.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.040
The eggs, microscopic eggs fall into your skin

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.080
and then begin to grow.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.600
And sooner or later, you feel a twitch

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.160
and it's a worm living inside of you

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.280
that's like vertical down in you and it's eating you.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.280
And at first, it's not a problem,

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.040
but when they get to about as thick as that pen,

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.000
it starts to hurt because you got a hole in you

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.760
and they have a little breathing tube that comes up

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.760
and they breathe and they go back in and then they eat

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.960
and they come back up to breathe

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.440
and you have a friend living in you.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.160
You've had one of those?

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.760
I've had lots of those.

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.720
It's tough to take them out.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.160
They have hooks.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.400
How do you, do you have to,

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.680
you gotta love the junk.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.480
So how do you take it out?

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:15.960
You have to come.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.420
100%.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.120
You gotta put an irritant.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.200
So like a lot of times what we'll do down there

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.120
is someone will take a massive drag of a cigarette

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.280
and then they'll spit the, they'll power like exhale

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.520
and get some of the tar, which also shows you

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.200
how much tar you get out of a cigarette.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.760
And then with a knife and you put that right over the hole

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.440
and then you slap some Vaseline or something on top of that

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.560
so they can't breathe.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.400
And eventually over the course of a few hours,

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.720
they'll come up enough looking for air

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.200
and then you gotta grab them with a tweezer

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.080
and try not to rip them

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.440
because then you're gonna get an infection.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.680
And you gotta squeeze from the, it's a whole ceremony.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.960
When people have botflies, we're all like,

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.560
oh, it's botfly time, let's go.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.920
And then like JJ will squeeze.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.360
He's got like pliers for thumbs.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.160
He can like take a piece of your neck

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.400
and you think he's going to break your skin.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.040
He'll just squeeze until this thing comes out.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:10.280
And you don't wanna, I guess there's an open wound right there.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:11.720
Yeah, you don't wanna bathe for a day or two

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.680
after until that closes.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.480
Cause otherwise you're gonna have like water sloshing around

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:18.040
in like a little pocket of yours just kind of grows.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.080
And that water might have other organisms in it.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.080
Water in your skin tends to, yeah.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.760
I mean, the jungle water is clean.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.560
We drink it like I drink the water fresh out of the stream.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.760
Oh, that's interesting.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.920
Well, it's just a giant filtration system.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.880
All those roots,

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.760
the whole jungle is constantly purifying everything.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.320
People might be thinking about that with the jungle.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.240
There's insects probably all over you all the time.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.480
It's not as bad as you think.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.600
Like I've been to Finland, Lapland in the summer

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.280
and the mosquitoes are horrendous, like devastating.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.520
The Amazon in our area,

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.440
if you're sitting in a hammock reading a book out,

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.840
our research stations don't have walls or anything.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.600
You're good for about one mosquito every half hour,

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.960
which really is not a lot.

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.240
I mean, it's worse than New Jersey.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.800
Like it's really not that bad.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.920
Tell me a little more about the little baby anteater, Lulu.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.420
Lulu.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.280
Who you've rescued and had to sadly leave behind.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.440
Yeah, I just was always fascinated with giant anteaters

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:23.240
or this German shepherd sized thing with wolverine claws

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.840
and these giant Popeye forearms.

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.440
They excavate ant and termite mounds

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.560
and they have this long tongue

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.880
and their baby's right on their back

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.640
for the first six months of their lives.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.960
They actually have this incredibly intimate relationship

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.520
with their young and it just so happened

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.040
that this animal that I was wildly fascinated with,

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.800
there was an orphan on the river and JJ was like,

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:46.680
you love these things.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.400
And I was like, yeah.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.360
And so he went and he was like,

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.800
hey, my friend, he got me the baby

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.160
and we were like, we're going to rewild her.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.080
And so I spent like weeks and weeks and weeks

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.920
just like with this thing on my back

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.120
crawling through the jungle, teaching her to find ants,

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.000
giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.960
And their tongue is like 11 inches long at that age.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.640
And so when she wanted me to wake up,

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.640
she'd fired up my nose and would come out my mouth.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.760
And then if I tried to get her off me quick,

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:15.320
she'd stick the claws in and all my clothes,

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.320
I have old, now they're like museum pieces

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.800
with rips in them from Lulu's claws.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.640
Just able to also communicate emotion

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.520
and feeling and all that.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.480
She needed it.

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.040
She needed it.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.080
So if this animal didn't have the physical touch,

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.080
if we didn't, if I didn't hold her all day long,

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:32.920
she'd throw tantrums.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.200
She'd go shred something.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.320
She'd go pull down the curtain.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.760
She'd go ruin the woods.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.480
She'd start literally having a traumatic response

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.320
to not having intimacy, which was shocking.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.120
Because again, on the scale of a cockroach to an elephant,

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.680
you go, I didn't know that giant anteaters

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.880
had such intense emotions.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:53.640
But she did.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.760
And also taking care of her forced me to explore the jungle

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.520
from the perspective of an animal.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.080
So I got to be an animal.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.360
And so there's only a few times in my life

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.400
where I've gotten to do that.

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.080
One was with her.

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.160
Another time was living with a herd of elephants

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.400
where I had to walk with them through the forest

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:21.880
and see how they interacted completely natural.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.680
And it's different.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.480
It's very different.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.680
And you realize just like a person's public persona

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.680
when they're out on the street in Manhattan

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.600
is going to be very different than when you're on the couch

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.720
with them on a Tuesday night.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.160
And with wild animals, it's very much like that.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.280
You see a bobcat on a trail and it's going to look at you

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.880
and glare at you and then go off.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.200
And it's like, yeah, but what's it like when it's in the den?

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.520
It's playing with its cubs.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.760
Yeah. So that when it's looking at you,

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.600
that's like the Instagram post it's making.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.400
So besides Amazon, you spend a lot of time in India.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.560
Can you tell me what you learned hanging out

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.520
with a herd of elephants?

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.560
What do people not understand about elephants

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.920
that's beautiful to you, that's interesting to you?

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.520
First of all, I think that elephants should have

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.720
government representation as like a subset of society.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.040
Like actually, they-

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.000
They have intelligence?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.600
They are so intelligent.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.520
And when you look at an elephant, so there's this question

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.160
that keeps coming up of, are we smart enough

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.440
to know how smart animals are?

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.720
Can we interpret the intelligence that we're seeing?

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.600
And I've lived with a semi wild herd of elephants

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:37.640
in India for a while.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:41.080
And some of the things that I saw like changed

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.280
how I view reality, to be honest with you.

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.120
Because you watch a matriarch of an elephant herd

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.760
walk up to someone that none of us knew was pregnant

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.920
and her trunk goes to her stomach.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.720
And then she calls all the other ones over

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.480
and they're interested in this little human

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.240
that they know that there's something in there.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.360
And they're all conversing about it and you go, whoa.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:04.680
Or that every morning we'd wake up

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.440
and the elephants didn't want the stream water,

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.360
they didn't want the lake water, they want puddles.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.280
They wanted the water from our well.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.840
We had like a stone well, like a traditional.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.400
And every morning it's like run out of bed

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.840
because all the elephants were gonna come

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.440
and they were gonna rip the bucket off

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.400
and destroy everything.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.720
But they wanted that nice, cold, clean water.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.720
And so it was like caring for elephants that were wild

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.520
that were sometimes getting shot at by farmers

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.440
because if they went to try and rob some bananas.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.760
So these are sort of like delinquent elephants

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.680
that were half wild in the forest department

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.240
was thinking about getting rid of them,

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.360
which whatever that meant.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.680
And I made really good friends with this one elephant

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.720
and his name was Dharma.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.200
And Dharma had the, this stuff doesn't,

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.880
it's hard to write the book I'm writing right now

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.160
because none of it sounds real.

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.760
He grew up around people because he was a tuskless male.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.640
So he couldn't hang out with the females

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.080
because he was a grownup male.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.240
And he couldn't hang out with the males, the bulls,

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.840
because he couldn't defend himself

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.040
when they rough housed and everything.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.560
So Dharma would be like wandering around the forest,

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.000
not knowing who to hang out with.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.600
And so like there was one night there was a tiger calling

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:15.960
and we just heard, you could hear it echoing over the hills.

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.720
And what does Dharma do?

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.160
2 AM we hear Dharma show up and he's same thing.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.520
He starts throwing a tantrum.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.640
He starts pulling shit over.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.640
He says, takes a chair, throws it.

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.760
We had bananas in the truck.

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.440
Dharma walks up to the truck.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.400
It's like a Jeep.

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.160
He walks up to the Jeep, smells it.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.640
He looks at me and he's like, are you going to get out of bed?

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:36.920
I'm like, no, I'm not going to get out of bed.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.160
I was like, Dharma, you're a grown ass elephant.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.840
The tiger does this thing again.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.600
And he's like, I need bananas to feel better.

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.800
Pushes the truck up on two wheels.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.520
Oh, wow.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.080
Looks at me.

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.160
Is this how you want it to be?

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.240
So I'm up, I'm up.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.400
And I go and I'm like, please, please, please, please, please.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.000
Dharma going to be rubbing his face.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:55.960
And he's like, he puts it down.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.200
He's like, all right, well then, then hit me.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.480
I didn't do it.

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.600
So he lifts it up again.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.280
And so in the end, there was no way for me to outsmart the elephant.

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:04.760
He wins.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.600
There was nothing I could do.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.720
And so a lot of my job was taking him out into the forest and, and, you know,

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.240
spending a little bit of time with him.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.000
I have this beautiful, one time I set up the tripod and I went and I was just,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.440
I was just journaling and he would come and he would just like play with my hair.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.480
And he'd be like, Hey, what's up?

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.760
You know, and he just, he wanted someone to, to interact with on an emotional level.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:30.680
And, you know, when you think about elephants in terms of the fact that,

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.520
you know, people go, oh, you know, they, they use medication to induce labor.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.280
It's like, yeah, that's not that surprising.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.760
They, they, they hold the bones of the dead.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.160
It's like, yeah, they have the best smell of pretty much any animal.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.360
That's also not surprising.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.480
They probably know exactly who that was, that bone, but they can navigate

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.520
to water holes and communicate in ways that we cannot really figure out.

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.400
And so when you hear about people measuring at elephant intelligence,

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.000
you'll hear about scientists being like, Oh, well, we gave it a, you know,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.200
a bucket with a hole in it.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.960
And then it had like a key and there was a rope.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.800
And you're like, bro, this is all human stuff.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:09.720
Can you go walking with them for three weeks in the wild and watch how they

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.960
deal with the problems that they encounter in the forest?

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.160
And so elephants have become, especially recently with the work that's been going

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.760
that I've been doing in Africa with vet paw.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.640
I've just become so fascinated with elephants and, you know,

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.040
elephants, the elephant, the African elephant population right now is down

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.360
at 2% of what it was a few hundred years ago.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.880
We're really, we're really putting them on the brink of, you know, there's

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.480
some elephants that are being born tusk less because we've poaching has taken

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.960
down the great tuskers to the point where now it's, it's actually beneficial

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.360
for some elephants and not have tusks because they won't have humans.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.840
But that's, that's like, we've created deformed elephants.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:56.440
And so like now I'm gotten very concerned with issues of elephants.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.320
And tusks are fundamental to the interaction between elephants.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:41:59.800
Absolutely.

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:02.920
I mean, with males compete with each other, but also elephants use their

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.480
tusks, you know, like they'll, they'll break a branch and they'll be like,

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.520
this is a good branch.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.880
I'm going to eat the hell out of this.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.840
And they'll like hang it on their tusk and they'll like grab a bunch of other

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:11.080
stuff.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.760
They'll like, hold it, um, you know, ripping a tree up out of the ground.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.920
I just watched it two weeks ago as, as, as watching an elephant, he got down on

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.240
his knees and stuck his tusk into the ground and like leveraged up.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.360
He like Archimedes to this route out of the ground.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.040
And then was like, that's a sweet route.

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.320
And then when he left, I went and I tasted the root and it was like sweet

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:31.640
ginger.

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.200
And I was like, I have no idea what this is, but he knew it was good.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.520
Did they use tusks for sexual selection?

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.040
Like to impress the ladies or no?

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.440
It's certainly involved in how, who, who has mating rights.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.880
Oh, who wins and who wins.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.600
I mean, if you've got the big tusks and there are elephants out there, like the

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:52.440
mammoth, big tuskers that have tusks down to the ground, like huge.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.720
And when you see them, it's like seeing something unique on earth, unique in

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:56.120
history.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.880
Cause we're at a point where we might lose those.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.080
There are only a few of them left.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.720
And then they're so prized by hunters.

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:01.880
Yeah.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.360
It's interesting.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.760
Cause I, I forget what the actual conclusion on that is because there's

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:12.680
some studies of the use of the value of beauty in evolution, like birds and

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:21.320
peacocks and so on that there's no actual value to it, but it plays a role in, in

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.240
sexual selection, meaning value.

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.000
Like it's much easier to understand competition and like a tusk helps you

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.800
defeat the competitor, but I bet you there's a component to the tusk where

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.520
the ladies go, God damn, that's a nice, like there's a visual, beautiful

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:36.920
component.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.320
Maybe not.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:37.800
I don't know.

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.120
But what if, what if beauty though, as we're defining it though, is, is, is

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:48.360
symmetry and the, the absence of yellow spots on your face and, and healthy

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:48.920
looking hair.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:54.520
And so like, I think to us, beauty is sexually appealing traits that look

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:55.400
good to meet with.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:55.800
And so-

01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.160
So that, that 19 year old with Marissa, everybody in the world would swipe left

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:01.480
on that.

01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:01.720
Yeah.

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.960
The least sexually desirable object in the universe.

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:06.280
Okay.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.400
What, I mean, speaking of elephant intelligence and something I think and

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.280
work quite a bit on as with artificial intelligence is what the philosophical

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.760
question that comes up is what is intelligence?

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.360
What is intelligent?

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:27.720
Humans, homo sapiens are often thought to be highly intelligent.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:34.680
That's the reason they stand out in your understanding of different species,

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:41.320
like the elephant, what stands out to about humans or are they just another

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:45.000
animal with different kinds of intelligence?

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:51.720
Well, we're certainly unique because we have altered the entire planet.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:51.960
Yeah.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.640
You know, the term the Anthropocene.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.680
I mean, it's like, we've literally created a geological layer of us,

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.480
whereas other animals don't.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.360
And going back to elephants, it's like, they also engineer their environment.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.200
If you're in a forest, like if you drop me in a forest on earth, I could tell you

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.360
in two seconds if there's elephants there because this twisted branches and

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:15.400
excavated earth and they, they're constantly gardening.

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.400
Um, but I mean, look, look at us.

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:25.080
I mean, there's, we're, we're clearly unique in nature, which, which makes me

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.240
not understand the, the, the anti-human sentiment that, that so much of

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.680
environmentalism has about like, you know, like we were, we're bad, we're

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.200
damned, we ruin everything.

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.200
And it's like, I've seen the worst.

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.520
I've seen the burning Amazon and I'm still like, I love being able to share

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:45.080
ideas with you and travel to places and FaceTime my family when I'm not around

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.440
them. And it's like, I, I celebrate a lot of what makes us human.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.000
And I, I, it's almost like reality is this crazy video game.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.240
And it's like, if we could just figure out the right keys, we can pretty much

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.520
do anything we can think of.

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.080
And it's like, I mean, poetry, art, I mean, you know, I'm, I'm the biggest

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:07.640
animal lover in the world, but we are, we are, we are different.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.240
We really are.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.040
Yeah.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.720
The ability to puzzle, solve, create tools.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.440
What do you think is the coolest invention humans have come up with?

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.840
Is it fire with the most impactful?

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.400
I feel like fire is fire.

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:26.680
I feel like fire is kind of a gimme.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.120
I feel like they didn't really invent it.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.560
They, they probably like the wheel flying.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.080
I mean, flying.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:36.280
I mean, think of, think if you could go back in time to someone that never

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:42.920
flew, you know, a Sultan, an Egyptian king, George Washington, you know,

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.160
and be like, you can fly.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.800
I mean, this is just, just on my way here and I fly way too much, but I was

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.680
looking out the window at the clouds and going, this is unbelievably spectacular.

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.680
It's just stunning.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:01.480
You know, as a kid, you, you look at a cloudy day and you go, this is the world

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.520
is like this today.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.640
And then you get in a plane and you fly above the clouds and it's sunny up

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.960
there and you go, oh, it just, it changes your perspective.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.840
It's like when people go to the moon and they come back and they tell you the

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:17.800
pale blue dot, you know, just, I say, I say flying, I think the ability to fly.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.880
I mean, the fact that I could, I could get on a plane and be in India and, you

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.160
know, 20, 22 hours is shocking.

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.880
In terms of its usefulness, I would argue that's not in the top five, but in

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.600
terms of its ability to inspire.

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:39.240
There's somebody I forgot who told me this idea that there's something about

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.320
the atmosphere, earth's atmosphere that allows you to look up and see the stars.

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.240
Like if we didn't have that human civilization would not have happened.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.800
Meaning like being able to look up and see something out there would fill our,

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:59.400
like there's something that allows you to look up versus just look down to like

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.880
looking at your local environment.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:07.880
Be able to like wander and see, holy shit, there's a big world out there.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.960
And I don't know anything.

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.440
If you're able to look up and see that, that kind of humility combined with the

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.800
ability to dream about exploring, maybe it just inspires the exploration.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.360
It's kind of an interesting thought given how inspiring, for example, the,

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:32.200
uh, the extra upgraded, super cool version of flying, which is flying to

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.760
other planets.

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:41.000
I mean, there's going to be, hopefully it's possible this century, a child

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.040
born, no, not this century, maybe the century, a child born on another planet

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:53.560
that looks up and looks back at earth and has to be educated by his, her parents

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.000
that like, there's another place.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.560
There's another place where life is way easier.

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.960
God, it's so easy.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.400
There's water everywhere.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.200
Exactly.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.200
People complain about earth, man, earth is really, really, really good.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.600
It's really, really good here.

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.040
Water everywhere.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.040
I wouldn't even leave.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.560
Given like right now, like if somebody said like, oh, you could like, you could

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.120
go to the moon.

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.000
I'd be like, no, I'm good.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.560
If I died in space, I'd be so pissed.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.480
I love it here.

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.080
Yeah, but you're still, there's a longing to explore for you.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.920
There's a longing to explore, but I really think I'm, I'm such a, like my

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.360
longing to explore is like river streams, oceans, jungles.

01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.840
Like to me, like, yeah, I would, I would watch the hell out of the, the

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.520
live stream of, of, of Elon touching down on Mars.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.960
Like I'd be like, this is incredible.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.040
It's an amazing that I get to be around to see this.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.120
I'm staying where I'll be right here.

01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.320
Yeah.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:57.320
But it's good that the human spirit pushes us.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.440
Oh, it's amazing.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.160
What's possible.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.240
And it does that for you.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.160
What, um, just, uh, out there are questions that what's, what's the

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:08.280
most dangerous animal in the Amazon?

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.440
Would you say mammal?

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.800
Let's go with mammal.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:12.840
Dangerous mammal.

01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.000
Like dangerous in terms of you walking around doing the solo hike.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.120
I'm going to disappoint everybody with this, but it's, it's,

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.160
it's humans.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:21.640
It's nothing.

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.480
There's no, if I'm out in the Amazon, there's nothing that's going to attack me.

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.120
You know, and in, in India, you might have, you might have an old

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.560
leopard or a tiger that's missing a tooth that decides your prey, or you

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.640
might have an angry elephant that's in must that just decides to, just

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.440
decides to flatten you in the Amazon.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.800
You're not, there's real Jaguars won't even let you see them.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:44.760
Yeah.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.720
And there's really nothing else.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:49.640
One of my friends, a brilliant scientist friend of mine, Pat got

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:53.400
attacked by a rabid ocelot ones, but that's like a diesel house cat.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.440
Just having a fit, you know, it's, it wasn't the worst thing in the world.

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.960
It's just the assholes kingdom.

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:00.280
Okay.

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:07.000
What, in terms of humans, you've said that the tribes, some of them

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.960
uncontacted can be exceptionally dangerous.

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.160
What's your experience with them?

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.360
What should people learn?

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:17.800
Cause it's such a fascinating part of life here on earth that there's tribes

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:23.080
that don't have much or any contact with the quote unquote civilized world.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.360
Most of the people that I meet don't actually really understand how,

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:35.160
how isolated these people are or how weird it is that we're sitting here

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.960
and that we have iPhones and airplanes and all this stuff.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.320
And these people are living naked in the forest at this moment.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:47.960
And so the, the, the thing though, you know, I also was recently, somebody,

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:50.920
somebody told me there's like Paleolithic tribes and it's like, no, no,

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.200
no, just by default, they're modern tribes living now.

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.320
They just happen to be living out in the jungle.

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.640
And there's a huge debate about, you know, do we try and contact

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.520
them and bring them in?

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.000
And there's two camps of people on this who they say that it was, it was, it

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
was the trauma of the rubber boom that sent them out that far into the forest

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.320
and made them terrified of the outside world.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.480
And so that's also what made them so hyper violent.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.040
I mean, they're, they're, I, there's one of the guys we work with on our team,

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:25.080
Victor was, and I think it was 2004 he's coming down river and he had a load of

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.880
mahogany wood and he's piloting this boat.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.920
And he sent two people, husband and wife ahead to go start cooking breakfast on

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.040
the beach so they could put the little kitchenette thing down and pick, put the

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:38.520
propane.

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:43.320
He sent them ahead as the he's going nice and slow with the barge coming down

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.120
the river.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.800
They go ahead, reach the beach.

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.280
They get out.

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.680
He starts cutting some cane to start making a fire tribe comes out.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:52.040
No warning.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.160
They just start screaming.

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.280
They start shooting arrows.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.520
The man instantly gets an arrow through the leg and it pins his legs.

01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.240
So he can't run.

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.400
He tells his wife, go save yourself.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.360
And she does.

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.320
She jumps in the water.

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:05.240
There's arrows falling around her too.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.160
And as she's floating down the river, she looks back and the last thing she sees

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:12.920
is these guys getting to her husband and beginning to rip him apart.

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.880
As Victor comes down the river, this is a guy we work with every day.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:25.240
He comes down the river and sees his friend disemboweled, opened up, dissected.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.600
His parts are all over the beach.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.800
The beach is red.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.320
And they only found out what happened because they found her later on holding

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.520
onto a stick in the river.

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.720
And they're like, what happened?

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.120
And she was like, they just attacked.

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.800
They don't want people on their land.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:45.320
On the sort of the underground WhatsApp chain of the Amazon, a few in August,

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.320
this was not internationally known.

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.200
Some loggers went up and tried to steal a few trees from where the tribes were.

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.280
And then everybody sent the pictures of what the loggers looked like after a few days

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.280
because the tribes porcupined them with arrows.

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.920
They were laying there on the ground with just arrows sticking out of their bodies.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:05.400
And then eventually the authorities came out and looked and there was just these white

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:06.440
bodies.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.480
I'll show you the pictures later.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:10.840
There's just these white puffy bodies with like the skulls sticking out.

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.320
And it was like, you don't mess with these tribes.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:20.680
I wonder what's the mythology around that they construct around who these outsiders are?

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:22.040
Are they gods?

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:22.920
Are they demons?

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:23.960
Are they humans?

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:25.960
Who are they?

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.160
Who are we to them?

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.960
Well, you got to go back to the rubber boom.

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.800
The rubber barons went down there and at the start of the industrial revolution,

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.520
the only way to get rubber was to mine it from the trees that are out in the forest.

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.840
And so the only way to do that, because you can't make a rubber plantation in the jungle.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.600
The rubber, when it's in plantation form, when it's a monoculture,

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:48.280
it gets this leaf blight and it all dies.

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.880
Henry Ford tried it.

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.440
It didn't work.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.160
And so what they did was they sent these people down who just whipped,

01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:57.480
burned, enslaved, raped and pillaged the people.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.080
It's one of the worst periods in human suffering that I've ever read about.

01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.840
One missionary said they were killing the locals the way you or I would kill a mosquito.

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.760
They just went nuts.

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.880
And so they sent them out and they would come back with rubber.

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:15.880
And this would go to fuel the industrial revolution for hoses and gaskets and tires

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.560
and all this stuff that suddenly we needed.

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.080
And it was during that time that these gangs of foreigners would go into the

01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:30.120
jungle to enslave the natives, that these uncontacted tribes went back into the jungle

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:30.840
and said, not us.

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:38.120
And they have six foot bows and seven foot arrows with bamboo tips.

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:42.200
They make the bamboo tips into razor blades.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.960
And so when those things fly, actually one of my rangers,

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:53.480
one of the jungle keepers team was present when the tribes had come out onto the river

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.320
and he tried to help them because they're nomadic and they live out there.

01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:02.200
And so there's an element of like brother, like, you know, they're trying to be like,

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.480
you don't need to be like this.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.760
Like we're friendly.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.480
So they sent a canoe across the river with bananas.

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.400
And so he's up to his waist in the river and the tribes are right across the river.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.080
And they shot and he sees the arrow coming right at his head.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.920
And as he moved to the side, it hit him at the temple and sliced him back towards the ear,

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:24.040
opening him to the skull.

01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:25.400
He's fine.

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:28.280
But let me tell you something, when he goes and gets a crew cut,

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:31.640
it's the most bad-ass skull, the scar you've ever seen, man.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.960
So he always keeps it real short on that side.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.120
But even if you try to help them, they're not necessarily friendly.

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.440
That's a tough lesson.

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:42.060
Yeah.

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.840
I suppose they have a point.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.640
They have a point and protecting them is a default of, you know,

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:53.080
now that we're protecting all this ecosystems and all these other indigenous communities,

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:56.600
it's like we all sort of live with this knowledge that they're the hermanos,

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.880
the brothers are out there and that's the way they want to keep it.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.960
And so we just have to be respectful of like,

01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:04.280
you don't camp on certain beaches at certain times of the year

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.880
because we know that they might be there.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.880
You really have to be careful about that.

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:09.480
Have you yourself interacted with any?

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.440
My interaction with them came on a solo where I pushed it a little bit too far.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.880
And I was planning to do a three week.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.240
This was like the big one.

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.640
And I got dropped off by poachers up a river.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.440
And I went past the point where they were like names there.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.440
I said, what tributary are we on?

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.600
And they were like tributary.

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.320
And I was like, okay.

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.160
And I said, leave me here.

01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:36.040
And I remember the guy being like, are you committing suicide?

01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:37.160
And he didn't understand that.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:39.240
I was like, no, I have a backpack and I have like food

01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:42.120
and like how I'm going to like take videos and I have a tripod.

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:43.080
And I was like, we're cool here.

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.640
And they looked at me like they were like, goodbye.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.560
And I was like, all right.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.120
And I went up this river and, and again, like you just, you learn these things.

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:57.160
Like, you know, it was only when I'd been alone for a week that you realize you're,

01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:00.120
I guess that's saying they're like, oh, you're, you're born alone and you die alone.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.160
It's like, no, you're not.

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.520
You're born into a room full of people.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:06.040
Usually at the very least, your mother's there for everybody.

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.480
And, and so you've been around people, probably if you're a normal person,

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.080
every single day of your life, you've seen dozens, if not hundreds of people.

01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:19.320
And all of a sudden you realize what a social creature we are

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:23.000
because on day six, it gets weird for me.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:23.480
It got weird.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.320
I know there's people that can do it longer.

01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.360
So what does that, what does that mean?

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.280
Like longing for contact?

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.560
Like are you lonely?

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.000
Longing for contact, the distortion of reality in the sense that like,

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.520
you know, you wake up and there's no one there and you start to,

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.840
you know, you're going up a river.

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.880
So I would, I would keep, I kept looking back down river and

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:47.560
almost thinking of my life as something, it was almost like I had already died

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.160
and I had gone to somewhere else.

01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:53.320
And I was looking back on that life as like something that I had experienced.

01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:57.080
And then there, there came this panic of what if it's gone or like,

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.520
what if world war three broke out?

01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.640
And I just don't know about it.

01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:04.280
My family in New York is vaporized and something just, you just, you're, you're,

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:10.280
your ability to comprehend and interpret reality kind of requires other people.

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:12.200
It's not just that you're lonely.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:16.120
You need that contact to actually just perceive the world, make sense of it,

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:17.240
all of that.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.200
So you start basically hallucinating a certain kind of way.

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.200
I started feeling very uncomfortable.

01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:27.480
It doesn't help also that like Santiago told me these stories where he's like,

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:31.720
if you hear Capuchin's sounding, not quite monkeys, if you hear Capuchin

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:35.640
monkeys sounding not quite like Capuchins, he goes, it's the tribe and they're coming to get you.

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:43.640
And then the guy who was shot, Ignacio, they showed me videos where we saw them on the beach

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.960
and they're communicating in monkey calls.

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:49.720
They're using it as code so that we don't understand them, even though we don't speak

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.520
their language, but they're, they're using animal calls.

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:57.400
And so every night you go to sleep and then you go, did that tinamou sound off and you're like,

01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.040
shit, you know, and it's really hard to fall asleep.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.240
And then like one night I messed up and I left a fish.

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:04.440
I like cleaned this fish.

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.120
I ate like this huge fish.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.400
I just ate it to my face.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.000
You're putting out like marathon levels of energy every day.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.920
Like, you know, Goggins would love solos.

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.040
He'd be like, this is awesome.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.040
You eat the fish raw?

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:20.680
This one, I actually cooked it, but you know, the skeleton was laying there right outside

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.720
my tent, stupid.

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:26.520
And then the middle of the night I wake up and I just could tell there was something there,

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.280
you know, and then like, you almost don't want to look.

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:30.760
It's like when you're a kid at the basement door and you're like, is there a ghost?

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:34.840
I like unzipped the tent and I like open it up.

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.400
And there's like 27 black caiman outside of my tent, all looking at me like this.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.520
And like, some of their heads are this big and they're like, there's fish there.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.720
Can we have it?

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.080
And I'm like, holy shit.

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.480
And like, you know, I was like, do I, I kind of like had to like scooch the tent back and

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:51.720
like move back and let them have their fish.

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:54.920
And there was a host of crocodiles outside of my tent.

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:55.420
Yeah.

02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:00.680
But no, so then there was like 27, maybe there was a lot.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.320
The big ones, small ones, medium sized one, every type.

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:05.400
They were all there and their eyes glow in the night.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:07.960
You know, you shine a light at animals and they have a tapetum lucidum.

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.200
And so their, their eye shine comes back at you.

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:16.120
If you shine a headlamp at a, at a jaguar or a frog or almost every animal has a tapetum.

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:16.760
These are croc.

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.360
There's a whole lot of them.

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:19.160
Yeah.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.000
I thought, can we go back to the part of the conversation where you said the jungle is not

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:23.640
dangerous?

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:24.920
The humans are the most dangerous.

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:25.560
Did they eat me?

02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:25.800
No.

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:27.560
Why didn't they eat you?

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.760
They wanted the fish.

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.560
Is there some way of you interacting with them that shows that you're not a source of harm?

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:35.320
I don't believe so.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.720
I'm sure there's someone out there that thinks they can talk to crocs, but.

02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.640
Cause there's a, there's a story of you grabbing a croc by the tail.

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.720
What did you learn from that?

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:45.560
Learn to not always listen to JJ.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.640
So JJ was testing you to.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.560
Yeah, to see how stupid it was.

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.880
How do you hold the croc exactly?

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:54.760
You have to get them by the head, like an anaconda like this.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:55.560
And so.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:59.320
So you're one of the world experts of grabbing creatures by the head.

02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:02.280
I wouldn't say world expert, but I've done a lot of it.

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:05.000
I also have, you see that there's like kind of a ball there.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.520
That's where a crocodile tooth went in that side and like came out that side of my.

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.640
That was a really good chomp.

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:12.360
And the watch I was wearing at the time saved me.

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:13.800
Cause that like that.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:15.880
It's real fast.

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:16.520
Just chomp.

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.680
Just like somebody took a sledgehammer.

02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.120
You put your hand on the table and I just went really hurt.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:23.880
Shouldn't have been doing that.

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.120
How did that come up?

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.400
Cause I caught a croc that was too big.

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:31.000
So usually when we catch little caiman in the streams and we measure them to monitor the

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.040
populations, you get it by the neck.

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.680
And then I tuck the tail under my arm and I hold it.

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.160
And you're talking about a little, you know, four foot croc, nothing.

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:45.720
And I, I, this one, I dove into a, into a swamp and I caught like a six foot.

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.960
Spectacle caiman and her head was big and I had her by the neck and I realized I couldn't get her

02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:52.760
tail under my arm.

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.240
Cause her tail was all the way back there and she started thrashing.

02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.760
And it was like probably croc number 375 that I'd caught.

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.040
And I just got a little cocky.

02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:04.600
And I said, ah, she's, you know, I just, I just like grabbed her by a leg.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.400
I was like, I got this.

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.680
And she just came back and tagged me and I went, okay, gonna go back to being safe.

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.600
Just to linger on it.

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.800
Is it one of the, one of the bigger predators in the Amazon?

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.480
And it's, is it going to, are they going extinct?

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.280
Black caimans.

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.440
Black caiman were, I believe they were critically endangered for a while because for a while,

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.520
the fashion industry loved their skin.

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.200
It's soft and it's black.

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.400
They're bouncing back a little bit now, you know, like most animals,

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.000
if you leave them alone, they'll be fine.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.640
I mean, crocs have been through, you know, how many millions and millions of years on earth before us.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.680
I mean, that's even the joke with, with the joke, but that's the grim reality of tiger conservation.

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.480
There was a hundred thousand tigers in 1900.

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.440
Now there's 4,000 tigers left on earth.

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.080
It's not rocket science.

02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:00.600
All you have to do is not bulldoze their forest

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.880
and allow there to be some deer and tigers will be fine.

02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:05.160
That's it.

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:06.680
It's so simple.

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.120
And that's like sometimes where I feel like I have the dumbest job in the world.

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:14.760
I'm like, guys, please stop killing the things that keep us alive.

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:20.760
The Amazon regulates our global climate, produces medicine, is home to indigenous people.

02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:21.480
It's beautiful.

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.880
Rainforests only cover 3% of the planet's landmass.

02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:27.400
Like it's not that much to ask.

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.680
If you leave their home untouched, they'll figure out how to have sex and multiply,

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.040
except for pandas, apparently.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.280
Cause pandas you have to convince.

02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.520
Yeah, humpbacks, humpbacks.

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:42.680
They went down to, they went from 130,000 down to I think about 8,000

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.280
at whaling times.

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.360
And then when we banned whaling, since that time, where I think we're back up to over

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.080
a hundred thousand humpback whales, they've bounced back.

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:51.880
It's a success story.

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.680
We're not going to lose them.

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:59.480
Okay. So you're in a, on a solo with Crocs looking at you.

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.600
See, this is why you're good at this.

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.800
You know, I would have lost.

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:04.920
We would have been, we were tangent forever with the fish.

02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:05.880
That was your mistake.

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:06.920
That was my mistake.

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.080
I mean, I, most people, I don't understand how you're still alive.

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:13.320
I mean, I, it's really inspiring.

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.080
When you come, we're going to, I'm going to show you.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.160
You told me you're coming.

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.600
Yeah, a hundred percent coming.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:29.080
If there's any place, I mean, sort of a grim joke, but if there's any way to die,

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.320
that's a good one, if I'm being honest.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:32.760
It's a cool one.

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:33.560
It's a pretty cool one.

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:34.840
It'll become part of the party.

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.080
Yeah. I mean, there's, I'm not even like joking.

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:39.880
There's a, there's a oneness to the whole thing.

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.080
All the stories, just reading your work, looking at your work.

02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:52.920
It seems like you're a part of this machine that is nature, this incredible machine.

02:05:52.920 --> 02:06:00.840
Like we all die and we're all part of this big thing that humans do have the capability

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:04.520
to also construct narratives and stories and myths and tell them to each other

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:08.920
and share them with each other and have more sophisticated ways, therefore,

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.840
to communicate love to each other.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.280
But animals do as well.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:16.280
They communicate love, maybe more simply, maybe more honestly.

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.600
Anyway, so you, you were the crocs and the fish.

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:22.920
Yeah. So I messed up.

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:26.920
I left the fish out, croc showed up at some intent, but in the end, it was fine.

02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.600
I, I, I backed off.

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.160
They had their way with the fish and then they all started biting each other.

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:32.200
It was fun to watch.

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.560
Is that a general, sorry to interrupt.

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:34.440
Is that a general rule?

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.480
You want to not leave?

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.000
Yeah. Just like if you're camping in the Northeast, you don't leave.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.640
Like you do a bear bag or a bear canister.

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.200
You don't, you don't want to invite the wild animals.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:45.160
I really did mess up.

02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:48.200
I kind of was just like, you know, whatever I do this every now and then

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.400
I get a little too cavalier.

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:54.840
And the, the ocean has almost, almost taken me down for that a few times.

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:56.360
But yeah.

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.920
So the crocs and then you keep going for a few days.

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:04.600
And my plan was to get to a point where I reached the end of the tributary.

02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:10.360
And this had a very, um, you know, again, for me, this is like a pilgrimage.

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:17.320
This is like, this is like me going into the heart of the, the very center and

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.680
soul and essence of everything that I am fascinated with, like as close to God

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:27.240
as you can get, because you're leaving every type of security, every human

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:29.480
relationship, you're also pushing all your chips in.

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:36.520
And so it's, it's, you know, the, every step I took further up river, it got

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.400
weirder and weirder and more intense and every day and every moment it changed.

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:43.400
And I would, I brought pictures at the time.

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:44.760
There's no way to keep a phone charged.

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:46.200
I didn't have like a power bank or anything.

02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:48.760
You know, I brought pictures from home.

02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:54.280
I brought a, I brought a national geographic magazine, um, something just to,

02:07:54.280 --> 02:08:00.440
you know, and, um, there came a day right when I was getting to the end, like to

02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:03.960
the point where the river was so shallow that it was just a trickle.

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.920
And I was walking on the rocks and the Andes mountains were in front of me.

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:11.560
And I was like reaching the, the place and the music was swelling.

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:15.480
And then all of a sudden I saw smoke around the next bend.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:23.080
And I, I, like my spine is reacting right now as I talk about it, because I, I knew

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:28.520
what I was going to see because I knew that it was impossible for loggers to be out there.

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:29.800
There's no motor that could take you.

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.200
The boat would have run aground miles ago.

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.880
And so I went, and this is the other, this is the other idiot thing.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:37.240
It's like, just turn around.

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.920
Yeah, just do it.

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.640
I'm that kid though.

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:43.160
When you see like a wet paint sign, like I walk by and I touch the wall.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:43.660
Yep.

02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:53.800
And, uh, so I, I, I went around the bend and, and I see, I see a few naked people on the beach.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.520
And they see me and we're like a good distance apart.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:03.480
It's there on the other side of the river, but you know, arrow in hand, bow in hand,

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:08.120
the intention of pose, they're looking at me, they're clearly conversing.

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.560
And that moment lasted for a long moment where I said,

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:20.520
this is the part of the story where they are going to rip me apart, dissect me to see what I eat.

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.200
I mean, every other story in the region that we've heard, that's the ending of it.

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:28.760
If you're alone with these people, it's not going to go well.

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.920
And I have nothing to defend myself with.

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:37.480
And I just, I turned and I ran for like three hours and I got in the river and I

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.720
swam for a while and all my food got wet.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:47.240
I mean, everything, I just, you know, just ran for dear life and, and my, my get out plan,

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:52.200
the thing after I crossed the mountains and came down into the next tributary was I had a pack raft

02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:57.080
and so tiny little inflatable raft, good enough to handle rapids.

02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:59.080
And I inflated the pack raft.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.160
Once the, once the river was like six inches deep, I inflated the pack raft and I went,

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:06.440
and I went for the rest of that day into the night.

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.000
I went into the point that my headlamp died and I was just floating,

02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:12.520
floating in a raft down the Amazon and hitting into things.

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.600
And I was like, okay, I'm going to pop this raft.

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.960
So I got out of the raft, set up my tent and I was like, I need some sleep.

02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:18.920
I was freaking out.

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.720
I hadn't had food.

02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.640
And now, you know, hours and hours and hours, as soon as I fell asleep,

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.760
my asshole brain comes up with the dream of that.

02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.080
I hear voices, they're right outside the tent.

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:32.840
I just, you know, sleeping was worse than being awake.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:35.000
So I woke up, got back in the tent.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.840
And then at one point it was really cool.

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.920
Cause one of those, one of the same black caiman that had come for the fish

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.040
as I'm going down river, he came right up next to me and the two of us were going.

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:48.600
And he was just like motoring down river, this giant, like 16 foot crocodile.

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:50.920
He just like came up to me and like looked at me as I was going.

02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.520
And it was funny cause I wasn't scared of him.

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.040
I was scared of them.

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.040
And yeah, it took me like a week to get back to town.

02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:02.920
And, and again, the things you learn in these moments, the, the, you know,

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:08.200
the appreciation for your parents, the, the, the, the, what a hug feels like,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.840
you know, when you, when you are faced with pretty much certainty that you're not going

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:19.720
to get those things again, whether it's from MRSA or uncontacted tribes or, you know,

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.040
I find that, that it brings, it brings, it brings you this new joy for life where you.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:28.280
Just being that close to death.

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:31.160
Yeah. You go, you go, my God, this is all a miracle.

02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:35.960
It's sad because they're human, just like you.

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.560
Actually, how different are they?

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:43.720
Like if you were forced to interact for a week together, where they can't,

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:45.000
they're not allowed to kill you.

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:47.400
Like not allowed to kill me.

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.680
What would they, are they, how fundamentally different are they?

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.160
Do you think that different?

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.920
I think they're like any other Amazonian natives, um, they're, they're, they're tall.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.920
They seem to have tall genetics.

02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.120
Um, and there's places, you know, again, there's, there's what is known and then

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.360
there's what we know down there.

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.520
Like there's, there's one community where I don't know whether it was like a bad rainstorm

02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:13.800
or something, but some kid from the uncontacted tribes did end up in a village.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:19.720
And so he learned Spanish or he learned whatever dialect they speak in that village.

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.520
And so he's told us a little bit about what life was like with them, but like,

02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:26.040
they're just people.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.560
They're just people.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.440
They have their own culture.

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.120
They know about medicines that we don't know about.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.200
They definitely have hunting practices that, that we don't understand.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.960
They can hit a spider monkey out of 160 foot tree with a bamboo arrow.

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:39.400
We can't do that.

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:44.120
I mean, they are incredible hunters and also like living naked in the

02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.280
jungle with the bot flies and the mosquitoes.

02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:48.600
I don't know how they do it.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:49.480
Like sometimes at night.

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:52.920
And again, we don't have night vision, whereas almost every other animal does.

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.520
And sometimes we'll be sitting, you know, on our, you know, at the resource station

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.720
at night and we'll be just drinking and like looking out and at the,

02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:03.000
you know, we'll do, we'll scare each other.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.680
We'll go, you know, you realize if they were out there right now,

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.560
they could be looking at us.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:10.440
And it's like, the truth is, is that when it's dark out there, they can't see.

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:15.480
It's not easy to start a fire with matches and a lighter and gasoline.

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:17.160
They do it with friction.

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.880
They have some, some beads on survival that we could really learn from.

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.400
Um, not to mention that then you have people that believe that they are

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:32.840
actually the guardians of the extinct giant ground sloth.

02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:35.880
And what they're doing is, you know, living out there because they're protecting

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:40.120
a secret population of previously extinct megafauna, but there's all kinds.

02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.080
I mean, this, it's like, you, you go into the crypto world so quick.

02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:44.520
I've heard so many people be like.

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:49.160
But then again, you have to be humble at how little we know about,

02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:52.920
about that world, about the world of life.

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.040
Like you said, there's so much of life in the Amazon that we don't,

02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.560
uh, creature with no names.

02:13:58.520 --> 02:13:59.160
Tons of them.

02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.640
We could go out on a night walk right now and I could show you something that,

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.240
you know, you, I've done it.

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.920
You, you, you pick up a bug and you go, that doesn't look right.

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:09.880
That's not right.

02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.480
He's got three heads, you know, and then you send it to, to the, the,

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:16.040
the greatest expert on that genus of insects.

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:18.920
And, and they go, look, I got no idea.

02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.800
And you're talking to a world expert and it's like,

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:23.080
that's it.

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:25.800
And then 50% of the life is up in the canopy.

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:29.320
And so like, we started climbing the trees, like rock climbing,

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:30.600
like what Alex Honnold does.

02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:34.120
Like, well, like I'll climb up 50 feet and then I'll put a safety.

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.240
Like I'm basically trad climbing and then I'll climb up another 50 feet

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:39.560
and I'll have JJ belaying me from below.

02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:40.920
And then he'll be like, Ooh, look, a snake.

02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:43.000
I'm like, JJ, pay attention.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.560
Like you get up there and the, the branches are as thick as this table.

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:49.000
So you can like walk around freely.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:49.480
Oh.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:52.200
It's like total, like avatar when they're in the floating out islands,

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.840
like you can, you can go run around if that's what you want to do.

02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.040
Bromeliads, orchids, cactuses, because up there it's against the sun.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:01.240
So it's a different environment.

02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.040
Oh, wow.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:02.440
Yeah.

02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:02.940
Interesting.

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.160
And then you start seeing lizards and snakes and birds and things

02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:08.680
that aren't down on the ground.

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:12.360
And so how many scientists have actually gotten to

02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:16.280
really spend time up there and really inventory the life.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.520
And that's why when you hear about you like it,

02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:21.480
it's like a taxonomical discussion of how many species they're on earth.

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.040
They're like between, you know, 10 and 30 million.

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:27.400
And it's like, well, that's a big, it's a big swing.

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:30.040
What about stuff on the ground?

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.320
So you mentioned some insects.

02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.280
What about bullet ants?

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:36.200
So it's supposed to be the most painful bite in the world.

02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.360
You've been bitten by one seven or eight times.

02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:38.860
Yeah.

02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:40.360
What does it feel like?

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:40.600
Okay.

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:46.280
So the first time that we ever did bullet ants, JJ said, you know,

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:47.880
okay, this is what we're going to do.

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.640
He goes, you know, it's bullet ant roulette.

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:52.200
We're going to get a bullet ant and you get like chopsticks.

02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.040
You like pick up this bullet ant and they're big.

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:54.920
They're big and they're tough.

02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:59.160
He goes, we're going to put our forearms together

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:03.000
and we're going to drop the bullet ant and clamp our forearms together

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.960
and just rub and whoever it takes, it takes.

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.400
Of course, JJ did not get stung and I did.

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.200
And it hurts every bit as much as they say it hurts.

02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:13.640
It really let me have it.

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:15.960
And then, and then I was like hitting my arm against the table

02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.480
to try and like kill it or get it off.

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:21.240
But it was holding on and just like really injecting the venom.

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.440
And yeah, really letting you have it.

02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:27.960
And then it travels up and it goes into your like lymph nodes

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.040
and into your here and you get a headache.

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:36.040
And I think the brilliant thing about the venom of a bullet ant

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:40.920
is that it makes you feel like this feeling of alarm.

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.760
It makes you feel like something's wrong.

02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:44.760
You don't just go, oh, this hurts.

02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:45.720
Like it's like a bee sting where you go,

02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:48.120
this really hurts on my hand.

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:49.320
It's like, no, no, no, no.

02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:52.280
Your whole nervous system is freaking out

02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.600
and you start sweating and then you get cold and then you're tired

02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.760
and then you get a little blurry vision and it's like,

02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:57.960
and that's actually that bad.

02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:01.160
I mean, now after six or seven, I get bitten and I'm like kind of okay.

02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:04.200
So it's a full body, full mind experience.

02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:05.480
It's a full body, full mind experience.

02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:08.280
But then there's places in the Amazon where they, you know,

02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.600
stick their hand in a glove with like 70 of them.

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.280
And I think Steve-O did that, which I just don't understand

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.000
how you could do that without going into complete anaphylactic shock

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.640
and dying because one really sucks.

02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.640
Well, just like, just like we said with animals and with humans,

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:24.440
there's different kinds.

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:25.320
There's different kinds.

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.560
Steve-O is definitely a special, unique.

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:28.920
The first of his species.

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.920
On the point of un-contacted tribes,

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:46.600
it's interesting to think about what kind of civilizations have there been.

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.240
This is something that you've talked about a little bit.

02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:55.720
Graham Hancock has written about ancient civilizations,

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:59.560
sort of challenging the conventionals, the mainstream thinking about

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.280
the civilizations that have been there in the Amazon.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.840
Can you steel man and criticize the ancient civilizations?

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.200
Can you criticize the idea, so the pro and the con of the idea

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:16.200
that there have been ancient, advanced ancient civilizations in the Amazon?

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.640
Like how much do we know?

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:22.760
What are all the possibilities of what's in the Amazon in this past?

02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:28.040
So like when Oriana went down the Amazon, the reports were that there was

02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:30.280
great civilizations in the Amazon.

02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.480
And then, you know, a few hundred years later when people got to actually

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:35.560
check up on this stuff, it was all gone.

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.840
Because of disease that we wiped out all these civilizations and these

02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:41.800
communities of people potentially, probably.

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:44.040
Was he just wrong?

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:44.760
Probably not.

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.400
This is a guy that navigated by the stars back to Spain

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:48.520
after building his own boat.

02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:52.200
Or did he, you know, or was he trying to just, I don't know, I don't know.

02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:59.160
But there clearly is a long history of complex civilizations in the Amazon.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:18:59.960
Hundred percent.

02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:01.240
There's no one that can deny that.

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:08.920
The thing that I reacted to was that I've heard videos, I've seen moments

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:15.320
in podcasts where the narrative becomes not, there's more ancient civilization

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:18.040
information in the Amazon than we previously thought.

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:19.320
True statement.

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.920
We're discovering with LIDAR, and this is what Graham Hancock is talking about,

02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:27.000
that we're discovering constantly that there was more civilizations than we

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.360
thought in various places.

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:37.640
The place where I take offense is where they start to say that the Amazon,

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:43.480
there's actually articles that are titled this, that the Amazon is a man-made

02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:47.160
garden, which is not true.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.480
Which I think is a really different idea.

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:56.040
The entire ecosystem and everything we've been talking about, all the

02:19:56.120 --> 02:20:01.720
species, all the forestry and the different, just life, life.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:07.640
One of the most diverse ecosystems on earth is initially created by humans.

02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:09.560
It's ridiculous.

02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:14.200
Well, it's not, first of all, it's unlikely, but it's not ridiculous.

02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:22.840
So we can't, there's no ridiculous in science, but the complexity of life

02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:24.440
is very difficult to engineer.

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:28.920
As you, the more you study about biological systems and so on, it's very

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.560
difficult to create the kind of things that nature is able to do.

02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:39.400
That said, I don't know if you've heard, but the entire earth, the world has

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:40.920
gone through a pandemic recently.

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:47.320
And everybody said, of course, it's natural origins, viruses mutate all the time.

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:53.000
And nevertheless, it seems more and more likely that in this particular case,

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:56.200
it was an artificial origin leaked from a lab.

02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:03.000
So humans are able to create stuff, at least modern technological genetic engineering.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.120
Made golden retrievers.

02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:06.140
Come on.

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:09.400
You can't be that nice and that good looking.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:12.120
Used to be a wolf.

02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:12.620
Yeah.

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:18.280
But so that bothers you because it, it allows you to think that we don't need

02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:19.240
to preserve the Amazon.

02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:20.280
We can always engineer it.

02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:21.560
Yeah, exactly.

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.720
Then just, this is just to me, that's a slippery slope.

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:30.120
Like I totally, it's just, it's so quick from, I'm a fan of expeditions to find

02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:34.680
ecological ruins and to learn more about the ancient civilizations too, which I

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:38.760
don't think is what he's putting out is that then sort of like news articles,

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:42.280
which I think they're trying to bait you where they're going, was the Amazon manmade?

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:46.680
And it's like, yeah, you know, because then you get, you're going to get a Brazilian

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:48.600
president to go see, see what they said.

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:49.800
It's manmade.

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:52.520
So we might as well continue to engineer it and manage it.

02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:58.920
And it's like, there's such complex systems and interactions and such a, such a giant

02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:05.960
web of life there that at least in my opinion is clearly one of the most

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:09.080
authentically natural things.

02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:12.760
And again, are there things that we've engineered to the uncontacted tribes?

02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:16.760
Sometimes they, they have banana plants that they've stolen and we could see it

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.920
from the air that they've, they have banana plants.

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:21.400
We made banana plants that's engineered by us.

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:25.160
We know for a fact, so agricultural engineering,

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:29.320
agricultural engineering and stuff like that, but suggesting that the Amazon

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:33.560
basin, you know, it's just, it's just a weird way to think about it.

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:39.320
I've just heard people dismiss the concert, the, the protection of the Amazon

02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:43.320
based on the fact that like, oh, well, if people made it and it's such a giant

02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:49.160
leap from, from, from the, from zero to a hundred, you know, is there slash and

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.080
burn that the ancient civilizations did?

02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.280
Of course.

02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:54.920
Are there areas that were affected by people?

02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:55.960
Of course.

02:22:55.960 --> 02:23:00.520
I just get worried when we start talking about it was a manmade thing.

02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.840
Hear you loud and clear on that.

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:08.920
And I personally think that's completely separate from wondering about what the

02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:11.160
ancient civilization have been able to accomplish.

02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:11.640
Oh, sure.

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:14.920
It's almost really sad because if all the humans on earth die now,

02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:19.880
how long does it take before all signs of humans ever existing disappear?

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:21.800
For the most part.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.200
From an alien perspective.

02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:28.920
What timeline are we talking about?

02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:32.200
I mean, like, I mean, there's, there's a hundred thousand years, like it could be

02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:33.240
less, it could be less.

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:36.680
It could be like a few thousand because a hundred thousand is complete

02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:37.480
destruction.

02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:39.320
A hundred thousand is like nothing.

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:44.360
But, but then it could be in, in just a few hundred years, it starts becoming,

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:48.040
you know, the government of the alien civilization is going to have to pay

02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:52.760
quite a bit of money to do the research because they're going to find other life

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:55.880
first, trying to find the dolphins and the fish and so on.

02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:56.840
They're going to find the trees.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.240
Maybe the trees are the interesting thing.

02:23:59.240 --> 02:23:59.640
Sure.

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.160
The buildings are not that interesting.

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:06.360
Crumbles, but there must be examples of cities that have been left unattended

02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:11.640
for a few decades and like how quickly the, the plants push up through the street

02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:13.160
and everything starts to get broken down.

02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:16.200
If you really look, you'll be like, oh, there's some interesting geometry here

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.320
for the buildings and so on.

02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:22.600
But most, most of the computer stuff, all the stuff of the past hundred years,

02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:27.240
the airplanes, all of that, all the technologies, all of the paperwork that

02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.480
all the hard drives that store all the information.

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:33.880
I want to, I want to actually know how long it takes like a 747 to like biodegrade.

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:38.360
Like how, like if you just leave it there, sitting on the runway, society stops.

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:38.840
Yeah.

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:41.240
How long does it take for that thing to disappear?

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:41.880
Like that's a weird.

02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:46.520
Completely versus to a point where it's unidentifiable might be different.

02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:53.720
But I mean, the point I'm trying to say here is as you've brilliantly put the,

02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:59.720
the Amazon churns and the fact that I wonder throughout its history,

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.040
what are the peaks of the awesomeness?

02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:11.240
Well, how many banana, how many agricultural, Einstein's of bananas were there?

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:15.720
The creating different kinds of ideas, different kinds of geometry, different kinds of tools.

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:17.160
Well, yeah, look what the Incas did.

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.960
I mean, the Incas, you know, Machu Picchu, I mean, when they found,

02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.440
when Hiram Bigham found Machu Picchu, it was covered in jungle.

02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:23.560
You could hardly see it.

02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:28.360
And I mean, the, the stonework they did, much like what the Egyptians did with the pyramids,

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:31.160
a lot of it, we don't really understand how they did it.

02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:35.640
If you come to the jungle, you got to go to Machu Picchu because it's not far from there.

02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:41.640
And I usually like, I'm the person like, I won't, I don't usually go see like the,

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:44.920
you know, like I have never been to see the Taj Mahal after living in India for five years.

02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:48.600
Like, I'm just not, but when you look up and you see Machu Picchu, you go,

02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:54.760
either they were communicating with the gods there or these people were so smart that they

02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:57.800
knew that anybody they brought, they were going to impress.

02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:03.640
They, they've built something there that when you look up at that mountain, you go,

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:11.480
with those giant stones, the beauty of it, you know, it's just, it's just stunning to imagine

02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:14.600
that there was this culture of people that, that could achieve this.

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:18.040
And so through the Amazon, I mean, that's sort of up in the Andes, but

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.080
there's all kinds of stuff in the Amazon.

02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:25.640
There are places where they say there's can pyramids beneath the canopy

02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:30.600
that we just don't know about. I mean, there's, it's endless.

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:37.880
If you had billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, what would be the efforts in the Amazon

02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.600
for the, for both conservation and for exploration?

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:44.680
All right. Well, first thing is tied together.

02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:49.400
Yeah, exactly. First arrest the deforestation. So we don't have an ecological crisis on our hands.

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:53.160
We don't want to keep losing species, losing indigenous cultures, losing the

02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.600
climate stabilizing services that the Amazon provides as a whole.

02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.240
Stop that. That's my first mission. Next, then we can play.

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:07.720
And then it's like, let's go find, I mean, I've flown over the Amazon and assess none.

02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.480
It's like, you see things where you go, we have to go see what that is,

02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.440
you know, weird lakes or, or shapes in the jungle that don't make sense that are,

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:19.320
that are, that are strange. And like,

02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.760
So even at that level, you can see weirdness. You can see different,

02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:23.080
Oh yeah.

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:25.240
Like signs of possible awesomeness.

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.120
Oh, the jungle is so weird. And here's the other thing is that most,

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:33.560
so like the region I've been working in, you see where the researchers go.

02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:37.880
There's certain biological stations, there's certain places where like, oh,

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:42.200
like this university has a relationship with this, this university is this.

02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:47.000
So everybody goes to the same few study sites and then they walk on the same trails and they

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:52.840
have the same guides. When you fly in a Cessna and you fly a few hours away from all that,

02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:58.840
and you see a tiny little tributary and then you fly for 40 minutes over unbroken green,

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:01.160
just wild before you reach another tributary.

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:08.440
Even if somebody could survive going up that tributary had the expeditionary expertise

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:12.760
and the ability to survive getting shot at by arrows, if they could get up that tributary.

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:19.400
Now go cut perpendicular into the jungle, which I don't do on the solos. You can't,

02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:25.320
you can never don't ever leave the river. But you're telling me that in that span of 70 miles

02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:31.160
between tiny tributaries at the edge of the world, no one's been there. None of us have been there.

02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:36.360
Maybe somebody 10,000 years ago was there, but we don't know what populations of things are there.

02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:41.400
We don't know what ruins are there. And so there's so much undiscovered stuff in the

02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:48.520
Amazon that is just waiting, just waiting. What is the process of exploring that? So

02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:55.320
how does money get converted towards exploration? Is there safe ways of doing that?

02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:00.680
There's places where, you know, we found out about things that have to be explored,

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:05.320
but where you come up with, well, how do we do this without getting shot?

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:09.480
And not only without getting shot, but also without endangering them too.

02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.680
Because how stupid are we if we go in there to people that are living in the jungle,

02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:19.160
not bothering us, and we go insert ourselves into there because we're curious about some rocks.

02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.840
That doesn't seem fair for the loss of life. And so like,

02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:27.960
yeah, that's something that we're working on. And like one thing of course is like

02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:33.480
LIDAR and stuff, but eventually at the end of everything, it comes down to boots on the ground.

02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:39.720
As somebody who has to ask that very question about how to deal with uncontacted tribes,

02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:44.440
they're going to kill you. But you also don't want to disturb their environment.

02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:51.640
If you were an intelligent alien civilization, oh boy, and you came about Earth,

02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:58.760
how would you interact with it? Can you put yourself in the mind of an alien civilization?

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:01.880
Because there seems to be some parallels here.

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.560
It is actually, right. It's like a microcosm of-

02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:11.080
We're very aggressive. Human civilization is very aggressive. So if we were easily,

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:18.360
we get threatened easily for stupid reasons because we start like American military probably

02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:24.520
thinks it's like the Chinese or the Russians. If we see any kind of flying objects, it gets very

02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:29.800
on edge. I don't know. I mean, cause you know, part of it is like, you just want to ask. Like

02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:33.560
that's the thing. I just want to ask questions. Yeah. But you don't know the same language.

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.200
Which you're going to get. First of all, you send a boat of bananas.

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:40.600
You send a boat of bananas, you get shot. I mean, picture if aliens landed in New York,

02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:45.400
how long would it take for one of them to get shot? So it'd be minutes. It'd be a matter of

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:50.120
minutes. Yeah. That's cause it's New York. Everywhere else. Look where we are right now.

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:58.840
That's true. It'd be even worse here. Yeah. It makes me wonder what is the right way to interact

02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:07.000
with intelligent life that's not like our own. I hope, I dream of in our lifetime, we would

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:15.240
interact with possibly life on Mars or on one of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn. And like,

02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:19.880
how do you interact with that thing? Well, there's very technical, biological, chemical

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:24.680
processes, but also if there's any kind of intelligence, how do you try to communicate

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:27.800
with that intelligence? Yeah. So we're not talking about like a cockroach. We're talking

02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:32.280
about like something that's clearly like doing things, making things. Well, cockroach possibly.

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.000
How do you know the difference between a cockroach? Like, how do you know? We were

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.080
just talking about developments. Yeah. We don't know. We don't know. We have-

02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:42.600
Just like a race of like philosopher cockroaches, just chilling on the rocks.

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:48.360
Well, here on earth, we kind of, there seems to be a strong correlation between size and intelligence.

02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:49.960
Like- Yes.

02:31:50.680 --> 02:31:56.120
It seems like the bigger things have bigger nervous systems and brains and so they're usually

02:31:56.120 --> 02:32:01.800
smarter. Well, that doesn't- I think it's brain, it's the ratio, brain to body.

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:06.040
Sure. Because you have like crows that are up among the most intelligent and it's like the

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:10.680
size of the brain to the size of the body. But there also could be kinds of intelligence

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:12.600
where we're completely- No idea.

02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:17.000
We're not appreciating. Maybe cockroaches. It survived the longest. They're talking

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.680
shit about us right now, dumb humans. They're like, dude, these rocks are so great.

02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:27.320
Couple of hundred years. Exactly. Did you ever hear that Kurt Vonnegut

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:31.960
where the two space travelers get lost? This really impacted me as a kid because my dad

02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:37.880
was an English teacher. So he's always quoting Dostoyevsky and Kurt Vonnegut. And there's this,

02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:43.400
two space travelers get like crash landed in a cave. And on the walls of the cave are the

02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:48.280
harmoniums. And there's these kite shaped animals and they feed off the vibrations of the cave.

02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:52.280
And that's all they do. They don't hurt each other. They just do that. And so for like two

02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:56.600
years, these travelers are stuck and they're trying to fix their ship. And one of them starts

02:32:56.600 --> 02:33:02.280
playing music for the harmoniums and the harmoniums love him for the music and they all come around

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:06.760
him and, and he plays this music for him. And finally they, they fixed the ship

02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:11.800
and then the one guy is like, all right, let's, let's get out of here. And the other guy's like,

02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:19.080
you know what? I'm staying. He goes, I found a place where I can do good. I'm not hurting anybody

02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:24.920
and they love me. I'm staying right here. Yeah. This whole ambition thing we've got going on,

02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:30.600
always try to build a bigger boat, bigger thing. That might not be the ultimate

02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:38.360
conclusion of a, of a happy existence as a civilization. That's probably, that's one of

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:44.040
the possibilities why we haven't met the aliens yet at scale. It's cause there, once you get

02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:50.040
good enough at technology, you realize that happiness lies in a peaceful coexistence. It's

02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:57.000
possible. So where do you stand on like aliens now? Like there's a lot coming out about the,

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.320
the pilots and the, the things people have been seeing. And again, like I kind of come in and

02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:04.840
out of this stuff, like I'll be in the jungle for three months. I miss, I miss a lot. So like

02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:09.800
update me like, or, or are we, are we being contacted right now? Like, of course nobody

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:16.040
knows, but I tend to believe my intuition says is there's aliens everywhere that the, the,

02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:24.840
our, even our galaxy. Sure. That's a bigger leap, but I believe our galaxy has probably billions,

02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:33.160
hundreds of millions of planets with life on it, like bacteria type of life. Sure. And I believe

02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:41.720
there is, I don't know, thousands of alien civil, intelligent alien civilizations that exist or have

02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.760
existed. The problem is there's a lot of time and it's very difficult to contact each other.

02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:55.480
So to achieve a kind of civilization that's able to actually send out enough signal or

02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:00.120
radiate enough energy where we would notice, I think that's really tough.

02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:05.880
That said, statistically speaking, it seems like that should have been possible inside our galaxy

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:19.000
or maybe nearby. And so I suspect that once an alien civilization is just many orders of magnitude

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:25.880
smarter than us humans, the way it would contact us is going to be very difficult for us humans to

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:33.160
understand. We're very egocentric. We want the message to be sent as like a, in English

02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:39.080
versus, you know, I think consciousness itself, emotion,

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:53.080
thoughts could be like fingertips, could be words in the story that the aliens are telling us

02:35:53.880 --> 02:36:00.920
or things that are just like a low dimensional projection of a much higher dimensional message

02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:06.920
that's being sent by aliens. And it may be our striving to create technology is to create the

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:11.480
kind of sensor that's actually able to hear some of the message. Maybe that's what AI is trying to

02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:18.440
do. So I think that bridging that barrier of communication between us and cockroaches,

02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:23.960
I think that's the biggest challenge. Interesting. Like the messages are all around us. They're here.

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:30.760
I suspect the alien messages are here. The aliens are here. We're just too dumb to see it.

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:39.080
So first of all, the imagining planets where there are, like just picturing like not a silent

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:45.080
planet, but just like a planet of alternate life forms. Maybe it's not something that we

02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:49.560
can communicate and have a conversation with, but just like a planet of like butterflies and

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:54.520
centipedes and weird, you know, unfortunate bacteria for billions of years, it was

02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:02.520
bacteria as a single cell prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but they're not, they're boring.

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:08.040
But yeah, but animals, animals of some sort in an environment of some sort, imagine that would just

02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:13.240
be such an interesting, beautiful, amazing thing. And I'm sure they're out of that. I'm yeah,

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:21.640
the kind of viruses they got going on. But they could also not be biologically based.

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:24.920
That could be different chemistry. So you have to be humble to that too. Sure.

02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:31.160
But then, you know, it depends on the day. Like I think you caught me on that day today,

02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:38.680
an optimistic one. Sometimes I think we're all we, this is all there is because you start,

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:41.960
you ask that question that the Fermi paradox, like why aren't they here?

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:48.360
You can't imagine an advanced alien civilization that would not be explorers because we're explorers.

02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:56.200
Why is that depressing to you that the idea that, that let's just say you found out right now that

02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:02.840
there isn't anything else. Let's just say that for, for example sake, that the earth is the earth

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:06.360
and the universe is the universe. And it's sort of like the backdrop of a video game.

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:11.560
And it's just what's out there. Would that be tremendously depressing to you?

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:16.120
I think it's exciting for an engineer. It's probably exciting for an explorer,

02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:21.320
but I would equate that to your going out hiking for three days with one match.

02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:28.600
It kind of terrifies me that we only got one match. Really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. One,

02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:33.960
all you got is one match. This, no, no, no. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Wait,

02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:41.160
Paul, wait, wait a minute. You're going to, there's no more matches. But this is the only match you

02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:44.600
got. No one's going to extinguish the planet. Like there's not, as far as we know, there's no,

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:48.280
there's no meteor coming. I'm saying like, do you live in a, so I'm saying is that,

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:54.120
is your worry then that we need to have a backup plan? Yeah. Really? Well, there has,

02:38:54.120 --> 02:39:00.040
so like, what if we do, what if we do mess it up so bad that we can't live here anymore? Well,

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:04.840
there's different ways to mess it up. There's ways to mess it up to make life really difficult.

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:13.400
Mad Max type of thing. But there's nuclear war. Yes. With the further and further advancement

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:18.840
of technology that can destroy all of Earth. It just feels like that's going to be exponentially

02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:28.200
growing. Yes. It's going to get worse. And that it's, listen, I'm very optimistic,

02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:34.200
but it's a heck of a Russian roulette we're playing. Okay. So I'm still curious about your

02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:40.840
intention though, or like where your passion for this comes from. Are you, is your, or maybe

02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:47.320
it's both, but is it the need to have a backup plan for humans, which is admirable for your

02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.680
intense love of humanity and our consciousness and love and art and everything? Or is it also

02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:59.160
just the raw fascination of imagining what's out there? Because I just, the way you said that

02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:04.040
about like, oh, you caught me on a positive day where I think it's, there was something in there

02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:16.680
that made me think that you need there to be. Yeah. Yeah. There's, I think I'm the kind of

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:22.040
person that sees beauty and everything, but to me, a universe full of diverse life

02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:29.800
is more beautiful than one where it's just humans. It's just the Earth life. Interesting.

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:35.800
There's more beauty. I mean, I'm not egotistical about the awesomeness of humans. I like

02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:44.680
if humans are not the smartest in our galaxy, or not even close to being the smartest.

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:52.520
And that to me is, I don't know, that to me is exciting about the possibility of what the

02:40:52.520 --> 02:41:00.360
universe can create. Yes. I'm with you on that, that it's wildly exciting to, like if we found,

02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:05.640
even if it was just a distant inkling, that we found out that there is a planet that has life,

02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:09.560
there's no communication coming from it, but we know for a fact there's stuff going on there.

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:13.400
It would just change how we think about our entire reality. We know now.

02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:19.960
And it could be, to me, I guess the little inkling of the thing that is depressing,

02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:29.880
if all there is is Earth and humans destroy it, then we're the coolest thing that the universe

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:37.000
has ever created. It's over. I'm interested to have this conversation. I'm really, I'm saying,

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:44.440
I would be interested to bring you to the jungle. And now I'm also wondering, I'm wondering what

02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:51.960
your wilderness experience is, because I feel like for me, I'm so Earth-centric to the point

02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:57.960
where I'm like, we differ in that. For me, this is like, it's a curiosity. I feel wonder and I feel

02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:03.400
it's fun to talk about what's at the edge of space. There's the conundrums of space time.

02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:10.040
But I'm so, to me, I'm like, what if the aliens are watching us or what if the aliens aren't

02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:17.320
watching us, but what if the challenge here is we've been put on Earth as the most intellectually

02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:24.200
complex of these creatures and we're being observed to see how we manage it. And it's like,

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:32.120
we haven't made a good job of managing each other. Before Oriana went down the Amazon,

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:37.560
I mean, they showed up and just sacked the Incas. I mean, our history, I don't have to tell you,

02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:47.800
you just got back. But sometimes I wonder, is there a grand narrative with what we're doing

02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:52.280
to wildlife? Because it's like, we have all these other species and we're struggling even here in

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:58.760
this conversation to sort of quantify. I think that most people don't think outside of the human

02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:04.520
framework. Just driving around, for me, living outside of the jungle, even just for a few weeks,

02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:11.480
you don't even think about the fact that there's other species around us. We really don't day to

02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:17.720
day. You look at TV and you listen to the radio and it's not very consequential to the average

02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.240
person living in a city that there are these islands covered in walruses and that there's

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.360
rainforests filled with birds and frogs and all these things happening and that

02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:35.720
the salmon are contributing to our fresh water and that life is literally given to us and made

02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:42.600
possible by these ecological systems. To me, that's where the whole essence of my existence comes

02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:49.880
from. Yeah, thank you for that reminder because you're basically saying the alien civilizations

02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:57.640
you dream about are here on earth. Those worlds are here. For me, yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with you.

02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:06.760
I think that's actually the way I think most of the time. I think I'm on mushrooms all the time,

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:13.160
genetically somehow, because when I go out in nature, it's just the beauty, even if you talk

02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:22.520
about the Amazon, man, just basics of nature fill me with awe. The other thing that fills me with awe

02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:31.400
is our own mind, like the biology of these things firing. Basically, not our own mind, but

02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:38.280
biology of any living organisms because it's like an ecosystem. These cells came together,

02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:45.800
somehow function, they delegate, they mostly operate in a local way, but first of all,

02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:49.720
it's just like you said with the anacondas, you start out as a tiny snake and you become giant.

02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.640
When you're a tiny snake, you're prey for everything. When you're a giant snake,

02:44:53.640 --> 02:45:00.440
you're a predator or you're prey to no one. Just that whole process, starting with a single embryo,

02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:06.600
single cells, human, and through the embryogenic process constructing this giant human that's able

02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:13.400
to have limbs, move about the world, think about things, write books and so on. That is

02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:20.680
incredibly beautiful and all of that is here on earth, yes. Actually, being sort of poetic

02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:28.520
about aliens and so on, I think I can spend 99.99% in terms of filling my mind with awe

02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:33.000
and beauty just looking down here on earth, for sure. I agree with you.

02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:38.600
They shouldn't cancel out. I think it's beautiful that there's people that are fascinated and

02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:45.400
obsessed with looking out into space and that will travel there. Just to me, the idea of,

02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:50.760
I have a little piece of meteorite at home that I hold and it does amazing things to my mind

02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:54.920
because I'm like, everything I've ever touched is from this earth and I'm holding this thing

02:45:54.920 --> 02:46:00.600
that's been places that we can't even think about. It blows my mind and I love it, but when it comes

02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:07.960
to intelligence, I think it's like, I'm so concerned with the fact that we're at this

02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:13.240
moment in history and it's interesting to me that we had the internet and now that with the

02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:19.720
emergence of AI and more and more, I feel like we are starting to resemble like an ant colony

02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:23.480
where there's more and more connection and there's more and more interaction globally

02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:27.480
between everybody. In the next 10 years, we're going to have to decide, are we going to let

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:32.120
our ocean ecosystems just collapse? Are we going to just take that 3% of rainforest and just let

02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.120
them log the shit out of it until it's gone? And it's like, we're going to be in a very different

02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:43.560
reality then. Then it's going to be very dystopian future. Or can we keep the good things about earth,

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:49.000
transcend that, realize that we have these incredible alien species around us that are

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.920
animals that we grew up with, that we wouldn't be here without, that we owe something to?

02:46:53.880 --> 02:47:00.600
And I feel like at that stage, then the outward look becomes something else. It's almost like

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:06.920
we've proven that if aliens came up to us, that's when I'd feel good. Aliens would come up to us

02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:10.760
and they said, you know, Louis has the thing where he goes, God comes back and he goes,

02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:17.400
what did you do? He goes, the polar bears are brown. He's like, I left food for you. It's like,

02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.840
if the aliens came and were like, you know, and they interviewed the elephants and they said,

02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:24.680
how are you feeling? And the elephants would be like, listen, fuck these little primates.

02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:29.640
You know what they've done to us? And it's like, I mean, you know, I've seen people break an

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:35.640
elephant. I've seen it all with that stuff. And it's like, if anybody was to ask them,

02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:45.560
they'd be screaming. And so like to me, it's just, you know, I have trouble looking out into space.

02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:50.040
I have trouble looking out into normal life as a human because I'm so concerned with trying to make

02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:54.200
sure that they're okay because not enough people are doing that. Well, the interesting thing about

02:47:54.200 --> 02:48:00.200
all the development with AI and just that we're living more and more of our life online, I think

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:11.960
we're actually learning what's missing when it's online. Like, I think people realize that online

02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:17.320
interaction is shallow, but we're just learning that that's a reality. Yeah. That we need that

02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:23.160
human connection. And I think there's going to be the swing back to like, sadly, AI systems of the

02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:29.720
future might be able to live fulfilling lives online, but us humans have to have a deep

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.840
connection with earth and like with each other, physical connection. I think there's going to be

02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:40.600
a phase somewhere in the century where we go back to deep physical connection and there'll be a

02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:46.760
digital world that we visit, that it would be separate. And that's the, you have a discussion

02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:52.520
with that with Twitter, with Instagram, with all of these social networks that they don't, they seem

02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:57.240
to be dividing us. They seem to not be bringing happiness and you have to try to figure out like,

02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:06.200
okay, so how do we use them in a way that does connect us, does educate us, grow our knowledge

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:12.680
base, but also keeps us, keeps our lives fulfilling in a deep human way that we're

02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:19.640
for good and for bad, genetically designed. We can't overcome, but we can't escape these meat

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:25.480
vehicles. Yeah, but that's, to me, that's so reassuring. Yeah. It's like when you would like

02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:28.360
I have, you know, we all have those friends that are like, you know, we got to live forever. And

02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:32.680
it's like, I don't know, man, do you? Yeah. I don't know. Is it that bad that this is how it works?

02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:38.280
Like that we don't understand it. Yeah. The, it's often from the tech sector,

02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:44.440
the discussions about immortality and so on. I think that's somehow trying to escape the beauty

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:52.200
of this earth for sure. That there's something to look at. Like, yeah. And I, I, I perhaps like you,

02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:58.360
I'm worried about the unintended negative consequences of trying to escape the way things

02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:03.560
are on this earth, because this is an incredible mechanism. How many times in the past has new

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:07.960
technology come out that people have hailed as, you know, blasphemy or it's not going to work or

02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:13.640
it's, it goes against nature and, and now, well, heart transplants are pretty cool. Yeah. You know,

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.200
and, and you could say what you want about like television and like, oh, it's, you know, it rots

02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:22.520
your brain. It's like, yeah, but also how many times have you sat in a room full of people being

02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:26.600
entertained and all laughing and interacting and eating popcorn because of the televisions there?

02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:32.680
It's not one or the other. And so I feel like with AI, we'll, we'll learn, we'll learn our way

02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:38.680
through it. You know, there's a, like with the, with the legged robots, especially and humanoid

02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:44.840
also. So anything on legs, four legs or two legs. I remember like the first time I interact,

02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:51.720
interacted with a legged robot. I saw a magic there. Like

02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:59.000
that this too can have consciousness. This too can have this lifelike quality

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:06.360
that a human being loves about other human beings, about other living creatures. Now,

02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:10.760
while I'm still, I grew up in the place with no internet in a time with no internet.

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:18.760
So I still like biological dogs better. I'm, I noticed the magic in robotic dogs.

02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:23.800
Yeah. And it makes me wonder the way same way. We're just talking about aliens looking up. It

02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:29.960
makes you wonder about other alien civilizations. Now the deep love is for dogs, for other humans,

02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:38.120
but there's still this wander. I struggle with that. Like you said, the, the, whatever's going on

02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:43.560
in here, the idea, and there's so much talk about the fact, like at what point does an artificially

02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:48.600
intelligent robot become something that has, and it's like, I get, I get very uncomfortable

02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:54.280
with that. It makes me, I don't know how to, how to handle the things. Cause I don't know enough

02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:57.080
about it probably, but it's like, I don't know how to handle like,

02:51:57.080 --> 02:52:03.080
I don't know how to handle it either. Nobody knows anything about it because the, it's really,

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:10.600
everything is terrifying here. Cause it could be as simple as consciousness is easy to fake.

02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:16.280
So what if you live in a, in a world 10 to 20 years from now, where your toaster,

02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:21.960
there's a bunch of robots in your room that are faking consciousness. And then you fall in love

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:24.840
with them and you have a deep connection with them. And then you actually have a deeper

02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.800
connection with your toaster than you do with any romantic human partner you've ever had.

02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:33.560
And you start to, I was, I was upset about the dogs.

02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:41.400
I was like, at least the robot doesn't take a shit on the floor. I was like,

02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:46.840
you just, you just took it way worse. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, and then they, they start to,

02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:52.040
I don't know if you've seen AI porn, but it gets pretty intense.

02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:56.040
Like fully AI porn. Like they're, they're fake people.

02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:01.000
Fake people that can, uh, things I've missed in the jungle.

02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:07.640
Things. Boy, do I have a lot to show you or not show you, not show you.

02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:17.080
Let me ask you about a touchy topic. Uh, climate change. What's the effect of climate change

02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:23.400
on the, uh, on the Amazon, maybe species diversity. What, what, what is something

02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:30.680
that people should, should think about? Because there's different views on, um, I think most

02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:37.640
people believe that climate change is human caused and that it's happening, but there is

02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:45.800
different perspectives on the degree of damage that it's going to do over the next several decades

02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:53.480
and what our response should be as a society. And so it would be amazing to hear your perspective

02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:58.120
on it in small slices of your experience or enlarge.

02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:05.800
To me, there's no denying the fact that we are experiencing changes. I think anybody that,

02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:08.760
that doesn't agree with that hasn't been outside in the last 20 years

02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:13.640
or has an interviewed old farmers who will tell you that it changed or, you know,

02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:19.400
it's that I think a lot of us can agree with that. Where I deviate is that I am not a climate

02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:26.040
scientist. I am, I am not qualified. And so I just like everybody else am listening.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:33.000
And what happens to me is I see that the, someone like Santiago Durán, JJ's father will,

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.320
will tell me it's totally different than it was when I was a kid. The seasons have

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:42.200
changed and moved and like in New York, when I was a kid, like we used to get like

02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:47.480
white Christmas, like we used to get snow. We don't, I was in shorts, like I came off

02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:50.680
the plane right before coming here and I was in like shorts for a second. Like I was like,

02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:58.200
this is a different reality, but my ability could my, or my, my interpretation of climate change,

02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:02.440
you know, I feel like it's just as dumb as those people that go like, you know,

02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:06.280
it's really cold. I thought they said it was getting warmer. It's like, it's,

02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:11.960
it's a very rudimentary thing. And so as a, as a someone that's fighting for the preservation

02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:20.440
of biodiversity, I, I, I don't feel like I'm any more qualified than the average person to,

02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:24.520
I can only provide anecdotal, anecdotal evidence of the stuff I've seen. What I,

02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:28.600
what I do do though, and I always, I always make a strong delineation here is that

02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:34.440
I can speak to the fact that I've been places where the ocean fisheries have been depleted

02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:39.240
and the local fishermen can tell you and the scientists can tell you there's no more fish

02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:44.680
here. I've been to the places where the rainforest line is being pushed back in Borneo and it's

02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:49.400
getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And I've been in the Amazon and I've walked through the

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:56.280
killing fields and through the fires and I've burnt my lungs on it. And, and I'm a big believer

02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:04.840
personally. And instead of trying to take on all of it, I've tried very hard in my life to pick

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:11.080
one thing. And to me, that one thing is protecting as many wild heartbeats as I can

02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:16.680
because they're under constant fire. And so climate change, you know, there's so much

02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:22.920
arguing over it. And, and like you said, the degree to which we, we affect it and, and,

02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:28.440
and, and how do you, you know what I mean? Like I like to have provable data points. Like,

02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.680
you know, I can show you tropical deforestation. I can show you the decline in tigers over the

02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:37.240
last hundred years. I can't prove, you know what I mean? Like I can't answer that question. I

02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:43.080
don't think probably you can better than I can. No, I think one of the criticism I'd love to get

02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:49.160
your opinion on is one of the criticisms that somebody like Jordan Peterson provides is that

02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:58.280
the climate is such a complex system. There's so many variables that making conclusive statements

02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:03.640
about what's going to happen with the quote unquote climate in the next 10, 20, 50 years

02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:14.280
is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, as he would say, as people like Bjorn Lombard would say,

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.560
the kind of fear mongering that is done saying we should spend humongous amounts of money to

02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:27.960
change the trajectory of everything we're doing in terms of energy, in terms of infrastructure

02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:33.720
and so on, in terms of how we allocate money is not justified because predicting is very difficult.

02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:41.000
And instead, it's better exactly what you're saying, which is focusing on local saying

02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:49.080
we need to protect the Amazon. What are the things attacking the Amazon this year? In the next five

02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:55.560
years, how can we stop the deforestation? How can we stop different things? And then humans are

02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:01.640
exceptionally good at coming up with solutions for that, especially when you put money behind it,

02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:06.520
you put attention to it, and that's the way we solve all the different problems that are

02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:15.480
projected for the climate change in its worst-case scenarios to be realized on this Earth. So that's

02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:20.760
kind of the case he would make. And I should also mention that one of the reasons I was fortunate

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:26.760
enough to discover your work is first a friend mentioned that I should definitely talk to you

02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:31.720
and I Googled you and I saw that somebody recommended that Jordan Peterson absolutely

02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:35.880
must talk to you on his podcast. Wow. I think it was like a Reddit post.

02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:40.920
Thank you for Reddit poster. That's great. I was like, oh, interesting. And then I looked

02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:49.560
and Jordan hasn't yet. My goal is for you to talk to Rogan and to Jordan Peterson for different

02:58:49.560 --> 02:58:54.520
reasons, but for the same reason, they get connected to a human being that deeply cares

02:58:54.520 --> 02:59:00.360
about this Earth. And I think that's probably the right lens through which to look at the effects

02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:06.680
of climate change in terms of focusing on the different things that are threatening the diversity

02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:13.480
of species in this most magical place on Earth, which is the Amazon, but also as you talk about

02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:18.680
with elephants and tigers in India and focusing on how to solve those problems. I don't know if

02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:24.520
there's any comment you want to make on folks like Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising

02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:30.120
questions about how much do we really understand about the climate? First of all, I'm such a Jordan

02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:36.600
Peterson fan and I think the guy is heroic for a number of reasons and I find his use of language

02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:42.680
and his use of theology and the message that he puts out wonderful. I cringe a little bit when

02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:47.080
he says, I feel like, and I might not even be accurate on this, but I cringe a little bit when

02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:53.880
I feel like he dismisses that there is an ecological emergency happening right now.

02:59:54.760 --> 03:00:00.200
I'm not talking about climate change specifically, but I've heard him say environmentalists upset

03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:03.640
me and he goes, well, what do you mean by the environment? Everything. And it sort of seems

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:11.160
to outrage him and I kind of agree with him there because, so are you telling me that we need to

03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:16.840
halt our global process and progress and economies and everything? I don't know. I don't know.

03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:25.480
So to me, that doesn't bother me because he's exploring what the hell are these people talking

03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:32.360
about. When you say, I personally have friends and students and people filling my inboxes. I

03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:37.960
have young kids telling me that they've become vegan and they ride a bicycle and sometimes they

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:44.040
don't watch TV because it uses electricity. They're just becoming so terrified of that

03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:49.400
they're killing the earth. And so it's this doomsday anti-human sentimentist thing that we're

03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:57.960
evil. It's almost like a new religion about your evil. And so to me, it almost makes me

03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:04.760
in a totally different camp where climate change and the right left politics and I considered a

03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:10.680
family, I considered Thanksgiving dinner and listened to the climate thing go back and forth.

03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:15.240
And I'm like, I'm not even here. And that might actually annoy some people

03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:21.000
in the environmental field that might feel betrayed by me saying that, but I don't care.

03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:26.840
My job, and it's not just the Amazon. And that's one note I wanted to make is that

03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:34.360
my career has taken place largely in the Amazon and also in India and now a lot in Africa.

03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:40.360
But it's not even just these exotic places either. It's people realizing that the salmon

03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:45.640
runs in Canada and the butterfly gardens in our backyards that there's biodiversity everywhere.

03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:55.160
And I strongly feel like the idea of jungle keepers, the idea of stewards of nature. And so

03:01:55.160 --> 03:02:01.080
for me, my job, my one thing, and I try to tell this to these kids that message me and that my

03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:06.280
inboxes are full of this where they go, the climate is burning and elephants are in decline

03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:12.040
and tigers and this and that. Guys, look, first of all, calm down. First of all, go outside,

03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:18.600
go get laid, do something, have fun. Next, pick something that you can affect. And it doesn't

03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:24.360
have to be with the environment. Do something good on earth. Go help somebody that needs food.

03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:30.920
Go help your elderly neighbor, whatever it is. Practice with being effective at one thing,

03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:36.280
at a time. And so for me, like I said, from those early days of sitting there with JJ on the side

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:44.360
of a river and going, someone has to protect this. My concern is that we've lost 70% of the

03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:49.400
wildlife on this planet in the last 50 years. That's a huge problem. Wildlife maintain the

03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:55.560
ecosystems. And so I have a very clear cut, very definable, very measurable and provable thing that

03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:02.680
I'm fighting against. And to me, it's a very small ask. Don't cut down the 3% of the world that has

03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.560
50% of the biodiversity in it. Maybe let's keep some wild tigers for future generations. And

03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:12.680
because tigers have their own inherent right to exist here. That's my thing. In terms of when we

03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:23.720
get to, I get attacked for, you should be a vegan. You have me roll into a village in the Amazon when

03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.640
they offer me spider monkey and you tell me that I should be a vegan and you see how much they

03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:33.560
respect you and you tell them that you're a vegan. But no, so for someone like Peterson,

03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:37.480
I think it's actually good that he's, first of all, telling everyone to make their damn beds

03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:44.040
and exploring it through a different lens. He's coming at it from a totally different

03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:52.200
thing and saying, are we just being alarmist here? I mean, again, imagine if there

03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:57.240
isn't a problem and they're making one out of it and all the implications that that could have

03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:02.840
for progress. So I think what he's doing is perfectly reasonable. There is a podcast though

03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:10.600
where he's, it was a great one though, where he's discussing animal intelligence. And I could really

03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:19.400
see that the human psyche and theology and religion is so much his world that really the idea of

03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.800
animals being intelligent was novel and it was fascinating.

03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:29.000
Yeah, that's why I would love for the two of you to talk. Just, I don't know, and hopefully I'm

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:39.880
not on a line here, but he is so focused on the human mind that I think he forgets that there's

03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:48.200
other life out there. There's this whole machine of intelligence, of a kind of intelligence out

03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:59.240
there, this entire trillions of species, tiny and big, just moving everywhere. And we're actually

03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:06.040
part of it. So to look at human psychology as distinct from that is missing at least some of

03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:11.000
the picture. Some of the picture. I do believe though, I would agree with him on that humans are

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:18.040
unique. Human psychology is unique. We just are. But he's in such an interesting

03:05:19.560 --> 03:05:25.960
place because usually you have environmentalists who are like nature, nature, nature, and then

03:05:25.960 --> 03:05:32.360
it's very anti-human. And then you have the other side and it's like he's on this path where he's

03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:39.000
starting to explore what those diverse intelligences mean. And that to me is really amazing because I

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:44.520
love hearing what he'll do with that. And I think also on top of that, I think if you're aware of

03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:50.280
nature, deeply aware of nature, it gives you another perspective on the evolutionary history

03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:57.320
of humans. It's one thing to be an evolutionary biologist and kind of study it from a philosophical

03:05:57.320 --> 03:06:02.360
perspective and it's the other to really, I think, experience it and deeply know it to see, I don't

03:06:02.360 --> 03:06:09.640
know, the fact that we came from fish and really be cognizant of that, that's something else.

03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:16.440
That's like, I don't know, to realize that we're part of a computing machine that created

03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:23.080
intelligence. We're part of the thing that started Bacteria and is now creating AI

03:06:24.120 --> 03:06:29.720
and I don't know, Dunkin Donuts. I don't know what else is impressive.

03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:31.000
The other great human achievements.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.040
He's the other great human. I was thinking, well, what's interesting about Boston?

03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:39.160
But I feel like we keep scratching up against this thing in this conversation that it's so

03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:44.120
easy. I think something like 50 or more percent of the humans on this planet live in cities

03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:51.880
and I think it's so easy for people to forget that we share this planet with so many other

03:06:52.440 --> 03:07:01.000
things and I think that we're in a way, we're almost like ecological orphans and that we've

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:07.880
left the things that actually make us feel at home and that's a bit of a stretch because I don't know

03:07:07.880 --> 03:07:13.080
if everybody feels that way. But for me, professionally as an expedition guide,

03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:18.120
when I take people into nature, I see what happens to them and they leave going, I mean,

03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:22.920
it doesn't have to be the Amazon. It could be Upstate New York, but it's like if you do it

03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:28.840
the right way, if you remove the fear of breaking an ankle, seeing a snake, being bitten by a

03:07:28.840 --> 03:07:33.960
mosquito, all that stuff, if you can get people to a peaceful moment and you're fly fishing,

03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.960
a lot of times they'll take that moment and they'll talk about it the rest of their life.

03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:42.360
If they don't live in that, then there's those of us who spend our lives doing that, but

03:07:42.360 --> 03:07:45.800
for a reason, because it's the only place we feel sane.

03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:50.920
And you were kind enough to suggest that we might travel together for a time at some point.

03:07:51.880 --> 03:07:56.680
If we do that, if we journey together, where would you recommend we should go?

03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:02.840
So what I would want to show you is sort of, I'd want to take you to church, I'd want to take you

03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:13.000
to see the giant trees, take you to meet the old gods, really. There's places when you walk in

03:08:13.320 --> 03:08:19.160
off the river that are so deep in the forest. And again, now we do this, we have the boats,

03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:25.400
we have the rangers, we protect this ecological corridor now. And so it would be taking you to

03:08:25.400 --> 03:08:29.720
meet some of those loggers that we converted. It would be taking you, we'd have to go to the

03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:37.160
floating forest, meet some of the trees that I love the most, go piranha fishing and really just

03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:47.960
spend, my ideal trip for you would be to spend five days of airplane mode phone,

03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:54.680
completely living out, comfortable. I'm not saying I don't want to torture you, I'm saying

03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:59.160
go and live comfortably on an expedition in the Amazon. And that means a few days at this

03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:04.040
research station, maybe go up river three days and camp up here just on the edge of where the

03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:09.080
uncontacted are and then come back and then see the jungle keeper station. But along the way,

03:09:09.080 --> 03:09:13.560
seeing all the special sacred places, it would be almost like saying like, let's go see

03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:19.880
all the treasures of Italy. It's like, this is one of the most beautiful things on earth

03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:25.960
and I've had the incredible, almost unbelievable fortune to be responsible for protecting it.

03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:32.680
I think it's a privilege to be able to share that with people.

03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:41.480
To be able to witness what this earth has created. It's been just a gift just even

03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:47.800
to follow your Instagram. The window you create on this part of the world

03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:52.200
is just really beautiful. I do want to ask on that,

03:09:55.240 --> 03:10:00.280
maybe it's like behind the scenes a little bit, but how do you keep the equipment dry?

03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:09.320
How do you, how hard is bringing equipment to the cameras? You're an incredible filmmaker

03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:14.760
and photographer. So how do you make it work? I don't know. It's not that hard. It's not that

03:10:14.760 --> 03:10:20.920
bad. It is wet. The new iPhones are waterproof and if they don't get, I'm telling you, dude,

03:10:20.920 --> 03:10:25.800
it's been such a weapon. It's been awesome. If you drop it in the river, my one thing is you

03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:30.040
got to have a tether because I drop it all the time. And so I'll be hanging off a boat

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:33.080
and I'll be trying to take a video and I'll be like, here we are in the Amazon and you can

03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:41.160
see the line and that's the biggest thing. But we shoot on cannons and I don't know,

03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:44.600
it's worked out. It's not that bad. Oh really? So you can keep the equipment dry.

03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:48.680
I keep the equipment dry and I actually don't, a lot of people put their shit in silica at night

03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:53.560
and like keep it dry and then they take it out. And I find that when you do that, the temperature

03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:58.200
change creates moisture inside the camera. So what I do is I never do that.

03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:04.440
I just keep my cameras in my backpack with a zipper so they're more or less exposed to the

03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:11.320
elements. And so it sort of always has a little bit of equilibrium and that's it. I mean, I shoot

03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:16.520
on some pretty fancy equipment sometimes and it's great. But I mean, the awesome thing though now is

03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:23.800
that like with a cell phone, I mean, like I like put my phone down on the ground a few weeks ago

03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:27.960
and like let this rhino like walk up to it and stuff. And it's like, you can get video footage

03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:32.280
that you can literally put on Netflix. Like it's just like, it's getting really exciting. And

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:38.600
that's where I deviate from the nature people that are like, we need to go back and live in cabins.

03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:44.440
I'm like, dude, this is awesome. And I love taking slo-mos, like no way.

03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:48.520
It makes you re-appreciate, but just by yourself, just re-appreciate over and over and over. And

03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:51.640
then you can also share it with the world. Well, that's the thing is sharing it with people.

03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:57.960
There's nothing better than like teaching a kid to catch a fish, you know? And like, in a way,

03:11:57.960 --> 03:12:04.600
Instagram has allowed us to do that where it's like, I can have this crazy ass moment that is

03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:10.120
so unique and then put it up for people to see, you know? Or I mean, I remember one of the most

03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:14.200
recent things that got people, you never know what's going to get people excited. I literally

03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:17.960
just like, there was like, you know, 3000 butterflies on the beach and they were like black,

03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:22.600
red and blue, beautiful butterflies. And I just like panned the phone across it and then like

03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:26.920
jumped in the river and swam away and like threw that up on Instagram and people went berserk.

03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:29.720
They're like, this is the most amazing thing. Like four different accounts reached out to

03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:34.040
try and share it. And I was like, butterflies, they're everywhere. This is 4,000 species of

03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:38.600
butterfly in the Amazon. But sharing that with people is beautiful.

03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:43.560
How do you find the thing to shoot? How do you come up with the butterflies? How do you

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:49.400
notice the thing that's beautiful and say, I'm going to wait a minute, like pause. This is

03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.400
beautiful. Let me take a, let me, let me take a picture of this. Cause like sometimes you

03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:58.360
might get used to the beauty, right? Yeah. Yeah. Or like sometimes simple,

03:12:58.360 --> 03:13:02.520
crazy things like, like leaf cutter ants, they're just walking by. They become,

03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:06.840
it becomes pedestrian. It's like, well, I mean, just like when you're, you know,

03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:10.440
you're living at the elephant camp and it's like, the elephant comes out and he starts like

03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:14.120
trashing the water bucket. We're all like, would just stop. We're trying to watch Peaky

03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:18.600
Blinders here. Just leave us alone. It becomes normal after a while.

03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:26.120
But no, in the, in the jungle, I don't, I don't, that's never a struggle for me because as a

03:13:26.120 --> 03:13:32.200
photographer, it's like, whenever my eye hits on something, I went, I've never seen that many of

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:37.720
those butterflies, all the same species together. And like this, oh yeah, I'm trying to get this

03:13:37.720 --> 03:13:42.120
one thing that the butterflies do is in the dry season, the salt deposits, you'll get like

03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:48.680
three or four, maybe 5,000 butterflies all coming onto this one area of sand. Cause there'll be

03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:53.240
like some leaching. There'll be some, some salt deposit there or something. And they'll all be

03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:58.680
wings flat against the ground with their, with their perboscis is on the sand. And if you go

03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:06.520
walk near them, they will vortex up and you have a rainbow vortex of butterflies and you can like

03:14:06.520 --> 03:14:13.080
go run through that. And it's surreal. And I want to, what I want to do is get the shot where I,

03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:16.680
I guess, leave the phone recording in slow-mo facing up

03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:23.480
and leave it there for an hour, let the butterflies come in and settle and then disturb them. So I

03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:27.560
get the bottom of the vortex of the bug. I'm like, these are the ways I think where I'm like, how can

03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:34.120
I show people the absolute mind blowing, you know, perfection. I mean, that's what I have, you know,

03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:38.680
I'm sure that somebody else could do it with, you know, a red and, and, and nail it, but it's like,

03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:42.120
that's what I have in the jungle because I have to travel light. And I, you know,

03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:46.040
Yeah, I think that, that, that really, that works. I have the same thing when I was traveling in

03:14:46.040 --> 03:14:51.400
Ukraine. The, the equipment was just the suit is that suitcase over there with the foam and you

03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:56.840
just shove it full of equipment and do the best you can. You can go to war zone. It doesn't matter.

03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:01.480
It doesn't like I, it has to do with the, you're talking about like, with the,

03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:07.720
like protecting your camera or not. It feels like the more you protect stuff,

03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:12.200
the more is going to get it damaged. Yeah. Like, so like, see like my cameras,

03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:16.600
they're all missing. This is like, this is amazing to me. So all my cameras are missing the,

03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:22.040
they all, how you can see the metal through the paint. Nice. So all this. And so like, they're all

03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:26.520
because I'm constantly like, I'll like slide in and like take a picture and like they're banged up,

03:15:27.160 --> 03:15:30.520
but these, they're good. They're good machines. I think they get tough over time. If you put them

03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:35.240
through, it's like the immune system, it's like muscles. It's like David Goggins cameras. If you

03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:43.960
got it, you got to make them suffer every day. Yeah. What's your view on hunting? So you really

03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:49.320
hate poachers. I really hate poachers. How do they operate? Who are they? What are they up to? What

03:15:49.320 --> 03:15:56.760
do they do? Poachers to me are the people that are going in and annihilating wildlife for profit

03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:03.480
without any, you know, the people that are going in and machine gunning an elephant to take its

03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:10.680
tusks. Yeah. The people that are sneaking into protected areas in Africa and shooting rhinos

03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:15.720
so that they can cut off their horns before the animal's even dead while its baby is beside it.

03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:23.880
So, and that there's a difference between a poacher and a hunter. I'm a hunter.

03:16:24.040 --> 03:16:29.640
JJ's a hunter. I work with an organization called Vet Paw in Africa and they use United States

03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:34.120
veterans who have come back, post 9-11 veterans who have come back from the war and have these

03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:41.240
skills. And they've been using these guys to protect the last black rhinos, white rhinos,

03:16:41.240 --> 03:16:46.840
elephants. And so we've, I've gotten to see this play out on a private reserve in Africa where

03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:53.480
in Africa where these incredible people have decided to protect zebras, wildebeests,

03:16:53.480 --> 03:16:59.320
all types of impala, giraffes, several herds of elephants, white rhinos, black rhinos,

03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:04.600
all of this stuff is protected. And what's interesting is it's a hunting preserve.

03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:12.440
And so it's been very interesting and challenging sharing my work there with the public because

03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:17.080
for instance, I went to a very high profile photographer recently and I said,

03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:21.320
you have to get over here and see this. It's amazing what these people have done. It's this

03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:26.040
reserve called Buffalo Clouffe and they've, you know, there's this rescued families of elephants

03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:29.800
and they have, you can see a black rhino every day if you want to. This is, they're critically

03:17:29.800 --> 03:17:36.120
endangered. And it's because of the work that Vet Paw does protecting these animals from poachers.

03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:41.240
But what people don't understand is that hunting happens all the time on the reserve,

03:17:41.880 --> 03:17:47.560
not for the elephants and the rhinos. Those are special and they will never be hunted there.

03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:52.840
But things like an impala, things like an inyala, a wildebeest, a zebra,

03:17:53.880 --> 03:17:58.120
there aren't as many predators as there used to be. So if you leave those animals

03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:05.480
unhunted, you know, without the wolf to chase the herd, to thin off the ones that are old and

03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:10.280
dying or sick, well, then you just have animals that are old and dying and sick walking around

03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:16.040
suffering. And so on reserves like this, they hunt and they take the old ones and they use

03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:19.880
the funding from hunting. No one's going to pay you $30,000 to take a picture of a buffalo,

03:18:19.880 --> 03:18:27.080
but they'll pay you $30,000 to hunt a buffalo. And so these reserves responsibly and ethically on

03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:33.000
foot can go hunting and manage. And again, if they were hunting rhinos or if they were hunting

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:37.000
elephants, I'd be out in a second. They're hunting non endangered species. They're hunting

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:41.400
non endangered species. They're hunting game species. And the difference is that a poacher

03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:46.600
is going to, so those are responsible hunters that are ecologists and conservationists.

03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:52.600
Whereas a poacher is someone that will come in and kill recklessly and murder an animal for no

03:18:52.600 --> 03:19:01.320
reason for a part to sell. I would love to travel together actually. So let's, we'll talk offline.

03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:06.680
I would love to make that happen if you allow me. I'm 100% serious, man. I have tremendous respect

03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:10.120
for your work and I've been watching you since the beginning. I would love to do that together.

03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:18.040
I've been, I've talked to Joe quite a bit about it. I really

03:19:19.880 --> 03:19:26.360
love the idea of eating the meat that I've hunted. It's mostly what I eat is meat, not for dietary.

03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:30.440
I don't have any weird constraints on my diet and so on. I just really enjoy eating meat.

03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:33.000
It's really good.

03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:37.480
And there is a part of me that's bothered by factory farming.

03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:38.920
Yes, sure.

03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:43.480
That it's very easily accessible meat, but there's something deeply wrong with it.

03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:50.120
Part of the reason I love fishing and eating the fish that I catch, it just seems to be

03:19:51.720 --> 03:19:58.680
more ethical, but also a more intimate, deep connection, honest connection with nature.

03:19:58.680 --> 03:20:04.440
You get to see the killing of the food that you're consuming versus removing that from the

03:20:04.440 --> 03:20:11.080
picture, not even thinking about it, not thinking about that this came from the meat. And yeah,

03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:17.560
I love the idea that you kill, I kill one animal and I eat that animal basically for the whole year.

03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:22.440
Yeah, an ethically slaughtered animal, whether it's a fish or a deer or whatever else.

03:20:23.240 --> 03:20:31.320
To me, I'm going to use the wrong religious term here, but I feel like I want to use the word

03:20:31.320 --> 03:20:42.120
sacrament, but there's a deeply profound ritual. And honestly, if you teach a kid to grow a

03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:47.240
vegetable, you show a kid how to grow a carrot and the miracle of like, wait, this thing just

03:20:47.240 --> 03:20:50.440
grew in there, it just appeared because there was sunlight. And it's like, yeah.

03:20:53.320 --> 03:21:01.400
To me, yes, when you feel that fish tug on the line, to me, it does something that awakens a

03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:06.680
deep primal something, this satisfaction. And then when you eat that, you feel good.

03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:13.240
The other thing functionally speaking is that aside from the fact that I think it's one of the

03:21:13.240 --> 03:21:21.240
original, we were so disconnected, we should be hunting, we should be gathering, walking more.

03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:25.400
Look at what we discussed now, people are like, oh, you got to get your steps in for the day.

03:21:25.400 --> 03:21:31.720
And it's like, that never used to be a problem. People are like, well, should we be eating animals?

03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:38.040
And it's like, what do you think we do here on earth? I'm not sure how you got so confused,

03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:46.920
but Walmart did it to you. I don't know. From 18 to 35, I feel like I've grown up,

03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:52.920
I've lived more outside than I have inside. And it's just to me, showing people these things,

03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:58.440
I can see this miraculous wonder in their eyes when they realize that they can reach out into

03:21:58.440 --> 03:22:04.840
the world and interact with something. So when I hear these frantic people talking about whether

03:22:05.800 --> 03:22:10.520
or not it's right, it's like, no, of course it is. Then again, factory farming is awful,

03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:17.160
but I try and walk the line. I'm worried about wild animals. I'm worried about wild ecosystems.

03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:25.560
The other thing that's important about hunting is that if people's livelihoods depend on

03:22:26.360 --> 03:22:32.840
salmon and elk and ocean fisheries, well, then they'll fight to protect it naturally

03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:38.200
because it's part of their life. And if everybody's going to Burger King and everybody's

03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:43.240
getting chicken wrapped in plastic, they forget that the fish are there because they're too busy

03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:49.800
watching sitcoms. And so then when the conglomerate comes in and builds a dam, nobody really cares.

03:22:49.800 --> 03:22:54.440
And then you just end up with a few hippies and signs standing next to the river and it becomes

03:22:54.440 --> 03:22:59.080
silly. We forget the meaning. You mentioned that

03:23:01.080 --> 03:23:13.560
Ayahuasca reveals the darkness that's there in the jungle. There's beauty, but there's darkness.

03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:18.600
So what is it that Ayahuasca reveals? What is the heart of darkness?

03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:23.640
Fuck, it opens the heart of darkness right up. I'm going to show you a picture of our

03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:28.680
shaman and then I'm going to ask if you want to do Ayahuasca here, not here in that sense.

03:23:28.680 --> 03:23:31.960
It can only be done in the jungle. Anybody that tells you, I've heard people be like,

03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:34.520
oh, I did Ayahuasca in Brooklyn last week. And I'm like, no, you didn't.

03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:39.640
I actually told that to my native friends. I went, hey, guess what? I said, a bunch of

03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:43.560
gringos keep thinking they're doing Ayahuasca in Brooklyn. And they were like howling laughing.

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:46.520
They're like, you can't do it outside the jungle. And I was like, exactly.

03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:52.200
I've never done Ayahuasca. I would love to. I've done or eaten whatever mushrooms.

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.080
It's a wonderful experience.

03:23:55.080 --> 03:24:01.800
I think it's wonderful. But Ayahuasca, oh man, yeah. See, I had done mushrooms. I thought I was

03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:07.000
like, okay. Yeah, I was like, I got this. I had my notebook. I was like, I'm going to journal a

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:14.840
little bit. But I quickly, quickly realized how out of my depth I was and how unprepared I was

03:24:14.840 --> 03:24:19.080
for what was happening. Because you sit in a circle with these native guys and there's one,

03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:23.160
he's got the feathers and he's old and he's got a face like the map of the world. And he's

03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:29.960
smoking this fat old tobacco thing. And he calls you forward and you kneel before him and you're

03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:37.720
going, is it too late to back up? And everyone's, there's one candle and he blows smoke over the

03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:44.600
cup and he hands it to you. And you're like, again, it's these things that you can't argue

03:24:44.600 --> 03:24:49.720
with. It's these facts that you're like, as soon as this goes down, I'm gone. I know it. And this

03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:54.280
is a moment in my life that I have to either embarrass myself in front of everybody or I'm

03:24:54.280 --> 03:25:02.120
going forward with this and then I went and sat. And you're sitting in the dark and it's again,

03:25:02.120 --> 03:25:08.120
so we're on a platform with palm thatched roof and the jungle is all around you. So all those

03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:16.200
tens of millions of frogs and insects are, and I'm like, all right, cool. And I remember I tried to

03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:22.200
light a cigarette or something and I went, oh, that's not going to happen. And then I put my

03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:29.000
hands on the floor and my experience, we've done mushrooms, it's interesting, it's introspective.

03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:37.080
No, this was like somebody unzipped the universe. I spent a lot of, without boring people with it,

03:25:37.080 --> 03:25:43.480
I spent a lot of time in like unconstructed dream space, like floating between nebulas.

03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:49.080
There was a long period where there was no physical shape, where I lived without a name.

03:25:49.880 --> 03:25:55.640
It's like you get brought so deep down, so elementally lost in the universe where I

03:25:55.640 --> 03:26:05.320
truly felt like I was experiencing moving through places like that asteroid that I have. It's like

03:26:05.320 --> 03:26:12.040
a piece of something detached from the earth. And so I got back from it and

03:26:14.440 --> 03:26:21.080
had an interesting new appreciation for life. I strongly suggest that people just do mushrooms

03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:24.920
like a normal person, unless you're ready. So it was really intense.

03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:30.120
It was really intense, but to be fair, the shaman who did it was like the old school guy.

03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:34.760
And he was getting up there in years and he had forgotten and overboiled the brew.

03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:40.280
And so we came back and I was like four in the morning and I had all this crazy shit. I'd been

03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:44.280
on journeys and years down there. And so when I came back and I had like hands, I started crying.

03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:46.600
I started absolutely weeping. Gratitude or what?

03:26:46.600 --> 03:26:49.560
Gratitude that I was alive. I was going to get to see my people again. I was like,

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:52.840
I'm going to have to see my parents again. I'm going to get to talk to humans.

03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:54.840
So you kind of thought you might've been gone.

03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:01.400
I was gone. I was gone. I was a dimly conscious something floating in dark space and

03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:06.520
spent what felt like years down there. And so I really did feel like being reborn,

03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:12.840
which I was like cheap trick. But no, the way it moves you through the jungle,

03:27:12.840 --> 03:27:19.160
the way the jungle moves through your skin, there are moments of absolute majesty and incredible

03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:26.120
discovery that happen along the way. And on the way up, the jungle brings you up and the shaman

03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:31.720
brings you up and you get to move through the forest in a way that it's almost like

03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:37.320
you're inhabiting the consciousness of animals. Very, very, very like I didn't think that

03:27:37.320 --> 03:27:43.160
hallucinogenics could do this to a brain. Mushrooms, you're like, oh, I feel like I can feel music.

03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:51.480
You guys want to watch March of the Penguins? This is transformative. Did that change you?

03:27:52.120 --> 03:28:00.200
I don't know. I think it definitely, I almost feel like it showed me the thing that I was scared

03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:05.880
the most of. And it was like that it's all just cold, dark, nothing. It brought me to the basement

03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:12.440
of the universe. And I felt like the point of that was to come back to this place where there's all

03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:19.080
this life and light and love and all this amazing stuff that we experience on a day-to-day basis and

03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:23.320
don't take for granted. And so just like almost dying, this was like fully dying.

03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:30.840
But the great part is, is that usually it's not that intense. This guy had overboiled the brew.

03:28:30.840 --> 03:28:35.640
He'd also, I saw the vine afterwards. Most ayahuasca vines are like as thick as your arm.

03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:40.440
This one was like as thick as a garbage can. It was like the oldest ayahuasca vine you can imagine.

03:28:41.400 --> 03:28:45.880
And at like four in the morning, I like crawled over to my friend, Chris, who's a tough New York

03:28:45.880 --> 03:28:49.000
City firefighter. And we were like holding each other, just like weeping, just like,

03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:54.760
thank God we're back. And then we had to go looking for the shaman. Where the hell is this

03:28:54.760 --> 03:28:59.320
guy? He was gone. We found him in the morning and he was laying in the stream naked, like ET

03:28:59.320 --> 03:29:04.840
at the end when he's like laying like in the, yeah, he kicked his own ass with that brew

03:29:04.840 --> 03:29:12.200
and he retired after that. So we really got like, somebody turned the dial all the way up on us.

03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:15.960
And so we got, we got blasted. So it's not supposed to be that bad.

03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:23.000
But I think you're somebody who's fearless in sort of diving into those kinds of places.

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:26.280
I think I also retire from ayahuasca. I could be fearless with other things, but

03:29:26.840 --> 03:29:33.080
I think I'm good. It sounds kind of, to me personally, kind of exciting.

03:29:35.240 --> 03:29:39.640
Well, I think, I think that you have a severely fearless aspect to you. I mean, you're,

03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:43.960
when you come up with something that intrigues you, like if somebody told you right now that

03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:51.320
you could go physically into deep space, I feel like you would do it. Yeah. Yeah. If, if go to

03:29:51.320 --> 03:30:00.600
Mars. Yeah. Right. And some of it is, I don't even know if you have that. Some of that is more

03:30:00.760 --> 03:30:11.880
Goggins-like. I want to see where my mind breaks by pushing it to tough places. There's a curiosity

03:30:11.880 --> 03:30:15.960
of exploring the mind, the limits of the mind. I feel like you- It's not a cold plunge. That's

03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:20.840
like, you're not coming back. Right. Right. And that's, that's okay.

03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:29.080
See, no, I have, I do. I have, I'm with you on that. I love seeing my limits. I absolutely love

03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:34.040
seeing my limits. I love getting my ass kicked. I love being shown how insignificant I am. But

03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:37.720
when it comes to something like that, where you got to push your chips in, it's got to be something

03:30:37.720 --> 03:30:43.080
for me. It's got to be a hill that I believe in before I die on it. And it's like, like to me,

03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:49.880
the promise of exploring space isn't enough, but like, even just the way, I mean, you said,

03:30:49.880 --> 03:30:54.520
you're like, I'm going to Ukraine. Here I go. You know, there, there's a certain

03:30:58.280 --> 03:31:06.840
dedication to, to curiosity at any expense. And I think that that is something that maybe

03:31:06.840 --> 03:31:13.560
we share in very, in different directions. Something tells me with those, with those,

03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:19.480
with those crocodiles outside, I would have gotten eaten. Something tells me there's some,

03:31:19.480 --> 03:31:22.600
something trying to preserve you in this world. I'm not sure exactly what that is.

03:31:23.320 --> 03:31:26.440
Somehow you keep surviving. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:31.720
Why are we here? Like, do you ever ask yourself that question?

03:31:31.720 --> 03:31:35.400
I feel like that's every day. I feel like I'm someone that lives with that a lot.

03:31:36.440 --> 03:31:40.200
And I think that, I think that it actually takes me away from the human world a little bit. I feel

03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:49.800
like I've always been a little bit apart because I think that other people do, you know, mushrooms

03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:54.760
and they go, wow, I really made me think about how amazing it is here. And I feel like on a daily

03:31:54.760 --> 03:32:01.480
basis, I find myself where I'm like, I can't believe that any of this is possible. You know,

03:32:02.680 --> 03:32:07.880
and that, and that goes, that goes from how delicious something tastes to being able to

03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:13.320
talk to, to, to, to someone in your family or, or have a phone. There's times where I'm in the

03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:18.040
Amazon and I, I miss home and I even just FaceTiming with someone. I go, this is possible.

03:32:18.040 --> 03:32:18.680
Yeah.

03:32:18.680 --> 03:32:22.600
Like people were rubbing sticks together to try and survive saber-tooth tigers not that long ago.

03:32:22.600 --> 03:32:28.360
And I'm over there like, yo, mom, look at this. It's wild. Like I'm in a constant state of all.

03:32:28.360 --> 03:32:40.040
And so I actually hope that this is, that this is a testing ground and whether it's aliens or

03:32:40.040 --> 03:32:45.640
God or whatever it is, that, that this is all, that this is, that this is, that this is something

03:32:45.640 --> 03:32:50.200
crucially important. That would be nice because it feels like it is.

03:32:50.520 --> 03:32:55.480
Yeah. I hope that too, that the universe almost created us to see

03:32:57.560 --> 03:33:04.040
what's possible and that I'd like to believe that beauty and good is possible.

03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:10.680
And those are the things that make me say that it's not, it's impossible for it to just mean

03:33:10.680 --> 03:33:15.320
nothing. And I'm very, and just like you said, there could be life forms that, that we can't

03:33:15.320 --> 03:33:22.120
even understand. I'm very open to the idea that there's meanings that we have no idea about.

03:33:23.320 --> 03:33:27.160
The few things I know are the things that I love and some of the things that I love

03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:34.120
are being pushed to extinction. So I try to protect them, but that's my mission. But I'm

03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:43.080
saying like, in terms of what are we doing here, I'm just always amazed at the simplest things.

03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:47.000
I mean, the, you know, that we can sit here doing this exchanging.

03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:53.880
Yeah. Using our imagination to fill in the gaps, exchanging feelings, experiences, images.

03:33:54.840 --> 03:33:59.640
Yeah. It fills you with awe. And every once in a while, you get a little glimpse of something,

03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:04.040
like a deeper meaning that might be there. You don't, you don't, you don't really know what it

03:34:04.040 --> 03:34:08.760
is, but you get a glimpse every now and then you keep searching. And then it's over before you know

03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:14.360
it, Paul. Hopefully for you, you got many more years. It was dark, man. You're an important,

03:34:14.360 --> 03:34:18.520
important and a beautiful man. Paul, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being who

03:34:18.520 --> 03:34:24.120
you are for everything you're doing. I hope to see you again soon, many times, and maybe one day

03:34:24.120 --> 03:34:29.160
soon in the jungle. I hope that happens. Thank you, Lex. Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:33.720
with Paul Rosalie. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

And now let me leave you with some words from Jane Goodall.

03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:43.960
If we kill off the wild, then we're killing off a part of our souls.

03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:48.600
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
