00:00.000 --> 00:04.220
The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.220
You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

00:09.420 --> 00:13.580
It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.280
And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.140
That's mortality.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.500
Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

00:22.740 --> 00:28.820
It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

00:29.340 --> 00:36.260
So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects

00:36.260 --> 00:41.140
and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

00:43.580 --> 00:47.340
The following is a conversation with John Vervecky, a psychologist and

00:47.340 --> 00:49.620
cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.

00:50.180 --> 00:55.420
I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

00:55.740 --> 01:00.140
which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.540
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.820
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.340
And now, dear friends, here's John Vervecky.

01:10.420 --> 01:15.340
You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the meaning crisis.

01:15.980 --> 01:20.980
And I think you describe in the modern times, an increase in depression,

01:21.100 --> 01:26.060
loneliness, cynicism, and wait for it, bullshit.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.660
The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.140
So let me ask, what is meaning?

01:33.780 --> 01:39.980
What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?

01:40.180 --> 01:43.460
So when I'm talking about meaning, I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,

01:43.580 --> 01:45.020
not the meaning of life.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.740
That's some sort of metaphysical claim.

01:47.380 --> 01:51.940
Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more

01:51.940 --> 01:55.060
meaningful, worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.

01:55.860 --> 02:01.860
And when you study that, what you see is it's a sense of connectedness,

02:02.700 --> 02:07.380
a connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world, and a

02:07.380 --> 02:09.300
particular kind of connectedness.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.940
You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence

02:14.940 --> 02:19.060
independent of your egocentric sort of preferences and concerns.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.900
This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful

02:21.900 --> 02:25.620
because you're connecting to something that's going to have a life and

02:25.620 --> 02:27.860
a value independent of you.

02:28.980 --> 02:33.340
Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there's two questions.

02:33.340 --> 02:35.940
One is, why is that at risk right now?

02:36.540 --> 02:41.060
And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,

02:41.060 --> 02:44.060
which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?

02:44.060 --> 02:46.620
Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?

02:46.620 --> 02:51.060
Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,

02:51.060 --> 02:54.540
potentially mental illness, addiction, self-destructive behavior?

02:55.100 --> 02:59.220
And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.180
And people often express it metaphorically.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.780
They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.660
They want to matter.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.220
They don't mean it literally.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.340
I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say,

03:09.340 --> 03:11.260
oh, now my life is so fulfilling.

03:11.300 --> 03:11.620
Right?

03:12.020 --> 03:15.060
So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say,

03:15.580 --> 03:16.620
they want to be connected.

03:17.220 --> 03:18.780
They want to be connected to something real.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.460
They want to make a difference and matter to it.

03:22.180 --> 03:27.940
And one way of asking them, well, you know, what's meaningful is tell me what

03:27.940 --> 03:31.580
you would like to continue to exist, even if you weren't around anymore.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.940
And how are you connected to it?

03:33.940 --> 03:35.060
And how do you matter to it?

03:35.940 --> 03:44.180
That's one way of trying to get at, at what is the source of meaning for you is if

03:44.180 --> 03:47.580
you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.

03:48.460 --> 03:52.140
That's not the only part of the definition, probably, because there's

03:52.140 --> 03:58.180
probably many things that aren't a source of meaning for me that maybe I find

03:58.180 --> 04:01.340
beautiful that I would like to continue existing.

04:01.380 --> 04:01.900
Yes.

04:01.940 --> 04:06.620
If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you're connected to it in

04:06.620 --> 04:13.820
some way and it matters to you and you matter to it in that you make some

04:13.820 --> 04:14.620
difference to it.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.580
That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good and beautiful to being a

04:18.580 --> 04:20.340
source of meaning for you in your life.

04:21.140 --> 04:26.060
Is the meaning crisis a new thing or has it always been with us as a part of the

04:26.060 --> 04:27.460
human condition in general?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.460
That's an excellent question.

04:29.460 --> 04:32.860
And part of the argument I made in Awakening from the Meaning Crisis is

04:32.860 --> 04:34.500
there's two aspects to it.

04:35.260 --> 04:40.300
One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.420
And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.

04:45.420 --> 04:49.180
You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.

04:50.580 --> 04:56.620
But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems

04:56.620 --> 05:01.540
more pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.820
And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,

05:07.140 --> 05:12.860
finding existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated,

05:13.460 --> 05:17.740
and then pressing historical factors, which have to do with the loss of the

05:17.740 --> 05:22.660
resources that human beings have typically crossed historically and cross-culturally

05:22.660 --> 05:23.220
made.

05:23.220 --> 05:30.820
Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning that speaks to

05:30.820 --> 05:33.620
the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?

05:34.060 --> 05:38.940
You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book, The Nile of Death, about the

05:38.940 --> 05:43.140
fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.

05:43.620 --> 05:48.020
As William James said, we're all vulnerable to despair, we're all vulnerable to

05:48.020 --> 05:52.060
fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.

05:52.540 --> 05:56.620
As William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.

05:56.940 --> 06:06.500
Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen from

06:06.500 --> 06:14.020
the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality?

06:15.020 --> 06:18.860
Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it, there's

06:18.860 --> 06:23.700
been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.620
Some of the work, not so good.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.660
So which aspects do you find convincing?

06:30.900 --> 06:33.980
Can you steel man that case and then can you argue against it?

06:34.620 --> 06:42.460
So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite, being

06:42.860 --> 06:46.780
inherently limited is very problematic for us.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.620
Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you used that word

06:54.060 --> 06:58.420
to describe one's own mortality as problematic because people sort of on

06:58.420 --> 07:01.420
Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.

07:01.740 --> 07:05.860
But this to me seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human

07:05.860 --> 07:08.300
condition is that we die and it ends.

07:08.540 --> 07:14.100
I think I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider

07:14.380 --> 07:18.380
that your mortality is not an event in the future, it's a state you're in right now.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.060
That's what I'm trying to shift.

07:23.420 --> 07:29.220
So your mortality is just a, we talk about something that causes mortality fatal.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.180
But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.580
And I don't mean in the sense of things that are pre-written.

07:36.580 --> 07:44.180
What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

07:44.420 --> 07:49.180
You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

07:49.380 --> 07:53.540
It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.220
And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.100
That's mortality.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.460
Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

08:02.700 --> 08:08.780
It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

08:09.300 --> 08:15.700
So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the

08:15.700 --> 08:19.940
projects and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe

08:19.940 --> 08:21.100
can just roll over them.

08:22.300 --> 08:28.420
So death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your, to your existence.

08:28.780 --> 08:31.300
And so in that sense, it is always here with us.

08:31.980 --> 08:32.460
Yeah.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.340
But you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the

08:35.340 --> 08:37.100
ending of your biological life.

08:37.620 --> 08:43.300
Because it's interesting if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.

08:43.580 --> 08:46.540
They often put public speaking as number one.

08:47.140 --> 08:53.540
Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for, for

08:53.540 --> 08:55.420
human beings and drive them into despair.

08:56.340 --> 09:00.980
So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say that

09:01.420 --> 09:05.380
you know, a self-report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is

09:05.380 --> 09:09.860
actually at the core of the motivation of a human being, that we could be terrified

09:09.860 --> 09:17.380
of death and we've from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact

09:17.380 --> 09:22.780
that the right ends, we've learned to really try to forget about it, try to

09:22.780 --> 09:28.700
construct illusions that, that allow us to escape momentarily or for prolonged

09:28.700 --> 09:31.700
periods of time, the, the, the realization that we die.

09:32.100 --> 09:32.380
Okay.

09:32.380 --> 09:37.180
So first I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical

09:37.180 --> 09:39.740
work that makes me want to reconsider it.

09:39.740 --> 09:44.580
So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of

09:44.580 --> 09:48.980
words to read and you, and in those words, in those lists of words associated

09:48.980 --> 09:52.620
with death, cough and funeral, and then you see what happens to people.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.740
And generally they start to become more rigid in their thinking.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.740
They tend to identify with their worldview.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.420
Um, they lose cognitive flexibility.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.380
That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective.

10:04.860 --> 10:09.700
But if you get them to go into first person perspective and imagine that

10:09.700 --> 10:14.700
they're dying and that the people that they care about are there with them, they

10:14.700 --> 10:17.500
don't show those responses.

10:17.740 --> 10:22.340
In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility and increase in

10:22.340 --> 10:22.780
openness.

10:23.180 --> 10:27.060
See, so I'm trying to say, uh, we might be putting the cart before the horse.

10:27.100 --> 10:31.700
It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent

10:31.700 --> 10:33.980
in depth, that is the crucial thing for us.

10:34.620 --> 10:37.380
By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously.

10:37.420 --> 10:42.540
I don't think you truly steel man the case because, uh, you're saying that

10:42.540 --> 10:43.940
death is always present with us.

10:43.940 --> 10:44.340
Yes.

10:44.660 --> 10:49.340
But isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?

10:49.340 --> 10:54.780
Nietzsche, will to power, Freud, wanting to have sex with your mother, uh, all the

10:54.780 --> 10:58.260
different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.

10:58.580 --> 11:05.060
Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good,

11:05.740 --> 11:11.460
um, if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans.

11:12.140 --> 11:16.660
I'm not saying that, um, the avoidance of death is not significant for human

11:16.660 --> 11:23.060
beings, but I'm proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for

11:23.060 --> 11:26.820
considering certain deaths, meaningful and certain deaths, meaningless.

11:27.340 --> 11:31.300
And people, and we have lots of evidence that people are re are willing to

11:31.300 --> 11:35.740
sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.380
Are you personally afraid of your death?

11:38.420 --> 11:44.660
Do you think about it as a, as somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records

11:44.660 --> 11:50.780
them, writes them down as a deep thinker, admired thinker, and as the years go on,

11:51.020 --> 11:52.540
become more and more admired?

11:53.540 --> 11:56.540
Does, does it scare you that the right ends?

11:57.820 --> 12:00.540
Um, no, I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.780
I'm a biological organism, so if something's thrown at my head, I'll

12:03.780 --> 12:11.060
duck and things like that, but if you're asking me, do I long to live forever?

12:11.380 --> 12:12.260
Uh, no.

12:12.780 --> 12:17.100
Um, in the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you

12:17.460 --> 12:22.020
aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.

12:22.660 --> 12:27.340
The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.

12:29.140 --> 12:35.180
Are those the only two options you can like, um, when you're sitting with a

12:35.180 --> 12:41.100
loved one or watching a movie, you just really love or a book you really love.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.420
You don't want it to end.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.420
You don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.380
The complete opposite of the thought experiment.

12:49.540 --> 12:51.780
What happens if the book lasts forever?

12:52.620 --> 12:54.860
There's gotta be a middle ground, like the snooze button.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.140
Sure.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.020
You don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button

12:58.300 --> 12:59.700
and get an extra 15 minutes.

13:00.500 --> 13:06.100
So there's surely some kind of balance that that fear seems to be.

13:07.820 --> 13:12.820
A source of an intense appreciation of the moment in part, I mean, that's

13:12.820 --> 13:17.380
what the Stoics talked about to sort of the, to meditate on once mortality

13:17.740 --> 13:25.740
seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is, uh, full of moments that are

13:25.740 --> 13:28.620
beautiful and then you don't get an infinite number of them.

13:29.260 --> 13:29.700
Right.

13:29.860 --> 13:34.540
And the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration

13:34.540 --> 13:38.300
of your life, but to deepen those moments.

13:38.300 --> 13:44.780
So they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes, it does not

13:44.780 --> 13:46.340
strike you as any kind of calamity.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.660
Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?

13:50.860 --> 13:51.620
I think so.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.300
Do you think about your mortality?

13:53.740 --> 13:55.860
I used to, I don't so much anymore.

13:56.620 --> 14:04.220
Um, part of it as I'm older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere

14:04.220 --> 14:06.740
in your thirties or forties, you don't live from your birth.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.380
You live towards your death.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.180
That's such a beautiful phrase.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.500
The temporal horizon flips.

14:12.980 --> 14:13.860
That's so true.

14:14.660 --> 14:15.500
That's so true.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.100
At what point is that?

14:17.780 --> 14:23.700
That the point before which the world of opportunity and

14:23.700 --> 14:25.660
possibility is infinite before you.

14:25.660 --> 14:26.020
Yeah.

14:26.020 --> 14:26.980
It's like Peter Pan.

14:27.220 --> 14:31.180
There's all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.580
Yes, very much.

14:33.060 --> 14:37.380
And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model.

14:37.660 --> 14:42.940
Uh, the Socratic, the Stoic model of Buddhism has also influenced me, which

14:42.940 --> 14:50.100
is more about, wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta desires.

14:50.580 --> 14:55.620
In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire

14:55.620 --> 15:01.940
to be real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal

15:01.940 --> 15:04.980
conflict, but bring something like peace of mind.

15:05.420 --> 15:10.460
And so I'm more and more moved towards how can I live such that those two

15:10.460 --> 15:17.740
meta desires are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.500
What do you think happens after we die?

15:22.100 --> 15:27.940
I think mind and life go away completely when we die.

15:28.420 --> 15:34.540
And I think that's actually significantly important for

15:34.540 --> 15:36.020
the kind of beings that we are.

15:36.580 --> 15:41.220
Um, we are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness.

15:41.260 --> 15:45.260
And then we have a responsibility, uh, to decide how we're

15:45.260 --> 15:46.860
going to comport ourselves towards it.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.060
Can you linger on what that means?

15:50.060 --> 15:51.180
The mind goes away.

15:52.300 --> 15:57.700
Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down,

15:57.820 --> 15:58.780
the song is over.

16:00.380 --> 16:01.900
Doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.940
Doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.

16:04.260 --> 16:08.380
Doesn't mean the song like didn't add to the value of the universe

16:08.380 --> 16:10.420
and its existence, but it came to an end.

16:10.980 --> 16:16.380
Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the

16:16.380 --> 16:23.180
human and remains after something like panpsychism or is it too much for

16:23.180 --> 16:25.340
us, limited cognitive beings to understand?

16:26.020 --> 16:27.420
Something like panpsychism.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.500
Um, I take it seriously.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.900
I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has

16:31.900 --> 16:34.940
insoluble problems that make me doubt it.

16:35.580 --> 16:40.980
Um, any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial

16:40.980 --> 16:46.260
substance also has for me, just devastating problems.

16:46.420 --> 16:51.420
Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order

16:51.420 --> 16:53.900
to support some kind of idea of immortality.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.420
I find both very problematic.

16:56.020 --> 17:01.220
Um, the fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most

17:01.220 --> 17:04.100
of our problem solving is not done as individuals, but in groups,

17:04.100 --> 17:05.500
this is something I work on.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.060
I've published on that.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.100
I think that's important.

17:08.700 --> 17:14.180
Um, but, uh, most of the people who do work on systems of distributed

17:14.180 --> 17:17.580
cognition think that while there's such a thing as collective intelligence,

17:18.340 --> 17:21.100
there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.780
In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.

17:25.300 --> 17:30.660
Um, and so while I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline

17:31.460 --> 17:34.300
and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not

17:34.300 --> 17:37.940
think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness.

17:38.700 --> 17:43.540
And so therefore I don't think the fact that I participate, which I regularly

17:43.540 --> 17:47.500
and reliably do in distributed cognition gives me any reason to believe that

17:47.500 --> 17:50.940
that participation grounds some kind of consciousness.

17:52.100 --> 17:52.460
Okay.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.340
There's so many things to mention there.

17:54.340 --> 17:58.500
First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective

17:58.500 --> 18:04.580
intelligence, so that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think,

18:05.180 --> 18:10.700
have cognitive machines and, uh, are somehow able to interact with the process

18:10.700 --> 18:17.380
of dialogue as you talk about to, um, more different ideas together, like

18:17.380 --> 18:19.340
this idea landscape together.

18:19.820 --> 18:25.420
It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating

18:26.140 --> 18:32.740
distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate

18:32.740 --> 18:38.900
in the same way as intelligence, but isn't there a case if we just look at

18:38.900 --> 18:43.220
intelligence, if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms,

18:43.620 --> 18:48.660
which we are, and so there's like a hierarchy, um,

18:49.580 --> 18:56.140
of organisms, tiny ones work together to form tiny villages that you can then

18:56.260 --> 19:01.260
start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming bigger

19:01.260 --> 19:05.100
villages and interacting different ways and function becomes more and more

19:05.100 --> 19:09.420
complex and eventually would get to us humans to where we start to think, well,

19:09.420 --> 19:11.500
we're an individual, but really we're not.

19:11.500 --> 19:16.780
There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.

19:17.780 --> 19:25.340
So, uh, isn't that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way

19:25.340 --> 19:29.300
up to us, our consciousness, why does it have to stop with us humans?

19:29.540 --> 19:35.980
Are we the only, like, is this the face transition when it becomes a zombie

19:35.980 --> 19:43.140
like giant hierarchical village that first like, oh, there's like a singing

19:43.140 --> 19:46.620
angels and it's consciousness is born in just us humans.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.060
Do bacteria have consciousness?

19:49.180 --> 19:52.740
Uh, not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the

19:53.020 --> 19:57.220
interesting complicated organisms that are within us have consciousness.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.220
I think it's proper to argue.

20:00.220 --> 20:06.500
And I have that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind of agency and even a

20:06.500 --> 20:12.540
kind of intelligence, uh, kind of sense making ability, but I do not think that

20:12.540 --> 20:16.100
we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this kind

20:16.100 --> 20:21.020
of self-awareness, this ability to introspect, um, et cetera, et cetera,

20:21.420 --> 20:23.660
um, uh, to bacteria.

20:23.980 --> 20:27.860
Now, the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness,

20:28.140 --> 20:29.820
I think is a little bit more tricky.

20:30.220 --> 20:37.380
Um, and I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a

20:37.380 --> 20:41.500
consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence.

20:42.460 --> 20:46.100
In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point.

20:46.260 --> 20:53.340
I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts, uh, bandwidth, uh,

20:53.380 --> 20:57.140
density of connections, speed of information transfer, et cetera.

20:57.740 --> 21:02.580
Um, it's conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankenstein and neural

21:02.580 --> 21:08.620
link and we linked our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and

21:08.620 --> 21:12.380
bandwidth and speed that a group consciousness could take shape.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.860
I don't have any argument in principle against that.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.860
I'm just saying those, those contingent facts do not yet exist.

21:19.180 --> 21:22.580
And therefore it is implausible that consciousness exists at the

21:22.580 --> 21:24.420
level of collective intelligence.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.500
So you talk about consciousness quite a bit.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.660
So let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.100
Uh, what is consciousness?

21:33.380 --> 21:38.580
For me, there are two aspects, uh, to answering that question.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.860
One is what's the nature of consciousness?

21:40.860 --> 21:43.860
How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise

21:43.860 --> 21:45.700
apparently non-conscious universe?

21:46.340 --> 21:49.020
And then there's a function question, which is equally important,

21:49.020 --> 21:50.540
which is what does consciousness do?

21:51.220 --> 21:56.300
Um, the first one is obviously, uh, you know, problematic for most people.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.580
Like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from the

21:59.580 --> 22:01.180
rest of the non-conscious universe.

22:01.860 --> 22:06.220
But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard because

22:06.260 --> 22:12.020
you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent

22:12.020 --> 22:14.700
behavior without consciousness.

22:15.140 --> 22:20.860
You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind,

22:20.860 --> 22:24.580
and you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.260
So why do we have consciousness at all?

22:29.940 --> 22:31.060
Now, here's the thing.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.900
There's an extra question you need to ask.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.020
Should we attempt to answer those questions separately or should we

22:38.020 --> 22:40.180
attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion?

22:41.180 --> 22:45.580
I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion,

22:46.620 --> 22:49.860
what consciousness does and what it is.

22:50.460 --> 22:53.460
We should be able to give it a unified answer to both of those.

22:53.580 --> 23:00.580
Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it

23:00.580 --> 23:07.340
does, both of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.860
Can you try to explain the difference?

23:09.860 --> 23:12.500
That's interesting that, uh, that's useful.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.700
That's important to understand.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.060
So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position because I actually

23:17.060 --> 23:21.340
argue that trying to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent.

23:21.900 --> 23:27.820
Uh, but what I can point to are many published articles in which only one

23:27.820 --> 23:31.260
of these problems is addressed and the other is left unaddressed.

23:31.260 --> 23:35.460
So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge

23:35.460 --> 23:37.500
without saying, what do they do?

23:37.820 --> 23:40.140
What problems do they help to solve?

23:40.140 --> 23:42.140
How do they make the organism more adaptive?

23:42.580 --> 23:44.900
And then you'll have other people who'll say, no, no, this is what

23:44.900 --> 23:48.300
the function of consciousness is, but I don't know, I can't tell you.

23:48.540 --> 23:50.100
I can't solve the hard problem.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.140
I don't know how qualia exists.

23:52.340 --> 23:56.540
So what I'm saying is many people treat these problems separately.

23:56.780 --> 24:00.940
Although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.

24:02.060 --> 24:05.220
So the hard problem is focusing on the, what it is.

24:05.300 --> 24:05.740
Yes.

24:06.100 --> 24:10.020
So the qualia that the, it feels like something to experience the thing.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.220
That's what consciousness is and does is more about the

24:13.220 --> 24:15.260
functional usefulness of the thing.

24:15.340 --> 24:15.780
Yes.

24:15.980 --> 24:16.260
Yes.

24:16.300 --> 24:23.020
To, to the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in, in everyday life.

24:23.620 --> 24:24.300
Okay.

24:25.460 --> 24:33.820
Uh, you've also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.540
Yes, clearly.

24:35.660 --> 24:36.580
Is that obvious to you?

24:36.980 --> 24:37.380
Yes.

24:39.820 --> 24:42.100
I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory.

24:43.260 --> 24:47.220
It just comes up and it comes up really intelligently.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.660
But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked

24:51.700 --> 24:57.900
with whatever is doing the memory access that's doing the, oh, I think so.

24:57.900 --> 24:58.460
In cognition.

24:58.460 --> 24:58.780
Yes.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.460
Yes.

24:59.540 --> 25:04.940
So I guess what I'm trying to say in this, we'll, uh, probably sneak up to this

25:04.940 --> 25:10.180
question a few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious.

25:10.420 --> 25:16.860
Uh, or machines that are, uh, that are, uh, that are, uh, that are, uh,

25:17.260 --> 25:21.700
intelligent human level intelligence or beyond without building the consciousness.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.260
I mean, ultimately that's one of the ways to understand what

25:24.260 --> 25:27.580
consciousness is, is to, is to build the thing.

25:28.220 --> 25:28.540
Okay.

25:28.540 --> 25:33.180
We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.140
Like he thinks about language in this way, try to construct models and

25:36.140 --> 25:39.260
theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing.

25:39.940 --> 25:40.500
Exactly.

25:40.580 --> 25:45.380
And, uh, that's a methodological principle in cognitive science.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.700
In fact, one of the things that, uh, sort of distinguishes cognitive science

25:49.980 --> 25:56.300
from other disciplines, uh, dealing with the nature of cognition in the mind is

25:56.300 --> 25:59.020
that cognitive science takes the design stance.

25:59.460 --> 26:05.860
It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but

26:05.860 --> 26:08.780
serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomena?

26:10.140 --> 26:14.460
Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?

26:15.300 --> 26:19.700
In terms of how far we are, there's, there's, uh, on the computational side

26:19.700 --> 26:23.660
of things, something called cognitive modeling, there's all these kinds of

26:23.660 --> 26:27.740
packages that you can construct simplified models of how the brain does

26:27.740 --> 26:31.420
things and see if complex behaviors emerge.

26:32.580 --> 26:36.540
Do you find any efforts in cognitive or what efforts in cognitive science do

26:36.540 --> 26:40.580
you find most, uh, inspiring and productive?

26:41.260 --> 26:46.380
I think the project of trying to create, um, AGI artificial general intelligence

26:46.780 --> 26:52.340
is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific

26:52.340 --> 26:57.340
significance, this is independent of technological socioeconomic significance,

26:57.340 --> 27:03.980
which is already well, well established, but being able to say because of the

27:03.980 --> 27:09.340
work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps

27:09.340 --> 27:13.820
consciousness, I think that's where I placed my bets is in the current

27:14.060 --> 27:17.060
endeavors around artificial general intelligence.

27:17.100 --> 27:24.420
And so tackling that problem head on, which is now become central, at

27:24.420 --> 27:28.420
least to a group of cognitive scientists is I think what needs to be done.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.380
And, uh, when you think about AGI, do you think about

27:34.500 --> 27:36.140
systems that have consciousness?

27:36.860 --> 27:42.500
Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence.

27:43.980 --> 27:48.940
So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem

27:48.940 --> 27:52.460
solver, you can solve a wide variety of problems on a wide variety of domains.

27:53.020 --> 27:56.100
And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer.

27:56.100 --> 28:00.180
They can learn this game and play a few other well-designed rule bound games,

28:00.500 --> 28:03.060
but they couldn't learn how to swim, right?

28:03.060 --> 28:04.540
Or et cetera, things like that.

28:05.340 --> 28:11.700
And so what's interesting is what seems to come up, and this is some of my

28:11.700 --> 28:16.900
published work in all these different domains of cognition across all these

28:16.900 --> 28:21.100
different problem types is a central problem.

28:22.020 --> 28:25.100
And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have

28:25.100 --> 28:29.020
some general ability, that's a significant component of our intelligence.

28:29.940 --> 28:33.900
I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.660
And so it's happening right now.

28:39.660 --> 28:42.620
The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention

28:42.620 --> 28:44.460
to is combinatorially explosive.

28:46.060 --> 28:49.220
The amount of information you have in your memory, long-term memory and all

28:49.220 --> 28:53.180
the ways you could combine it, combinatorially explosive.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.700
The number of possibilities you can consider also combinatorially explosive.

28:57.940 --> 29:02.620
The sequences of behavior you can generate also combinatorially explosive.

29:02.940 --> 29:06.100
And yet somehow you're zeroing in.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.860
The right memories are coming up.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.580
The right possibilities are opening up.

29:09.580 --> 29:12.460
The right sequences of behavior, you're paying attention to the right thing.

29:12.700 --> 29:19.580
Not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you

29:19.580 --> 29:22.700
should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand.

29:23.020 --> 29:29.900
And that's an ability that is still not well understood within AGI.

29:30.620 --> 29:35.300
So filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.300
Right.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.580
It's almost like a Zen Cohen.

29:37.580 --> 29:44.140
What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information

29:44.500 --> 29:48.540
and do it in such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary

29:48.540 --> 29:51.060
guessing and algorithmic search.

29:52.900 --> 29:57.980
And to a fault sometimes, of course, that you, based on the models you

29:57.980 --> 30:02.820
construct, you forget, you ignore things you should probably not ignore.

30:03.380 --> 30:08.980
And that hopefully we can circle back to it, Lex, is related to the meaning

30:08.980 --> 30:14.860
issue because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent, make

30:14.860 --> 30:19.500
us perennially susceptible to self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior

30:19.700 --> 30:24.060
because of the way we miss frame the environment in a fundamental ways.

30:24.780 --> 30:37.300
So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we

30:37.300 --> 30:41.820
interpret and understand and interact intellectually with the environment.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.380
Yes.

30:42.620 --> 30:44.500
So what is wisdom?

30:44.940 --> 30:46.220
Why do we long for it?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.500
How do we, and where do we find it?

30:48.780 --> 30:49.220
What is it?

30:49.420 --> 30:53.100
Intelligence is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing.

30:55.060 --> 31:00.740
Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of

31:00.740 --> 31:03.820
self-deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems.

31:03.860 --> 31:04.980
So it's that meta problem.

31:05.940 --> 31:11.060
And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing?

31:11.700 --> 31:14.820
I think you have multiple ways of knowing and therefore you

31:14.820 --> 31:16.620
have multiple rationalities.

31:17.740 --> 31:21.660
And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are

31:21.980 --> 31:24.420
optimally constraining and affording each other.

31:25.340 --> 31:29.580
So in that way, wisdom is rationally self-transcending rationality.

31:30.980 --> 31:31.220
Right.

31:31.220 --> 31:37.860
So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality

31:38.460 --> 31:43.700
and pick up a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom.

31:44.380 --> 31:44.820
Yes.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.100
It's properly coordinated.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.460
You mentioned framing.

31:47.620 --> 31:48.020
Yes.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.340
So what is framing?

31:52.580 --> 31:57.460
Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how

31:57.460 --> 32:02.940
you reason about the world, how you understand the world?

32:03.500 --> 32:06.180
So it depends what you mean by assumptions.

32:06.180 --> 32:10.940
If by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that's

32:10.940 --> 32:14.580
much more downstream from relevance realization.

32:14.580 --> 32:22.460
I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on

32:22.660 --> 32:24.420
how you are paying attention.

32:25.020 --> 32:32.460
And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing

32:32.460 --> 32:34.140
right now of salience landscaping.

32:35.140 --> 32:36.180
What's salient to you?

32:37.380 --> 32:42.900
And how is what's salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?

32:42.900 --> 32:50.020
And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salience landscaping is

32:50.060 --> 32:54.340
aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?

32:54.660 --> 33:00.940
For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of beliefs we have.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.060
And here's why.

33:03.540 --> 33:09.180
If we mean by beliefs, you know, a representational proposition, then we're

33:09.940 --> 33:16.620
in this very problematic position because then we're trying to say that propositions

33:16.620 --> 33:19.980
are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance realization.

33:21.140 --> 33:25.860
And that's problematic because representations presuppose relevance realization.

33:26.860 --> 33:29.180
So I represent this as a cup.

33:30.500 --> 33:34.660
The number of properties it actually has and that I even have epistemic access to

33:34.660 --> 33:36.180
is combinatorially explosive.

33:36.700 --> 33:42.300
I select from those a subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar

33:42.300 --> 33:43.380
as they are relevant for me.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.700
This doesn't have to be a cup.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.260
I could be using it as a hat.

33:46.580 --> 33:50.580
I could use it to stand for the letter V, all kinds of different things.

33:50.580 --> 33:55.620
I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America, right?

33:56.220 --> 33:59.580
Representations presuppose relevance realization.

34:00.020 --> 34:04.980
They are, right, they are therefore dependent on it, which means relevance

34:05.020 --> 34:08.460
realization isn't bound to our representational structures.

34:09.020 --> 34:12.980
It can be influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on

34:12.980 --> 34:14.060
relevance realization.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.980
Let's define stuff.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.220
Relevance realization.

34:18.260 --> 34:18.580
Yes.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.220
What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing?

34:21.220 --> 34:21.700
What is it?

34:22.100 --> 34:23.060
What are we talking about?

34:23.940 --> 34:30.700
What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.

34:31.660 --> 34:37.460
So if you think about the adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment,

34:37.580 --> 34:41.460
but in a dynamical relation, and then what does evolution do?

34:41.860 --> 34:44.940
It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure.

34:45.180 --> 34:48.500
And what that does is that changes the niche constructions that are

34:48.500 --> 34:49.620
available to a species.

34:49.620 --> 34:50.820
It changes the morphology.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.700
You also have a loop.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.020
It's your sensory motor loop.

34:55.740 --> 35:00.460
And what's constantly happening is there are processes within you that are opening

35:00.460 --> 35:04.260
up variation and also processes that are putting selection on it.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.180
And you're constantly evolving that sensory motor loop.

35:07.460 --> 35:11.900
So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're

35:11.900 --> 35:14.620
framing the world is constantly evolving and changing.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.620
I can give you two clear examples of that.

35:17.020 --> 35:18.220
One, right?

35:18.820 --> 35:22.340
Your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic.

35:22.380 --> 35:28.060
The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret as much of reality

35:28.060 --> 35:29.500
as threat or opportunity.

35:29.980 --> 35:35.660
The parasympathetic is, right, is biased to trying to interpret as much of the

35:35.660 --> 35:37.860
environment as safe and relaxing.

35:38.140 --> 35:40.340
And they are constantly doing opponent processing.

35:40.340 --> 35:46.540
There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.

35:46.740 --> 35:50.460
There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is

35:50.460 --> 35:52.340
constantly evolving your arousal.

35:52.580 --> 35:56.940
Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network.

35:57.220 --> 36:01.020
The default mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind

36:01.020 --> 36:03.980
wander, to go off, to drift, right?

36:04.020 --> 36:07.900
And then the task focused network is selecting out of those possibilities,

36:07.900 --> 36:11.100
the ones that will survive and go into.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.860
And so you're constantly evolving your attention.

36:14.420 --> 36:14.660
Okay.

36:14.660 --> 36:18.300
So there's a natural selection of ideas that a bunch of systems

36:18.300 --> 36:19.420
within you are generating.

36:19.420 --> 36:22.300
And then you use the natural selection.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.940
What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with the glass

36:26.500 --> 36:31.380
relevance, realization, once again, you just described how it happens.

36:31.500 --> 36:31.860
Yes.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.220
You didn't describe what the hell it is.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.140
So what's the goal?

36:36.220 --> 36:37.100
What are we talking about?

36:37.100 --> 36:42.700
So relevance realization is how you interact with things in the world to

36:42.700 --> 36:47.980
make sense of, yes, make sense of why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.

36:48.100 --> 36:48.420
Yes.

36:48.420 --> 36:49.740
And notice the language you just used.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.660
You're starting to use the meaning in life language.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.420
Good or bad.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.260
That's good.

36:53.300 --> 36:53.580
Okay.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.180
That's good.

36:54.420 --> 37:00.420
So what that, what, what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?

37:00.980 --> 37:06.100
It, it, it, it gives you, and here I'll use the term from Marla Ponte.

37:06.100 --> 37:10.100
It gives you an optimal grip on the world.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.580
So let's use your visual attention again.

37:15.180 --> 37:15.300
Okay.

37:15.300 --> 37:15.940
Here's an object.

37:17.380 --> 37:18.420
How close should I be to it?

37:20.180 --> 37:23.860
Is there a right, exactly, exactly.

37:24.660 --> 37:30.740
So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal

37:30.740 --> 37:34.500
grip that actually creates the affordance of you getting to a goal

37:34.620 --> 37:35.540
that you're trying to get to.

37:36.140 --> 37:36.260
Yeah.

37:36.260 --> 37:40.700
But you're describing physical goals of manipulating objects.

37:40.700 --> 37:47.500
But is, so this applies the task, the process of relevance realization is not

37:47.500 --> 37:54.140
just about getting a glass of water and taking a drink, it's about falling in love.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.460
Of course.

37:55.940 --> 37:56.820
What else is there?

37:57.100 --> 38:01.820
Well, there's, there's, there's obvious between those two options.

38:01.860 --> 38:05.740
I can show you how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.260
Okay.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.740
So a mammal goes by and most people will say there's a dog.

38:13.100 --> 38:17.900
Now, why don't they say they might, but typically, you know, probabilistically

38:17.940 --> 38:18.860
they'll say there's a dog.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.940
They could say there's a German shepherd.

38:21.140 --> 38:21.940
There's a mammal.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.380
There's a living organism.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.700
There's a police dog.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.060
Why that, why there?

38:27.220 --> 38:30.580
Why do they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level?

38:31.020 --> 38:34.900
Well, what you find is that's an optimal grip because it's getting you the best

38:34.900 --> 38:39.780
overall balance between similarity within your category and difference

38:39.780 --> 38:41.180
between the other categories.

38:41.220 --> 38:46.420
It's allowing you to properly fit to that object insofar as you're setting

38:46.420 --> 38:51.140
yourself up to, well, I'm getting so as many of the similarities and differences

38:51.420 --> 38:55.540
I can on balance because they're in a trade off relationship that I need in

38:55.540 --> 39:01.100
order to probably interact with this mammal that's optimal grip, not right.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.700
It's at the level of your categorization.

39:04.420 --> 39:11.780
You evolve these models of the world around you and I'm top of them.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.500
You do stuff like you build the representations.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.540
Like you said, yes.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.300
What's the salience landscape salience?

39:19.940 --> 39:22.180
Meaning attention landscape.

39:22.820 --> 39:28.340
So salience is what grabs your attention or what results from

39:28.340 --> 39:29.660
you directing your attention.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.820
So I slap my hands.

39:31.860 --> 39:32.700
That's salient.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.820
It grabs your attention.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.660
Your attention is drawn to it.

39:35.660 --> 39:40.140
That's bottom up, but I can also say your left big toe and now it's

39:40.140 --> 39:42.580
salient to you because you directed your attention towards it.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.460
That's top down.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.420
And again, opponent processing going on there.

39:46.860 --> 39:50.660
So whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what

39:50.660 --> 39:54.900
arouses you, what triggers at least momentarily some affect towards it.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.540
That's how things are salient.

39:57.180 --> 40:00.660
What salience I would argue is, is how a lot of unconscious

40:00.660 --> 40:06.220
relevance realization makes information relevant to working memory.

40:07.220 --> 40:12.100
That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory

40:12.100 --> 40:13.300
motor interaction with the world.

40:13.300 --> 40:17.980
So you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience

40:17.980 --> 40:19.780
extends into the subconscious mind?

40:21.020 --> 40:25.700
I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively

40:25.700 --> 40:31.100
processed, relevance realization such that it passes through sort of this

40:31.100 --> 40:36.420
higher filter of working memory and has these properties of being globally

40:36.420 --> 40:41.420
accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing we call salience.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.100
Look, that's really good evidence.

40:44.140 --> 40:47.940
There's really good evidence from my colleague at UFT, University of

40:47.940 --> 40:50.780
Toronto, Lynn Hasher, that that's what working memory is.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.580
It's a higher order relevance filter.

40:52.740 --> 40:57.260
That's why things like chunking will get way more information through working

40:57.260 --> 41:02.300
memory because it's basically making, it's basically monitoring how much

41:02.300 --> 41:05.300
relevance realization has gone into this information.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.660
Usually you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing.

41:09.140 --> 41:13.180
And that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness?

41:13.180 --> 41:18.420
When do you need that working memory and that salience landscaping?

41:18.820 --> 41:23.300
It's when you're facing situations that are highly novel, highly complex,

41:23.460 --> 41:27.300
and very ill defined that require you to engage working memory.

41:28.460 --> 41:29.220
Okay, got it.

41:29.220 --> 41:33.460
So relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that

41:33.460 --> 41:35.180
basic level thing of a dog.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.980
When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German

41:38.980 --> 41:44.780
shepherd, not a mammal, not a biological meat bag, it's a dog.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.100
Wisdom.

41:46.860 --> 41:47.220
Yes.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.620
So what is wisdom?

41:49.980 --> 41:56.020
If we return, I think as part of that, we got to relevance realization and then

41:56.060 --> 42:02.420
wisdom is accumulation of rationalities.

42:02.820 --> 42:08.380
He described the rationality as a kind of, uh, starting from intelligence,

42:08.580 --> 42:12.140
much of puzzle solving, and then rationalities like the meta problem

42:12.140 --> 42:16.500
of puzzle solving, and then what wisdom is the meta meta problem of puzzle solving?

42:16.740 --> 42:17.300
Yes.

42:17.380 --> 42:21.900
In the sense that, um, the meta problem you have when you're solving your

42:22.020 --> 42:25.700
puzzles is that you can often fall into self deception.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.140
You can miss frame deception.

42:27.140 --> 42:27.380
Right.

42:27.380 --> 42:27.620
Right.

42:27.780 --> 42:33.420
So, whereas knowledge overcomes ignorance, uh, wisdom is about

42:33.420 --> 42:37.780
overcoming foolishness if what we mean by foolishness is self deceptive,

42:37.780 --> 42:41.500
self destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition of foolishness.

42:42.620 --> 42:49.580
And so what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization.

42:49.580 --> 42:52.780
You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence.

42:53.220 --> 42:56.780
And then you're using your rationality to improve the use of your rationality.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.900
That's that recursive relevance realization.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.900
I was talking about a few minutes ago.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.020
Think about a wise person.

43:02.860 --> 43:08.940
They come into highly, often messy, ill-defined complex situations, usually

43:08.940 --> 43:12.260
where there's some significant novelty and what can they do?

43:12.660 --> 43:17.300
They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant, and then they can

43:17.300 --> 43:23.380
shape themselves, salience landscaping to intervene most appropriately to

43:23.380 --> 43:25.580
that situation as they have framed it.

43:25.580 --> 43:27.660
That's what we mean by a wise person.

43:27.860 --> 43:30.780
And that's how it follows out of the model I've been presenting to you.

43:31.020 --> 43:35.700
So when we say self deception, I mean, part of that implies that it's intentional.

43:36.420 --> 43:41.660
Part of the mechanism of cognition, you're modifying what you should

43:41.660 --> 43:43.540
know for some purpose.

43:43.940 --> 43:47.180
Is that, is that how you see the word self deception?

43:47.340 --> 43:52.460
No, cause I belong to a group of people that think the model of self deception

43:53.180 --> 43:56.780
as lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense.

43:57.660 --> 44:01.420
Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you don't, and I have

44:01.420 --> 44:05.860
to depend on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.300
I don't think that's what we do to ourselves.

44:09.820 --> 44:13.260
I think, and I'm going to use it in a technical term and thank you for making

44:13.260 --> 44:16.860
space for that earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves, which is a

44:16.860 --> 44:18.540
very different thing than lying.

44:18.860 --> 44:22.700
So what is bullshit and how do we bullshit ourselves?

44:22.900 --> 44:24.060
Technically speaking.

44:24.140 --> 44:27.820
Yeah, Frankfurt, and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's

44:27.820 --> 44:29.700
work based on Frankfurt's work.

44:29.700 --> 44:30.420
On bullshit.

44:30.460 --> 44:30.980
Yeah.

44:31.220 --> 44:32.180
Classic essay.

44:32.900 --> 44:33.900
It's a pretty good title.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.060
I think it's one of the best things he wrote.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.260
He wrote a lot of good things.

44:37.580 --> 44:38.820
The title or the essay.

44:39.020 --> 44:39.540
The essay.

44:40.580 --> 44:41.340
Title's good too.

44:41.820 --> 44:44.700
It's always an icebreaker in certain academic settings.

44:44.700 --> 44:48.860
So let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.220
The liar depends on your commitment to the truth.

44:53.700 --> 44:58.540
The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question

44:58.540 --> 45:04.500
of truth and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so

45:04.500 --> 45:06.460
that they are catchy to you.

45:07.500 --> 45:12.460
So, you know, a poster artist is trying to make you indifferent to the question

45:12.620 --> 45:19.820
So, you know, a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial television

45:19.820 --> 45:26.620
commercial, you watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of

45:26.620 --> 45:31.340
alcohol and they're gorgeous and they're laughing and they're smiling and

45:31.340 --> 45:32.420
they're cleared eyed.

45:34.180 --> 45:35.100
You know, that's not true.

45:36.180 --> 45:38.980
And they know, you know, it's not true, but here's the point.

45:39.660 --> 45:44.980
You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling and they're happy and

45:44.980 --> 45:47.260
that's salient to you and that catches your attention.

45:47.500 --> 45:50.100
And so all you know, go into a bar.

45:50.100 --> 45:53.060
You know, that won't happen when you drink this alcohol.

45:53.060 --> 45:58.580
You know it, but you buy the product because it was made salient to you.

45:59.660 --> 46:01.660
Now you can't lie to yourself, Lex.

46:02.620 --> 46:06.180
Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive salience.

46:06.380 --> 46:07.660
So this is what I can do.

46:08.140 --> 46:12.340
I can make something salient by paying attention to it.

46:12.900 --> 46:17.820
And then that will tend to draw me back to it again, which, and you see what

46:17.820 --> 46:21.940
happens, which means it tends to catch my attention more so that when I go into

46:21.940 --> 46:26.620
the store, that bottle of liquor catches my attention and I buy it.

46:27.220 --> 46:30.580
And that's, why is that bullshit?

46:31.380 --> 46:38.460
Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things

46:38.860 --> 46:43.460
independent from whether or not that salience is tracking reality.

46:44.340 --> 46:47.940
Is it independent or is it loosely connected?

46:47.980 --> 46:53.420
Because it's not so obvious to me when I see happy people at a bar that I don't

46:53.420 --> 46:58.180
in part believe that, well, my experience has been maybe different.

46:58.620 --> 47:04.460
Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there where it's

47:04.460 --> 47:05.900
all happy people dancing.

47:06.580 --> 47:09.740
In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas, there's pretty,

47:09.860 --> 47:10.900
lots of happy people.

47:11.420 --> 47:15.500
I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation, although I think

47:15.500 --> 47:17.260
it's very, the truth-seeking in there.

47:17.540 --> 47:22.420
Let's say the intent is at least to try and shut off your truth-seeking.

47:22.620 --> 47:25.340
It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.

47:25.580 --> 47:30.380
At times it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much

47:30.380 --> 47:33.780
gibberish and you never let it will motivate your behavior.

47:33.780 --> 47:37.580
There's a, there's a simp, there's a episode from the classic Simpsons, not

47:37.580 --> 47:41.780
the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons where there's aliens and they're running

47:41.780 --> 47:43.900
for office in the United States.

47:43.900 --> 47:47.060
Now I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me, but right.

47:47.060 --> 47:48.500
And this speech goes like this.

47:48.820 --> 47:53.380
My fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being a baseball, but we

47:53.420 --> 47:57.780
must move forward, not backward, upward, not forward, twirling, twirling

47:57.780 --> 48:02.300
towards freedom and people go, and there's a rush, nothing, there's

48:02.300 --> 48:07.660
nothing there and yet it's great satire because a lot of political

48:07.660 --> 48:10.140
speech is exactly like that.

48:10.140 --> 48:12.100
There's nothing there, right?

48:12.420 --> 48:15.780
Well, I'm not saying all political speech.

48:15.780 --> 48:16.580
I said a lot.

48:16.980 --> 48:20.380
No, but there, there is a fundamental difference between, and this is so hilarious.

48:20.380 --> 48:24.580
I remember that episode, uh, there's a fundamental difference between that

48:24.580 --> 48:29.620
absurd sort of non secular speech and political speech, cause one of the

48:29.620 --> 48:35.060
things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.

48:35.460 --> 48:41.340
And so if that requires you talking about alternative facts and

48:41.900 --> 48:48.460
weird self destructive, oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching

48:48.460 --> 48:49.940
pole pure bullshit?

48:51.500 --> 48:57.820
No, I think, I think pure bullshit, uh, like the vacuum is, uh, is very

48:57.820 --> 49:01.380
difficult to, uh, to get to, uh, but I get the point.

49:01.620 --> 49:05.980
So what exactly is truth?

49:07.260 --> 49:08.820
Is it possible to know?

49:09.380 --> 49:11.700
I think Spinoza is right about truth.

49:11.700 --> 49:15.660
That truth is only known by its own standard, which sounds circular.

49:16.020 --> 49:18.420
There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly.

49:18.420 --> 49:20.860
And I think this is also converges with Plato.

49:20.980 --> 49:22.940
These are two huge influences on me.

49:24.500 --> 49:30.180
I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we, when we go

49:30.180 --> 49:33.620
through some process of self-transcendence, when we move from a

49:33.620 --> 49:37.860
frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and

49:37.860 --> 49:40.780
the distortions of the earlier frame.

49:40.780 --> 49:44.340
You have this, when you have a moment of insight, insight is you doing

49:44.820 --> 49:47.420
your, you are re-realizing what is relevant.

49:48.540 --> 49:55.100
You go, Oh, Oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry.

49:55.100 --> 49:56.900
She's actually really afraid.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.060
I was miss framing this.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.700
I, and you change what you find relevant.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.300
You have those aha moments.

50:05.660 --> 50:13.260
So do you think it's possible to get a sense of objective reality?

50:13.900 --> 50:19.620
So is it possible to have, to get to the ground level of what, something

50:19.620 --> 50:21.340
that you can call objective truth?

50:22.580 --> 50:24.380
Or is it, are we always on shaky ground?

50:26.580 --> 50:30.540
I think those moments of transcendence can never get us

50:30.580 --> 50:33.140
to an absolute view from nowhere.

50:34.340 --> 50:38.180
I, and so this is Drew Highland's notion of finite transcendence.

50:38.180 --> 50:42.300
We are capable of self-transcendence and therefore we are creatures who can

50:42.300 --> 50:45.620
actually raise the question of truth or goodness or beauty.

50:45.940 --> 50:50.820
Cause I think they're, they all share this feature, but that doesn't mean we

50:50.820 --> 50:56.580
can transcend to a godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere that takes

50:56.580 --> 51:02.980
in all information and organizes it in a comprehensive whole, but that doesn't

51:02.980 --> 51:05.820
mean that truth is thereby rendered valueless.

51:06.460 --> 51:18.140
Um, I, I think a better term is real and real and illusory are comparative terms.

51:18.460 --> 51:23.540
You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real.

51:24.580 --> 51:28.700
And so we're always in a comparative task, but that doesn't mean that

51:28.700 --> 51:34.620
we can, we can somehow jump outside of our framing in some final manner and

51:34.620 --> 51:38.740
say, this is how it is from a God's eye point of view.

51:38.980 --> 51:44.020
So what do you think, if I may ask, uh, of somebody like Ayn Rand and

51:44.020 --> 51:45.980
her philosophy of objectivism.

51:46.820 --> 51:50.220
So where the core principle is that reality exists independently of

51:50.220 --> 51:53.820
consciousness and that human beings have direct contact with reality

51:53.820 --> 51:54.900
through sense perception.

51:54.900 --> 52:00.220
So they have that, you do have that ability to know reality.

52:00.300 --> 52:01.180
There's two things.

52:01.220 --> 52:04.420
Knowing that there's an independent reality is not

52:04.420 --> 52:06.820
knowing in that independent reality.

52:06.860 --> 52:08.100
Those are not the same thing.

52:08.500 --> 52:08.620
Yeah.

52:08.620 --> 52:14.700
But I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is

52:14.700 --> 52:17.220
able to have contact with that.

52:17.220 --> 52:23.180
Then I would respond and say, you have to, I believe in fact, ultimately,

52:23.180 --> 52:27.540
in a conformity theory of knowing that what, that the deepest kind of

52:27.540 --> 52:34.300
knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity between the mind with

52:34.300 --> 52:36.060
the embodied mind and reality.

52:36.580 --> 52:40.820
But, and here's where I guess I'd push back on Rand.

52:40.820 --> 52:46.540
I would say you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge,

52:46.860 --> 52:49.860
because if you don't, you're going to fall prey to Mino's paradox.

52:50.620 --> 52:53.660
Mino's paradox is, you know, this is in Plato, right?

52:54.740 --> 52:55.380
To know P.

52:55.940 --> 52:59.900
Well, if I don't know P, I'm going to go looking for it.

53:00.620 --> 53:03.780
But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I found it?

53:04.700 --> 53:05.820
I have no way of recognizing it.

53:05.940 --> 53:08.180
I have no way of knowing that I've found it.

53:08.980 --> 53:13.140
So I must know P, but if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it.

53:13.140 --> 53:14.220
I don't need to go searching.

53:15.980 --> 53:17.660
So learning doesn't exist.

53:17.740 --> 53:18.980
Knowledge is impossible.

53:19.700 --> 53:23.020
The way you break out of that paradox is saying, no, no, no, it is

53:23.940 --> 53:26.060
possible to partially know something.

53:26.580 --> 53:31.180
I can know it enough that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not

53:31.180 --> 53:34.940
the same as having a complete grasp of it because I still have to search and

53:34.940 --> 53:37.700
find what I don't yet possess in my knowledge.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.740
If we, so, yeah, partial knowledge has to be real knowledge.

53:43.220 --> 53:43.580
Right.

53:43.620 --> 53:45.100
Partial knowledge is still knowledge.

53:45.140 --> 53:45.660
Yes.

53:46.340 --> 53:50.500
What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman who thinks

53:50.500 --> 53:52.180
the reality is an illusion?

53:52.620 --> 53:58.700
So complete illusion that we're given this actually really nice definition

53:59.140 --> 54:02.220
or idea that you talked about, that there's a tension between the, the

54:02.220 --> 54:04.580
illusory and the, and what is real.

54:05.300 --> 54:12.460
He says that basically we taken that and we ran with the real to the point where

54:12.660 --> 54:17.820
the real is not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.

54:18.700 --> 54:20.060
I hope to talk to him at some point.

54:20.060 --> 54:21.340
We were supposed to talk at one point.

54:21.420 --> 54:23.620
And so I have to talk in his absence.

54:24.020 --> 54:30.300
Um, I think that, first of all, I think saying that everything in his illusion is

54:30.300 --> 54:31.660
like saying everything is tall.

54:31.700 --> 54:32.620
It doesn't make any sense.

54:32.620 --> 54:33.620
It's a comparative term.

54:34.020 --> 54:41.020
Um, something you have to say against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.

54:42.100 --> 54:49.780
And he uses arguments like from evolution, which are problematic to me

54:49.780 --> 54:56.180
because it's like, well, you seem to be saying that evolution is true,

54:56.220 --> 54:58.060
that it really exists.

54:58.620 --> 55:06.980
And then some of our cognition and a perception has access to reality math

55:06.980 --> 55:09.700
and presumably some science has access to reality.

55:10.140 --> 55:16.460
And then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday

55:16.500 --> 55:22.500
experience is illusory, but that we do have some contact with reality whereby

55:22.500 --> 55:26.740
we can make the arguments as to why most of your experience, most of your

55:26.740 --> 55:28.260
everyday experience is an illusion.

55:28.780 --> 55:31.180
But to me, that's not a novel thing.

55:31.340 --> 55:32.980
That's, that's, that's Descartes.

55:33.380 --> 55:36.980
That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy, but the

55:36.980 --> 55:39.100
math is what connects us to reality.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.540
That's how he interpreted the Copernican revolution.

55:41.940 --> 55:45.660
Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set.

55:45.700 --> 55:49.660
And it's all an illusion, but the math, the math gets us to the reality.

55:49.700 --> 55:55.420
Well, I think he, he makes a deeper point that most of cognition is just, is

55:55.540 --> 55:59.420
evolved and operates in the illusory world.

55:59.460 --> 56:02.580
How does he know that things like cognition and evolution exist?

56:03.980 --> 56:09.500
I think there's an important distinction between evolution and cognition, right?

56:09.580 --> 56:11.700
No, no, I'm just saying that's not the point I'm making.

56:11.700 --> 56:14.660
I'm making a point that he's claiming that there are two things that really

56:14.660 --> 56:15.140
exist.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.340
Why are they privileged?

56:19.620 --> 56:26.300
He basically says that, look, the process of evolution makes sense, right?

56:26.500 --> 56:30.140
Like it makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple organisms through

56:30.140 --> 56:31.660
the natural selection process.

56:32.100 --> 56:35.180
Here's how you get to transfer information from generation to

56:35.180 --> 56:35.900
generation.

56:36.140 --> 56:36.820
It makes sense.

56:37.220 --> 56:43.420
And then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition to evolve in

56:43.420 --> 56:48.060
a way that it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the

56:48.060 --> 56:49.100
physical reality.

56:49.620 --> 56:53.620
Except that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of

56:53.620 --> 56:57.340
evolution and you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing.

56:57.740 --> 57:00.940
Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics.

57:00.980 --> 57:04.860
It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.

57:05.220 --> 57:08.460
It depends on how chromosomes are structured.

57:08.660 --> 57:12.820
Actually, that's an interesting question to him where I don't know if he actually

57:12.820 --> 57:17.260
would push back on this is how do you know evolution is real?

57:17.540 --> 57:17.940
Yes.

57:20.020 --> 57:25.020
I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we

57:25.020 --> 57:31.900
constructed, that there's some, it's in some sense, it is connected to reality,

57:31.900 --> 57:33.660
but we don't have a clear picture of it.

57:34.220 --> 57:38.660
I mean, that's an intellectually honest statement.

57:38.940 --> 57:46.780
If most of our cognition as thinking beings is operating at every level in an

57:46.780 --> 57:52.580
illusory world, then it makes sense that this one of the main theories of science

57:52.580 --> 57:58.420
that's evolution is also a complete part of this illusory world.

57:58.580 --> 57:59.020
Right.

57:59.100 --> 58:03.420
But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion

58:03.460 --> 58:04.660
that cognition is illusory?

58:04.700 --> 58:09.260
I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an explanation of why

58:09.420 --> 58:15.660
the world is of our cognition operating in the illusory world, but that's just

58:15.660 --> 58:16.940
one of the explanations.

58:17.060 --> 58:22.140
I think the deeper question is, why do we think we have contact with

58:22.140 --> 58:24.420
reality, with physical reality?

58:25.500 --> 58:34.100
We could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by our minds in a way

58:34.100 --> 58:38.340
that makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody

58:38.340 --> 58:43.700
playing a video game or we're trying to, through the process of distributed

58:43.700 --> 58:47.540
cognition, construct more and more complex objects.

58:47.580 --> 58:53.500
Like, why do we have to, why, why does it have to be connected to like physics

58:53.500 --> 58:55.020
and planets and all that kind of stuff?

58:55.140 --> 58:55.460
Okay.

58:55.460 --> 59:00.140
So if we're going to say like, we're now considering it as a possibility rather

59:00.180 --> 59:04.740
than it's a conclusion based on arguments, because the arguments again, will always

59:04.740 --> 59:07.940
rely on stipulating that there is something that is known.

59:08.580 --> 59:10.100
These are the features of cognition.

59:10.420 --> 59:12.260
Cognition is capable of illusion.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.460
That's a true statement.

59:13.700 --> 59:15.540
You're somehow in contact with the mind.

59:15.820 --> 59:20.580
Why does the mind have this privileged contact and other aspects like my body do

59:20.580 --> 59:24.860
not, so that's, but let's put that aside and now let's just consider it.

59:25.580 --> 59:29.420
Now, when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore.

59:29.420 --> 59:30.580
It's an existential question.

59:30.580 --> 59:31.740
And here's my reply to you.

59:32.100 --> 59:37.900
There's two possibilities, either the illusion is one that I cannot discover

59:38.380 --> 59:42.180
sort of, you know, the matrix on steroids or something.

59:42.180 --> 59:46.460
There's no way, no matter what I do, I can't find out that it's an illusion.

59:48.660 --> 59:52.300
Or it's an illusion, but I can find out that it's an illusion.

59:54.660 --> 59:55.900
Those are the two possibilities.

59:56.380 --> 59:57.900
Nothing changes for me.

59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.980
If those are the two possibilities, because if I could not find, possibly

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:06.420
find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention to that possibility.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.020
So I could keep, I should keep doing the science as I'm doing it.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.740
If there's a way of finding out science is my best bet.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.180
I believe for finding out if it's what's true and what's an illusion.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.580
So I keep doing what I'm doing.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.820
So it's an argument.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.100
If you move it to that, that makes no existential difference to me.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.100
Oh man.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.060
That is such a deeply philosophical argument.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:37.300
Uh, nobody's saying science doesn't work.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.900
It's an interesting question.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.500
Just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a question.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.220
Can we build a machine that makes us fly in that same way?

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.020
We're asking a question to which we don't know an answer, but we may know

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.660
in the future how much of this whole thing is an illusion.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.060
And I think in a second category, the first guy, I forgot which one.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:01.700
Yes.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.140
Science will be able to help us discover this.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.540
Uh, otherwise, yes, for sure.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:07.980
That doesn't matter.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:12.860
If we're living in a simulation, we can't find out at all, then it doesn't matter.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.220
But yes, the whole point is as we get deeper and deeper understanding of our

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:23.740
mind of cognition, we might be able to discover like how much of this is a big

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.700
charade constructed by our mind to keep us fed or something like that.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.300
Some, some weird, uh, some weird, very simplistic explanation that it will

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.460
ultimately in its simplicity be beautiful.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:42.940
Or as we tried to build robots and instill them, instill them with

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:51.460
consciousness, with ability to feel those kinds of things we'll, we'll discover.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:56.580
Well, let's just trick them into thinking they feel and have

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.220
consciousness and they'll believe it.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.300
And then they'll have a deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.700
And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way that will

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.020
make our lives more meaningful.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.100
And then all of a sudden it's like at the end of animal farm,

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.300
you look at pigs and humans.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.940
You look at robots and humans, you can't tell the difference between either.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:20.180
And we, in that way, start to understand that, um, that much of

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.860
this existence could be an illusion.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:22.860
Okay.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.020
Well, I have two responses to that.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:33.980
Uh, first is, uh, the progress that's being made on like AGI is about making

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.540
whatever the system is, that's going to be the source of intelligent more and

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.580
more dynamically and recursively self-correcting.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.220
That's part of what's happening.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.340
Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.140
better at self-correcting, but that's exactly what I was describing

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.700
before as the transformative theory of truth.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:05.820
The other response to that is science, like people think of science just

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.820
as right sort of end proposition.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.260
But let me just use the evolutionary example again, right?

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.980
Like I need, I, I, I need, if I, if I'm gathering the evidence, I need to

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.260
know a lot of geology, I need to know plate tectonics, I need to know about

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.620
radioactive decay, I need to know about genetics and then, and, and then in order

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.740
to measure all those things, I need to know how to, how microscopes work.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.260
I need to know how pencils and paper work.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.900
I need to know how rulers work.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:38.460
I need to know how English like, like you can't isolate knowledge that way.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.020
And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:47.260
position of saying somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.420
I think it goes in reverse.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.460
If you think this is the truth claim, right?

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.780
The measuring and all the things that scientists would do to gather on all

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.860
the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to be

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:07.900
fundamentally right because it's not like Lego, it is an interwoven hole.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.180
Yes, it definitely is interwoven, but I love how I played that.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.620
I'm playing the devil advocate for the illusion world, but, uh, there's a

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.260
consistent, I mean, there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.820
consistent across an entire system.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.340
But inside a video game, that's some kind of, that's some same

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.340
kind of consistency evolves.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.100
There's rules about interactions.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.340
Then it's game theoretic patterns about what's good and bad and so on.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.900
You get, and there's sources of joy and fear and anger and, and then

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.380
understanding about a world, what happens in different dynamics of a video

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.060
game, even simple video games.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.980
So there's no, you know, even in an, inside an illusion, you can have

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:56.460
consistency and develop truths inside that illusion and, uh, iteratively

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.180
evolve your truth with the illusion.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:04:59.820
Okay.

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:00.860
But then it comes back.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.780
Does that, is that process genuinely self-correcting or are you in the

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.780
simulation in which there is no possible doorway out?

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:13.420
Because if my argument is, if you find one or two doorways that feeds back, in

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.380
fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island where we have the truth.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.580
That's the point I'm making.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.060
Right.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:23.700
But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:28.100
And what if, uh, you find a doorway and you step out, but you're

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.660
yet in another simulation?

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:35.020
I mean, that's the point that's so self-correcting when you fix the

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.700
self-deception, you don't know if there's other bigger self-deceptions

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.460
you're operating on.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.420
Of course, in, in one sense, that's right.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:48.700
But again, we're back to when I step into the second simulation, is it, uh,

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.020
can I get the doorway out of that or right?

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.500
Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you've basically

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.220
said, I have a simulation that I can never get out of.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:57.740
Yeah.

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.580
I think there's always a bigger pile of bullshit is that the claim

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.420
I'm trying to make here.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:02.580
Okay.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.180
Let me dance around meaning once more.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:15.580
I often ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.660
talked to in a room when I'm all by myself, uh, the question of the meaning of life.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.780
Do you think this is a useful question?

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.460
You drew a line between meaning in life.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.180
And meaning of life.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.580
Do you think this is a useful question?

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.340
No, I think it's like the question.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.300
What's north of the North pole or what time is it on the sun?

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.940
It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question, uh,

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.740
because it has a presupposition in it that I think is fundamentally flawed.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:50.020
Um, if I understand what people mean by it, and it's actually often not that clear,

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.020
but when they talk about the meaning of life, they are talking about, there are

01:06:53.060 --> 01:07:00.100
some feature of the universe in and of itself that I have to discover and enter

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:05.140
into a relationship with, and there's in that sense, a plan for me or something.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.460
And so that's a property of the universe.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:14.620
That's a very deep, um, serious metaphysical ontological claim.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.980
You're, you're claiming to know something fundamental about the structure of reality.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.500
There were times when people thought they had a worldview that

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.940
legitimated it, like God is running the universe and therefore, and God cares

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.660
about you and there's a plan, et cetera.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:34.660
But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not right.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.500
It's meaning is like the grasp ability.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.020
Remember I talked about optimal grip.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.620
It's like the grasp ability of that cup.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.380
Is that in me?

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.420
No.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.060
Is it in the cup?

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.060
No, because the fly can't grasp it.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:47.980
Right.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.980
Well, grasp abilities in my hand.

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.780
Well, I can't grasp Africa.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:58.020
No, no, there is a real relation fittedness between me in this cup.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.540
Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism is the adaptivity of a great

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.820
white shark in the great white shark, drop it in the Sahara does.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:05.780
Okay.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.420
Meaning isn't in me.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:14.540
I think that's romantic bullshit and it isn't in the universe.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.100
It is a proper relationship.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.020
I've coined the phrase transjective.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.860
It is the binding relationship between this objective and the objective.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:29.100
And therefore when you're asking the question about the meaning of life, you

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:34.860
are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning, just like when you ask what

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.580
time is it on the sun, you're misrepresenting how we, how we derive clock time.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.500
Uh, at the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.220
crisis, let me, uh, hard disagree.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:51.540
Uh, but I think we'll probably agree, but it's just like a dance, like any dialogue.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:58.860
I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and the

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:08.180
glass of water between whatever the forces of the universe that created the

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:19.140
planets, the proteins, the multi-cell organisms, the intelligent, early humans,

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.100
the beautiful human civilizations and the technologies that will overtake them.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:36.180
It's trying to understand the, the relevance realization of the big bang

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:40.500
to the feeling of love you have for another human being.

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:47.380
It's reaching for that, even though it's hopeless to understand it's the question.

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.620
The asking of the question is the reaching.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:10:00.380
Now it is in fact, romantic bullshit, technically speaking, but it could be

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.860
that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life.

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.860
And the source of his deepest meaning.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.820
Well, I hope not, uh, but, uh, technically speaking, romantic bullshit,

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.380
meaning romantic in the philosophical sense.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:18.660
Yes.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.340
So I, I mean, what is poetry?

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.260
What is music?

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.460
What is the magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music?

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.260
What is that?

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.260
Oh, but that's exactly to my point.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.780
Is music inside you or is it outside you?

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.820
It's both and neither.

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.060
And that's precisely why you find it so meaningful.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.820
In fact, it can be so meaningful.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.140
You can regard it as sacred.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.380
What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement,

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:47.980
right?

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:54.180
What you said is no, no, no, there is, there's a way in which reality is realizing

01:10:54.180 --> 01:11:03.260
itself and I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.780
The sort of meta optimal grip to what is most real.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:07.740
I totally agree.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:11.060
I totally think that's one of the things I said this earlier.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:15.460
One of our meta desires is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.980
I do this with my students.

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:22.540
I'll say, um, you know, cause romantic relationships are sort of take the role of

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.100
God and religion and history and culture for us right now.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.420
We, we put everything on them and that's why they break, but right.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.700
Strong words.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:30.780
Got it.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.900
But I'll say to them, okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.140
relationships put up your hands?

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:41.020
Then I'll say, okay, I'm now only talking to these people of those people.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.380
How many of you would want to know your partner's cheating on you, even if it

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.620
means the destruction of the relationship, 95% of them put up their hands.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.060
And I say, but why?

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.220
And they, and, and here's my students who are usually all sort of bitten with

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:58.060
cynicism and postmodernism and they'll just say spontaneously, well, because it's

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.860
not real because it's not real.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:02.260
Right.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:11.380
So I think what you're pointing to is actually you're pointing not to an

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.060
objective or a subjective thing.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.140
So romanticism says it's subjective.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.380
There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.740
empiricism says it's objective, but you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:27.340
realization and can I get relevance realization to be optimally gripping in

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.420
the best right relationship with it?

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.060
And, and there's good reason you can, because think about it.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.260
Your relevance realization isn't just representing properties of the

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.660
world, it's instantiating it.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.380
There's something very similar to biological evolution, which is that

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:45.460
the guts of life, if I'm right, running your cognition, it's not just

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:50.300
that you have ideas, you actually instantiate, that's what I mean by

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.420
conformity, the same principles they're within and without, they don't belong

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.300
to you subjectively, they're not just out there, they're in both at

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.540
the same time and they help to explain how you are actually bound

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.260
to the evolutionary world.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.140
Yeah.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:08.540
So it comes from both inside and from the outside, but there's still the

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.380
question of the meaning of life.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:16.380
First of all, the big benefit of that question is that it shakes you out of

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:22.700
your hamster in a wheel that is daily life, the mundane process of daily

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.740
life, where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids, you have to

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:31.300
take them to school, then you go to work and it repeats over and over

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:35.100
and over and over, and then you get increased salary and then you upgrade

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.660
the home and that whole process.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:47.020
Asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit that if

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:52.740
you just allow yourself to take it seriously for a second, it forces

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:57.860
you to pause and think like, what, what's going on here?

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.060
And then it ultimately, I think does return to the question of meaning

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.740
in those mundane things.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.780
What gives, what gives my life joy?

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:11.940
What gives it lasting deliciousness?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.700
Where do I notice the magic and how can I have that magic return again and

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:21.260
again, beauty, and that that ultimately would returns to, but it's a, the same

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:24.500
thing you do when you look up to the sky, you spend most of your day hurrying

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.060
around, looking at things on the surface.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.980
But when you look up to the sky and you see the stars, it fills you with the

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:37.980
feeling of awe that forces you to pause and think in full context of like, what

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.140
the hell is going on here?

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:47.540
That, but also I think, um, there is a, when you think too much about the

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:54.180
meaning of a glass and a relevance realization of a glass, you don't

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.620
necessarily get at the core of what makes music beautiful.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.660
So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:07.100
And I think meaning of life forces you to really go to the big bang and go, go,

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:12.260
go to the, go to the universe and the whole thing, the origin of life.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.820
And I think, um, sometimes you have to start there to discover the

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.820
meaning in the day to day, I think.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.020
But perhaps you would disagree.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:31.020
Insofar as the question makes you ask about, um, the, the, the whole of your

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:36.060
life and how much meaning is in the whole of your life and insofar as it asks how

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:42.220
much that is connected to reality, it's a good question, but it's a bad

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.180
question in that it also makes you look for the answers in the wrong way.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:51.380
Now you said, and I agree with what you said, what, how we really answer this

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.420
question is we come back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.980
in life is connected to reality.

01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.900
We pursue wisdom.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:04.820
And so for me, the question, I don't need that question in order

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.700
to provoke me into that stance.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:10.780
So let's return to the meaning crisis.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:11.180
Yes.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.220
What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times?

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:18.860
What's its origin?

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:19.980
What's the explanation?

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.580
Well, remember what I said, what I argued that the very processes that make us

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.940
adaptively intelligent, subject us to perennial problems of self-deception,

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.020
self-destruction, creating bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:38.100
And that can cause, you know, anxiety, existential anxiety.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.340
It can cause despair.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.460
It can cause a sense of absurdity.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.260
These are perennial problems.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:53.660
And across cultures and across historical periods, human beings have

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.460
come up with ecologies of practices.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.500
There's no one practice.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.620
There's no panacea practice.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.740
They've come up with ecologies of practices for ameliorating that self-deception

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.140
and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness that's at the core of

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:07.780
meaning in life.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.420
That's prototypically what we call wisdom.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:19.140
And here's how I can show you one clear instance of the meaning

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:22.260
crisis is it's a wisdom famine.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.380
I can, I do this regularly with my students.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.740
In the classroom, I'll say, where do you go for information?

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.740
They hold up their phone.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540
Where do you go for knowledge?

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.300
They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my class, they'll say,

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.100
well, science, the university, and I'll say, where do you go for wisdom?

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:42.740
There's a silence.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.020
Wisdom isn't optional.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.780
That's why it is perennial, cross-cultural, cross-historical

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.860
because of the perennial problems.

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:59.460
But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.940
technological worldview so that they are considered legitimate.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.540
The fastest growing demographic group are the nuns, N-O-N-E-S's.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.180
They have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:17.260
They most frequently describe themselves with this very, this has become almost

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:23.060
everybody now described, I'm spiritual, but not religious, which means they are

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:28.660
trying to find a way of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness,

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:34.380
but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy established religions by and large.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:44.740
Well, isn't both religion and the nuns, isn't wisdom a process, not a destination?

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:51.060
So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.780
trying to find, right?

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:59.060
So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.820
around which you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search.

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:10.500
So I guess, is there a case to be made that this is just the usual human condition?

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:12.700
How do you answer?

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.940
If you ask five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom?

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:22.580
I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to answer, well, the Bible

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.460
or a religious text.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:24.940
Right.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:31.140
And they had a worldview that was considered not just religious, but also rational.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:37.900
So we now have these two things, orthogonal or often oppositional,

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.060
spirituality and rationality.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.260
But if you go before a particular historical period, you look back in the

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:48.180
Neoplatonic tradition, like before the scientific revolution, those two are

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:53.940
not in opposition, they are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:59.060
of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding in your practices.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.980
We don't have that anymore.

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.460
And I'm not advocating for religion.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.180
Neither am I an enemy of religion.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.140
I'll strengthen your case, by the way.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:12.540
So one of my RAs did research and you get people who have committed

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.420
themselves to cultivating wisdom.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.980
And you can look at people within religious traditions and people who are

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.940
doing it in a purely secular framework.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:27.100
By many of the measures we use to try to study wisdom scientifically, the people

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:33.940
in the religious paths do better than the secular, but here's the important point.

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.740
There's no significant difference between the religious paths.

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:42.100
So it's not like if you're, you know, following the path of Judaism, you're

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.220
more likely to end up wiser than if you follow Buddhism.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.140
By the way, I don't know if that's my case.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.420
I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.380
affiliation to search for wisdom.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:57.140
It's that I thought along to the point you just made that it doesn't matter

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.500
which religious affiliation or none.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.580
But that's what I'm saying.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:01.780
Okay.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.420
So this is the tricky thing we're in.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:03.740
Yeah.

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.660
It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.020
the propositional creeds of that.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.820
There's something else at work.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:16.260
There's a, if you'll allow me this, there's a functionality to religion that

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.740
we lost when we rejected all the propositional dogma, but there was a

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.900
functionality there that we don't know how to recreate.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:25.100
Yeah.

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:25.620
What is that?

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.740
Can you try to speak to that?

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.100
What is that functionality?

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.180
What is that?

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.540
Why is that so useful?

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:35.580
A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:41.220
drenched in like deep lessons about morality and all those kinds of things.

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.980
What is the, what's the, what's the functional thing there that can't be

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.900
replaced without a religious text by non-religious text?

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.540
This is for me, the golden question.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.140
So thank you.

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.180
Um, do you have an answer?

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:58.340
Yeah, I have, I think I have a significant answer.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.060
I don't think it's complete, but I think it's important.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:08.700
And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and think about

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.380
many different kinds of knowing.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.940
And this is now something that is prominent within what's called

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.220
4E cognitive science, the kind of cognitive science I practice.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.260
And there's a lot of converging evidence for, okay, these

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.740
different ways of knowing.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.260
There's propositional knowing.

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.860
This is what we are most familiar with.

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.940
In fact, it's almost, it's almost has a tyrannical status, right?

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.300
First time.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.260
So this is knowing that something is the case, like the cats are mammals

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:34.940
and it's stored in semantic memory.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:39.300
And we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right?

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.460
There's procedural knowing.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
This is knowing how to do something.

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.740
This is skills are not theories.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.460
They're not beliefs.

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:49.580
They're not true or false.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.820
They engage the world or they don't, and they are stored in a

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.780
different kind of memory, procedural memory.

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:01.700
Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.660
That's why, you know, you have the prototypical story of somebody

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.940
suffering Alzheimer's and they're losing all kinds of facts, but they

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:10.420
can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.180
Same kind of argument.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.980
There is perspectival knowing.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:18.940
This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation,

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:22.380
in this state of mind, the whole field of your salience landscaping,

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.420
what it's like to be you here now.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.700
And you have a specific kind of memory around that, episodic memory.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.500
And you have a different sense, you have a different criterion of realness.

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:37.700
So you can, you can get this by, well, we, my friend Dan Shapi and I, we

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.820
studied the, the scientists using, moving the rovers around, or you

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.780
can take a look at people who are doing VR.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.260
People talk about, you know, they want, they want to really be in

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.260
the game and that makes it real.

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.020
They don't mean verisimilitude.

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.500
You can get that right.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.140
Sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which has,

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:00.060
isn't like, it doesn't look like the real world and you can fail to

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:05.060
have it in a video game that is, has a lot of verisimilitude is something else.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:09.180
It's about again, this, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:13.060
If I may interrupt, is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness,

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.380
the subject, the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing is

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.300
that different from the qualia of consciousness?

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:21.860
I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.580
adjectival and the adverbial qualia.

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.340
So I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more with

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:27.620
the, than with the adjectival.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:32.020
So the adjectival qualia are like the greenness of green and the blueness

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:32.420
of bloom.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:40.260
The adverbial qualia are the here-ness, the now-ness, the togetherness.

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:40.460
Yeah.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.740
And I think the perspectival knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.340
Adjectival qualia and adverbial qualia.

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.100
I'm learning so many new things today.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:50.700
Okay.

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.700
So, uh, that's another way of knowing.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.020
Right.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.620
The perspectival, and then there's a deeper one.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.740
And this is a philosophical point.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:01.220
I, uh, and I don't want to, I mean, we can go through the argument, right?

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.380
But you don't have to know that, you know, in order to know, because

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.420
if you start doing that, you get an infinite regress.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.940
There ha there has to be kinds of knowing.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:09.380
That doesn't mean you know that you know that.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.460
Yeah.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:12.900
Okay.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:13.340
Of course.

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:13.660
Okay.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.020
Great.

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.380
Okay.

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:14.620
Good.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.140
Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that over a 40 year period.

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.780
So by philosophers, they spill, this is what they do.

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.580
They spill ink.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:22.900
Yeah.

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.300
But I want to talk for ink spillage.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.060
So I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:35.540
This is the idea that you and the world are co-participating in things and such

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.060
that real affordances exist between you.

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.300
So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity.

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.660
So the affordance of walking becomes available to me.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:51.340
Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped by my biology.

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.380
And so affordances for that are here.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:26:02.860
Look at this cup, shared physics, shared sort of biological factors, my hand, I'm

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.700
bipedal, also culture is shaping me and shaping this.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.580
I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup.

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.380
So this is an agent arena relationship, right?

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:20.900
There's identities being created in your agency, identities being created in the

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.980
world as an arena.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:23.860
So you and the world fit together.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.260
You know when that's missing, when you're really lonely or you're homesick or you're

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.860
such suffering culture shock.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:36.540
So this is participatory knowing and it's the sense of, it comes with a sense of

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.540
belonging at every level.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:46.820
So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing that there's a dance between the

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:53.420
physics that enables this process and just participating in the process is the

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.340
act of knowing.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.020
Right.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:59.140
And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind of knowing.

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.260
It's called yourself.

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:01.700
What?

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.020
Can you elaborate?

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:09.180
Well, so we talked about how all the different, other kinds of knowing had

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.580
specific kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional procedural, right?

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.260
Episodic for perspectival.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:21.020
What do you, what's the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse of all

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.980
of your agent arena relationships, all the roles you can take, all the identities

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.300
you can assume, all the identities you can assign.

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.660
What's, what's the self?

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:35.340
Do you mean like consciousness or like your sense of self sense of self in this

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.260
world that's not consciousness.

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.940
That's a, like an agency or something, right?

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.780
It's an agent arena relationship.

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:50.300
And so in an agent arena relationship is the sense of the agent and, and, and

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.300
that the agent belongs in that arena.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.780
Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:28:01.460
Cause it's probably a bunch of different framings of how you experience that.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:01.940
Yeah.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:06.660
And you, and you do, you have all within your identity as a self, you have all kinds

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.860
of roles that are somehow contributing to that identity, but are not

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.140
equivalent to that identity.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:13.540
Yeah.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.540
I wonder if like my two hands have different.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.980
Cause there's a different experience to me picking up something with my right

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.140
hand and then my left hand.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:29.420
So are those like, uh, that's a really cool question, Lex, and they certainly

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:36.220
feel like their own things, but that could be just, uh, anthropomorphization

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.860
based on cultural narratives and so on.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.860
It could, it could, but I think it's a legitimate empirical question.

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.100
Cause it also could be sort of Ian McGilchrist stuff.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:47.060
It could be, you're using different hemispheres and they sort of have different

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.420
agent and arena relationships to the environment.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.180
This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.220
Does the, does that hemispheric difference mean you're multiple or

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.540
you actually have a singular self?

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.060
Oh, so it's important to understand how many cells are there.

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.540
Yes, I think so.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.820
But that's, that's just like a quirk of evolution.

01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:09.740
That's a, it's not, it surely can't be fundamental to cognition, having

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.060
multiple cells or a singular self.

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.820
It depends.

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:18.740
Um, again, because, uh, we're getting far from the answer to the question

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.620
you originally asked me, do we want, you want me to go back to that first?

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.260
Or answer this one?

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:22.860
Which question?

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860
I already forgot everything.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.380
What's the functionality of religion?

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.340
Yes.

01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.500
Okay.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.140
And then we can return to the self.

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:30.940
Okay.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:35.060
So you said, you know, you have all these propositions and et cetera, et cetera,

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:39.060
and they different from the religions and the, the, the, the, the, the,

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.860
religions and they're not, they don't seem to be considered

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.300
legitimate by many people.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.860
But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.220
people and making them wiser.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.620
And I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring

01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.260
at those non-propositional levels.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:03.620
The procedural, the perspectival and the participatory.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.220
And those are the ones by the way, that are more fundamentally

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.580
connected to meaning making.

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:11.700
Cause remember the propositions are representational and they're

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:16.620
dependent on the non-propositional, non-representational processes of

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.300
connectedness and relevance realization.

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:22.060
So religion goes down deep to the non-propositional and works there.

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:24.220
That's the functionality we need to grasp.

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:29.540
Well, you talk about tools essentially, that humans are able to incorporate

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:33.820
it into their cognition, psychotechnologies, like language is one, I suppose.

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:39.700
Uh, isn't religion then a psychotechnology?

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.100
It would be a, yeah.

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.740
An ecology of psychotechnologies.

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.060
Yes.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:48.300
And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:54.500
Uh, do we have to invent the new thing, go to go to, from the old phone, create

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.740
the iPhone, invent the new psychotechnology that takes place of religion.

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:02.980
And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace,

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.220
who's he talking to?

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.140
He's not talking to the believers.

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:10.940
He's talking to the atheist and he says, do you not realize what we have done?

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:11.580
Right?

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.860
We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.

01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:16.300
We are now forever falling.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.740
We are unchained from the sun.

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.140
We have to become worthy of this.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:20.700
Yeah.

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.300
What Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit.

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:24.140
No, no, no, no.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.140
But there's a point there.

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:25.460
Yes.

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.420
The point is, right.

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:31.220
There's one thing to rejecting the proposition.

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:36.260
There's another project of replacing the functionality that we lost

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.820
when we reject the religion.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.460
So his worry that is nihilism takes hold.

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:47.740
You don't ever replace the thing that's religion, uh, the role

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.100
that religion played in our.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.060
Maybe it's, it's hard to tell what he actually, cause he's so multivocal.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.980
Um, I, I, I'll speak for me other than for Nietzsche.

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:03.260
I think it is possible to using the best cognitive science and respectfully

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.700
exacting what we can from the best religion and philosophy, philosophical

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:12.020
traditions, cause there's things like stoicism that are in the gray line

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.300
between philosophy and religion.

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.100
Buddhism is the same.

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:22.620
Doing that best coxi, that best exaptation, we can come up with that

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:28.140
functionality without having to buy into the particular propositional

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:30.100
sets of the legacy religions.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.620
That's my proposal.

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:32.700
I call that the religion.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.500
That's not a religion.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:39.020
So things like stoicism or modern stoicism, those things, don't you

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.260
think in some sense, they naturally emerge?

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.860
Don't you think there's a longing for meaning?

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:51.540
So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:56.220
significant meaning crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened

01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:00.180
after the breakup of Alexander the Great's empire.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:05.500
So if you, if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after, um,

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.740
Alexander, so Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.820
has a language, has the same religion.

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.780
His ancestors have been there for years.

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:19.500
He knows everybody after Alexander the Great's empire broken is broken up.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:23.220
People are now thousands of miles away from the government.

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.660
They're surrounded by people because of the Diasporas, right?

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:30.180
The Diasporas, I should say, they're surrounded by people that don't speak

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.060
their language, don't share their religion.

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.900
That's why you get all these mother religions emerging, right?

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.380
Universal mother religions like ISIS, et cetera.

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.660
So there is a, there is what's called domicide.

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.220
There's the killing of home.

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:47.100
There's a loss of a sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:52.260
Hellenistic period and stoicism arose specifically to address that.

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:57.100
And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence

01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.060
that it is coming back into prominence right now.

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.060
Well, there, there could be a lot of other variations and it feels, it feels

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:10.260
like, I think when you speak of the meaning crisis, you're in part describing,

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.500
not prescribing, you're describing something that is happening, but I would

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:22.540
venture to say that if we just leave things be, the, the meaning crisis

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:29.180
dissipates because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas.

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:32.900
So there's distributed cognition process that give us meaning.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.620
So if religion loses power, we'll find other institutions

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.900
that are sources of meaning.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.460
I don't, is that, is that, is that your intuition as well?

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.860
I think we are already doing that.

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:53.700
I do, I am involved with and do participant observation of many of these

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:58.620
emerging communities that are creating a colleges of practice that are specifically

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.980
about trying to address the meaning crisis.

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.860
I just, in late July, I went to Washington state and did Rafe Kelly's

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:08.020
evolve, move, play, return to the source.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.900
And one of the most challenging things I've ever done.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.140
That guy is awesome.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.820
By the way, I've gotten to interact with him a long, long time ago.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:18.300
Uh, he said to say, he said to say hi to you, by the way.

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:18.620
Yeah.

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.020
It's from another world.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.540
It feels like a different world.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:27.380
Um, because I interacted with him, not directly, but so he, this is somebody

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.460
that maybe you can speak to what he works on, but, uh, he makes movement

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:36.620
and play, uh, and he encourages people to make that a part of their life.

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:40.700
Like how, how you move about the world, whether that's as part of sort of

01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:45.300
athletic endeavors or actual, just like walking around, around a city.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:45.860
Yeah.

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:51.380
Um, and I think the reason I ran into him is because there was a lot of interest

01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.060
in that in the athletic world, in the, in the grappling world, in the Brazilian

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:58.900
jujitsu world, people who study movement, who make movement part of their lives

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.580
to see how, how can we integrate play and fun and, and, uh, just the, the

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:09.780
basic humanists that's natural to our movement, how do we integrate that

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.060
into our daily practice?

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:14.900
So, so this is yet another way to find meaning.

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:19.020
I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what's

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.260
going on with Rafe's integration of parkour in nature, right?

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:29.340
And, uh, martial arts, um, and mindfulness practices and dialogical

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:35.460
practices is exactly, and explicitly so, by the way, he's, he will tell you

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.140
he's been very influenced by my work.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:41.540
He's trying to get at the non propositional kinds of knowing that make

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.780
meaning by evolving our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.980
realization, because that gives people profound, improved sense of connectedness

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:52.460
to themselves, to each other and the world.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.620
And I'll tell you, Lex, I won't, I don't want to say the, I don't want to say too

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:01.940
specifically the final thing that people did because it's part of his secret

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.420
sauce, right, right, right.

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:08.220
But what I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said, as far

01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.300
as I can tell, none of you are religious, right?

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:12.180
And they go, yeah, yeah.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.180
And I said, but what you just did was a religious act, wasn't it?

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.380
And they all went, yeah, it was.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.260
Yeah.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.620
So that same magic was there.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.340
Yes.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:23.620
Bath and break.

01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:24.060
Sure.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.900
What's your take on atheism in general?

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:37.100
Is a closer to truth than a, maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.540
person who believes in God?

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:43.860
So I'm a non-theist, which I, which means I think the shared set of

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.380
presuppositions between the theist and the atheist are actually

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:48.420
what needs to be rejected.

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.620
Can you explain that further?

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.740
Yes, I can.

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.940
And I want to point out, by the way, that there, there are lots of

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.700
non-theistic religious traditions.

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.180
So I'm not, I'm not, I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy category.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:08.500
Yeah.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:13.540
And what's the difference in non-theism, agnosticism and atheism?

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:19.500
So non-theist think that the theist and the atheist share a

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.580
bunch of presuppositions.

01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:28.620
For example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a

01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:34.020
personal being that is in some sense, the supreme being, and that the

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.220
right relationship to that being is to have a correct set of beliefs.

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.420
I reject all of those claims.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.340
So both the theist and the atheist see God in their modern version.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:45.940
Yes.

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:46.420
Yes.

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:52.300
In which do you reject it in the sense that you don't know, or do you

01:38:52.300 --> 01:39:00.020
reject it in a sense that you believe that each one of those presuppositions

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.140
is likely to be not true?

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:03.380
The latter.

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:10.580
I, both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and, and

01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.740
experience, I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:16.100
are probably not true.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.820
Which one is the most troublesome to you?

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:24.780
The personal being, the kind of accumulation of everything into one

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.020
being that ultimately created stuff.

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.780
So for me, there's two and they're interlocked together.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.020
I'm not trying to dodge your question.

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:38.940
It's that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being, I

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.460
think is a fundamental mistake.

01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.700
It's void of being.

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:42.740
No, no, no.

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.660
Like the ground of being is some kind of being.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.380
No, no, no turtles all the way down.

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.580
The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.740
Being is not a being.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:58.860
It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.540
Are humans beings?

01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.780
We are beings.

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:04.820
This glass is a being, this table is a being.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:10.300
But when I ask you, how are they all in being?

01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:15.260
You don't say by being a glass or by being a table or by being a human.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:19.300
You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath it all.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.780
And then you realize it can't be any thing.

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:26.340
This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea that the ground

01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:31.700
of being is no thingness, which is, you know, which you normally

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:35.220
pronounce as nothingness, but if you, if you put the hyphen back in, you

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.140
get the original intent, no thingness.

01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:45.740
And that is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:50.100
with, so it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a Supreme Being,

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.780
which is a category mistake to my mind.

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.060
And then that my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.620
And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:07.260
that meaning is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions.

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:11.460
And so that is a misunderstanding of sacredness, because I take sacredness

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.580
to be that which is most meaningful and it connected to what is most real.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:22.900
And theists think of what, of sacredness as what?

01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:30.380
They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God.

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:38.180
And that the way that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set

01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.620
of propositions or beliefs.

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.780
Now, I want to point out that this is what I would now call modern or common

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:51.180
theism, you go back into the classical periods of Christianity, you get a view

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.940
that's really radically different from how most people understand theism today.

01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:55.940
Okay.

01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.780
So let me, this is an interesting question that I usually think

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.500
about in the form of mathematics.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:09.420
But so in that case, if meaning is sacred in your non theist view, is

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:13.340
meaning created or is it discovered?

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:17.820
There's a Latin word that doesn't separate them called inventio.

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:23.500
And I would say that, and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.300
because you participate in it.

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.260
You've experienced an insight.

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:28.660
Yes.

01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.420
Did you make it happen?

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.540
The, the insight.

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:35.940
Did you make it happen?

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.820
Or did, did you do, like, can you do that?

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:39.980
I'm going to have, I needed insight.

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.820
This is what I do to make an insight.

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:42.540
Oh, I see.

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:43.580
Yeah.

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:46.060
In some sense it came from elsewhere.

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:46.660
Right.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.580
But you didn't just passively receive it either.

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:50.580
You're engaged and involved in it.

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.060
That's why you get, right.

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.100
So that's what I mean by you participate in it.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:55.660
You participate in meaning.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.740
So you do think that there's both.

01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:58.780
Yes.

01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.820
You do think it's both.

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:03.860
I mean, that's not a trivial thing to understand.

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:10.460
Um, cause a lot of time we think, when you think about a search for meaning,

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:16.740
you think it's like, uh, you're going through a big house and you open each

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.980
door and look if it's there and so on, as if there is going to be a glowing

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:25.540
orb that you discover, um, but at the same time.

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:33.660
I'm somebody that, uh, based on the chemistry of my brain have been extremely

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:38.860
fortunate to be able to discover beauty and everything, uh, in the most mundane

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:46.380
and boring of things I am as David Foster Wallace said, unboarable, I could

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:50.860
just sit in a room, uh, just like playing with the tennis ball or something and be

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:55.580
excited, um, basically like a dog, I think endlessly.

01:43:55.900 --> 01:44:04.180
Um, so to me, meaning is, um, created like, because I could create

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.860
meaning out of everything, but of course it doesn't require a partner.

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:13.620
It does require dance partners, whatever it does require the tennis ball.

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.540
But honestly, that's what, you know, a lot of people that I don't necessarily,

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.500
we'll talk about it.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.620
I don't practice meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like, you

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:29.700
know, the entire days for months kind of thing, they talk about being able to

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:35.460
discover meaning and just, uh, the wind or something like they, they just, the,

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:41.980
the breath and everything, just subtle sensory experiences give you deep

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.820
fulfillment.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.740
Um, so that's again, it's interaction.

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:52.420
Actually, I do want to say, because the, the interesting, uh, difference that

01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:58.740
you've drawn between non-theism, theism and atheism, where's, uh, where's the

01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:01.620
agreement of disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson on this?

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:07.180
I just talked to Jordan about this, um, because you're very clear it's, it's

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:10.260
kind of beautiful in the clarity in which you lay this out.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:14.580
Um, I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.980
What have you, have you been able to draw any kind of lies between the way the two

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.940
of you see religion?

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:22.300
Yeah.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:26.700
So there was a video released, uh, I think like two or three weeks ago with

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.540
Jordan and myself and Jonathan Peugeot.

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:30.540
Oh, I haven't watched that one yet.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:30.780
Yeah.

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:32.580
And it's around this question, Lex.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.980
Uh, he's basically sort of making, um, he's putting together an argument for God.

01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:40.620
I mean, I think that's a fair way.

01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.100
I don't think he would object to me saying that.

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:49.340
And, um, and Jonathan Peugeot is also a, um, well, Jonathan is a Christian.

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:51.020
It's unclear what Jordan is.

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:55.340
Um, and Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different

01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.780
mythologies and Christianity.

01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:00.540
Yes, especially neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important.

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.700
Um, I have a lot of respect.

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:05.100
Well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a lot of respect for

01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:05.500
Jonathan.

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:12.900
But in, in, in my participation in that dialogue, you could see me, well,

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.060
repeatedly, uh, but, uh, but I think everybody, including Jordan thought

01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:21.140
constructively, challenging sort of the attempt to build a theistic model.

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.580
And I was challenging it from a non-theistic perspective.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:33.260
So I think we don't, um, agree in on certain sets of propositions, but there

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.500
was a lot of, there was also a lot of acknowledgement, um, and I think

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.500
genuine appreciation on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I was making.

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:48.180
So they believe in, uh, maybe the presupposition of like a Supreme being

01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:54.180
that not believe, but the, the, not, not believe, but they see the power of that

01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:57.900
particular presupposition in, uh, uh, being a source of meaning.

01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:02.420
I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan Jordan's a really complex guy.

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:07.900
So it's very hard to just like pin to my best sort of understanding.

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:08.780
Yes.

01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:11.860
I think that's clearly the case for Jordan.

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.460
It's not the case for Jonathan.

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:17.980
Jonathan is, remember I said, I was talking about modern atheism and theism.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:25.660
Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving and Maximus, the

01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.620
confessor and Eastern orthodoxy and has come out of it at the other end as a

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:35.420
fifth century church father that is nevertheless being rightfully so found

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.940
to be increasingly relevant to many people.

01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:38.620
I think-

01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.060
So he's deeply old school.

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:40.620
Yeah.

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:45.580
I think he has, he and I, especially because neoplatonism is a non-theistic,

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:49.460
uh, philosophical spirituality and it's a big part of Eastern orthodoxy.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:54.820
He and I, uh, I think, um, he would say things like God doesn't exist.

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:56.100
What?

01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:56.980
You're a Christian, right?

01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:01.220
And then, and he's being coy, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.420
way the cup exists or the table exists.

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:05.820
The same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago.

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:07.420
He'll say things like that.

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:13.260
He will emphasize the no thingness of ultimate reality, the no thingness of

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:19.820
God, because he's, he is, he's from that version of Christianity, um, what

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:23.860
you might call classical theism, but classical theism looks a lot more like

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:26.300
non-theism than it looks like modern theism.

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:28.020
That's so interesting.

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:29.860
Yeah.

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.740
That's really interesting.

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.660
What, what about, um, is there a line to be drawn between myth and religion in

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:41.260
terms of its usefulness in man's search for meaning?

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:45.700
So here's where Jordan and I are much more, actually, all three of us

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.020
are in significant agreement.

01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:50.980
Um, I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here.

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:56.660
Uh, myths aren't stories about things that happened in the deep past that

01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.620
are largely irrelevant.

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:03.700
Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns that need

01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.220
to be brought into awareness.

01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:10.180
And they need to be brought into an awareness, not just, or primarily at

01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:13.860
the propositional level, but at those non-propositional levels.

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:16.700
And I think that is what good mythos does.

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.140
I prefer, I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now turned the

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:25.260
English word into a synonym for a widely, uh, a widely believed falsehood.

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.820
And I don't think, again, if you go back even to the, you know, the church

01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:32.940
fathers, I'm not a Christian, I'm not advocating for Christianity, right?

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.540
But, right, neither am I here to attack it, right?

01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:41.260
But if you, when, when they talk about reading these stories, they'll, right,

01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:46.660
they think the literal interpretation is the weakest and the least important.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:53.060
You move to the allegorical or the symbolic, to the moral, to the spiritual,

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:56.180
the mystical, and that's where, right?

01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:02.420
So they would say to you, Oh, you know, but how is, how is the story of Adam

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.980
and Eve true for you now?

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:07.460
And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense.

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:11.660
I mean, how is it pointing to a pattern in your life right now?

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:19.220
So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos becomes real in

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.900
connecting to the patterns that kind of, uh, captivate the public today.

01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:24.380
Sure.

01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:26.620
So for, so you just keep telling the story.

01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:30.740
I mean, there's something about some of these stories that are just really good

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:36.300
at being sticky to the patterns of each generation and they, they'll stick to

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.780
different patterns throughout time.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.260
They're just sticky in powerful ways.

01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:41.740
Yes.

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:46.060
And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again.

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:54.980
And it's important to see that some of these stories are recursive.

01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:58.900
They're myths about one particular set of patterns.

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:01.580
They're, they're myths about, right?

01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.060
Not, not, not just the important pattern.

01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:09.740
Like you get the, you know, Jordan stuff about there's heroes and myths are

01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:16.220
trying to, uh, make us understand the need for being heroic in our own lives.

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.700
One of the things I like to put in counterbalance that is the Greek also

01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:22.020
have myths of hubris, right?

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.940
The counterbalance, the heroic, right?

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:33.780
But then there are myths that are not about those deeply important patterns, but

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:39.860
they're myths about religio itself, that the way we're, religio means to

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.820
bind, to connect the way relevance realization connects us.

01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:46.060
And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.340
pattern and notice that pattern.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:55.060
It's notice how all of these patterns are emerging and what does that

01:51:55.060 --> 01:52:02.300
say about us and reality and those myths, those myths, um, I think, um, are

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:08.620
genuinely profound and how much of the, the myths, how much of the power of

01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.500
those myths is about the dialogues.

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.380
So you talk about this quite a bit.

01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:16.140
I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys, I'm not

01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:17.580
sure you've gotten really into it.

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:21.700
You, you, you scratch the surface a little bit, but the role of, as you

01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:24.220
say, dialogue in distributed cognition.

01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:24.940
Yes.

01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:25.700
What is that?

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:30.700
The thing we're doing right now, talking with our mouth holes, what is that?

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:33.580
And actually can I ask you this question?

01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:34.060
Yep.

01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:41.780
If aliens came to earth and we're observing humans, would they notice our

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:47.100
distributed cognition first or our individual cognition first?

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:50.380
What is the most notable thing about us humans?

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:54.580
Is it our ability to individually do well in IQ tests or whatever?

01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:58.980
Uh, or puzzle solve, or is it this thing we're doing together?

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:03.180
I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:07.780
Uh, like look around, you didn't make this equipment.

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.620
You didn't build this place.

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:11.900
You didn't invent this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera.

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:15.420
Uh, and now there's, there's more specific and precise

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:17.020
experimental evidence coming out.

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:23.540
Um, let's take a standard task that people reasoning task.

01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:25.060
I wanted you to do the details.

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:29.940
It's called the waste and selection task and you give it to people, highly

01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:34.060
educated, psychology students, premier universities across the world.

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:36.300
You've been, we've been doing it since the sixties.

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:40.380
It's replicates and replicates and only 10% of the people get it right.

01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:47.020
You put them in a group of four and you allow them to talk to each other.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.900
The success rate goes to 80%.

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:54.980
That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the four.

01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:58.980
By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of

01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.860
engineering students for a psychology students?

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:04.260
Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:05.020
Just kidding.

01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:07.780
Um, that's, uh, let's move on.

01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:08.860
Uh, all right.

01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:12.540
So there is a lot of evidence that there's power to this distributed cognition.

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:16.740
Now, what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism of the ants

01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:19.100
interacting with each other, the dialogue?

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.620
I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation.

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:30.740
But, and this is deeply inspired by, um, Socrates and Plato, especially

01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.700
the platonic dialogues, and I'm sure we've all had this.

01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:35.780
And so give me a moment.

01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.020
Cause I want to build onto something here.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:43.340
We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us

01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:47.740
both in directions we did not anticipate afforded us insights that we could not

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:51.740
have had on our own and we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were

01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.620
both moved and we're both drawn into insight and we feel like, wow, that was

01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:02.900
one of the best moments of my life because we feel how that it introduced us

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:09.380
to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition that

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:14.620
puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person and

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.180
potentially with the world.

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:18.500
That's what I mean by dia logos.

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:26.340
And so for me, I think dia logos is more important.

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:27.740
Huh?

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:30.940
Boy, I could just hear, I, I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.460
Jonathan in my head right now, but I think it's more, I hear them all the time.

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:38.500
I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes.

01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:41.780
Uh, so what, uh, what are they saying to you in your head?

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.420
What they're saying it, well, see, that's what the most recent conversation was

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:45.620
about.

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:53.540
I was trying to say that I don't think mythos is, I think mythos is really

01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:54.060
important.

01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:59.580
I think these kinds of narratives are really important, but I think this

01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:05.860
ability to connect together in distributed cognition, collective intelligence,

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:11.540
and cultivate a shared flow state within that collective intelligence.

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:14.980
So it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective wisdom.

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:20.780
I think that's more important because I think that's the basin within which the

01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:24.340
myths and the rituals are ultimately created and when they function.

01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:27.500
Like, like a myth is like a public dream.

01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:32.700
It depends on distributed cognition and it depends on people in the acting it

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.820
and getting into mutual flow states.

01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:41.300
So the, the highest form of dia logos of conversation is this flow state.

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:46.260
And that it forms the foundation for myth building.

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:47.340
I think so.

01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.340
I think so.

01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:53.100
So that communitas that's Victor Turner's phrase, and he specifically linked it to

01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:57.700
flow and I study flow scientifically that, you know, that within distributed

01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:05.140
cognition as, as, as, as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual, and those

01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:06.460
are bound together as well.

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:08.660
I think that's fundamentally correct.

01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.980
You know, what's the cool thing here?

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:15.500
Cause I'm a huge fan of podcasts and audio books, but the pockets in particular

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.420
is relevant here is there's a third person in this room listening now.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:23.260
And, and, and they're also in the flow state.

01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:23.820
Yes.

01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:24.580
Yes.

01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:28.460
Like I'm, I'm close friends with a lot of podcasts.

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:29.860
They're, they don't know I exist.

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:33.420
I just listened to them and cause I've been in so many flow states with them.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:35.660
I was like, yes, yes, yes, this is good.

01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:39.660
But they don't, they don't know I exist, but they are in conversation with me.

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.220
Ultimately.

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.900
And think, think like of what, what that's doing.

01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.620
You've got like, you've got dialogues and then you've got this meta

01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:46.940
dialogue, like you're describing.

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:53.180
And think about how things like podcasts and YouTube, they break down old

01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:58.180
boundaries between the private and the public, between writing and oral speech.

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:03.140
So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency of

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:03.580
writing.

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:09.340
Like we're, we're, we're, we're in the midst of creating a vehicle, right.

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:15.820
And a medium for distributed cognition that breaks down a lot of the categories

01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:18.020
by which we organized our cognition.

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:22.740
I mean, because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the, the network, the,

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:27.100
the graph of how quickly the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful.

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.300
And you just, a huge amount of people have listened to your lectures.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.420
I've listened to your lectures, but I've experienced them at least in your style.

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.540
There's something about your style.

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.820
It felt like a conversation.

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.780
Like it felt like at any moment, I could interrupt you and say something.

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.740
And I was just listening.

01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:51.260
Thank you for saying that because I aspire to being genuinely as

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:53.780
Socratic as I can when I'm doing this.

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:54.380
Yeah.

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.540
There was that sense actually, as I'm saying it now, why was that?

01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:02.780
It didn't feel like sometimes lectures are kind of, uh, you, you know, you came,

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:06.220
you come down with the commandments and you just want to listen, but there was a

01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:09.700
sense like, I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have, like you have

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:14.820
to understand, and also the fact that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the

01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:18.980
top of your head sometimes there was a, you were interrupting yourself with

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:22.580
thoughts, you're playing with thoughts, like you're, you're reasoning through

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:26.740
things often, like you had, you referenced a lot of books.

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:31.140
So surely you were extremely well prepared and you're referencing a lot of

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:34.060
ideas, but then you were also struggling in the way to present those ideas.

01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:34.380
Yes.

01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:39.420
There was, uh, and so the jazz, like the jazz and getting into the flow state

01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:45.460
and, and trying to share in a participatory and perspectival fashion, the

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.820
learning with the people rather than just pronouncing at them.

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.300
Yes.

01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:51.300
What's mindfulness.

01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:54.340
So published on that as well.

01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:58.660
Um, and I practice, I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness in the

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:01.060
college of practices since 1991.

02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:05.740
So I both have practitioners knowledge and I also study it scientifically.

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.980
I think I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:14.700
mindfulness at the university of Toronto within a classroom setting, like

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.580
lecturing on it.

02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:16.420
Um,

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:20.580
so this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in

02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:21.260
think about.

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.820
So from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?

02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:31.420
I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions, being, you know, aware of the

02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:34.820
present moment without judgment, because I think they're, they're, they're

02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:35.340
flawed.

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:39.500
Um, and if you want to get into the detail of why we can, but this is how I

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:40.940
want to explain it to you.

02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:46.340
And it also points to the fact of why you need an ecology of mindfulness practices.

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:49.020
You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation.

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:50.580
I think that's a primary mistake.

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.220
When you say ecology, what do you mean by the way?

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.420
Like, so lots of many different variants.

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:55.660
No.

02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.340
So what I mean by an ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology.

02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.380
You have a dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.580
other, right?

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:05.780
And I'll get to that with this about mindfulness.

02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:06.780
So I'll make that connection.

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:07.340
If you allow me.

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:09.580
So we're always framing.

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:11.100
We've been talking about that, right?

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:15.740
And for those of you who are not on YouTube, but there's podcasts, I wear

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:20.140
glasses and I'm now sort of putting my, my, my, my fingers and thumb around the

02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:21.860
leg, the frames of my glasses.

02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:27.740
So this is my frame and I, and my lens is right in that frame, the frame holds a

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:32.820
lens and I'm seeing through it in both senses beyond and by means of it.

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:36.220
So right now my glasses are transparent to me.

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:39.940
I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing.

02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:40.540
Okay.

02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:43.580
Now, sometimes this is what you do in meditation, I would argue.

02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:48.780
You step back from looking through your frame and you look at it.

02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.540
I'm taking my glasses off right now and I'm looking at them.

02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.540
Why might I do that?

02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:59.300
To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right?

02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:04.300
Now, if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've

02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:08.180
actually corrected the change I made to my lenses?

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.660
What do I need to do?

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:15.140
I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now see more clearly and deeply than

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:15.980
I could before.

02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:19.820
Meditation is this stepping back and looking at.

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.660
Contemplation is that looking through and there are different kinds of practices.

02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:28.700
The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake.

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:32.700
The word contemplation has temple in it, in Latin contemplatio means

02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:34.220
to look up to the sky.

02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:39.060
It's a translation of the Greek word theoria, which we get our word theory from.

02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:40.900
It's to look deeply into things.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.860
Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:47.420
looking at.

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.940
Mindfulness includes both.

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:56.340
It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame and the

02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.540
ability to make a new frame.

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.740
That's what actually happens in insight.

02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:07.980
You have to both break an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame.

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.820
This is why mindfulness enhances insight.

02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:15.820
Both ways, by the way, meditative practices and also contemplative practices.

02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:24.780
So mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your

02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:27.700
capacities for insight and self-regulation.

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:34.140
Now I am inexperienced with meditation, sort of the practice, the rigorous practice

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.700
and the science of meditation.

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:42.380
But, you know, I've talked to people who, uh, seriously as a science study

02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:47.980
psychedelics, and they often talk about the really important thing is the sort of

02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:49.780
the integration back.

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.260
So the contemplation step.

02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:56.700
So if you, it's not just the actual things you see on psychedelics or the actual

02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:00.980
journey of where your mind goes on psychedelics, it's also the integrating

02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:05.060
that into the new perspective that you take on life.

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:05.780
Right.

02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:06.420
Exactly.

02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:08.180
You, you really nicely described.

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:13.500
So meditation is the, in that metaphor is the psychedelic journey to a different

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:18.260
mind state and contemplation is the, the return back to reality, how you integrate

02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:22.620
that into a new world view and mindfulness is the whole process.

02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:23.420
Right.

02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:28.140
So if you, if you, if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:30.340
inflation and projective fantasy.

02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:34.740
If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual

02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.420
bypassing, avoiding reality.

02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:39.060
They act, they need, they need each other.

02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:40.180
You have to cycle between them.

02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:43.780
It's like what I talked about earlier, when I talked about the opponent

02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:48.220
processing within the autonomic nervous system or the opponent processing at

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:52.260
work and attention, and that's what I mean by an ecology of practices.

02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:53.300
You need both.

02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:55.300
Neither one is a panacea.

02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:58.660
You need them in this opponent processing acting as checks and

02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:59.620
balance on each other.

02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:05.140
Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people on how to meditate or

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:09.300
how to be mindful in this full way?

02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:09.900
Yes.

02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:12.820
I would tell them to do at least three things.

02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:16.020
And I was, I, I, I lucked into this.

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:20.260
Uh, when I started meditation, I went down the street and there was a place

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:25.700
that taught Vipassana meditation, metacontemplation and Tai Chi Chuan for

02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:29.980
flow induction, and you should get, you should have a meditative practice.

02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:35.620
You should find a contemplative practice and you should find a moving mindfulness

02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:39.140
practice, especially one that is conducive to the flow state and practice

02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.620
them in an integrated fashion.

02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.580
Can you elaborate what those practices might look like?

02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:48.140
So generally speaking.

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.460
Meditative practice like Vipassana.

02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:56.020
Um, and so what, what, what's the primary thing I look through

02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:57.860
rather than look at it's my sensations.

02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:02.300
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.300
focusing on the world through my sensations.

02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:10.980
So I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in this area of my, of my

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:16.460
abdomen, where my breathing is so I can feel as my abdomen is expanding, I can

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:21.060
feel those sensations and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting.

02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:27.740
Now what'll happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:29.180
the world again, right?

02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:32.300
I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry or what was that noise?

02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.620
And so what do I do?

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:35.780
I don't get involved with the content.

02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:43.340
I step back and label the process with an ing word, listening, imagining, planning,

02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:47.220
and then I return my attention to the breath and I have to return my attention

02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:51.300
in the correct way, the part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist

02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.580
tradition, this is called your monkey mind.

02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:56.180
It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering, right?

02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:01.300
If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Cornfield

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:05.300
said, train a puppy dog, you know, stay puppy dog.

02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:09.100
And if it goes and I get really angry, and I bring it back and I'm

02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:12.220
yelling at it, I'm going to train it to fight and fear me.

02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:17.940
But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims, oh, well, look, the puppy

02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.180
dog went there, oh, now it's there.

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:21.700
Puppy dog never learns to stay.

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.580
What do I need to do?

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.620
I have to neither fight it nor feed it.

02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:27.060
I have to have this centered attitude.

02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:28.260
I have to befriend it.

02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:32.820
So you, you step back and look at your sensations.

02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.780
You step back and look at your distracting processes.

02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:40.500
You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the right attitude.

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:43.820
That's the core of a good meditative practice.

02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:44.860
Okay.

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:47.020
Then what's a good contemplative practice?

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:54.980
Good contemplative practice is to try and meta, it's actually apropos

02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:58.140
because we talked about that participatory knowing the way

02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.980
you're situated in the world.

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:04.060
So what, this is a long thing because there's different interpretations

02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:07.700
of meta and I go for what's called an existential interpretation

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:09.700
over a, an emotional one.

02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:15.380
But so what I'm doing in meta, right, is I'm trying to become a, I'm

02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:16.820
trying to awaken in two ways.

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:22.300
I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an

02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:24.580
identity and assigning an identity.

02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:26.820
So I'm looking at that.

02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:29.380
I'm trying to awaken to that.

02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:33.420
And then I'm trying to awake from the modal confusion that

02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:35.500
I can get into around that.

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:43.740
And so I'm looking out onto the world and I'm trying to see you in a

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:46.300
fundamentally different way than I have before.

02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.980
You know, like, uh, you go to the gym and you do bicep curls.

02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:52.020
Yeah, yes, yes.

02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:55.140
Is it possible to reduce it to those things that, I mean, you don't

02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.460
need to speak to the specifics, but is there actual practice you can do?

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:00.660
Or is it really personal?

02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:03.140
No, I teach people how to do the meta practice.

02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.780
I also teach them how to do a neoplatonic contemplative practice,

02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:07.220
how to do a stoic one.

02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:09.820
Another one you can do is the view from above.

02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:11.180
This is classic stoicism.

02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:14.900
I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:19.260
you're floating above the room, then above Austin, then above Texas,

02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.860
then above the United States, then the earth.

02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:24.100
And you, like, and you have to really imagine it.

02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:28.220
Look, don't just think it, but really, and then what you notice is as you're

02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:33.580
pulling out to a wider and wider, like contemplation of reality, your sense of

02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:36.580
self and what you find relevant and important also changes.

02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:40.300
No, for all of these, there is a specific step-by-step methodology.

02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.500
Oh, so you can, so like in that one, you could just literally imagine yourself

02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.900
floating farther and farther out.

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.300
But you have to go through the steps.

02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:47.620
Yeah.

02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:49.660
Because the stepping matters.

02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:52.060
Because if you just jump, it doesn't work.

02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.100
Do you have any of the stuff online by the way?

02:09:54.700 --> 02:10:02.020
I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a

02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:07.020
daily course I taught meditating with John Vervecky, I did all the way through

02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:10.220
meditation, contemplation, even some of the movement practices.

02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:11.100
That's all there.

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:11.820
It's all available.

02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:14.220
That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism.

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:18.180
And then I went into the Western tradition and went through things like

02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:21.540
Stoicism and Neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Vervecky.

02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.460
That's all there, all free.

02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:24.540
On your website.

02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.420
Yeah, it's on my YouTube channel.

02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:26.540
Yeah.

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:27.460
On your YouTube channel.

02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:27.780
Okay.

02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.060
That's exciting.

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:34.180
I mean, your Meeting Crisis lectures is just incredible.

02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:37.340
Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people took.

02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:41.780
It's just, there's a, it created this tree of conversations.

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:43.540
It's really, really, really well done.

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:46.780
Um, what about flow induction?

02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:48.500
You want to flow wisely?

02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:54.060
And first of all, you need to understand what flow is and then you need to

02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:57.220
confront a particular issue around a practical problem around flow.

02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:01.140
Let's go there because a lot of those words seem like synonyms to people

02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:04.340
sometimes, so the state of flow.

02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:06.700
What is it?

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:07.660
All right.

02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:10.380
So, um, and he just died last year.

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.340
Chicks at my high.

02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:12.860
I admire him very much.

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:18.780
We've exchanged a bunch of messages, um, over the past few years and he

02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:25.540
wanted to do the podcast several times, but he's, he said, is, um, he

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:30.100
struggled with his health and I never knew in those situations, I deeply

02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:39.460
regret, um, several cases like this that, um, that I had like with, with Conway

02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:42.180
that I should have pushed them on it.

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:48.180
Cause yeah, as you get later in life, things, the simple things become more

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:52.540
difficult, but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard is

02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.740
important to hear.

02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:56.780
So anyway, I, I apologize, but

02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:58.660
no, no, I share that.

02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:04.780
I mean, I can tell you that within my area, he is important and he's

02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:07.060
famous in an academics sense.

02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:12.500
So the flow state, two important sets of conditions and very often people only

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:15.260
talk about one and that's a little bit of a misrepresentation.

02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:22.140
So the flow state is in situations in which the demand of the situation

02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:24.700
is slightly beyond your skills.

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:30.460
So you both have to apply all the skills you can with as much sort of attention

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:33.500
and concentration as you possibly can.

02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:35.940
And you have to actually be stretching your skills.

02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:42.740
Now, in this circumstance, people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways,

02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:46.140
optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've had in my life.

02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.700
It's distinct from pleasure.

02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:51.300
And yet it explains why people do very bizarre things like rock climbing

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:52.660
because it's a good flow induction.

02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.380
But they also mean optimal in a second sense, my best performance.

02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:00.700
So it's both the best experience and the best performance.

02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:05.140
So Chick-Sat-Mahai also talked about the information flow conditions you need,

02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:06.380
right?

02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:08.500
In order for there to be this state of flow.

02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:10.980
And then I'll talk about what it's like to be in flow in a sec.

02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:13.100
What you need is three things.

02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:15.580
You need the information that you're getting to be clear.

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.900
It can't be ambiguous or vague.

02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:18.500
Think about a rock climber.

02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:19.620
It's ambiguous and vague.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:20.500
You're in trouble.

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:21.020
Right?

02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:26.260
There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the

02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:27.500
environment responds.

02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:30.020
So when you act, there's an immediate response.

02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:34.820
There isn't a big time lag between your action and your ability to detect the

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:36.260
response from the environment.

02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:39.220
Third, failure has to matter.

02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:40.980
Error really matters.

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:44.020
So there should be some anxiety about failure.

02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:46.220
And failure matters.

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:49.700
So, so that like they, yeah, because to you, the, the person that

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:51.340
participates, yes, yes, yes.

02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:53.300
Now, when you're in the flow state,

02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:57.500
notice how this sits on the boundary between the secular and the sacred.

02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:02.860
When you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of

02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:05.180
at one mint with the environment.

02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:10.700
They report a loss of a particular kind of self-consciousness, that narrative,

02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:15.060
naturing nanny in your head that how do I look, do people like me?

02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:15.820
How do I look?

02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:16.540
How's my hair?

02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:17.500
Do people like me?

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.300
Should I have said that?

02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.140
That's the way it is.

02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:19.940
That's the way it is.

02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:20.860
That's the way it is.

02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.340
Do people like me?

02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.220
Should I have said that that all goes away?

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.060
You're free from that.

02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:30.020
You're free from the, the most sadistic, super ego self-critic you could possibly

02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:33.660
have at least for a while, the world is vivid.

02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:35.780
It's super salient to you.

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.860
There's an ongoing sense of discovery.

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:42.300
Although often, you know, you're exerting a lot of

02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:44.780
metabolic, metabolic effort.

02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:46.980
It feels effortless.

02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:51.420
So in the flow state, when you're sparring, your hand just goes up for

02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:55.860
the block and you, your strike just goes through the empty space.

02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:59.900
Or if you're a goalie in hockey, I got to mention hockey once I'm a Canadian,

02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:03.500
right, you put out your, you know, you put out your glove hand

02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.060
and the puck's there, right?

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:16.100
So there's this tremendous sense of grace, at one mint, super salience, discovery,

02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:20.780
and realness people don't, well, people don't, when they're in the flow state,

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:22.500
they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:29.220
The interesting questions for me and my co-authors in the book, in the, the

02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:33.540
article we published in the Hanford, the Oxford handbook, a spontaneous thought

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:38.820
with Ariane, Herb Bennett and Leo Ferraro is that's a descriptive account of flow.

02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:40.660
We wanted an explanatory account.

02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:43.380
What are the causal mechanisms at work in flow?

02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:50.020
And so we actually proposed to interlocking cognitive processes.

02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:53.940
The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow?

02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:56.100
Well, think about it.

02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:57.220
Think about the rock climber.

02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:01.540
The rock climber, and we, I talked about this earlier, they, they, they're

02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.380
constantly restructuring how they're seeing the rock face.

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:07.860
They're constantly doing something like insight.

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:12.180
And if they, and if they fail to do it, they impasse and that starts to get

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:12.740
dangerous.

02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:16.340
So they got to do it in insight that primes an insight that primes an insight.

02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:22.260
So imagine the aha experience, that, that flash and that moment and imagine it

02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:22.900
cascading.

02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:25.460
So you're getting the extended aha.

02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:27.380
That's why things are super salient.

02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:28.740
There's a sense of discovery.

02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:33.540
There's a sense of at one minute of deep participation of grace, but there's

02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:34.820
something else going on too.

02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:41.300
So there's a phenomena called implicit learning, also very well replicated.

02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:43.220
Starts way back in the sixties with Reber.

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:49.620
You can give people complex patterns like number and letter strings, right?

02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:57.620
And they can learn about those patterns outside of deliberate focal awareness.

02:16:57.620 --> 02:16:58.900
That's what's called implicit learning.

02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:05.140
And what's interesting is if you try and change that task into, um, you

02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:10.020
know, tell me the pattern, but explicitly, explicitly try to figure it out.

02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:11.380
Explicitly try to figure it out.

02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:12.500
Their performance to grades.

02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:14.100
So here's the idea.

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:19.060
You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning and what it does is it

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.180
results in you being able to track complex variables in a way, but you don't

02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:26.500
know how you came up with that knowledge, right?

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:30.420
So you get, and this is Hogarth's proposal and educating intuition.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:32.820
Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:37.220
So an example I use is how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral?

02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:43.300
There's a lot of complex variables.

02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:48.900
There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history,

02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:49.860
all kinds of stuff.

02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:53.940
And yet you know how to do it and you didn't have to go to funeral school.

02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.660
I'm just using that as an example.

02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:58.580
So you have these powerful intuitions.

02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:00.580
Now here's Hogarth's great point.

02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:03.460
Implicit learning.

02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.660
Remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive, make a subject to

02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:07.540
self-deception.

02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:09.140
Here's another example.

02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:13.700
Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on complex patterns, but it doesn't

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:15.620
care what kind of pattern it is.

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:20.740
It doesn't distinguish causal patterns from merely correlational patterns.

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:24.100
So implicit learning, when we like it, it's intuition.

02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.380
When it's picking up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice or all kinds

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:30.100
of other names for intuition that's going wrong.

02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:32.740
Now he said, okay, what do we do?

02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:34.260
What do we do about this?

02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:36.100
And this will get back to flow.

02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:36.900
What do we do about this?

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:40.180
Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit learning because

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:42.580
we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it.

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.340
So what can we do explicitly?

02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:48.260
What we can do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the

02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:49.140
implicit learning.

02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:50.900
How do we do that?

02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:55.300
We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish

02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:56.820
causation from correlation.

02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:01.460
What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing

02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:02.820
causation from correlation?

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:04.900
Experimental environments.

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.820
What do you do in an experiment?

02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:09.860
You make sure that the variables are clear.

02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:12.260
No confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:15.380
You make sure there's a tight coupling between the independent and the dependent

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:18.740
variable, and your hypothesis can be falsified.

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:19.860
Error matters.

02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.220
Now look at those three lex.

02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:25.460
Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for flow.

02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:30.820
Clear information, tightly coupled feedback, and error matters.

02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:36.580
So flow is not only an insight cascade improving your insight capacity.

02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:43.300
It's also a marker that you're cultivating the best kind of intuitions,

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:48.100
the ones that fit you best to the causal patterns in your environment.

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:53.460
But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:59.540
distinction between causality and correlation, and it has the rigor of a

02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:01.220
scientific experiment.

02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:01.700
Fair enough.

02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:06.660
I don't think Hogarth was saying it's going to be epistemically as rigorous

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:08.020
as a scientific experiment.

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:14.340
But he's saying if you structure that, it will tend to do what that scientific

02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:16.180
method does, which is find causal.

02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:17.620
Think of the rock climber.

02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:18.660
All of those things are the case.

02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:19.860
They need clear information.

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:23.700
It's tightly coupled, and error matters.

02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:29.380
They think what they're doing is very real because if they're not conforming

02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:35.140
to the real causal patterns of the rock face and the physiology of their body,

02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:35.780
they will fall.

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:42.660
Is there something to be said about the power of discovering meaning

02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:46.340
and having this deep relationship with the moment?

02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:54.020
There is something about flow that really forgets the past and the future,

02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:55.780
and is really focused on the moment.

02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:57.860
I think that's part of the phenomenology,

02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:02.740
but I think the functionality has to do with the fact that what's happening in flow

02:21:02.740 --> 02:21:08.820
is that dynamic non-propositional connectedness that is so central to meaning

02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:12.100
is being optimized.

02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:18.260
This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life,

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:23.540
how much well-being you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive

02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:26.260
and interrelated with how meaningful you find your life.

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:29.780
One of the things that you can do, but there's an important caveat,

02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:36.180
to increase your sense of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.

02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:39.940
That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state,

02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:47.540
but there's one important caveat, which is we of course have figured out,

02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:51.860
and I'm playing with words here, how to game this and how to hijack it

02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:54.020
by creating things like video games.

02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:58.980
I'm not saying this is the case for all video games or this is the case for all people,

02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:05.620
but the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing that you can get into the flow state

02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:12.340
within the video game world to the detriment of your ability to get into the flow state

02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:13.700
in the real world.

02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:15.220
What's the opposite of flow?

02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:19.300
Depression, in fact, depression has been called anti-flow.

02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:27.460
So you get these people that are flowing in this non-real world, and they can't transfer it

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:31.060
to the real world, and it's actually costing them flow in the real world,

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:34.500
so they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things.

02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:42.020
Oh, your ability, your habit, and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world

02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:51.860
world basically makes you less effective, or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is

02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:53.540
to achieve flow in the physical world.

02:22:55.540 --> 02:23:01.540
I don't want to push back against the implied challenge of transferability,

02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:10.740
because I have a lot of friends that play video games, a very large percent of young

02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:20.340
folks play video games, and I'm hesitant to build up models of how that affects behavior.

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.020
My intuition is weak there.

02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:28.100
Oftentimes, people that have PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:31.380
games weren't a deep part of their life development.

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:37.540
I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games

02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:44.740
being a large part of that world are in some sense different humans, and it's possible

02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:52.420
that they can transfer more effectively some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain

02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:55.140
flow from the virtual world to the physical world.

02:23:55.140 --> 02:24:01.460
They're also more, I would venture to say, resilient to the negative effects of, for example,

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:09.860
social media or video games that have maybe the objectification or the over-sexualized

02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:12.180
or violent aspect of video games.

02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:15.700
They're able to turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on

02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:22.820
when they're playing the video games probably more effectively than the old timers.

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:25.780
So I just want to say, I'm not sure.

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:28.900
It's a really interesting question how transferable the flow state is.

02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:31.620
I don't know if you want to comment on that.

02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:32.580
I do, I do.

02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:36.180
First of all, I did qualify, and I'm saying it's not the case for all video games or for

02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:36.980
all people.

02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:42.180
I'm holding out the possibility, and I know this possibility, because I've had students

02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:47.380
who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.

02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.100
The ability to achieve...

02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:52.180
That they couldn't transfer, yeah.

02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:58.740
And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science

02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:00.500
and write about it and work on it.

02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:10.100
Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim, because there seems to be mounting

02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:10.740
evidence.

02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:17.300
It's not consensus, but it's certainly not regarded as fringe, that the increase in

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:22.500
social media is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression, self-destructive

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:24.420
behavior, things like this.

02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.100
I would like to see that evidence.

02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:27.140
Sure, I can find it.

02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:27.940
No, no, no, no.

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:42.020
I'm always hesitant to too eagerly agree with things that I want to agree with.

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.340
There's a public perception, everyone seems to hate on social media.

02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:55.140
I wonder, as always with these things, does it reveal depression or does it create

02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:55.700
depression?

02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:57.460
This is always the question.

02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:03.380
It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create hate

02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:05.780
or does it reveal hate?

02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:09.380
And that's a good thing to ask, and you should always challenge the things that you

02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:11.220
intuitively want to believe.

02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:11.860
I agree with that.

02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:14.580
Like aliens.

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:20.420
So one of the ways you address this, and it's not sufficient, and I did say the work

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:27.940
is preliminary, but if I can give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends

02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:32.340
credence, and part of what happens is illusory social comparison.

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:34.260
Think of Instagram.

02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:39.460
People are posting things that are not accurate representation of their life or life events.

02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:46.660
In fact, they will stage things, but the people that are looking at these, they take it often

02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:50.820
as real, and so they get downward social comparison.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:58.980
Compared to how you and I probably live, where we may get one or two of those events

02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:04.820
a week, they're getting them moment by moment, and so it's a plausible mechanism that why

02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:07.540
it might be driving people into a more depressed state.

02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:14.020
The flip side of that is because there's a greater, greater gap going from real world

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:19.620
to Instagram world, you start to be able to laugh at it and realize that it's artificial.

02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:26.900
So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize it's the same kind

02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:31.220
of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.

02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:33.700
In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things.

02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:38.420
Grand Theft Auto, you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want.

02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:42.820
In the real world, you can't, and you start to develop an understanding of how to have

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:45.940
fun in the virtual world and in the physical world.

02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:50.580
And I think to push back, I'm not saying either is true though, those are very interesting

02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:51.540
claims.

02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:56.900
The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes, the easier you can laugh it off,

02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:00.420
potentially, in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:03.860
I'll respond to that, but at some point we should get back to flow.

02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:07.220
As we engage in flow.

02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:12.340
You laugh at the shampoo commercial, and you buy the shampoo.

02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:20.100
Yeah, there's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines

02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:26.820
are designed to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.

02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:41.220
I'm thinking of Connor examples, because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank.

02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:44.660
You can laugh and not buy the shampoo.

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:45.220
Right.

02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:48.900
There's many cases, so I think you have to laugh hard enough.

02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:54.740
You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars precisely

02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:59.940
because for many, many people, it does make you buy the shampoo, and that's the concern.

02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:04.660
And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.

02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:05.300
Yes.

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:13.540
The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately right,

02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:17.060
the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing.

02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:22.500
I want to contrast that to an experience I had when I was in grad school.

02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:26.500
I had been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years, very religiously,

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:30.820
in both senses of the word, like three or four hours a day, and reading all the literature.

02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:36.980
And I was having all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff.

02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:45.700
But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on? You're different.

02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:51.300
And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced

02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:56.980
in your interactions, and you're a lot more flowing, and you're a lot more sort of flexible,

02:29:57.060 --> 02:30:04.980
and you adjust more. And I realized, oh, and this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan

02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:11.460
that it actually transfers in ways that you might not expect. You start to be able,

02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:17.140
and I've now noticed that. I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this interaction,

02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:22.180
and how it can facilitate and afford. And so there's a powerful transfer.

02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:29.540
That's what I meant by flow wisely. Not only flow in a way that's making sure that you're

02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:36.420
distinguishing causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate it, home it,

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:40.420
so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains of your life.

02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:48.100
Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation

02:30:49.060 --> 02:30:57.860
and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind? Where does the mind go

02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:02.900
when it's on psychedelics?

02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:11.860
I want to remind you of something you said, which is a gem. It's not so much the experience,

02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:14.180
but the degree to which it can be integrated back.

02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:19.780
So here's a proposal. It comes from Woodward and others. A lot of convergence around this.

02:31:19.780 --> 02:31:24.660
Carl Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain. But I'm not going to talk first

02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:28.500
about psychedelics. I'm going to talk about neural networks, and I'm going to talk about

02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:33.940
a classic problem in neural networks. So neural networks, like us with intuition and implicit

02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:37.620
learning, are fantastic at picking up on complex patterns.

02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:39.780
Which neural networks are we talking about?

02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:42.820
I'm talking about a general, just general part of it.

02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:45.140
Both artificial and biological?

02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:52.980
Yes, yes, yes. I think at this point, there is no relevant difference. So one of the classic

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:58.500
problems, because of their power, is they suffer from overfitting to the data. Or for those of

02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:06.580
you with statistical orientation, they pick up patterns in the sample that aren't actually

02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:15.060
present in the population. There's various strategies. You can do dropout where you

02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:21.620
periodically turn off half of the nodes in a network. You can drop noise into the network.

02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:27.780
What that does is it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to

02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:35.620
generalize more powerfully to the environment. I propose to you that that's basically what

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:44.500
psychedelics do. They do that. They basically do significant constraint reduction, and so

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:50.020
you get areas of the brain talking to each other that don't normally talk to each other,

02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:54.580
areas that do talk to each other not talking to each other, down regulation of areas that

02:32:54.580 --> 02:33:00.500
are very dominant, like the default mode network, etc. What that does is exactly something strongly

02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:06.660
analogous to what's happening in dropout or putting noise into the data. It opens up. By

02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:12.260
the way, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve and you

02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:17.060
throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight in them.

02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:23.140
So like literally a very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.

02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:29.460
Right. It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up. Now, that means, though,

02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:41.220
just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because you also have to make sure

02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:47.060
that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly. This isn't a problem with

02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:51.540
neural networks. You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks,

02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:54.260
and now they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before.

02:33:54.980 --> 02:34:00.500
Human beings are a little bit more messy around this, and this is where the analogy does get a

02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:09.620
little bit strained. So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new

02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:17.460
state space so they can properly integrate it. So beyond Leary's state set and setting,

02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:25.860
I think you need another S. I think you need sacred. Psychedelics need to be practiced

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:32.500
within a sapiential framework, a framework in which people are independently and beforehand

02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:37.540
improving their abilities to deal with self-deception and afford insight and

02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:43.220
self-regulate. This is, of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous

02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:51.780
cultures. I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people

02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:58.100
self-transcending, cultivating meaning and increasing wisdom. But if I think we remove

02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:05.220
them out of that context and put them in the context of commodities taken just to have

02:35:05.220 --> 02:35:09.860
certain phenomenological changes, we run certain important risks.

02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:14.020
So using the term of higher states of consciousness,

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:25.780
is consciousness an important part of that word? Why higher? Is it a higher state? Or is it a

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:30.180
detour, a side road on the main road of consciousness?

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:32.820
So where do we go here?

02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:39.860
I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum. There's insight, and then if flow is an insight

02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:44.660
cascade, there's flow, and then you can have sort of psychedelic experiences, mind-revealing

02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:50.180
experiences. But they overlap with mystical experiences, and they aren't the same.

02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:57.060
So for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people psilocybin, and they taught them ahead of

02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:03.860
time the features of a mystical experience, and only a certain proportion of the people

02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:08.900
that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic into a mystical experience. What was interesting

02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:14.740
is the people that had the mystical experience had measurable and long-standing change to one

02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:18.980
of the big five factors of personality. They had increased openness, and openness is supposed to

02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:23.060
actually go down over time, and these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable, and it was

02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:31.060
significantly altered. But imagine if you just created more openness in a person,

02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:37.060
and they're now open to a lot more, and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't give

02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:42.660
them the tools of discernment. That could be problematic for them in important ways.

02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:43.860
That could be very problematic.

02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:54.100
I got it. So you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow, integrated back into

02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:58.020
your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception of that world.

02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:02.340
And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience.

02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:06.900
Now, the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move

02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:11.700
people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience. Because what

02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:16.500
happens in these experiences is something really, really interesting. They get to a state

02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:23.300
that's ineffable. They can't put it into words. They can't describe it, but they're in this state

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:28.340
temporarily, and then they come back, and they do this. They say, that was really real, and this,

02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:34.020
in comparison, is less real. So I remember that platonic meta desire. I want to change my life

02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:40.100
myself so that I'm more in conformity with that really real. And that is really odd, Lex, because

02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:47.460
normally when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, and we come

02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:51.780
back from it, we say, that doesn't fit into everything, therefore it's unreal. They do the

02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:58.180
exact opposite. They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this, consensus

02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:04.100
intelligibility, and that means this is less real. They do the exact opposite, and that fascinates

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:13.140
me. Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative states? And the thing is,

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:17.300
those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that onto normativity,

02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:23.780
the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to bridge between mystical

02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:29.060
experiences and genuine transformative experiences. So you do think seeing those as more real is

02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:36.100
productive because then you reach for them. So Yaden's done work on it. Again, all of this stuff

02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:42.660
is recent, so we have to take it with a grain of salt. But by a lot of objective measure,

02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:48.020
people who do this, who have these higher states of consciousness and undertake the

02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:52.660
transformative process, their lives get better. Their relationships improve, their sense of self

02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:58.900
improves, their anxieties go down, depression. All of these other measures, the needles are

02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:03.780
moved on these measures by people undergoing this transformative experience. Their lives,

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:07.620
by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to be good, get better.

02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:16.420
I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that leads to

02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:23.700
mass formation of ideologies that have had an impact on our world. So you spoke about the clash

02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:31.300
of the two great pseudo-religious ideologies of Marxism and Nazism, especially their clash

02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:40.340
on the Eastern Front. Can you explain the origin of each of these, Marxism and Nazism,

02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:45.300
in a kind of way that we have been talking about the formation of ideas?

02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:53.220
Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism. He was like the philosopher who

02:39:53.220 --> 02:40:02.420
took German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and he built

02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:09.860
a philosophical system. He explicitly said this, by the way. He wanted to bridge

02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:14.740
between philosophy and religion. He explicitly said that. I'm not foisting that on him. He

02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:20.660
said it repeatedly in many different places. So he was trying to create a philosophical system

02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:29.140
that gathered to it, I think, the core mythos of Christianity. The core mythos of Christianity

02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:36.740
is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which progress is real, in which our actions now

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:43.060
can change the future. We can co-participate with God in the creation of the future,

02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:47.940
and that future can be better. It can reach something like a utopia or the promised land

02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:53.060
or whatever. He created a philosophical system of brilliance, by the way. He's a genius.

02:40:53.060 --> 02:41:00.020
But basically what it did was it took that religious vision and gave it the air of philosophical

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:09.140
intelligibility and respect. Then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the

02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:13.300
narrative is working itself out that Hegel called dialectic. I don't think it's primarily

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:19.220
happening in ideas. I think it's happening primarily between classes within socioeconomic factors,

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:25.220
but it's the same story. Here's this mechanism of history. It's teleological. It's going to move

02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:30.660
this way. It can move towards a utopia. We can either participate in furthering it,

02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:36.500
like participating in the work of God, or we can thwart it and be against it.

02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:44.420
So you have a pseudo-religious vision. It's all encompassing. Think about how Marxism is not just

02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:49.460
a philosophical position. It's not just an economic position. It's an entire worldview,

02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:58.580
an entire account of history and a demanding account of what human excellence is. It has

02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:03.060
all these things about participating, belonging, fitting to.

02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:13.380
But it's very, in Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society

02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:18.580
to where it more naturally leads to political ideologies.

02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:25.220
It does. But I think Marx, to a very significant degree, inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.

02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:32.660
Hegel is talking about all this and he's trying to fit it into post-Kantian philosophy.

02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:40.100
So for him, it's ultimately propositional, conceptual. He, like everybody after Descartes,

02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:46.100
is very focused on the propositional level and he's not paying deep attention to

02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:52.740
the non-propositional. This is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard,

02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:57.220
they're trying to put their finger on the non-propositional, the non-conceptual,

02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:03.460
the will to power or faith and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing

02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:07.860
as being inadequate. That's why Kierkegaard met when he said Hegel made a system and then he sat

02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:18.660
down beside it. And so Marxism is very much, it is activists, it's about reorganizing society, but

02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:26.740
the transformation in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about these

02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:31.220
significant propositional changes and adopting a set of beliefs.

02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:37.220
When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union,

02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:41.460
why do you think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people?

02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:47.700
Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism in the name of communism.

02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:58.100
Because it offered people something that typically only religions had offered and

02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:06.420
it offered people the hope of making a new man, a new kind of human being in a new world.

02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:16.660
And when you've been living in Russia, in which things seem to be locked in a system that is

02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:26.100
crushing most people, getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy that we can make new

02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:33.940
human beings in a new world and in which happiness will ensue. That's an intoxicating proposal.

02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:41.940
Like I said, you get all of the intoxication of a religious utopia, but you get all the seeming

02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:48.660
legitimacy of claiming that it's a scientific understanding of history and economics.

02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:52.820
It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days.

02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:59.300
I often put myself in the place before any of the implementations came to be,

02:45:01.700 --> 02:45:04.260
I tried to think if I would be able to predict

02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:11.780
what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in in the 20th century.

02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:18.580
And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction because at the core of the ideas are

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:27.220
respecting, with Marx it's very economics type of theory, so it's basically respecting the value of

02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:35.220
the worker and the regular man in society for making a contribution to that society.

02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:42.660
And to me that seems like a powerful idea and it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.

02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:51.380
In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell did this like with Stalin happen or Mao happen.

02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:57.300
There's something very interesting and complex about human nature in hierarchies,

02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:01.620
about distributed cognition, the results in that, and it's not trivial to understand.

02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:02.420
No, no.

02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:08.580
So I wonder if you could put a finger on it. Why did it go so wrong?

02:46:08.580 --> 02:46:14.980
So I think what Ohana talks about in the intellectual history of modernity

02:46:17.140 --> 02:46:27.460
talks about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal.

02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:33.300
And think about how it's not so radical to us. And in that sense, Marxism has succeeded.

02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:36.740
The radical proposal that you see even in the French Revolution,

02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:40.340
and don't forget the terror comes in the French Revolution too,

02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:48.740
that we can make ourselves into God-like beings. Think of the hubris in that, right?

02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:54.420
And think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand human nature and all of its

02:46:54.420 --> 02:47:02.660
complexities and human history, and how religion functioned, that we can just come in with a plan

02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:11.060
and make it run. To my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why it's doomed to fail,

02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:16.900
and it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way because the Promethean spirit

02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:25.460
really licenses you to do anything because the ends justify the means.

02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:31.460
Does the end justify the means really free you to do some of basically,

02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:39.300
well, commit atrocities at any scale? Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge,

02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:46.020
right? Exactly. And you can only believe in an ends that can justify any means.

02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:50.980
If you believe in a utopia, and you can only believe in the utopia if you really buy into

02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:55.140
the Promethean spirit. So is that what explains Nazism?

02:47:55.140 --> 02:48:02.180
So Nazism is part of that too. The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into supermen,

02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:14.820
ubermensch, right? And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting

02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:23.540
Gnostic themes that are very prevalent. Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when

02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:29.620
people are experiencing increased meaning crisis. And don't forget, the Weimar Republic is like a

02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:35.460
meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels. Everybody's suffering domicide. Everybody's

02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:40.500
home and way of life and identity and culture and relationship to religion and science,

02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:47.940
all of that. And so Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism,

02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:56.420
again, twisted, perverted. I'm not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is

02:48:56.420 --> 02:49:04.020
this Gnostic mythology, mythos, and it comes to the fore. I remember, and this stuck with me

02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:11.300
undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor extended lecture on this,

02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:16.260
and it still rings true for me. He says, if you understand Nazism as just a political movement,

02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:24.580
you have misunderstood it. It is much more a religious phenomena in many ways.

02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:32.580
Is it religious in that the loss of religion, so is it a meaning crisis? Or is it out of a

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:39.220
meaning crisis every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of-

02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:42.820
I think it's the latter. I think there's this vacuum created.

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:48.260
In that context, is Hitler the central religious figure?

02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:48.820
Yes.

02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:57.460
Also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler or did Hitler create Nazi Germany? In this distributed

02:49:57.460 --> 02:50:02.580
cognition where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of the charismatic leader?

02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:10.100
Is it an emergent phenomena or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?

02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:15.220
I hope it's not a necessary requirement. I hope that the next Buddha can be the

02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:22.980
Sangha rather than a specific individual. I think in that situation, Hitler's charisma

02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:31.060
allowed him to take on a mythological in the proper sense archetypal. He became deeply symbolic

02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:38.340
and he instituted all kinds of rituals, all kinds of rituals and all kinds of mythos.

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:44.740
There's all this mythos about the master race and there's all these rituals. The swastika is,

02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:49.780
of course, itself a religious symbol. There's all of this going on because

02:50:52.180 --> 02:51:00.340
he was tapping into the fact that when you put people into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity,

02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:05.700
they will fall back on more and more mythological ways of thinking

02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:11.060
in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new meaning-making,

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:20.500
I should say, meaning-participating behavior. What is evil? Is this a word you avoid?

02:51:21.060 --> 02:51:30.740
No, I don't because I think part of what we're wrassling with here is resisting the

02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:37.540
Enlightenment, I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be

02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:47.860
reduced to individual human immorality. I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than

02:51:47.860 --> 02:51:54.660
just immoral. I think sin is a much more comprehensive category. I think sin is a

02:51:54.660 --> 02:52:02.500
failure to love wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry. You take something

02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:12.420
as ultimate which is not. That can tend to constellate these collective agents, I call

02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:18.580
them hyperagents, with indistributed cognition that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world

02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:27.060
that is not just due to a sum total of immoral decisions. This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing,

02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:33.300
and the banality of Eichmann. She was really wrestling with it. I think she's close to

02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:38.260
something but I think she's slightly off. Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral

02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:44.420
decisions but it doesn't seem to capture the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:50.580
and the warfare. She's right because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of

02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:56.420
individual rather banal immoral choices adding up to what was going on. You're getting a

02:52:56.420 --> 02:53:05.060
comprehensive parasitic process within massive distributed cognition that has the power to

02:53:05.060 --> 02:53:11.140
confront the world and confront aspects of the world that individuals can't. I think when we're

02:53:11.140 --> 02:53:16.100
talking about evil, that's what we're trying to point to. This is a point of convergence

02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:19.700
between me and Jonathan Pageau. We've been talking about this.

02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:21.540
So the word sin is interesting.

02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:21.860
Yes.

02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:26.660
Are you comfortable using the word sin because it's so deeply rooted in religion?

02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:35.140
It is. I struggle around this because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian

02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:40.260
and so that is still there within me. There's trauma associated with that.

02:53:40.980 --> 02:53:44.980
Probably layers of self-deception mechanisms.

02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:46.180
No doubt.

02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:48.660
You're slowly escaping.

02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:56.900
Trying to and trying to come into a proper respectful relationship with Christianity via

02:53:56.900 --> 02:54:01.700
a detour through Buddhism, Taoism and pagan neoplatonism.

02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:04.020
Trying to find a way how to love wisely.

02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:14.100
Yes, exactly. I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something

02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:20.580
that we would prototypically call immoral, but if they're failing to love wisely,

02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:29.540
they are disconnecting themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.

02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:36.820
I think it was Hume. I may be wrong. Hume says people don't do things

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:41.860
because they think it's wrong. They do a lesser good in place of a greater good.

02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:46.900
And that's a different thing than being immoral. When immoral, we're saying,

02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:51.620
you're doing something that's wrong. It's like, well, no, no. I'm loving my wife.

02:54:51.620 --> 02:54:56.580
That's a great thing, isn't it? Yeah. But if you love your wife at the expense of your kids,

02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:05.300
maybe something's going awry here. Well, I love my country. Great. But should you love your country

02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:12.500
at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong to? People should wrestle with these

02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:17.940
questions. And I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions properly.

02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:21.540
Yeah. To be content with the choices you've made without considering,

02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:26.020
is there a greater good that could be done? Yeah.

02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:33.060
Your lecture series on the meaning crisis puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast

02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:38.900
with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history. Heidegger, Corbin,

02:55:40.580 --> 02:55:46.660
the man Carl Jung, Tillich, Barfield. Can you describe, this might be challenging,

02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:54.740
but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind? Yes. Maybe Heidegger.

02:55:54.740 --> 02:56:02.340
So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had a huge influence on me. He's had a huge

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:06.980
influence on me in many ways. He's a big influence on what's called Fourier cognitive science.

02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:12.820
And this whole idea about the non-propositional, that was deeply afforded by Heidegger and

02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:17.540
Marleau-Ponty. But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one, is his critique of

02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:24.100
ontotheology, his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a supreme being,

02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:29.460
something like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up. And we get disconnected

02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:34.020
from being because we are over-focused on particular beings. We're failing to love

02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:39.940
wisely. We're loving the individual things, and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.

02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:43.220
Can you explain that a little more? What's the difference between the being,

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:45.780
the supreme being, and why that gets us into trouble?

02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:50.980
Okay. Well, we talked about this before. The supreme being is a particular being,

02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:55.860
whereas being is no thing. It's not any particular kind of thing. And so if you're thinking of

02:56:56.420 --> 02:57:01.700
being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way about something that is fundamentally

02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:07.460
no thingness. And so then you're disconnecting yourself from, presumably, ultimate reality.

02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:14.420
This takes me to Tillich. Tillich's great idea is understanding faith as ultimate concern,

02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:24.340
rather than a set of propositions that you're asserting. What are you ultimately concerned

02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:28.900
about? What do you want to have? What do you want to be in right relationship to,

02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:36.180
ratio religio? And is that ultimate? Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?

02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:42.900
Are those two things in sync? This has had a profound influence on me, and I think it's a

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:46.420
brilliant idea. So some of the others, how do they

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:55.220
integrate? Maybe Carl Jung and Freud. Which team are you on?

02:57:55.220 --> 02:58:02.900
I'm on Jung. Freud is the better writer, but Jung has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer

02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:09.060
to where cognitive science is heading. He's more prescient. Which aspect of his model of the psyche?

02:58:09.060 --> 02:58:13.380
Directly. So Freud has a hydraulic model. The psyche is like a steam engine. Things are under

02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:18.980
pressure, and there's a fluid that's moving around. It's like, like this is a record note

02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:24.660
of this. Jung has an organic model. The psyche is like a living being. It's doing all this

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:31.620
opponent processing. It's doing all of this self-transcending and growing. And I think that's a

02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:36.820
much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.

02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:41.780
What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind? What do you think their

02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:49.940
view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow? All bad stuff? Some good stuff?

02:58:51.540 --> 02:58:58.740
Any stuff at all? Well, I mean, both Freud and Jung are only talking about the psycho-dynamic

02:58:58.740 --> 02:59:04.900
unconscious, which is only a small part of the unconscious. Can you elaborate on the psycho-dynamic?

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:09.380
They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do

02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:16.740
with your sort of ego development and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.

02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:22.740
Yeah. What else is there? There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the noise coming out of my

02:59:22.740 --> 02:59:29.380
face hole into ideas. There's the unconscious that says, yeah, all that stuff, which is huge

02:59:29.380 --> 02:59:35.220
and powerful. And they didn't think about that. They were focused on the big romantic stuff

02:59:35.220 --> 02:59:38.260
that you have to deal with through psychotherapy, that kind of stuff.

02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:41.380
Which is relevant and important. I'm not dismissing. I'm not saying it doesn't exist,

02:59:41.380 --> 02:59:46.980
but it's certainly not all of the unconscious. A lot of work that's going on, my colleague and

02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:52.900
deep friend Anderson Todd is about, can we take the Jungian stuff and the cognitive science stuff

02:59:52.900 --> 02:59:57.860
and can we integrate it together theoretically? And so he's working on that, exactly that project.

02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:02.100
But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.

03:00:02.100 --> 03:00:06.980
Or at least an unconscious. I like the term unconscious. And Jung continually reminded

03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:11.780
people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we're not conscious of it. And that's

03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:20.100
its fundamental property. Yeah. And then isn't the task of therapy then to make the unconscious

03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:28.980
conscious? Yeah, to a degree, right? But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there

03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:36.340
was unconscious is part of Jung's mythos. But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:42.100
Part of why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind is that so it can enter into more

03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:48.900
proper dialogical relationship with the self-organizing system of the unconscious mind.

03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:56.580
What did they have to say about the motivations of humans? So for Freud jokingly, I said sex,

03:00:56.580 --> 03:01:02.740
so much of our mind is developed in our young age, our sexual interactions with the world or

03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:09.460
whatever. Hence, the thing about the edible complex and all, you know, I wanted to have sex

03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:15.300
with your mother. What do you think about their description about what motivates humans?

03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:23.860
And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche? Which camp are you in there?

03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:30.980
What motivates humans? Sex or power? I think Plato is right. And I think

03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:35.540
there's a connection for me. Plato is my first philosopher, Jung is my first psychologist,

03:01:35.540 --> 03:01:38.660
and Jung is very much the Plato of the psyche. You never forget your first.

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:46.660
Yeah, you never do. You never do. And I think we have, I reject the monological mind,

03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:52.660
I reject the monophasic mind model. I think we are multi-centered. I think we have different

03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:59.060
centers of motivation that operate according to different principles to satisfy different problems.

03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:08.020
And that part of the task of our humanity is to get those different centers into some

03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:15.540
internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather than in conflict with each

03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:23.860
other. What advice would you give to young people today? They're in high school,

03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:26.580
trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life. Maybe they're in college.

03:02:26.580 --> 03:02:32.740
What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they

03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:39.460
can be proud of? So the first thing is

03:02:42.820 --> 03:02:49.620
find an ecology of practices and a community that supports them without involving you in believing

03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:55.300
things that contravene our best understood science so that wisdom and virtue

03:02:56.900 --> 03:03:03.380
especially how they show up in relationships are primary to you. This will sound ridiculous,

03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:11.220
but if you take care of that, the other things you want are more likely to occur because what

03:03:11.220 --> 03:03:21.300
you most want is what you want at when you're approaching your death is what were the relationships

03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:26.420
you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world. And what did you do to improve the

03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:34.580
chance of them being deep and profound relationships? Well, that's an interesting ecology of practice.

03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:40.260
So like finding a place where a lot of people are doing different things that are interesting

03:03:40.260 --> 03:03:48.020
interplay with each other, but at the same time is not a cult where ideas can flourish. Now,

03:03:48.020 --> 03:03:55.220
how the hell do you know? Because in a place where people are really excited about doing stuff,

03:03:55.220 --> 03:04:00.900
yes, that's very ripe for cult formation, especially if they're awash in a culture in

03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:07.700
which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit. Yes, precisely. So try to keep away from the

03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:13.780
bullshit is the advice. Yes. I mean, I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of people

03:04:13.940 --> 03:04:19.300
I was with a bunch of people in Vermont at the respond retreat, Rafe Kelly was there,

03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:24.660
bunch of people who have set up colleges of practices and created communities.

03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:32.980
And I have good reason to find all of these people trustworthy. And so we gathered together

03:04:32.980 --> 03:04:40.020
to try and generate real deal logos, flow in distributed cognition, exercise the collective

03:04:40.020 --> 03:04:47.220
intelligence and try and address that problem, both in terms of, you know, meta-curriculum that

03:04:47.220 --> 03:04:53.220
we can offer emerging communities in terms of practices of vetting, how we will self-govern the

03:04:53.220 --> 03:05:00.340
federation we're forming so that we can resist gurufication. Gurufication of people or ideas?

03:05:00.340 --> 03:05:09.140
Both, both. Some of us just get unlucky. Some of us get unlucky and we all at respond, we all had

03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:14.980
a tremendous sense of urgency around this, but we were trying to balance it about not being

03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:20.900
premature, but there is going to, I mean, there's, we're going to produce a meta-curriculum that's

03:05:20.900 --> 03:05:26.180
coming in months. There's going to be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on

03:05:26.180 --> 03:05:31.620
wisdom with this practitioner based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom. There's going to be

03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:40.020
projects about how we can create a self-correcting vetting system so we can say to people,

03:05:40.020 --> 03:05:45.300
we think this ecology is legit. It's in good fellowship with all these other legit

03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:51.220
ecologies. We don't know about that one. We're hesitant about that one. It's not in good fellowship.

03:05:51.220 --> 03:05:56.180
We have concerns. Here's why we have our concerns, et cetera. And you may say, well, who are you to

03:05:56.180 --> 03:06:01.460
do that? It's like nobody, but somebody's got to do it, right? And that's what it comes down to.

03:06:01.460 --> 03:06:07.860
And so we're going to give it our best effort. It's worth a try. You talked about the meaning

03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:14.420
crisis in human civilization, but in your own personal life,

03:06:16.900 --> 03:06:22.020
what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind? Has there been difficult times in your

03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:30.020
life where you really struggled? Yes. So when I left Fundamentalist Christianity,

03:06:32.020 --> 03:06:35.700
for a while I was just sort of a hard-bitten atheist.

03:06:38.180 --> 03:06:45.620
The problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with all the non-propositional

03:06:45.620 --> 03:06:51.620
things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and all the perspectives and all the

03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:58.500
identities and the trauma associated with that. So I required therapy. It required years of

03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:06.020
meditation and Tai Chi, and I'm still wrestling with it. But for the first four or five years,

03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:14.100
I described it like this. I called it the black burning. I felt like there was a

03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:20.740
blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the religion had left

03:07:20.740 --> 03:07:25.460
a taste for the transcendent in my mouth, but the food it had given me,

03:07:25.460 --> 03:07:31.940
food in square quotes, had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous. And the juxtaposition of

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:38.420
those seemed like an irresolvable problem for me. That was a very, very dark time for me.

03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:42.500
Did it feel lonely? When it was very bad,

03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:51.700
it felt extremely lonely and deeply alienating. The universe seemed absurd. And there was also

03:07:52.340 --> 03:07:56.500
existential anxiety. I talk about these things for a reason. I don't just talk about them

03:07:56.500 --> 03:08:01.140
as things I'm pointing to. I'm talking about them as seeing in myself and in people I care,

03:08:02.580 --> 03:08:11.300
having undergone them and how they can bring you close to self-destructive. I started engaging in

03:08:11.300 --> 03:08:15.700
kinds of self-destructive behavior. So the meaning crisis to you is not just

03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:22.020
the thing you look outside and see many people struggling, you yourself are struggling.

03:08:23.540 --> 03:08:29.700
That's in fact the narrative. I struggled with it, thinking it was a purely personal,

03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:34.580
idiosyncratic thing. I started learning the Kogsai. I started doing the Tai Chi and the

03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:40.980
meditation. I started doing all this Socratic philosophy. And when I started to talk about

03:08:41.380 --> 03:08:50.180
these pieces, I saw my students' eyes light up. And I realized, oh, wait, maybe this isn't just

03:08:50.180 --> 03:08:55.940
something I'm going through. And then talking to them and then doing the research and expanding

03:08:55.940 --> 03:09:04.260
it out, it's like, oh, many people in a shared fashion and also in an individual lonely fashion

03:09:04.260 --> 03:09:09.380
are going through meaning crisis. Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning,

03:09:09.380 --> 03:09:13.540
and you said that the goal is to love wisely. So let me ask about love.

03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:20.580
What's the role of love in the human condition? It's central. I mean, it's even central to

03:09:21.620 --> 03:09:28.740
reason and rationality. This is Plato, but Spinoza, the most logical of the rationalists.

03:09:30.500 --> 03:09:34.980
The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry, but he calls it the ethics for a reason

03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:41.780
because he wants to talk about the blessed life. And what does he say? He says that ultimately

03:09:41.780 --> 03:09:49.380
reason needs love because love is what brings reason out of being entrapped in the gravity well

03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:55.620
of egocentrism. And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really beautifully,

03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:59.380
love is when you painfully realize that something other than yourself is real.

03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:06.180
Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism. Beautifully put, a beautiful way to end it. John,

03:10:06.180 --> 03:10:10.260
you're a beautiful human being. Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the

03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:17.860
search for meaning and encouraging others to do the same and ultimately to learn how to love

03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:21.940
wisely. Thank you so much for talking today. It's been a great pleasure, Lex. I really

03:10:21.940 --> 03:10:26.740
enjoyed it a lot. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with John.

03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:31.700
Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Breveke. To support this podcast,

03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:36.260
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:42.420
Herman Hesse and Siddhartha. I've always believed and I still believe that whatever good or bad

03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:48.180
fortune may come our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.

03:10:49.220 --> 03:10:52.340
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

03:10:56.740 --> 03:10:56.980
you
