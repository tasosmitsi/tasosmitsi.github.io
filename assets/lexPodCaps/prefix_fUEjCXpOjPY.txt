WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
we have been encouraged culturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with.

00:05.440 --> 00:09.280
Not new relationships. New relationships, you put the person on a pedestal,

00:09.280 --> 00:14.160
you're allowed to just, oh, they're wonderful. But every trope out there and every form of

00:14.160 --> 00:18.560
popular media is like the wife rolling her eyes at the husband and the husband being like,

00:18.560 --> 00:24.640
oh, this loathsome harpy that castrated me. As if people are just passive players in their lives.

00:25.280 --> 00:32.160
And I think that is an incredibly toxic message to send to people, that this is how we should be

00:32.160 --> 00:36.640
relating to our partner. We should not, you don't take the piss out of your partner in front of

00:36.640 --> 00:43.200
people. The successful relationships I've seen are where people are just cheering for their partner,

00:43.200 --> 00:47.280
where they are thick as thieves, where there is just this feeling of like, man,

00:47.280 --> 00:52.240
they like each other. They got each other's back like you wouldn't believe. Man,

00:52.240 --> 00:58.640
you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner, you're going down.

00:59.440 --> 01:08.320
When you see a couple that has that, you just, that's so hard to break. But I think that comes

01:08.320 --> 01:18.320
from having like a steadfast, yeah, no, I don't do that. I don't shit talk my partner. And you

01:18.320 --> 01:25.360
don't shit talk my partner to me. And that to me is because I think we're just so criticized

01:25.360 --> 01:30.480
by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly that having

01:31.120 --> 01:37.200
a partner who no matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Like you fuck, okay,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.560
yeah, you screwed up. I see it. Look, I'm not going to lie to you about your blind spots. You

01:40.560 --> 01:43.520
screwed up, but you know what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of

01:43.520 --> 01:48.080
people screw up. Come on, get up, let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person,

01:48.400 --> 01:52.160
like that, I feel like that's a, that's a superpower.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.040
The following is a conversation with James Sexton, divorce attorney and author of How

01:59.040 --> 02:03.920
to Stay in Love, A Divorce Lawyer's Guide to Staying Together. As a trial lawyer,

02:03.920 --> 02:10.240
James for over two decades has negotiated and litigated a huge number of high conflict divorces.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.880
This has given him a deep understanding of how relationships fail and how they can succeed.

02:16.960 --> 02:23.840
And bigger than that, the role of love and pain in this whole messy roller coaster ride we call

02:23.840 --> 02:30.240
life. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:30.240 --> 02:38.000
And now, dear friends, here's James Sexton. What is the most common reason that marriages fail?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.400
That's a great question, but it's a question that everybody wants there to be a simple answer. Like

02:42.400 --> 02:52.080
they want me to say cheating or money or the internet. But the reality is, I think it's a

02:52.080 --> 02:57.680
lot of little things. It's this disconnection. That would be my answer. The reason marriages fail is

02:57.680 --> 03:04.240
disconnection. What causes disconnection? That's the bigger and I think more important question

03:04.240 --> 03:09.760
because like Tom Wolf said about bankruptcy, it happens very slowly and then all at once.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.960
Disconnection happens very slowly and then all at once. So most of the time, what I think people

03:14.960 --> 03:24.640
want is an answer like cheating. But cheating is the big all at once thing. How did we get to the

03:24.640 --> 03:29.120
place where cheating was even something you were thinking about doing or that you would think about

03:29.120 --> 03:34.480
and then cross the line from thought into action? And that's, I think, the big question. So

03:34.480 --> 03:37.520
disconnection would be my answer. Do you think it's possible to introspect,

03:38.400 --> 03:43.280
looking backwards for every individual case where the disconnection began and how it evolved?

03:43.280 --> 03:50.480
Sure. Yeah. This is such a multivariate equation. It's a dance. It's a chemistry.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.560
What did you do and what did the other person do? And see that the interesting thing about

03:56.560 --> 04:03.600
being a divorce lawyer is I'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom. So I'm telling it's

04:03.600 --> 04:09.360
full context storytelling, what I do for a living. So what I do is I take my client's story

04:10.240 --> 04:16.000
and I have to present it to a judge and make my client the hero in every way and the other side,

04:16.000 --> 04:21.600
the villain in every way. Now I have to be careful not to do that in a manner that loses

04:21.600 --> 04:25.920
credibility because even a judge would know. Even a judge is smart enough to know that

04:25.920 --> 04:33.040
no one's all good or all bad. But only if you were reverse engineering a relationship and saying,

04:33.040 --> 04:39.920
how did this break? You really have to look at both people, the good and the bad, what each of

04:39.920 --> 04:46.480
them did that moved the dial in these different directions. And I think that that's very hard for

04:46.480 --> 04:51.040
anyone going through a divorce to do about their own relationship. We don't know who discovered

04:51.040 --> 04:56.640
water, but it wasn't a fish. If you're in it, I don't think you see it clearly. I think as a divorce

04:56.720 --> 05:03.600
lawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's going on in this story,

05:04.640 --> 05:08.400
I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot about my own arguments, but I also have to

05:08.400 --> 05:13.440
think about what's the other lawyer's argument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I

05:13.440 --> 05:22.320
really have been forced to look at both sides for so many years, so deeply in relationships that

05:22.320 --> 05:26.880
once you do that, you realize that the good guy, bad guy thing just doesn't apply.

05:26.880 --> 05:33.760
I wonder if it's the little things or a few big things that caused this connection. You've talked

05:33.760 --> 05:39.600
about granola and blowjobs, but those seem to be stories that you can tell to yourself.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.000
Maybe that story should be explained or maybe not.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You don't think granola and blowjobs is self-explanatory?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.960
Almost. I think people can construct a good... If you ask GPT, what do they mean?

05:52.960 --> 05:58.320
I think the story that would come up is a pretty good one. But that's a story you tell about when

05:58.320 --> 06:06.320
you first knew the disconnection has begun, is when he stopped buying my favorite granola,

06:06.320 --> 06:12.160
or when she stopped giving blowjobs. I would say when it's reached a critical mass.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.160
Yeah, phase shift.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.200
Because I think it started before that when she said, yeah, I used to give him blowjobs.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.440
When we were in our early relationship, and then one day I just was like, oh, well,

06:23.440 --> 06:27.040
we don't have much time. I'll wait until later and we'll have sex, and then we both enjoy it.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.880
Blowjobs are inefficient.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.920
Yeah, exactly correct.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.440
You batch it all together.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.280
Yeah. So she said, and they had kids at that point. So I think she really was like, hey,

06:35.280 --> 06:40.560
we've gotten a certain window, so let's have something we both enjoy. So I don't think she

06:40.640 --> 06:47.280
had any negative intentions there. I think that she was working in good faith towards the betterment

06:47.280 --> 06:55.840
of the relationship, but it was having this second order effect. And so I really do think

06:55.840 --> 07:01.120
that, yeah, the blowjobs, granola. I mean, there are anyone who's been in a long-term relationship.

07:02.480 --> 07:10.080
I guess it's just worth asking the question, what does this person do that makes me feel loved?

07:11.120 --> 07:19.920
Because I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life. I remember I had a difficult

07:19.920 --> 07:25.840
chapter with one of my sons, my younger son, when he was in his early 20s. And we were having a

07:25.840 --> 07:31.600
heartfelt conversation. And I said to him, do you know I love you? And he said, well, yeah,

07:31.600 --> 07:36.880
of course I do. I said, but do you feel my love? Like, do you feel it? Not just do you know it

07:36.880 --> 07:43.120
intellectually, do you feel it? And I remember thinking to myself, when do we feel someone's

07:43.120 --> 07:48.880
love, right? Like, what is it that they do? And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things that

07:48.880 --> 07:53.680
they would never know. They are the person who's showing us that they love us and that we're

07:53.680 --> 07:59.760
feeling their love. They would never show us. Like if you said, why does this person love you? They

07:59.760 --> 08:04.320
wouldn't say, oh, because I always make sure that when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom

08:04.320 --> 08:08.800
of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it. Or I always hold the door

08:08.800 --> 08:13.920
for them. Or I, you know, oh, I always, like, again, I buy the granola that I know this person

08:13.920 --> 08:20.800
likes, you know, or I remembered that they don't like it when I put on this particular record so

08:20.800 --> 08:27.600
I don't put it on. Like, and those are these, yes, they're small things, but they're not small.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.160
They're kind of everything. Do you think it's good to communicate that stuff? Well, 100%.

08:32.160 --> 08:39.840
It takes away some of the power of it, right? When you point it out, then the person realizes,

08:39.840 --> 08:44.160
oh, okay, he likes this or dislikes this. So yes, there becomes a deliberateness to it,

08:44.160 --> 08:50.400
you know, a conscious. So I understand not pointing that out when it's a good thing.

08:51.760 --> 08:59.840
I think when it's a negative thing, like I think in the granola situation, if she had said to him,

09:00.000 --> 09:07.440
hey, you used to do this and you've stopped. That feels like something to me. Like she said,

09:07.440 --> 09:10.560
she didn't say anything about that, just like he probably didn't say anything about the blowjobs.

09:10.560 --> 09:18.320
Like, I think if there had been a moment of this is starting, let's talk about it while it's starting,

09:18.320 --> 09:23.920
but people wait, from what I can see, people wait until the big thing happens, the financial

09:24.000 --> 09:28.240
impropriety, the substance use disorder, the cheating, they wait for that to happen.

09:28.240 --> 09:35.360
And then they go, where did we go wrong? And the answer is quite a while ago, with the granola.

09:37.360 --> 09:42.480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you notice something, like you notice that little something,

09:44.240 --> 09:50.320
talk about it. Because that little something is probably a kernel of a deeper truth. Of course,

09:50.320 --> 09:55.920
there's also moods. We're all like a rollercoaster of emotions, so you can not bring a granola one

09:55.920 --> 10:03.680
day just because you're in this place where nothing is, just cynicism everywhere, just anger and so

10:03.680 --> 10:09.600
on. But it's a temporary feeling, but maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper

10:09.600 --> 10:15.280
current that's actually building up. Yeah. And I think a good partner wants to understand

10:15.280 --> 10:20.560
the currents of their partner. They want to understand, hey, are you going through something?

10:20.560 --> 10:26.320
And look, if I'm the one you need to take it out on, that's okay. I'm a big boy. I can take it.

10:26.320 --> 10:32.160
If you're hormonal, if you're frustrated at work, if you're whatever, we should be able to

10:32.880 --> 10:40.080
have a little bit of that interaction in a relationship. But I do think it's so easy to

10:40.880 --> 10:48.640
just say to people, communication is the key. But it really is about fearless kinds of communication.

10:48.640 --> 10:57.040
It's about really honestly saying to somebody, this feels like something to me. Am I wrong?

10:57.040 --> 11:02.240
This just feels like something to me. And also how that's presented. One of the things I'm very

11:02.320 --> 11:13.280
caught up on or feel very strongly about is that we have been encouraged culturally to criticize

11:13.920 --> 11:18.240
people we're in long-term relationships with. Not new relationships. New relationships,

11:18.240 --> 11:22.080
you put the person on a pedestal, you're allowed to just, oh, they're wonderful.

11:22.080 --> 11:27.120
But every trope out there in every form of popular media is like the wife rolling her

11:27.120 --> 11:31.760
eyes at the husband and the husband being like, oh, this loathsome harpy that castrated me.

11:32.240 --> 11:40.240
As if people are just passive players in their lives. And I think that is an incredibly toxic

11:40.240 --> 11:45.920
message to send to people, that this is how we should be relating to our partner. Don't take the

11:45.920 --> 11:51.200
piss out of your partner in front of people. The successful relationships I've seen are where

11:51.200 --> 11:56.080
people are just cheering for their partner, where they are thick as thieves, where there is just

11:56.080 --> 12:01.840
this feeling of like, man, they like each other. They got each other's back like you wouldn't

12:01.840 --> 12:07.440
believe. Man, you could take sides against anybody, but take sides against their partner,

12:08.480 --> 12:18.480
you're going down. When you see a couple that has that, that's so hard to break. But I think that

12:18.480 --> 12:28.960
comes from having a steadfast, yeah, no, I don't do that. I don't shit talk my partner. And you

12:28.960 --> 12:36.000
don't shit talk my partner to me. And that to me is because I think we're just so criticized

12:36.000 --> 12:41.120
by the world. The world is so full of criticism. We criticize ourselves so harshly that having

12:41.760 --> 12:48.720
a partner who no matter what is like, you've got this, I'm with you. Okay, yeah, you screwed up.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.760
I see it. Look, I'm not going to lie to you about your blind spots. You screwed up, but you know

12:51.760 --> 12:55.200
what? People screw up sometimes. You got a right to screw up. A lot of people screw up. Come on,

12:55.200 --> 13:01.280
get up. Let's go. I know you have it in you. If you have that person, I feel like that's a

13:02.160 --> 13:06.240
superpower to have that effect on another person. Yeah, one of the things I love seeing,

13:06.960 --> 13:13.920
you look at a couple and one is talking, like in an interview, answering a question,

13:13.920 --> 13:19.440
especially like intellectual questions. Like, what do you think about the war in Ukraine or

13:19.440 --> 13:26.000
something? And then the partner is talking and then the other person is looking at them

13:26.000 --> 13:32.560
as if they're hearing the wisest thing ever. They're still looking at them, not waiting for

13:32.560 --> 13:36.720
their turn to speak, not thinking about how's the audience going to take that, but they're looking

13:36.720 --> 13:44.880
at them like, God damn, I'm so lucky to be with this smart motherfucker. And they could be saying

13:45.840 --> 13:50.640
There's a scene in the movie, True Romance. I love a great movie. I mean, Gary Oldman

13:50.640 --> 13:55.920
scenes like the greatest scene ever done in film with Christian Slater. But there's a scene in it

13:55.920 --> 14:03.120
where she holds up a sign to Christian Slater and it says, you're so cool. And I like, man,

14:03.120 --> 14:10.320
that's it. That's it. I think I say it somewhere in the book that you go to weddings and when the

14:10.320 --> 14:15.680
bride walks in, everybody's looking at the bride. It's her show. Everybody turns around,

14:15.680 --> 14:20.480
it's the first glimpse everybody gets of the bride. And I never look at the bride. I always

14:20.480 --> 14:28.240
look at the groom looking at the bride. Because there's this like, to me, that's every like,

14:28.240 --> 14:32.080
he has this look like this, because this is the first time he's seeing her in the dress most of

14:32.080 --> 14:36.320
the time. And also, he's seeing her like, holy shit, she's coming down the aisle, we're getting

14:36.320 --> 14:41.600
married. Like, but this is it. And everyone's looking at her. And I always look at him because

14:41.600 --> 14:46.960
I always think to myself, like, the look on his face is like, that's like this feeling of like,

14:46.960 --> 14:52.080
holy, yeah, wow. Okay, like that's, everyone's looking at her and she's mine. And she's coming

14:52.080 --> 14:58.560
up here and we're getting married. And I feel like, yeah, like that kind of adoration. Like,

14:58.560 --> 15:02.640
I think that's the look we're describing is like adoration, like that the words coming out of their

15:02.640 --> 15:08.000
mouth that they're like, yeah, that's mine. That one's mine. You know, that's such a great thing.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.560
Like, it's such a great feeling. Seeing the good stuff like with with true romance. I mean,

15:13.360 --> 15:19.600
you could make fun of the guys totally cringe wearing Elvis, like essentially being a fake Elvis

15:19.600 --> 15:26.000
with shades and like, what is he doing? It's like watching these kung fu movies. But from her

15:26.000 --> 15:31.360
perspective, and from any perspective you could take on him is this is the the baddest motherfucker

15:31.360 --> 15:37.520
who's ever lived. Like he's willing to do those things for me, but not like it's almost like an

15:37.520 --> 15:45.280
epic heroic figure. And we're living in this epic hero story. And what does that do to him though?

15:45.280 --> 15:52.400
Yeah, that's what see that that's the point. Like if there's a point to this, to this whole thing,

15:52.400 --> 15:59.120
this couple thing. Yeah. Isn't that it? Yeah. Like I don't I don't understand this idea of,

15:59.600 --> 16:05.040
you know, we had a successful marriage, we were married for 50 something years, we were miserable

16:05.040 --> 16:10.480
for 47 of them, but we hung in there like it. This is an endurance event. Like the primary

16:10.480 --> 16:16.480
relationship of your life, you've decided you're going to turn into the the like a 50 mile trail

16:16.480 --> 16:23.120
race. Like, why? Why would you do that? Like, congratulations, you took the concept of monogamy

16:23.760 --> 16:27.600
and made it something that two people are absolutely not going to enjoy, but you hung

16:27.600 --> 16:31.600
in there like congratulations. And I understand there's religious perspectives that say, well,

16:31.600 --> 16:36.000
it's a sacred covenant, but I have a real chicken or the egg problem with that. Because I think it

16:36.000 --> 16:41.520
was like, well, how do we sell this incredibly stupid concept that isn't working to people?

16:41.520 --> 16:47.360
I know we'll tell them God says you have to, and we'll sign on for that. I don't buy it. I don't

16:47.360 --> 16:54.480
buy it anymore. I really because when you see a successful marriage, or you see to be even without

16:54.480 --> 16:59.600
a marriage, you see a pair bond, you see a couple that really love each other and cheer for each

16:59.600 --> 17:05.200
other in that way and like hang on each other's words that way and like are just in each other's

17:05.200 --> 17:13.040
corner that way. You see the fake shit instantly. Like you see the difference right away. It's like

17:13.040 --> 17:17.600
if you, you know, the first time I've, this is the first time I've come to Austin. I've thought I'd

17:17.600 --> 17:24.160
eaten a lot of barbecue in my life. I've never had Texas barbecue. I landed, I went and had barbecue.

17:24.160 --> 17:28.480
I was like, okay, I've never had barbecue before. Apparently this is, this is a whole different

17:28.480 --> 17:33.920
thing. I think it's the same thing. I think it's like, once you see real love, like real love,

17:34.480 --> 17:40.080
and I mean, romantic love, like real love, like that real bond, real, you go, oh yeah, this other

17:40.080 --> 17:44.640
thing's not going to do it. Do you think that's a daily deliberate choice that, that a couple like

17:44.640 --> 17:54.800
that makes? Cause it feels like a very easy to do deliberate step. Like choose to see the brilliant

17:54.800 --> 18:00.080
in it, the beautiful in it. And almost immediately everything shifts and it becomes this momentum

18:00.080 --> 18:03.360
where all you see is the beautiful and all you see is the brilliant.

18:03.360 --> 18:08.160
That is a conscious choice. I think approaching life that way is a conscious choice. Approaching

18:08.160 --> 18:13.120
any relationship that way is a conscious choice. I mean, looking at someone who hurts you

18:14.000 --> 18:19.680
or does something hurtful to you and thinking about what's going on in their life that they're

18:19.680 --> 18:24.000
doing that or what's happening with them. Yeah, that's a very conscious choice. And I think a

18:24.000 --> 18:28.960
better one, a better one than seething and animosity and letting that eat you alive. But,

18:29.680 --> 18:36.880
but I, I don't know that it's, I don't think it should be so difficult. Like with our children,

18:36.880 --> 18:42.640
with our pets, we don't have this problem. Like you never have someone look at their dog

18:43.360 --> 18:48.480
who they've had for eight years and go, I gotta get a new dog. Like I've had this one for eight

18:48.480 --> 18:53.440
years. Like I gotta get, like puppies are so cute. What am I doing with this old dog? Like

18:54.000 --> 18:58.480
it's the total opposite. They're like, oh my God, this is like my dog. This is my dog. Like

18:58.480 --> 19:02.800
the smell of the dog is like, this is my dog's smell. The bad habits of the dog. You're like,

19:02.800 --> 19:07.040
that's my stupid dog that does stupid things. And it's not like that has to be a conscious

19:07.040 --> 19:10.480
like they wake up every day and go, I should be grateful for the dog. Like it's just visceral.

19:10.480 --> 19:15.200
It's in them, you know? And so, and your children, like people's children, you know,

19:15.200 --> 19:20.560
it's why people are like not aware of how annoying their children are because they're not annoying

19:20.560 --> 19:27.040
to them. Like I get it. Like to you, the sound of your kids shrieking is like, oh, my kids

19:27.040 --> 19:32.240
having a good time. And you don't get that. And see, when I try to, when I hear that,

19:32.880 --> 19:37.280
I try to hear it with those ears. Like, oh, that, like I'm a parent. I get it. My kids are adults

19:37.280 --> 19:41.520
now, but like, I get it. Like, so when I hear a kid shrieking, I just am like, oh, like to that

19:41.520 --> 19:45.120
parent, that's the sound of that kid having a great time and good. Like, it's so nice that

19:45.120 --> 19:49.440
that's in the world. But it, so for me, it has to be conscious for that parent. I don't think it

19:49.440 --> 19:56.880
has to be conscious. So I think it would be great if it didn't have to be a conscious practice,

19:56.880 --> 20:03.280
but I wonder if like anything in meditation or mindfulness, it's a matter of exercising

20:03.280 --> 20:12.960
that way of seeing. And then once you've come to that, it becomes itself, right? Like it really

20:12.960 --> 20:20.080
does. Like you're, I think it's, it initially has to be a conscious practice. And by the way,

20:20.960 --> 20:28.960
it's easier to make it a conscious practice before it started to fade, right? Like the,

20:29.600 --> 20:35.520
I mean, that's what's so amazing about marriage is there's like almost 8 billion people in the

20:35.520 --> 20:42.800
world and you're picking this one. So when you marry in theory, like the stock's at its highest,

20:42.800 --> 20:48.560
like you're as crazy about each other as you could possibly be. So that's the time to get into this

20:48.560 --> 20:53.120
mindfulness, to get into this practice, not once it's like the wheels are starting to come off.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.240
It's much harder. It's like gaining a bunch of weight and then saying, okay, how am I going to

20:56.240 --> 21:00.560
lose the weight now? Well, I think that even before marriage, like right away,

21:00.560 --> 21:05.440
just see everything is beautiful. Let me quote Bojack Horseman on this. When you look at someone

21:05.440 --> 21:10.800
through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags. That's great. There's a

21:10.800 --> 21:15.920
certain sense where if you, from the very beginning, of course you could end up in toxic

21:15.920 --> 21:22.480
relationships that way, but you know, life is short. You're going to die eventually. Might as

21:22.480 --> 21:28.400
well really go all in on relationships. There's a line in Drugstore Cowboy, a great film,

21:28.960 --> 21:31.760
where he says, we played a game you couldn't win to the utmost.

21:33.680 --> 21:39.920
And I think everything, I think life is a game you can't win. And so you play it to the utmost.

21:40.560 --> 21:46.720
Like to love anything is insane because you are accepting that you're going to lose it.

21:47.520 --> 21:57.280
Like I'm a dog person and you get a dog and you've just resigned yourself to unbelievable pain

21:57.280 --> 22:03.680
because this thing's going to die in like 10 years, maybe 15 if you're lucky. And why would

22:03.680 --> 22:08.880
you open your heart to that? Why would you let, because the joy is just so wonderful of it,

22:08.880 --> 22:12.800
of the ride up until it. Same thing with us. I mean, every marriage, every relationship,

22:12.880 --> 22:19.840
every love is going to end. It's going to end in death or divorce. So why not like just go in,

22:19.840 --> 22:25.600
like go in, like go in and just get, get weird, you know, like don't define it the way that's,

22:25.600 --> 22:30.000
I mean, look at, you know, again, we keep going back to true romance, but just get weird. Like,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.840
yeah, I love this Elvis pretending to be weirdo. I love this like, you know, like former sex worker

22:35.840 --> 22:40.240
who's like, you know, like whatever, like just go in, like love this person, have them love you.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.800
Don't worry about what everybody else is doing in their relationship. Like we're in such, I mean,

22:44.800 --> 22:51.520
it's not to me surprising that, that as the performative aspects of life on social media

22:51.520 --> 22:55.680
increases, people's satisfaction with their relationships and the divorce rate,

22:56.240 --> 23:02.480
you know, is, is following the same trend because I think everyone's going, well, what's everybody

23:02.480 --> 23:07.280
else doing? You know, well, how much sex is everyone else having? The only two people that

23:07.280 --> 23:10.720
should worry about how much sex you're having with the two people. If the two people are happy

23:10.720 --> 23:13.680
in the relationship, great. Then what does it matter? What does it matter what everybody else

23:13.680 --> 23:18.240
is doing? Yeah, there should be an element to great relationships and great friendships of like,

23:18.240 --> 23:22.800
fuck the world. It's us versus the world. It's us. It's us. And that's what I mean when I say that,

23:22.800 --> 23:26.960
that thick is thieves. Like when they're, when they're like a unit like that, because it's,

23:26.960 --> 23:32.000
look at, it's just us. It's just what we want. It's what we like. And that's why I said like,

23:32.000 --> 23:37.200
you know, even when it comes to sex or things like that, like if you can't be candid with your

23:37.200 --> 23:43.120
partner about whatever weird shit you're into or what fantasy you had and any particular,

23:43.120 --> 23:47.520
well then who the hell can you be candid with? I mean, because you're going to either go without

23:47.520 --> 23:53.280
or go elsewhere. And neither of those is a particularly healthy option or helpful option.

23:53.280 --> 23:59.520
It's, it's the start of that decline. So why, why open yourself to that decline,

23:59.520 --> 24:04.560
which invariably is just the path to the chair in front of me in my office.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.800
Yeah. You have a full section in your book on, on foot fetishes.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.360
I do. I do. Yeah. Which is funny because I don't know anything about foot fetishes.

24:13.360 --> 24:18.400
Yeah. Like I can't, I'm not King shaming anybody, but like there's nothing sexual about feet to me

24:18.400 --> 24:23.040
at all. Like I just don't get it. I don't, but I mean, listen to people like things. It's good,

24:23.040 --> 24:31.680
you know, but yeah, I, I, I have had clients that have odd fetishes or sexual proclivities or things

24:31.680 --> 24:37.120
they want to do and they don't share it with their partner at all. And then they find an outlet for

24:37.120 --> 24:41.440
it because they try to go without it and that doesn't work. So they try to find some other outlet

24:41.440 --> 24:45.680
for it. And then that's interpreted as a betrayal and it creates distance and people split up.

24:45.680 --> 24:50.720
And of course everybody likes to have like a, you know, a bad guy to blame it on. So when you say,

24:50.720 --> 24:54.080
well, why'd you guys get divorced? Oh, cause he secretly had a foot fetish and he was on these

24:54.080 --> 24:58.080
message boards, like meeting people about, well, it gives you an easy answer as to why the two of

24:58.080 --> 25:02.320
you split up. But I don't think, you know, most divorces have such simple answers as it was a

25:02.320 --> 25:08.320
foot thing. But I also think too, like, listen, if you got a partner and we all do stuff that we're

25:08.320 --> 25:13.600
not super into because we're in a relationship and that's what part of it is. Like, do you really

25:13.600 --> 25:17.360
want to go see that chick flick? Do you really want to eat at this restaurant? You really want

25:17.360 --> 25:21.440
to go to her cousin's wedding? No, but you know, part of being a relationship is okay, if you're

25:21.440 --> 25:26.160
into this, I'm going to pretend this song's a good song, you know, even though it's not my favorite

25:26.160 --> 25:31.840
song. And I think, I just don't know, we've turned sex, I mean, sex has been so politicized

25:31.840 --> 25:37.520
in recent years, maybe it always was, but I think we've made it into something where we can't just,

25:38.080 --> 25:44.240
I don't know, I'm not into feet, but if the woman I love was like, you know, I'm really into feet,

25:44.240 --> 25:47.920
like I really want to do stuff with your feet. I'd be like, all right, I can pretend that I'm

25:47.920 --> 25:52.800
into that. Like for, it's not going to kill me. I'm not going to be able to make it a centerpiece

25:52.800 --> 25:56.480
of our coupling, but you know, like, yeah, I can pretend I'm into feet if you want.

25:56.480 --> 26:02.720
I don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the normal discourse.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.520
As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience the whole spectrum.

26:06.240 --> 26:11.760
But if I, like, if I was into like furries, for example, I don't know how I would initiate

26:11.760 --> 26:16.960
the conversation with my partner about that. But frame the question the other direction.

26:17.680 --> 26:26.000
If you were into furries, how do you prevent your partner from knowing anything about that?

26:26.800 --> 26:32.400
That feels like a real, you'd have to make a conscious choice to not let your partner

26:32.400 --> 26:40.080
know. So I don't think either of those is a particularly palatable or easy proposition.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.000
But a lot of people live life hiding some part of themselves.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.160
Quite unsuccessfully. The second order effects of that are very rarely positive.

26:51.040 --> 26:55.360
I don't think I've ever met someone who went, yeah, I really hid this huge part of myself for

26:55.360 --> 26:59.760
an extended period of time. And that's the best thing that happened. I'm really glad I stayed in

26:59.760 --> 27:05.520
the closet as long as I did. It really worked out. It rarely does. It's a question of how long can

27:05.520 --> 27:13.280
you hold it off? I know gay men who stayed in the closet for 40 years, 50 years of their lives.

27:14.560 --> 27:20.160
And then they had a successful second chapter as a gay man. I've had clients like that.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.680
Do they regret that they were in the closet? No, because they were married, they had kids,

27:25.680 --> 27:31.840
they had experiences, they're glad they had. But would their advice to a young person in their

27:31.840 --> 27:35.760
20s and 30s who's gay be, stay in the closet because then you can have a wife and some kids

27:35.760 --> 27:40.400
and then you can come out when you're 50 or 60 and have a second chapter? No. They would say,

27:40.400 --> 27:46.000
be who you are. Don't be afraid. As you were talking, I'm trying to think of, because I'm

27:46.000 --> 27:49.680
publicly and privately, I'm the exact same person, or try to be the exact same person.

27:49.680 --> 27:54.160
So I usually try to make sure there's nothing to hide. But I was trying to come up with a

27:54.160 --> 28:00.800
common example for you for if there's good things to hide. Well, I mean, there could be past

28:00.800 --> 28:08.000
relationships. If I slept with thousands of women or something like this, maybe you want to

28:08.880 --> 28:15.520
put that to the side. There's a difference between being honest about something and being

28:16.480 --> 28:23.440
indelicate about it. I think we all do this with lovers. Like any of us who've

28:23.440 --> 28:30.560
been in more than one relationship, you would not at the end of sex be like, that was the third best

28:30.560 --> 28:40.480
sex I've ever had. It's just indelicate. It's rude. So I don't think it's a matter of total

28:40.480 --> 28:47.280
candor at all times. But I think if you were, we're using the furry example, I'm not picking on

28:47.280 --> 28:55.280
furries. I just think if that is a proclivity that is anything other than a passing thought,

28:55.360 --> 29:00.960
it's something that you just keep coming back to. Then you're making a conscious decision

29:00.960 --> 29:06.080
to withhold it from your partner. And what is that out of? I mean, I would say it's probably

29:06.080 --> 29:10.800
out of fear. I'm not a psychologist, but probably out of fear, fear that they would

29:10.800 --> 29:25.120
reject you. See, I genuinely believe that this, I'm very conflicted in my religious faith.

29:25.280 --> 29:32.720
But I don't know that I believe in the devil. But if there was a devil, I think his principal

29:32.720 --> 29:38.400
function would be to convince us that we are so bestial that God couldn't love us. It would be

29:38.400 --> 29:44.480
to convince us that we're awful and that we should just lean into the awfulness. And I know the

29:44.480 --> 29:53.120
greatest low points of my life came whenever I just went, you know what, I'm just awful. I might

29:53.120 --> 30:07.360
as well just behave awfully. And I really believe that when you push down parts of yourself,

30:08.720 --> 30:16.240
like your sexuality, like your insecurities, your true feelings from your romantic partner,

30:16.320 --> 30:24.320
the person who's supposed to be your number one, you are making sure you will never feel their love

30:25.920 --> 30:31.600
because they don't love you. They love the you you've presented to them, which you know

30:31.600 --> 30:38.320
in your heart is not the authentic, honest, real you. And so if you know you're super into

30:38.320 --> 30:44.080
furries and you don't tell your partner about that, and your partner says, I love you so much,

30:44.080 --> 30:47.680
and you know what I love? One of the things I love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry.

30:47.680 --> 30:52.480
You will never feel that love because you know, yeah, that's not true though. She doesn't know.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.960
She doesn't know that actually I'm not really satisfied. And there is this thing that I want

30:56.960 --> 31:01.360
that I know I can't even tell her because I'm so ashamed. Like that doesn't feel like a good

31:01.360 --> 31:10.160
option to me. Yeah. Yeah. So that kind of vulnerability is essential to intimacy.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.840
You know, I'm prone to jiu-jitsu metaphors, and this is one of the first conversations where I

31:13.840 --> 31:18.480
can actually use them because the person I'm talking to is a jiu-jitsu person. And people

31:18.480 --> 31:24.640
should know that you are a quote unquote jiu-jitsu person. You have been afflicted with the disease.

31:24.640 --> 31:29.520
I am a brown belt under Marcelo Garcia, and I am like a seven-year brown belt now.

31:29.520 --> 31:35.120
Which is the right way to be a brown belt. Well, and also I am late middle-aged,

31:36.000 --> 31:41.120
middle weight and moderately talented. And training at that academy with so

31:41.120 --> 31:44.880
many incredibly talented people and training in New York City where there's so many unbelievably

31:44.880 --> 31:48.960
talented people, you're constantly humble and feeling like you should just be wearing a blue

31:48.960 --> 31:55.600
belt all the time. But a lot of, I think as you know, and as most people who practice jiu-jitsu

31:55.600 --> 32:03.120
know, you start to sort of see jiu-jitsu in everything. I genuinely believe that in love,

32:03.200 --> 32:07.760
you have to give something to get something. You have to create, everything you do creates

32:07.760 --> 32:15.360
a vulnerability. Every move you make in jiu-jitsu creates opportunity and creates vulnerability.

32:15.360 --> 32:20.400
And so you have to be willing to create vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage,

32:20.400 --> 32:25.280
in order to get any progress, in any way to move the position. You don't want a marriage

32:25.280 --> 32:31.440
that's just two people both in 50-50. Like you're just sitting in that car doing nothing. You want

32:32.240 --> 32:37.280
to, you want it to actually move along. Yeah. I mean, that's the way I see love

32:37.280 --> 32:42.240
in relationships is you should take that leap of vulnerability, give the other person the option

32:42.240 --> 32:50.160
to destroy you. Well, you have to expose. And that's the part that I think is hard for everyone,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.640
is to expose yourself in that way. But that's what I mean even when I said about

32:55.360 --> 33:01.440
getting a dog or having a child. Like love, loving anything is tremendously courageous

33:02.560 --> 33:08.560
because it's terrifying. And it's only brave if you're scared. If you're not scared,

33:09.520 --> 33:15.200
you know, it's not brave. It's just stupidity. It's just, you know, it's bravery when you're

33:15.200 --> 33:21.040
afraid and you do the thing anyway. And so love is like, yeah, it's scary. Like I don't care who you

33:21.040 --> 33:26.400
are. Like, you know, being, you know, in the Jiu-Jitsu community, like I'm around, you know,

33:26.400 --> 33:31.520
as you are all like incredibly tough people, like physically tough people, mentally tough people.

33:32.160 --> 33:39.680
But, you know, I've seen some of those people taken down by a 120 pound woman, you know,

33:39.680 --> 33:47.200
not from a grappling perspective, but they are taken apart by a woman in their life and vice versa.

33:47.200 --> 33:53.600
I've seen men, you know, who like, it really is shocking how much leverage we give to our

33:53.600 --> 34:00.720
romantic partners and how little discussion we really, genuine discussion we really have about it,

34:00.720 --> 34:06.160
how much we really are ever trained to think about it. You know, there's nothing in school

34:06.160 --> 34:12.560
that teaches us about it. So much of literature and art is an idealized version of it.

34:13.520 --> 34:20.160
So little of it is real. And no matter how it evolves, even when it ends in tragedy or

34:21.440 --> 34:28.880
drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times, like appreciate

34:29.920 --> 34:36.720
how beautiful it is to having taken the risk and to having experienced that kind of love.

34:36.720 --> 34:40.080
I mean, when you look at people that are divorcing each other,

34:42.160 --> 34:47.840
there's an Edgar Allan Poe quote, the years of love have been forgot in the hatred of a minute.

34:47.840 --> 34:54.640
I always kind of am saddened, like deeply saddened, how people seem to forget how many

34:54.640 --> 35:01.600
beautiful moments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to

35:01.600 --> 35:06.480
part ways. Yeah, yeah. It's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer,

35:06.480 --> 35:11.360
because I felt that way for a long time. And I really try to say to my clients,

35:12.160 --> 35:16.640
like in the courtroom at the negotiating table, I have a role to play where I have to be sort of

35:16.640 --> 35:22.640
like a pit bull or some kind of like a courtroom sociopath. But behind closed doors, I'm very

35:22.640 --> 35:26.000
candid with people. I try to be much more emotionally attuned with them.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.800
So you're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.440
Exactly. Correct. That's well said. I get a new tattoo idea. That's good. I like that.

35:36.320 --> 35:42.800
I, I, but I do believe when I'm behind closed doors with people, I say to them, how you end

35:42.800 --> 35:47.680
things is going to be how you're going to remember the whole thing. And that's unfortunate. Because,

35:47.680 --> 35:53.200
you know, you watch like a two hour movie, and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked, you go, well,

35:53.200 --> 35:58.320
that movie sucked. Like, well, the first hour and 45 was great, you know, but you walk out with this

35:58.320 --> 36:07.760
bad taste in your mouth. I, I'm genuinely in awe of how easily people forget that they loved

36:07.760 --> 36:15.120
each other. And, and I'm amazed because by the time I meet them, and by the time they, they hire

36:15.120 --> 36:21.680
me to be a weapon against the person they were in love with, there's nothing but animosity there.

36:22.640 --> 36:28.320
And so I have to try to imagine what these two people looked like when they were in love with

36:28.320 --> 36:34.960
each other and how that even existed. But I have to tell you, like I, you know, I don't function

36:34.960 --> 36:40.880
that way. Like I, every woman I ever had a relationship with, like I, when I think of them,

36:40.880 --> 36:47.040
I don't think of the ending necessarily. I think of, I try to think about the greatest hits. I try

36:47.120 --> 36:52.400
to think about the moments that were wonderful, where I loved them and they loved me. And like,

36:52.400 --> 36:58.000
there was joy and there was connection. And I, I don't know why you'd choose not to, you know,

36:58.000 --> 37:03.040
it's there's that old axiom, I don't know who said it, that if you don't learn to find joy in the

37:03.040 --> 37:08.640
snow, you'll have, you'll have less joy in your life and precisely the same amount of snow.

37:11.280 --> 37:16.480
And I, and I genuinely believe like, okay, the relationship ends. This is where it ends. We're

37:16.480 --> 37:24.880
done now. I, I am making a choice as to how I will remember you. And, and we do it in relationships.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.560
Like I, I always tell people, you know, if you ever want to see a couple light up, if they're

37:28.560 --> 37:31.680
ever like the couple at the table, it's, you know, it seems like they got in a fight or something,

37:31.680 --> 37:37.360
ask them how they met. And most people, when they talk about how they met, like the face softens,

37:37.920 --> 37:41.600
they both in the other person looking at them, telling the story gets that look you were talking

37:41.680 --> 37:46.800
about before. And cause they remember that thing and how they felt at that moment. And when, when

37:46.800 --> 37:53.680
this person was a choice, not a default, not their automatic plus one, but the person they asked to

37:53.680 --> 37:56.720
the wedding, not the, of course you're bringing her, it's your wife. You bring your fucking wife

37:56.720 --> 38:04.000
places. Like it was still, Hey, there's like, you know, three and a half billion women and I'm

38:04.000 --> 38:11.120
picking you, you know, like that, that feeling. And, and I don't know when, why, when a relationship

38:11.120 --> 38:18.080
ends, you can't do that. A lesson I learned when my mother passed away of, of a very, she had a two

38:18.080 --> 38:25.120
year terrible battle with cancer and was on hospice and was very, very sick and it was a very slow and

38:25.120 --> 38:32.000
awful end. And I remember one of my worst fears was that this is how I would remember my mother

38:32.000 --> 38:37.680
for the rest of my life. That I would never be able to think of her that I didn't think

38:37.680 --> 38:43.120
of what she had become in the last months where she was withered away to nothing in this bed,

38:43.120 --> 38:50.720
you know? And I learned over time that memory is very kind that like that faded somehow.

38:50.720 --> 38:56.000
And that now, like when I remember her, I remember her healthy and vibrant. I remember her laughter.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.800
I remember positive things. Some of that is I like to look at photos of that or, but some of it is

39:00.800 --> 39:08.480
just how I think memory works. And I, I don't know why we don't apply that to relationships.

39:09.120 --> 39:14.000
And I think part of it is because we have this binary view of relationships, that it's either

39:14.000 --> 39:17.840
success, which means you live happily ever after for the rest of your lives and die together,

39:18.880 --> 39:26.400
or like in short succession, or it was wrong. It was awful. And I don't understand why that

39:26.400 --> 39:31.200
would have to be how we do it. I think we could look at relationships like what they are, which

39:31.200 --> 39:40.080
is chapters in a book. And that book is our life. And those chapters all have significance. And

39:40.080 --> 39:43.440
none of them would have the later chapters, none of them would happen without the prior ones.

39:44.080 --> 39:48.160
So there's this beauty to me of that. And it's, I don't know if that it's a choice

39:48.560 --> 39:57.360
or if that is how it is. And the rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it culturally

39:57.360 --> 40:01.760
for some reason. Well, I think to, to push back a little bit, I think memory

40:03.200 --> 40:08.880
can also, I think it is a deliberate choice because I think memory can basically, that's

40:08.880 --> 40:15.200
how trauma works. It can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff completely drowns

40:15.200 --> 40:21.840
out all the positive. So it's, I think it's a deliberate choice to make your memory probably

40:21.840 --> 40:27.920
work that way. You know, in relationships, betrayal can do that, right? Sort of cheating

40:27.920 --> 40:38.480
and fidelity, like one event can almost erase the entirety of your understanding of the past. And

40:38.480 --> 40:44.160
all the memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of, okay, what I believed was true is

40:44.160 --> 40:49.040
totally untrue. And sort of to overcome that and still appreciate the beautiful moments.

40:49.040 --> 41:02.320
I'm continually astounded by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate.

41:03.520 --> 41:10.240
I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended, the cheating was

41:10.240 --> 41:17.760
discovered and they're as angry as they were the day they found out. And, and I, I don't know what

41:17.760 --> 41:25.600
that's about because I also have clients that they like look back on it and they go, you know,

41:26.640 --> 41:31.360
we screwed up. Like we were, you know, we didn't do the best, but we did the best we could do at

41:31.360 --> 41:38.080
the time. And you know, we like, there should be stars for wars like ours, you know, there should

41:38.080 --> 41:43.680
be champagne for the survivors. Like we made it through, you know, like we survived it and we were

41:43.680 --> 41:48.240
fools and we were fools for love. And there are worse things in the world to be fools for.

41:48.240 --> 41:54.560
But I also do think that most relationships where there was infidelity and it's not a,

41:55.120 --> 42:00.480
it's not a popular thing to say and I'll get, I'll get pilloried for it, but, you know,

42:01.440 --> 42:07.440
I just don't know and I don't want to blame the victim of infidelity,

42:08.480 --> 42:15.360
but was the relationship really where it needed to be? Like had, were you truly the most just

42:15.360 --> 42:21.680
dutiful spouse who was seeing this person's needs be met? Again, we've established in the granola

42:21.680 --> 42:26.480
story that people can sometimes with good intentions not be meeting their partner's needs

42:26.480 --> 42:30.320
or perceiving their partner's needs or their partner isn't communicating them the right way

42:30.320 --> 42:39.280
or all of the above, but I've rarely seen very happy content couples that cheat on each other.

42:40.320 --> 42:45.520
And so I understand there's a shame in saying this person cheated on me or I cheated on this

42:45.520 --> 42:51.120
person because I represent, you know, I represent, I represent the cheater and I represent the cheated.

42:51.120 --> 42:55.200
I represent the victim of domestic violence. I represent perpetrator of domestic violence.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.400
I represent the person with the substance use disorder, the person married to the person.

42:58.400 --> 43:03.440
So I don't get to choose the white or the black hat. Like I have my client and that's my client.

43:04.480 --> 43:12.800
And it's forces me to put myself into their story from their point of view. And I think that kind of

43:12.800 --> 43:19.520
radical empathy that you need to engage in on a daily basis to represent people in those kinds

43:19.520 --> 43:26.480
of proceedings, it just, I don't know, it's, it just doesn't seem like there's good guys and bad

43:26.480 --> 43:33.200
guys. You know, it just seems like it's complicated and people's intentions and where they actually

43:33.200 --> 43:39.920
end up are different. Yeah, I think there's some sense in still remembering the betrayal as

43:41.120 --> 43:46.080
it being a symptom of taking life a little too seriously, too seriously where you don't,

43:47.360 --> 43:51.440
life shouldn't be taken that seriously. You should be able to laugh at it all. I like the story you

43:51.440 --> 43:58.320
say, you know, be able to appreciate the battle that should give stars for those kind of wars

43:58.320 --> 44:02.560
that we fought and just kind of be able to laugh at it all. Especially with love. Like,

44:02.560 --> 44:09.280
that's just so absurd. Yeah. Like it's so crazy. It's so crazy. I mean, like I, you know, I think

44:09.280 --> 44:16.000
it's funny. I think this is real candor, but you know, as a man, like there's nothing funnier than

44:16.000 --> 44:21.120
when you finish masturbating, you know, there's no more humbling moment. And I like to think

44:21.120 --> 44:25.760
about the fact that like the richest, famous, most powerful person in the world, they jerk off,

44:26.560 --> 44:30.320
you know, the most powerful man in the world jerks off. I'm sure, you know, all of them do.

44:30.320 --> 44:35.120
I mean, you probably know them, so you could ask, but in that moment where you just, you come and

44:35.120 --> 44:41.040
you go, what am I doing? Like, what the, now I got to wipe that like, oh, good Lord. And there's this

44:41.040 --> 44:45.920
feeling of, but a second ago, this seemed like a great idea. And it was, by the way, it was a great

44:45.920 --> 44:53.600
idea. But, but there's this moment, this satori, you know, where you just go, oh, like what, this

44:53.600 --> 45:00.720
is so silly. Well, like that's love. That's sex. Like it's great. Like when you read other people's

45:00.720 --> 45:07.040
infidelity, the text messages, the emails, cause I have to do that all the time. And I'll tell you

45:07.040 --> 45:11.520
how we make the sausage in a divorce lawyer's office. This is some of the most entertaining

45:11.520 --> 45:16.160
moments is dramatic readings aloud of people's infidelity exchanges with their lovers.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.120
The sex.

45:17.120 --> 45:23.200
Yeah, the sex and the like, you know, like it's just so ridiculous. Cause people have to go

45:23.200 --> 45:28.640
through like all kinds of gymnastics to be able to meet and have sex in weird places. And, you know,

45:29.680 --> 45:34.320
and you're reading this and you're reading these texts and you kind of go like, oh my God.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.240
And by the way, like I've represented some very powerful people

45:39.920 --> 45:44.800
and you read their texts with their lover or even their spouse, like even their spouse,

45:44.800 --> 45:50.160
you know, and they're just pathetic. I mean, they're just like, so not powerful. They're

45:50.160 --> 45:56.320
so like, Hey, babe, you know, I have a, I have a will remain totally nameless. I have a very

45:57.200 --> 46:03.040
powerful, wealthy, famous former client where there's a whole series of texts about is my

46:03.040 --> 46:08.640
dick weird, which by the way, I think the answer is, if you have to ask, if you have a weird dick,

46:08.640 --> 46:12.320
the answer is probably yes. Cause I've, I've owned one and I've never thought it's this weird,

46:13.760 --> 46:19.680
but, but I, the fact that you're having this discussion, like it's absurd. It's hilarious.

46:19.680 --> 46:24.160
Like love is hilarious. It's bizarre. It's such a weird vulnerability. It's such a,

46:24.160 --> 46:29.920
a basic visceral human need, you know, it, it, it really is something that we just,

46:30.880 --> 46:35.920
you know, it's mysterious. It, it, it, but it, but it doesn't have to be that complicated.

46:35.920 --> 46:41.120
I don't think that even betrayal, like I said, it doesn't have to be that complicated. I think

46:41.120 --> 46:46.400
we can frame it differently. Yeah. You can laugh at the whole thing. I mean, I, I think what we

46:46.400 --> 46:53.040
don't often do with ourselves is, uh, look back at texts or look back at emails or look back at

46:53.040 --> 46:58.960
Google search. I did that recently, just looking at what I searched for like 10 years ago, 15,

46:59.040 --> 47:05.840
and it's like, forget last week, just look at your Google searches last week. And you're like,

47:05.840 --> 47:13.200
wait a minute, what, why did you just search for this? Right. Right. 50 times. Right. Like,

47:13.200 --> 47:17.680
why did, why did the karate kid three pop? Yeah, exactly. What, why? And like you're like,

47:17.680 --> 47:22.080
where's Ralph Macchio now? And where did he, who is he dating? Uh, wise and then mother,

47:22.080 --> 47:26.640
and then, and then you're like a restaurant nearby. Like, how did I go from this to that?

47:26.640 --> 47:31.280
But, but it, it made sense at the time. So, so when you ask someone,

47:32.560 --> 47:39.600
how did our relationship fall apart? It's like looking at the Google search history of yourself

47:39.600 --> 47:43.440
from 10 years. You don't even know why you were thinking about those things.

47:44.080 --> 47:49.040
And now you want to understand why you did what you did, felt what you felt. She felt what she

47:49.040 --> 47:54.080
felt. She did what she did. And why the two of you, how you impacted each other and interacted

47:54.080 --> 48:01.120
with each other. Really? You think that's doable? But you've, so you've in the courtroom,

48:01.120 --> 48:07.600
does that come up like text messages with that resulted in, uh, with whoever you're cheating

48:07.600 --> 48:11.440
with? So you have to, I mean, you know, cheating doesn't come up as much because most states are

48:11.440 --> 48:15.920
no fault states now. So why someone's getting divorced, whether it's infidelity or, you know,

48:15.920 --> 48:19.920
it doesn't matter. There's no good spouse bonus or bad spouse penalty. Oh, there isn't. I mean,

48:20.880 --> 48:25.920
like that's. Well, you can have, we've had times where we have to prove infidelity because we want

48:25.920 --> 48:30.480
to prove what's called wasteful dissipation of marital assets, which means that you were spending

48:30.480 --> 48:36.240
money that was marital money on a paramour. That's what the legal name for an ex, you know,

48:36.240 --> 48:41.520
for a boyfriend or girlfriend in the marriage. And usually the person calls it, you know, that

48:41.520 --> 48:47.680
whore or that piece of shit, but we call the paramour paramour. And the, the, the, you know,

48:47.760 --> 48:52.720
sometimes we have to prove inclination and opportunity. We have to prove that this person

48:52.720 --> 48:56.720
had the inclination to cheat and that they had the opportunity to cheat. And then we want to show

48:56.720 --> 49:00.400
that, okay, so when they went away, that should be considered dissipation of marital assets.

49:00.400 --> 49:05.040
So if you go out to dinner with your brother, you didn't dissipate the marital estate. But if

49:05.040 --> 49:09.760
you bought your paramour, a Tiffany bracelet, that would be a dissipation of marital assets.

49:09.760 --> 49:13.600
And the person's entitled to a credit back for that from what was taken out of the marital estate.

49:13.600 --> 49:19.600
So we do sometimes have to authenticate text messages on the witness stand or in depositions,

49:19.600 --> 49:24.240
you know. And what's interesting about that is the way people approach it. Like people sometimes try

49:24.240 --> 49:31.200
to pretend, oh no, this is just my good friend, you know, and which is just like you kill your

49:31.200 --> 49:36.240
credibility. You know, if you, oh no, she's just my very good friend. She's not, she's not. That

49:36.240 --> 49:42.000
that makes no sense whatsoever. Or no, we were just friends at that point. And then several months

49:42.000 --> 49:46.640
later is when we, once this marriage was over, that's when we got together as partners. That's

49:46.640 --> 49:52.800
ridiculous. But sometimes people just own it. Just own it. Like I did a deposition of an executive

49:52.800 --> 49:57.280
once and, you know, opposing counsel, I thought they were going to really hit them. They were

49:57.280 --> 50:01.440
like, and looking at this credit card receipt, what was this charge for, for this hotel? He was

50:01.440 --> 50:06.480
like, oh, that was for a hotel room that I got with my girlfriend. And you were married. Yes.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.920
Yes. What did you, where did you stay at the hotel? It was, we didn't even stay. We actually

50:09.920 --> 50:15.200
just did like an afternoon delight rolled around in bed for the day. Yeah. And it was like, well,

50:15.200 --> 50:19.840
now, you know, took all the thunder out of that. What's the downside of doing that? It seems like

50:19.840 --> 50:23.120
there wasn't. It actually, I think helped his credibility. It was my client. So I thought it

50:23.120 --> 50:27.600
was the right move. We hadn't really discussed it in advance, but he, he, he was naturally

50:27.600 --> 50:32.720
intelligent enough to go, yeah, my credibility, like, I'm not going to lie under oath. I'll admit

50:32.720 --> 50:37.760
what it was, but I'll do it in such an, you know, we did it like at the end, like Eminem at the end

50:37.760 --> 50:42.960
of eight mile. Like it was very like, yeah, I cheated on her with this person. Now tell these

50:42.960 --> 50:47.360
people something they don't know about me, you know? And, and, and that's kind of how I try to,

50:48.960 --> 50:54.800
as a trial lawyer, we actually in my firm refer to it as the eight mile strategy, which is like,

50:54.800 --> 51:01.520
we will, if I know there was a text message sent, you know, you piece of shit, I hope you die.

51:02.080 --> 51:09.520
My client sent that text message to his co-parent. I, I, on my examination of my client,

51:10.240 --> 51:14.640
I will say, I'd like to have this marked for identification shown to the witness. What is that?

51:14.640 --> 51:23.200
It's a text message. Who's it to? A plaintiff. You sent it? Yeah. Read it out loud for the court.

51:23.440 --> 51:32.720
Mm-hmm. Do I have to? I think you should. You're a piece of S. Does it say S? No.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.560
What does it say? Well, it's a profanity. Say it, say,

51:38.080 --> 51:45.520
you piece of shit, I hope that you die. Yeah. You sent that to her. Yes. Why? I was really mad.

51:45.520 --> 51:49.760
Do you think that was good? No. Do you think it was helpful for your co-parenting relationship

51:49.760 --> 51:57.520
with her? No. Why did you send it then? You know, she sent me like 50 texts exactly like that and I

51:57.520 --> 52:03.200
never responded and I pushed it down every time. And then finally I just blew up at her. If you

52:03.200 --> 52:07.360
had it to do over again, would you do it differently? You know, I wish I could say I would, but the

52:07.360 --> 52:14.560
truth is I'm human and I was at my limits. And I'm watching opposing counsel cross out entire

52:14.560 --> 52:18.960
sheets of their cross-examination because it's gone now. They thought that they had their like

52:18.960 --> 52:24.880
Perry Mason moment. They had their like, did you order the code red moment and it's gone now.

52:24.880 --> 52:30.480
Because if you just own and accept your fault or your issues in the relationship,

52:31.680 --> 52:36.560
you can take a lot of the power out of that. And I wish we wouldn't take texts seriously.

52:37.360 --> 52:41.680
I don't think we should have substantive discussions via text. I think text was designed

52:41.680 --> 52:49.600
for are you here? Yes. 15 minutes away. Or I got here safely. Love you. Like that substantive

52:49.600 --> 52:54.320
discussions. People love having arguments via text. And I have to say, when you read other

52:54.320 --> 53:01.920
people's text messages, as I am often forced to do, it is amazing because just like that Google

53:01.920 --> 53:08.080
history you were talking about, I don't know how the hell you got from one thing to another. Like

53:08.080 --> 53:14.480
I was just reading on actually on the way here in the car. I was reading through a text exchange

53:14.480 --> 53:19.520
between two co-parents in the middle of a custody thing that I'm involved in. And

53:21.440 --> 53:25.600
it's like you piece of shit. You never cared about anything. And I'm going to take you have

53:25.600 --> 53:31.040
no right to take the kids from you. And then the next day, nothing in between. The next day,

53:32.400 --> 53:37.120
Maddie got a, you know, a good grade on her science thing. Oh, that's great. She's doing

53:37.120 --> 53:41.440
so well. It makes me so happy. Yeah. Her teacher said she's doing really well. Yeah. That's really

53:41.440 --> 53:48.000
great to see. I'll be there about 15 minutes late. No problem. See you then. Wait, like it was a day

53:48.000 --> 53:53.600
ago. Was there some, I want to know, was there a phone conversation in between where one of you

53:53.600 --> 53:57.760
went, Hey man, listen, I'm really sorry about that. Oh no, look, we were both pissed, whatever. Or is

53:57.760 --> 54:00.880
it just like you did that? And then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen. And now we're just

54:00.880 --> 54:05.040
going to talk about what Maddie got on her test. Yeah. Well, sometimes a good nap or a good night

54:05.040 --> 54:10.320
of sleep can solve a lot of emotional issues. I totally get it. But is there some, if you're

54:10.320 --> 54:17.120
looking just at the texts, like it begs the question, wouldn't you take the nap and then go,

54:17.120 --> 54:20.560
Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap. It turns out I was really tired. Like is that not

54:20.560 --> 54:25.840
happened by text? Oh, no, that's, uh, because sometimes it's hard to probably apologize for

54:25.840 --> 54:31.680
being an asshole, right? So I think we use just texts. We humans use all kinds of forms of

54:31.680 --> 54:38.560
communication to kind of vent. I think it's the wrong thing to do, but people do do that.

54:38.560 --> 54:43.200
Text has a permanence though. It's writing. I mean, it's writing. You think like a lawyer,

54:43.200 --> 54:48.560
I like it. You think like a lawyer, but lawyers think, lawyers think like detail, you know? And,

54:48.560 --> 54:54.800
and why would you write that down? Like, you know, writing it down, like, would you write it down

54:54.800 --> 54:59.200
and would you put it on a billboard in Times Square? Cause like that's, everything you say

54:59.200 --> 55:04.480
on Facebook or Instagram can and will be used against you in a court of law. Like every photo

55:05.040 --> 55:10.960
you post. I mean, that's going on with, uh, what's his name? Jake Paul or whatever. Paul

55:10.960 --> 55:15.280
and Dylan Dennis right now that that guy's girlfriend, every picture has ever been put

55:15.280 --> 55:20.960
on the internet of her by her is being weaponized right now. To reference an earlier part of our

55:20.960 --> 55:27.760
discussion. That's love. You take a big risks, big risk, putting it out there, um, putting out there

55:27.760 --> 55:35.200
on texts, putting out there on social media. But is the reward of doing it via text worthwhile?

55:35.200 --> 55:43.120
I'm, listen, the reward of love, I think is worth the risks of love, but the benefit of communicating

55:43.120 --> 55:51.760
by text, does it merit that, that risk of that being in writing that the person can reflect on

55:51.760 --> 55:57.440
and review and scroll back and get heated up again about? I don't know. We just take risks

55:57.440 --> 56:05.360
and we're vulnerable with each other. There may be something about text that for whatever reasons

56:05.360 --> 56:13.920
inspires a kind of candor, because I think it is a new way to communicate, right? In the scheme of

56:13.920 --> 56:19.760
things. And so sometimes, you know, we don't know the thing until it's really come into existence.

56:19.760 --> 56:26.720
So I don't know. I think it started as something that we just communicated in a very extemporaneous

56:26.720 --> 56:31.440
unplanned way. Like texts were meant to be, I'm here, I'm outside, whatever it might be.

56:33.280 --> 56:40.720
And so what happens when you start to talk about more emotional, deeper, bigger things or visceral

56:40.720 --> 56:47.360
things or more emphatic, passionate things using a technology that was originally just being used

56:47.360 --> 56:51.440
for that purpose? I don't, I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is yeah, as a lawyer,

56:51.920 --> 56:59.040
A, from an evidentiary perspective, and B, I just know what it looks like on the outside.

56:59.760 --> 57:07.440
Like I, I know when I read it, what it looks like. And that's, that's not always accurate. Like to

57:07.440 --> 57:11.920
just see the, it's like when you watch, you know, a video of someone at just their worst moment,

57:11.920 --> 57:16.880
you know, and the person tries to say, but wait, that's not me. Like that was just me in that

57:17.840 --> 57:25.120
moment. That was me at this incredible low point. And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize

57:25.120 --> 57:30.160
that and to try to say, okay, this, this low point is indicative of who they actually are.

57:30.160 --> 57:34.240
Yeah. And when I'm defending someone, I'm supposed to say, you know, well, this is their low point

57:34.240 --> 57:38.320
and we've all been to a low point and this is just a moment in this person and to judge them by that

57:38.320 --> 57:43.120
moment. Would you want to be judged by your worst moment? So I have to be able to look at that both

57:43.120 --> 57:47.520
directions. Yeah. I mean, I don't think anyone looks great on text. I mean, there's so much

57:47.520 --> 57:53.040
of our communication that, that is missing your, you know, your, your expression, like my sense of

57:53.040 --> 57:59.600
humor does not do well via text. Like I, I, cause I have like sometimes a sarcastic sense of humor

57:59.600 --> 58:05.360
or I have a dry sense of humor and it does not always translate well to text. The nuance of

58:05.360 --> 58:12.480
things is lost sometimes, you know? Yeah. But that's what makes the risk of it hilarious. I mean,

58:12.480 --> 58:18.160
the emojis, the memes, all that, um, taking a risk, the dry, the, there's a risk with the text. If

58:18.160 --> 58:26.720
you do some like dark, dry statement, right? That's a joke. And then the pause and then there's no

58:26.720 --> 58:30.880
response for a couple of hours. I mean, that's beautiful. I don't know. That's a, that's like a,

58:30.880 --> 58:36.480
it's this, you know, it's, it's the gap between the two trapezes, you know, like once you've hit

58:36.480 --> 58:42.320
send and you're like, well, let's see where this goes. Like there's a coming back now, you know,

58:42.320 --> 58:47.200
and you're waiting and waiting. It's like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush.

58:47.200 --> 58:50.560
I mean, that's a rush. That's a beautiful thing. Well, I have, uh, my friend Michael

58:50.560 --> 58:55.920
Malice living close by and if, if, uh, the courtroom were ever to see the text between us,

58:55.920 --> 59:03.440
I would, we would be both in jail for many, many years. Yeah. When this finally comes out,

59:03.440 --> 59:08.640
when I have my Johnny Depp Amber Heard moment, we'll get Michael Malice.

59:08.640 --> 59:12.320
Well, but that was one of, you know, the Johnny Depp Amber Heard thing was a great example of

59:13.120 --> 59:17.600
in a gunfight between those two, everyone was cheering for the bullets. I mean, no one was,

59:17.600 --> 59:22.960
I don't think anybody looked like a hero. They both looked like what they are, which is humans,

59:22.960 --> 59:29.280
really flawed humans who had, you know, it really is like that, that people magazine thing stars,

59:29.280 --> 59:33.600
they're just like us, you know, like we watched that and went like, oh yeah, they're just like us.

59:33.600 --> 59:39.280
Like they cannot keep it together. They cannot have like, they just have these ridiculous toxic

59:39.280 --> 59:44.320
moments where both of them look awful in that trial. What do you take away from that trial?

59:44.320 --> 59:48.640
Just, just given, given all the work you've done. I mean, for me, I don't know if you can speak to

59:48.640 --> 59:58.720
that is probably the first time I've seen that kind of a complicated relationship, even just to

59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.320
say a relationship laid out in this raw form, like the fights of a relationship.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.920
My feeling about that trial is there is no amount of money that would be worth laying

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.520
that kind of stuff bare publicly. For you, if you were Johnny Depp,

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.640
yeah, there's no amount of money because they both look awful. They both look awful. And I don't

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:26.880
think, I don't think I'm qualified to say if one or both of them are awful, but they both had

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:34.240
moments in that courtroom where their behavior and words looked awful. And, and I just don't

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.160
know that, that exposing that to the world, like the, I just don't know. I mean, I understand the

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.520
point of view that, that by bringing that suit, Johnny Depp was saying, look, I, yeah, I have to

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.520
show these awful things to the world about myself, but it's, it's not as bad as what she's claimed

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.160
I've done. So I get it. I'm not saying that's incorrect. And for Amber Heard, I think her

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.520
response is, well, for him to say, I'm lying, you know, I have to prove my, but my God, like,

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.640
what an awful thing to watch. I, it was, all it really is, is just another, it's just another

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.320
couple. Like, well, there's so, you know how banal that is, you know, many of those-

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.160
This kind of stuff happens a lot.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.960
A lot? It's the norm. It's not, it's not the exception. They just happen to have like a grand

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.040
scale because they have, you know, lots of people around them and lots of money. But yeah, it's all

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:31.040
this, that kind of dysfunction, that kind of chaos, that kind of he said, she said to people

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.360
with completely differing histories of what happened in the marriage, false allegations of

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.080
domestic violence or true allegations of domestic violence that are completely denied by the person.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.000
And you have witnesses that'll say, oh my God, they never engaged in any kind of, because again,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.040
no one engages in domestic violence with company over, you know, you don't like invite friends.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.360
Like people always say, oh no, I saw them. They seem so happy. Like people always do this to me

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.880
as a divorce lawyer. They come in and they go, well, here's photos of the kids, you know,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.680
smiling with me. So that's proof that like I'm a good dad. I'm like, there's photos of Jeffrey

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:08.560
Dahmer smiling with people he ate later. And you're, you think these photos prove something? Like I

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.240
don't, the lack of, I'm in the middle of a very complex domestic violence trial and the entire

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.120
defense on the other side is, well, we have photos of them on vacation where they look very happy

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.800
and she never called the cops. That's no defense at all. Like most victims of intimate partner

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.600
abuse don't call the cops. They don't identify, self-identify as victims of domestic violence.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.720
And they probably have many stretches of time of intense happiness or happiness.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.200
Of course. And by the way, perpetrators of domestic violence are charismatic.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.160
How else would they get victims? You know, it's not like if they were ogrish,

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.520
no one would sign on for that relationship. It's that when they're good, they're so good

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.840
that when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him. The really good person is him

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.680
or her. You know, we saw that in the public testimony of that, you know, depth hurt thing is

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.720
they, there were moments where you look at her and go, oh my God, like I want one just like that.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.040
And there are moments where you listen to the testimony and go, oh my God, she's awful. Like

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:19.120
what? That's just evil. And the same for him. So I really, this should teach us something about

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.920
how not only are there two sides to every story, like that there's just so much complexity and

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.200
nuance. But I think everyone was asking the question, whether you were team depth, team

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.720
herd or team, I could care less about either of these people. Everybody's looking at it going,

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.320
why? Like why 8 billion people in the world? Why did you stay together? Just break up. You're

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:48.560
miserable. It's obvious. It's obvious you're not. This can't be worth it. I've actually become

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.040
friendly with Camille Vasquez, who's the lawyer on the depth side. She's an incredible woman.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.760
Great lawyer. And just a great human being. Just how passionate she's about her work. I mean,

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.080
you radiate this kind of same passion. Like she's just truly happy doing what she does.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:13.520
But also where the stress of a case is like, it becomes her. She can't sleep, all this kind

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:20.480
of stuff, which is fascinating. I think that's a function of our professions. Even after 20 plus

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:26.080
years of doing this, like the night before a trial, I can hardly sleep. Excitement, fear?

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:34.480
Yes. All of that. All of that. And I even have moments as I pull up to the courthouse and I

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.400
listen, I wear certain cufflinks that are like my lucky cufflinks or something. And I pull up to the

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.040
courthouse, I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach. And then it

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.640
starts. And the moment it starts, something in me goes, oh yeah, I know how to do this. And it's

01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:01.520
instantly. I own it. I love it. And yeah, it's the people that love this job. Being a trial

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:09.280
lawyer, being particularly a divorce trial lawyer, family law trial lawyer, I love it. I love it more

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.280
than I loved it when I started doing it. I can't imagine spending five days a week looking forward

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.080
to two. I love what I do. I don't know that I'll ever love anyone or anything more than I love

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:30.960
the work. So I saw you on the talk with Steve Harvey a bunch of times and I always loved it.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:38.560
One thing just sticks in my head from something he said as a device that if you and your partner,

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.440
your spouse, if there's a fight, there's a difficult thing you have to deal with,

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.280
keep that to yourself. Don't talk to anyone else. That's a little, what does he say,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.480
two-armed circle or something, whatever the expression is, but basically resolve it all

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.240
internally. Don't like when you face the world, you have a front of like.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:07.040
Don't take sides against the family. Yeah. Yes. Like it all boils down to Godfather.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.400
Everything boils down to Godfather references. It really does. And true romance. You don't take

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:17.440
sides against the family. You don't show that weakness to the world. I mean, again, I don't

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.680
know that Steve in candor would say you shouldn't discuss it with your own therapist,

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.520
but I think what he's saying is don't project it out to the world. Don't share that because I think

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.800
it can change the way people view your relationship, which then will change the

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:42.800
way you view your relationship. And so I think don't run reckless when it comes to

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.080
that primary relationship. Don't run your mouth recklessly.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:55.120
Yeah. It's one of the things I mentioned to you offline that my now close friend, Joe Rogan,

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.240
I've never heard him ever speak negatively of his wife. It's always like super positive,

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.800
how awesome a person she is. And that to me has always been an inspiration to do the same

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.240
for everybody in my life, to always speak positively about them.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.520
So that has probably a virtuous spiral effect.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:21.360
I'm sure. That's probably because he has a great wife and he has a great wife in part because of

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:28.640
that. I think it's clear that he's in her corner and cheering for her. It's clear she's cheering

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.720
for him. It's not like Joe Rogan's not a man who has opportunity. I mean, he's surrounded by UFC

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.560
ring girls for God sakes. This is a guy who has all the opportunity in the world and he seems to

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.960
be quite a fan of his wife. And that's a superpower. That's a real thing. Now the question is,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.240
he doesn't seem to talk about it like, oh, I got to really work at that. And that's not a man who's

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.840
afraid to talk about what he works at. He's pretty honest about, man, yeah, I got to work really hard

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.360
to stay in show. We got to work really hard to be able to do this. Yeah, I'm not good at memorizing

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.560
that. It takes time. But I've never heard him say like, oh, marriage is a lot of work. And I think

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:14.160
that's to his credit because it seems like they're enjoying that. And it's also not incredibly public.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.960
It's not something most people couldn't pick her out of a lineup. He kept it private for many years

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.040
and just because it's a private joy, it's a private, deep, meaningful, intimate partnership,

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.200
that's interesting. That's also an inspiration. Not everything about your life has to be this

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.200
like, look at me, I'm happy. I'm in a happy relationship. Everything is wonderful.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:46.400
Especially that. I think there is something about the womb-like, cocoon-like joy of love

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.400
when you're just talked in, snuggled in, just pressed against each other with that.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:00.720
That's such a, it's just the two of you. And that's lovely. And that's such a good thing.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:08.960
We were just dying for connection. And that connection is so big. It's so everything.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.680
One of my earliest psychedelic experiences, probably when I was a teenager,

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.480
but a theme that's been persistent in every psychedelic experience I've ever had

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:28.480
is this idea of like, everything is connection. Everything is being pressed to someone and with

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.360
them. The warmth of human connection. One of the reasons I enjoy listening to your work and your

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:43.040
perspective has always been that I think at the core you see connection and love. And I think for

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:54.560
me, from my earliest experiences with psychedelics at 16, 17, I was very attuned to that.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:01.200
I was very much, that was put on my radar by psychedelics and just stayed part of my

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.760
consciousness forever. And I think I had a 30 something year break from psychedelics,

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.000
but it was like, when I came back to it, I went, oh yeah, it's still there. That's still the core

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.280
of everything is connection. I mean, it's fascinating how deeply you value connection,

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:22.720
how empathic you are that you would be doing what you're doing, which is, or is it not?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:32.080
I think it's actually why I'm well suited for what I do. I think what I do is I have to learn the

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.600
story of my client and know it and feel it very deeply. And I have to feel it in a very human

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.400
way that's very compassionate to this person. And then I have to feel it and understand it in a way

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:54.960
that's incredibly antagonistic to it so I can shore up defenses. So I have to feel this person's

01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:01.120
story and feelings from every possible angle, because every one of them is a vulnerability

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.800
and every one of them is a potential strength and a potential defense. And so I actually think it's

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:15.280
my number one, other than extemporaneous speaking ability, it is my number one job tool. It's the

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:22.960
ability to radically empathize and to put myself in the emotional state of someone in its best

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.880
possible light and its worst possible light so that I can see, again, the defense and I can see

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:36.480
the vulnerability. So that's beautifully put, but also just to bear witness to this

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.680
connection broken in those dramatic way over and over and over and over.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:47.760
That part is hard, but I was a hospice volunteer for many, many years when I first got out of

01:11:47.760 --> 01:12:01.200
college. And it really showed me a lot about what is sadness, what is tragic, and what is just

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:10.400
inevitable decay? What is pain and decay? We all die. We play a game you can't win to the utmost.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.480
And so if we know the answer to all of this is you're going to die,

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.760
then what do we do with the rest of that time? If all your stuff is just stuff, it's just going to

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.160
go to the... The money's going to go, your looks is going to go, your everything's going to go,

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.120
love's going to end one way or the other, then what are we doing? And again, I think it's love

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:36.880
and connection, but what I'm doing for a living is helping... I don't look at it as what I'm doing

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.320
is helping people beat the crap out of each other. I look at it as I'm trying to help a client

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:50.080
build their post-divorce life, to sort of rise from the ashes of that which has fallen apart

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.360
and move on to the next chapter and refocus and have the things they need financially, emotionally,

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.600
whatever it might be, interpersonally in terms of with their kids. And so for me, it's actually a

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.840
job that is very consistent with my desire to build connection and to be empathetic.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.240
And witnessing the ashes doesn't make you cynical about the whole thing of love.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:17.680
No, because again, 56% of marriages end in divorce, but 84% are remarried within five years.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.360
Like we keep doing it over and over again.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.160
And that's a good thing.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.760
I think it is a good thing.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.800
The mess of it, the absurdity of it, the hypocrisy of it, that's something beautiful about that.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.920
Well, it's just the return is so great on the investment. Listen, man, I've had more than one

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:44.160
dog. When my dog died, the first dog I had died, I remember when I'm never going to love again.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.120
I'm done. I'm done with this. I will never expose myself to this kind of pain again.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.160
I'll never have to take the dog bed and put it in the closet.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.760
And then some friend called me and said, we have an adoption event. Can you just watch this dog

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.320
for 24 hours and then we'll take him. We just need to, and I went, yeah, all right. I'll watch

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.440
a dog for the night. And this dog come in and say, oh, he has mange. He's not going, fuck,

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.480
I got another dog. He walked in. My heart went, yeah, I got a dog. And now that dog

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:25.200
is 13 years old and his eyes are cloudy and he doesn't go up the stairs real well.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.960
And he's going to break my heart. And I wouldn't change that for the world.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.440
I'm still there. I'm still struggling for the second one. I've lost a dog and broke my heart.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:50.240
Yeah. And you'll never lose that pain. But I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.560
for the kind of love you felt with that dog. And you'll never feel a love that replaces the whole.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.760
There will never be another buster for me. But there was Kaba.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.720
And when he's gone, there will never be another one of him. But you know what? When that stupid

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:21.840
puppy that was five months old stumbled in, I went, I guess I'm going to do this again.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.920
And you know what? I'm so glad. I'm so glad. And I know, by the way, I know now because,

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.840
and that's where I've said, it's that Joseph Brodsky poem, a song. I wish I knew no astronomy

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:39.040
when stars appear. I wish I didn't know the pain. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.800
And I believe we don't care. Again, I think there's something to that. If something hurts so badly

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.320
and you go, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to do it again, then it must be of value. It must

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.760
be of real value. There's also a different perspective on it, that pain. So there's that

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.040
from Louie, the show of this interaction with an old man with Lucy Kay. And he says that,

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.800
because Louie is mourning the loss of, got split up, he got dumped or whatever. And

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:15.600
he's mourning the loss of that partner of love. And the old man says that that is the best part.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:25.200
Like missing the love is still love. The real bad part is when you forget it, when the pain fades,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.840
it's all gone. But the pain is actually a kind of celebration of the love you had.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.920
Well, the opposite of love isn't hate. The opposite of love is indifference.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:40.240
There's no question about that. I mean, hate is a passionate emotion. Love is a passionate emotion.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.840
But and there is a school of thought that says that only unfulfilled love can be truly romantic.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:56.560
But I believe that it's what I think I learned from hospice is that I think, for me, knowing

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.000
the impermanence is the thing, you know, it's the key.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.120
Yeah, it's finite and eventually it's going to be over. And so like that intensifies the feeling

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.960
that that's when you can have pure love without the drama.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.560
Dogs are, for me, a great example. And again, I don't know what it all means, right,

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:24.000
existentially. But I just feel like they have that that kind of love has to be here to teach us

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.240
something. And I feel like the fact that they're so amazing and just so loving and so wonderful,

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.360
and the bond we feel is so amazing and deep and doesn't require a lot of maintenance.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.880
And yet it's so finite, like it's just this short little lifespan. And I feel like that

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:49.440
there's just such a lesson there, you know, there's so much there to unpack about the nature

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:57.840
of connection and loss. And, you know, that that that your heart has this infinite capacity,

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:03.120
like when you're I'm telling you, when when my dog died, when Buster died, I remember I

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:09.520
thinking with certainty, I will never do this again, because I'll never love that way again,

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.440
I'll never love a dog the way I love this dog. And it's just not true. That's just not true.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:22.480
Like you, you have this infinite capacity. And, and it's that makes it scary, actually,

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.640
because, like right now, there's so many people you could love, there's so many dogs you could

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.960
love, like there's so much out there. And it requires a certain bravery and tremendous

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:41.920
amount of risk to do it, you know. And a commitment, because I think to really

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.760
experience love is you just dive in. Because there is a huge number of people, but to really like,

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:57.840
I mean, you have to like, really dive into the full complexity, the full range of another human

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.800
being. Yeah, which is hard. Because we don't even I don't know that we even feel comfortable

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.440
diving into the full range of ourselves. You know, there's pieces of ourselves we try to push away

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:14.800
or not think about. Okay, so speaking of the whole sociopath slash empath that is all embodied in

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.360
one human being that is you, let's go back to some cases, perhaps that you've worked on just

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.760
something that stands out to you. What's maybe the craziest, most complicated thing you've worked

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.360
on? Is there something that pops to mind? Craziest would be different than most complicated.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:38.480
Let's go craziest. Yeah. So craziest? Ah, gosh, that's a great question. So from a

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.120
chaos standpoint, I mean, I see so many bizarre fact patterns and so many variations of people

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:50.000
cheating with people, people sleeping with the nanny, people sleeping with someone's relative of

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.880
their spouse, people having same sex or polyamorous relationships, and the other person

01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:00.880
doesn't even know they're not monogamous. So much craziness that you could fill 15 books.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:08.080
In terms of complexity, you know, I mean, emotionally complex as any custody case is

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:14.400
emotionally complex, because you're dealing with parenting issues. And what makes a good parent,

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:20.800
I think, is a very tricky question because, you know, I'm trying to convince a judge who's a

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:30.400
better parent. And that is so loaded with subjective, you know, value judgments.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:37.360
Is there, just to linger on the maternal presumption, is that a thing you come face to

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.320
face with often? Well, there was, I mean, it was real. It was the law. There was something in the

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.240
law called the maternal presumption. It was also known as the tender years doctrine,

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.280
which meant that a child under the age of seven was presumed to be in the custody of the mother,

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:57.200
unless you could show she was an unfit mother. So that's where the idea of, like, someone has

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:06.640
to be proven an unfit mother came from. Now, in the 80s, 1980s, that was changed. But, you know,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:14.800
under my skin is under my sovereignty. I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:21.760
a suggestion that a mother who births a child and feeds a child with her body

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:28.800
doesn't have a particular bond with a child that's different than a father's bond with a child.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:37.360
So where do we put that? How much importance do we put on it? Now that there's better and more

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.360
research in the mental health field about attachment theory and infants, there's also a lot of,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.720
you know, a lot of research on how is attachment formed? How should parenting schedules be put

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:57.760
together based on attachment theory? But, you know, there's conflicting perspectives on that.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.200
And so as judge to judge, you see, like, is there a lot of variation?

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.280
Yeah, there is because there's lots of kinds of judges. Like, there's judges that are thoughtful,

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.000
enlightened, interested in mental health research. And there's judges that just want,

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.120
were unsuccessful lawyers that were good politically and got elected. And they just want

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.120
to, you know, they just want a job where, like, they show up at nine o'clock, they have a lunch

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.440
break from 12 until two o'clock, and that they leave at 430. And they get a certain number of

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:30.480
weeks vacation and a pension after 20 years. So what is in general the process of these custody

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:37.120
battles? Like what, what are the, what's the landscape? Well, most, the overwhelming majority

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:46.640
of custody cases don't end up in my office. They, they, they, they are a negotiation between two

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.880
people that love their children more than they dislike their soon to be ex. So the overwhelming

01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:00.080
majority of cases are just two people going, okay, how are we going to make decisions together?

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.680
Because there are decisions that have to be made about kids. Will they go to public or private

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.320
school? Can they go on medication if they need it or not? Should we change pediatricians? You know,

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:12.720
all those kinds of things. How do we make decisions? And when will we each spend time with the kids?

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.400
And so most custody cases are just that. Most custody cases are just a discussion,

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.880
a negotiation between counsel about those issues. And they're not ugly and they're not

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.320
anything. They're just people, again, sometimes people have differing perspectives, you know,

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.600
but sometimes people haven't thought through their perspective. So as a divorce lawyer,

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:39.840
a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a person because they come in and say, well, I've been

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.560
the person who handles, you know, all of the homework and all of the everything. So he should

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.320
only see the kids on weekends. And there's a logic to that. Like I've always done the homework

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.640
with the kids, so I'm the parent who's in charge of the homework. And he's obviously not done that

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:00.720
before. But there's also a logic that you can then say, right, but then you're doing all the heavy

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.280
lifting of parenting and he's doing none of that. And you were a married couple and living together.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.800
So he was trusting you to do that because you're good at it and you seem to like it. So maybe now

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.640
we want him to have to do some of the heavy lifting of parenting because we don't want the

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:20.480
child when they're 13 to say, I love dad, we have nothing but a good time together. Whereas you make

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.960
me do my homework and eat my broccoli. Dad's the grass on the other side of the fence that's greener.

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.200
So sometimes it's about educating a client to like change their frame, you know, to look at this

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.320
differently. Yeah, okay, we always go to my mother's for Thanksgiving. So I need every Thanksgiving.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.160
Okay, well, you were married. So you went to now you're going to have new traditions. Things are

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.440
changing for your children. Things are changing for your family. You're both going to have new

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:49.040
traditions. So a lot of times it's just educating people on looking at things in a different way,

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.040
looking at their parenting in a different way. We're not going to live in the same house anymore,

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.720
but we're still going to parent these child, you know, this child or these children together.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.800
What's much more interesting, because like, you know, I don't get invited to a lot of parties,

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.280
but when I get invited to parties, if somebody says, what do you do for a living? And I say,

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.960
I'm a divorce lawyer. And they go, Oh, my God, you must have stories. That's the way everybody

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:16.400
is. Oh, my God, you must have so many stories. And if I said, yeah, there was this couple and they,

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.000
you know, slowly grew apart. And then they decided that it would be good for them to end their

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.960
relationship as a married couple, but they wanted to continue to have an amicable co-parenting

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.120
relationship. So they divided their assets and, and they figured out a good parenting access

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.080
schedule that made sure that they both had both leisure time and responsibilities with the children.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.560
People would be like, that's the worst fucking story. That's so boring. So what they really

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.520
want is the like, and then he was sleeping with the nanny and then she caught him. So, you know,

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.080
the truth is like people want to hear about those flame outs. And by the way, those are super

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.040
interesting as a lawyer. Like it's super interesting. It's usually going to be what

01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.160
infidelity. You do have a chapter called everybody fucks the nanny. Everybody's fucking the nanny.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.440
There's a nanny fascination out there. I try to explain it in the book, but yeah, I mean,

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.400
I've had some great nanny stories. I mean, people run off with the nanny. People end up getting

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.720
married to the nanny. I had one where the, the, he convinced her that they should have a threesome

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.640
with the nanny. They got the nanny drunk. They had a bunch of threesomes with the nanny. And then

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.800
the nanny and the wife paired up and left him. Oh, nice. And they're still quite happy. It seems

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.640
like a happy ending to the whole thing. For everyone but him, but it was his idea.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.560
Well, he's really going to have a nanny fascination now. Now he's, yeah. Well,

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.320
now he's got to see the nanny who's now the like step-parent to the kids. And it was his

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.920
bright idea of let's have a threesome with the nanny, you know? Yeah. I mean, the nanny thing,

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:55.520
I think is a function of in many circumstances is the characteristics of the wife that he remembers

01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:05.760
fondly and that have been extinguished by the presence of children. So I, my words of wisdom

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.760
is not don't get a nanny or make sure you get an ugly nanny. My, my, my thought on it is that a

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:18.640
woman should remember even when she's a mother, that she's also a woman who a man, you know,

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.400
they fell in love with each other and she should take time to be in touch with the part of herself

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.960
that is an independent woman that's interesting and interested. And you know, like there's a lot

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.640
to be learned from divorced couples because like divorced couples, if you do it right,

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.960
it's awesome. Like I, I, I had a wonderful experience parenting and being divorced

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.640
because I divorced when my kids were quite young. My co-parent, you know, my ex-wife is awesome.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:52.320
She's a great mom, nice person. We're good friends. And it was great. I had half the time I

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.720
had my kids and I could focus on them and the other half of the time they were with the other

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.520
person who loves them as much as I do. And I didn't have any of the responsibilities of kids

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.240
and I could just have, you know, all of the wonderful fun that you can have when you don't

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.920
have, you know, the, the responsibilities that come with full-time caring for children.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.320
So what would you say now on the flip positive side? We've been talking about

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:22.720
the collapse of things. What about success? What's the secret to a successful romantic

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.000
relationship? My mom used to say that it's hard to define intelligence,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.840
but you could spot stupid a mile away. Yeah. So I'm much better at, at pointing out where

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.760
people fall apart because I spend a lot of time with people who have fallen apart

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.800
in their relationship. So it's easy to then say, well, just don't do what they do.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:58.000
But I don't know that that's not an oversimplification. So again, I think the

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:09.520
answer is connection. I think the answer is affection, presence, you know, mindfulness

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:16.800
and presence. I do think in my personal and professional experience,

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:28.480
that most people want you fully more than they just want you in a disconnected way.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:35.040
So if you were to say to your romantic partner, you can have me for two hours

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:44.160
where I'm giving you my undivided attention and I'm really joyful to be with you. Or you can have

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.960
me for eight hours where I'm sort of half paying attention and I kind of want to be someplace else

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.000
for part of the time. There's just no choice there. It's so obvious. So I think presence is a big

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:07.280
piece. And I think that the you, the me and the we, I think is important because I think in

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:16.240
relationships there's you and there's me and we meet and something magical happens, you know,

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:24.240
and we become we. And now there's you and there's me and there's we. And then the we gets bigger

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.800
and bigger and bigger. And isn't it great? Because it's such a nice warm place. It gets so big.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:39.760
But it gets so big that you get small and me get small because we. And if any of us dares to ask,

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.120
well, what about you? What about me? No, no, no, the we. What, you don't like the we? You

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:49.120
don't want to be with the we? Well, no, it's not that. But the we only exists because there was

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.040
you and there was me and I really like you and you really liked me. And so we picked each other

01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:02.640
out of lots of choices. And now this we is so fucking big, like it threatens to just consume

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:10.320
all of it, you know? And I really think that there's something there we have to look at more

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:18.800
honestly. So we should not consume everything, but at the same time, not be small. Well, the we is

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:29.440
the you and the me. And if you mix it so much that you and me loses its components, that all that's

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:37.040
left is we. I don't think that that's the way to do it. I just think there's a, the world pulls us

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.560
in that direction. We get told culturally that, well, why aren't you going with this person to

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:49.760
that? Why would you do that by yourself? And why? Why? Like anyone knows that there's joy in being

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.240
away from each other and there's joy being reunited together. So why don't we speak very

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:02.160
honestly about that? And I think some of that's our own insecurity. Well, why don't you want to

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.400
be with me 24 hours a day? Aren't I wonderful? Aren't I delightful? It's like, well, wait, what?

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:15.200
Well, but also probably people are either afraid or lazy in developing their individual selves. I

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.720
mean, it's still, it's lonely going out there in the world by yourself and it's comforting in that

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.280
little cocoon of we. I mean, it can also be incredibly adventurous going out into the world

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:29.840
by yourself and then coming back to the we with a full report. Yeah. You know, coming back and

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.360
saying like, Oh my God, guess what I saw? Guess what I did? Oh my God, we have to go there together

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:37.120
now. Cause all I could think about was you. Yeah. You know, while I was there, I was like,

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.560
Oh my God, she would love this. You know, like that's magical. That's amazing. Like,

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.720
like I look what I brought you back. You know, I went into this and then I got you this

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:51.280
present from there. Like there's something, you know, and we know this, you know, I always

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.200
thought it was, you know, like when you watch the old Westerns, you know, or like the,

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:01.040
you know, the heroes leaving, you know, and he's walking away from the cabin cause he's going to

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:05.840
go fight the gunfight and she runs up and she goes, please don't go, don't go, stay here with me.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.320
And he like kisses her and then he goes, you know, if he goes like, yeah, you're right,

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.840
I'll just stay here. It's cool. You know, like this is, I didn't want to deal with that anyway.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:20.960
Like he's not the hero anymore. Yeah. Yeah. That's deep truth to that. Uh, and probably

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:27.680
like you mentioned sex, sex is probably a big part of it. Friendship. That seems to me like

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:33.280
a really important one. Depends on how you define friend. Like I, you know, if, if being a friend

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.760
means we have some connection to each other and we have each other's cell phone numbers. Okay.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.240
Then we're friends. But if it's a bigger definition than that, if it's like you've picked me up at the

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.520
airport, you know, or like, you know, you're someone I could call and it's like, dude, I gotta hide a

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:54.160
body. Like you get shovel and lime. I like how you escalated from airport pickup to murder.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.560
Yeah. I try to go in this direction. Well, I have to tell you, I define, you know, the Ben Affleck

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.280
movie, the town, you know, that scene, that's friendship to me. I mean, to me, the ideal male

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.320
friendship is the scene where he says, I need you to come with me. We're going to hurt some people

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.440
and you never have to ask me about it again. And he says, whose car are we taking? Yeah. And that's

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.560
sort of like, to me, that's friendship. So it's, it's a high bar, you know, to be like a friend.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.320
So when you say like friendship, I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.920
with your romantic partner. If you're getting married, it should be the like, whose car are

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:36.800
we taking? Like it should be that it's you and me. To be fair, that bar's reached with me with,

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.840
with a lot of people. Like if you called me tomorrow, there's a body, but you're a big open,

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:48.480
your big open heart, but it's true. Like, I wonder how many people out there are like that

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.760
in terms of hiding the body. I mean, my theory on this,

01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.560
because I think I'm like you in that way. I think, I think I, I'm very sensitive.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:10.320
I feel things really deeply, you know, and I think it's, it's, that's a terrif, the world is

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.880
terrifying when you feel things very deeply because there's so much pain. There's so much

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:21.840
betrayal. There's so many opportunities to be hurt, you know? And I think when you are that kind

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:28.080
of person, you go through like stages. And one of them is that I don't care. I don't feel anything.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.560
It doesn't matter. I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.600
Well, you try to convince yourself, I don't feel anything. It's fine. I don't feel anything.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.480
And then at some point, like, you know, you, you do feel all of it. And then it's like, oh my God,

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.600
the weight of this, this crowd. I mean, I think it's the whole arc of Pink Floyd, the wall.

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:47.520
It's literally the entire arc of Pink Floyd, the wall, you know, and, and the song stop,

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.840
you know, I want to go home, take off this uniform and leave the show. Like you just,

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.680
when you feel all of it, the army of hammers coming at you, the slings and arrows of outrageous

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.560
fortune, you know, a thousand natural shocks, the flesh is there too. When you feel all of that

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:11.120
deeply, you know, it's very hard, but, but it can also be a superpower because I think

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.560
when you can bring that to a relationship, when you can bring that to a profession,

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:22.720
like you've done and I've done, then you, there's something very magical about that. The ability to,

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.880
to, to bring it out in someone, to feel it in yourself, to understand it, you know, is,

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:35.600
is a gift. It's a wonderful, wonderful gift. I'm humbled by what it brought me professionally.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:42.080
And I'd like to think that you and I have both found professions that enable us to use that

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.240
sensitivity, that empathy in a, in a productive and good way and in a fulfilling, a personally

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.480
fulfilling way. And ideally in a way that does, does good for other people.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:00.400
You yourself are incredibly successful and high performer. You've dealt with a lot of CEOs and

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:07.440
just high performers in all walks of life. What can you say about successful relationships

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.760
with those kinds of folks?

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.040
That's a good question. I think,

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.720
is it all the same stuff or there's something special when they're busier?

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:24.320
Well, you know, I think when you represent high net worth individuals, but also high performing,

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.200
I would make a distinction between high net worth and high performing. So I,

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.960
I've done high net worth divorces where the person's like a trust fund kid,

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.440
even though they're an adult, you know, but they're like, they're what they did to achieve

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.160
their high net worth status is their great grandfather died. You know, so that is different

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:49.520
than someone who is self-made, who through discipline, focus, entrepreneurship, you know,

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:56.000
whatever it might be, that they have found success. And there's also difference between

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:04.400
financial success and fame because I've represented famous people that actually did not have that much

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:10.720
money in the scheme of things or much liquidity. And I've represented people that were not in any

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.280
way famous and were very high performing in their field. Like in New York, we have a lot of finance

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:24.960
people. So, and what I find is their divorces are challenging one on a technical level because

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.960
figuring out what they have and how to divide it is tricky.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:29.680
Sure. Yeah.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.440
Because when something's moving that quickly, like when your, when your portfolios movement,

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.560
you know, affects a market, you know, that's, that's challenging. You know, Jeff Bezos divorce

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:49.760
for a time when it was in its early stages could affect Amazon stock. It did, you know, so that's

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.040
a, that's a real thing. You know, there are, there are businesses that are affected by a divorce.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.040
But in terms of, of being in a relationship with someone who,

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.680
who is a high performing person, you know, most of the high performing people I know

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.960
are creatures of discipline and routine. You know, from, from Joe Rogan, you know, we've

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.880
talked about, you know, any of these people, like they have a routine, they have a discipline,

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.160
they have a focus, they have a way they like to do things. They have a type of coffee they like

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.800
to drink. They have a way that they like to do. And, and divorce is a tremendous disruption.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.920
I mean, divorce is fundamental things in your life are shifted out of your control.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.680
Like your spouse may be the one who has decided you are no longer going to live in that house.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.280
You will no longer see your children on these days. So to take that control away from someone

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:53.200
is very, very hard. I mean, when someone is a high performing, high net worth person,

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:59.200
they are used to being told yes, they are used to being able to buy their way out of a problem.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:06.400
But just like illness, you know, I, you can get, you can hire the best doctor,

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.000
but you can't cure cancer because you have a lot of money. Like you can hire the best lawyer,

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:19.440
but you can't cure a custody case, you know, and that's, I mean, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.000
seemingly endless custody disputes that have been going on for years now with the best lawyers in

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.600
California working on them is proof of the fact that you can't just buy a resolution to those

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:38.640
things, you know, that you have to go through it just like everyone else. So that lets me ask the

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:45.440
question of how much does a divorce usually cost? It's a great question. Average divorce.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.360
I mean, it's sort of like a, what I always tell clients in the first consultation

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.240
is I tell them that the most reasonable question a person could ask me sitting in that chair across

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.960
from me is two, how long is this going to take and how much is it going to cost? And those are two

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:06.800
questions I can't answer. And then the next thing they say is give me a range, which is a bit like

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:16.000
calling your doctor and saying, I have a headache. What is it? Well, I can't tell you I'd have to do

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.440
tests. Give me a range. Okay. It's a reaction to the barometric pressure and it'll be gone in 15

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.080
minutes or it's a brain aneurysm and you'll be dead in five minutes. There's your range.

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:41.200
And so it didn't really help, right? So I have the least expensive divorce I've ever seen

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:49.040
is two people who, one of whom comes into my office and says, we've written down on a yellow

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.680
pad what we figured out at the kitchen table. She's going to keep the house. I'm going to keep the

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.800
401k. We have a bank account at this bank. We're going to split that 50-50. I'm going to pay her

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.200
this much in child support each month and we're going to agree from time to time on what we're

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.640
going to do in terms of the schedule with the kids, but they're primarily going to live with her.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.520
Can you write this up and make it legally binding? Yes. 3,500 bucks.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:19.440
Just as a side note, I have a friend who went through a divorce and handled it just masterfully

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:27.440
by giving more than he's supposed to and having nothing but love in his heart and happiness with

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:37.200
the kids. I don't know. That to me is just an inspiration. His whole view was like,

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:47.280
who cares about money? And also, he refused with every ounce of his being to have anything but

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.840
complete love for the other person. I've had clients who, with a straight face,

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.480
will say to me, well, I'm not going to quibble over a few million dollars.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:00.080
And they mean it because to them, it's numbers on a page. I'll personalize this a bit.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.080
I have a friendly relationship with my ex-wife who's the mother of my sons who are adults.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.600
We have maintained a very good relationship and so now it's many years

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:18.640
divorced later, 17, 18 years later. We were able to post-game that relationship,

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.080
even our co-parenting relationship. We kind of post-game it when we chat with each other.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:30.880
And I remember once saying to her, yeah, you never screwed around with me when it came to the kids.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:40.560
You were always so cool. If I was having a really bad day at work or seeing just an ugly

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.840
custody case, I would call her and say, hey, can I just pick the boys up and take them out

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.120
for ice cream or something tonight? I know it's not my night, but would you mind if I just took

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.400
them out for a couple of hours? She'd be like, yeah, sure, come on by. She was always flexible

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:58.800
like that. And I said to her, was that just goodwill? You're just a good person? What was

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.240
that about? And she was like, yeah, it was partly that, but she was like, it was partly that you

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.320
never screwed around with me when it came to money. If the kids needed something or if I needed

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.480
something as the mother of the kids, you were always like, yeah, sure, of course. Her air

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.880
conditioning kicked out and she needed it to replace it and she didn't have liquidity. I

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:17.840
didn't have a lot of money at the time because it was a long time ago. And I was like, all right,

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.120
because I don't want you hot and upset and I don't want the boys to be like, of course.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:29.440
And so I think, yeah, when you approach a conflict, it's very hard to argue with someone

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:36.400
who won't argue with you. If the person approaches the argument from the point of view of, I'm not

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:42.800
going to argue with you. I'm going to absorb your aggression. I'm going to just not meet it with

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.640
that. I'm going to meet it with love. I'm going to meet it with positivity. It doesn't always work

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.360
because sometimes people are so angry that they just are, they're relentless. But I have to tell

01:44:51.360 --> 01:45:01.680
you, the louder you get, the quieter I get, the more you seem irrational. And that's what I always

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.480
try to bring that to court proceedings. I always try to bring to court. If I know my adversary is

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:15.440
coming in hard, I'll come in quiet and slow and deliberate because I want the volume to be turned

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:22.160
up way too high over there. And then it looks like, what? Your honor, what's their problem over

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:28.560
there? And I think that, I say this to clients, they got a four-year-old, they're getting divorced,

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:35.920
let's say. There's going to be a wedding in like 20 something years. There's going to be a wedding.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.440
And it's either going to be the wedding where they got to put these people on opposite sides

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.960
of the room because if they pass each other by the shrimp boat, they're going to kill each other.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.640
Or it's the wedding where you stand there, you take some pictures, you kind of go like,

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.320
yeah, we fucked up this whole marriage thing, but maybe we did a good job with this kid,

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:59.520
didn't we? And the decisions you make right now, there's a straight line to that wedding.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.720
And so even if you don't like this person, even if you're mad at them, even if you're mad at

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.080
yourself for the choices you made in choosing them as a co-parent, every single Mother's Day

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:17.120
for 27 years, I have told my now longtime ex-wife, happy Mother's Day. I'm so glad that we

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.520
had kids together. I'm so glad you're the mother of my kids because they wouldn't be who they are

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:27.760
if it wasn't that they were part me and part you. And I'm so grateful for you. And I'm always

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:35.440
cheering for you. How hard is that? How hard is that? I don't understand why it's so hard for

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.840
some people. I'll tell you, I do find that hard. There's not a lot of things that I kind of don't

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.000
understand, but that's one that I kind of don't understand. I put in

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:55.040
one of the weird things I did as a divorce lawyer that caused a little stir among my colleagues for

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:02.480
a few years was some years ago. We all steal from each other's work, divorce lawyers. We're like the

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:06.720
matrimonial mafia. We all know each other. We all deal with each other over and over again,

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.640
but we all have the same job. And so we're the only people that really know the unique stresses

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.160
of that job. So even though we try to kill each other all day, it's like boxer, like professional

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.880
fighters. Yeah, your job is to take each other's head off, but nobody knows what the two of you

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:26.560
went through, the two of you. That's why I always get, I go all kinds of rubbery when I see after

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:31.360
the fight, the two people hug each other because I'm always like, yeah, because you know what? They

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.640
relate to each other better than anybody. They suffered, they bled, the competitors, they bled.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:42.480
So I really think divorce lawyers, we have that same kind of relationship. We went through this

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:54.080
stress on opposite sides trying to take each other apart. And I find that we all steal from

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:58.800
each other's material when it comes to separation agreements, provisions that we use for agreements.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.640
All the agreements are like these Frankenstein monsters of, oh, I like his estate planning

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.440
provisions. Oh, I like her provisions related to maintaining a life insurance policy to secure

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:17.840
the alimony award. And I wrote this paragraph or this section because what occurred to me is that

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:23.840
when you have a child with someone, and let's say they're three or four or five, they're old

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:28.480
enough to know what Christmas is, but they're not old enough to go buy a Christmas present.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.000
But they're old enough to know that you get presents on Christmas and you give presents

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:41.680
on Christmas, but they're not old enough to buy one for the parent. So someone has to do that for

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:49.840
them. So I thought I'm going to put in a provision that says that as long as the children are so

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.600
young that they can't independently purchase a mother's day or a birthday present for the

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:02.480
co-parent, that you'll take the children either to buy a small gift or to make a card, something

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:12.160
like that. This struck me as a no-brainer. Who could disagree with this? It's not for the person,

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:17.520
it's for the kid. It's so the kid, happy birthday, mom. I don't have a present for you,

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:23.840
I don't have a card for you because I'm fucking five. I'm five. You can't go do that.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.120
So wouldn't you want your child, not your co-parent, who cares? Maybe you want them to

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.320
have the worst birthday ever. Fine, but you don't want your child to be embarrassed. And I even put

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:40.000
in the provision, the parties acknowledge that it is the intention of this provision to ensure that

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.520
the child is not embarrassed and feels that they were able to. I cannot tell you how many people

01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:53.680
refuse to sign that. How many lawyers said to me, we're taking that out. And I went, wait, why?

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.360
Why does my client have to buy a present for your client? I said, they're not buying a present for

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.000
my client, they're buying a present for the child to give to my client. It can be one of those little

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.280
$3 boxes of chocolates they sell at the drug store. It's a kid, they don't know, they don't

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:16.960
know what anything is. And I have to tell you, of the conundrums, of the puzzles,

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:23.520
that I can't figure out in existence. That's what I can't figure out. I do not understand

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.840
why that's so hard. That's basically just an illustration of their complete inability to do

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:37.600
anything nice for the other person. The level of hatred, the level of vitriol. Maybe this is me.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:48.080
I'm, if you apologize, there's not a lot I won't forgive. I'm not saying I'll forget it. I'm not

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.880
saying, oh, we're totally good like it never happened. I understand that. But if someone says

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:59.360
what I call a non-bullshit apology, a bullshit apology is, oh, I'm sorry you got so upset when

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:05.280
I did that. That's a bullshit apology. I'm sorry that you were offended. That's a bullshit apology.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.240
Or I'm sorry for what I did. Because what are we talking about? We might not be talking about the

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.520
same thing. Or you might be saying, I'm sorry that you found out about that, not that you did it.

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:24.640
So a real apology is, I lied to you and I realized that that hurt you. And I'm really sorry. I

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:31.040
shouldn't have done that. I regret that I did that. And I know that it hurt you and I'm really sorry.

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.600
That's a real apology. So someone's willing to give you that and you still want to walk around

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:45.520
with the level of vitriol that you will harm your child rather than do something nice for them.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:51.680
I don't have a solution. And I can tell you, I see that all the time. Parental alienation is a thing.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:58.560
It is a thing. Children can be weaponized. I always tell people, if you want to get married,

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.480
get married. Get a prenup ideally. But if you don't have a prenup, okay, you're just risking

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:08.080
money. Don't worry. You're just risking money. Money and hassle of paperwork and of time and

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:15.760
of going through an ugly financial divorce. But you have a kid with somebody, that is a missile.

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:23.200
That person has a power over you for a long time, if not forever.

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.320
So the child could be used as part of a manipulation?

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:34.960
Oh, routinely. People weaponize children all the time. And they do it with the permission

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:41.680
of their own conscience because they genuinely believe, I'm going to protect this child from

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:47.120
this person who, by the way, is a bad spouse. But that doesn't mean they were a bad father

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:54.160
or bad mother. You can be bad at being a spouse, but the skill set of a spouse and of a parent,

01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:03.360
it's not necessarily the same. And I've seen people alienate children from a parent

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:10.640
in such subtle ways, but they're so powerful. And as a lawyer, it doesn't matter what I know,

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:18.960
it matters what I can prove. And it's very hard to prove alienation because it's usually a very

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:24.960
subtle process. And the example I always give to people is, it's a rare kind of crazy person

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:36.000
that will say to a seven-year-old, your dad is a bad person. But this, hello, here's your dad.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:42.480
You just said your dad's a bad person. You just did it with your eyes. You did it with

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:46.560
the expression on your face when you handed the phone to the kid. You told that kid your

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:51.600
dad's a bad person. You didn't have to say it out loud. And that is something people are guilty

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:58.720
of all the time. When the kid comes home and says, there's a divorced couple, kid comes home and

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:03.120
says, oh, I met mom's new boyfriend. And you go, oh yeah, that's nice. Remember, he's not your dad.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.800
Whoa. You just told that kid a whole bunch of information about how he's supposed to feel

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:13.920
about this person. Whereas if you go, oh, that's nice. Oh, that's great. I heard nice things. Yeah,

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.560
I heard he's really, he likes bicycles. That's cool. That's really neat. You just told this kid,

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:23.120
okay, it's okay. You can like this person. It's okay to like this person. It's okay that your mom

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:30.480
is with this person. And again, whatever you feel about your ex, your co-parent, usually you love

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:37.520
your kid more than you hate your ex, ideally. Also, I wish people would, even without an apology,

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:46.400
forgive each other. It goes back to the earlier discussion we had. I usually forgive people if

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.920
there's something in them, especially if we shared something, but even just if there's something

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:59.040
about them that's beautiful. It's great that they exist in the world. So I'm just grateful for that

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.960
and I use that as the fuel of forgiveness. I don't know. To me, forgiveness is very often,

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:14.960
it's for me. When I let go of anger, I feel lighter. I think my heart enjoys peace.

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:21.760
Partly it's because I fight for a living. I work in the world of conflict. I jokingly used to say

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:27.360
to my sons when they were teenagers, I can only argue if you've paid. It's not fair to the paying

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:35.760
customers. If I argue with you for free, that's not fair. But I think we're talking about the

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:45.600
incredibly wide range that a divorce can cost. And you were saying the cheapest one was the yellow

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.760
paper. Yeah, yellow pad, two people, came to an agreement, write it up, make it legally binding,

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:54.800
five grand maybe, tops. But usually 3,500, five grand, that kind of vibe.

01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:01.920
Most expensive, millions, millions in council fees. And that's because of the duration,

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.560
the complexity. Yeah, the duration, the complexity of issues. I have clients who've paid

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.600
two, three million in council fees to me. So it's like as a custody or social complexity?

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.480
It can be complex custody that requires a hearing, that requires expert testimony,

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:26.160
dueling mental health professionals, opining on the parenting. It can be a situation where

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.800
emergency circumstances occur, like where an individual tries to abscond to another country

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.440
with the children and you have to bring them back under the Hague Convention on International

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:46.640
Child Abduction. We've done some Hague cases. There are cases where people have very different

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:55.120
facts. Before I came here today, a client of mine's soon to be ex-husband who she's in the

01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.560
middle of a divorce, he tested positive for cocaine on a hair follicle test where it was said he was

01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:06.080
definitely not going to test positive and he tested positive. So it was like we were scurrying now with,

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.520
okay, we got to get a motion filed, we got to suspend access, we got to protect the kids,

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.160
we got to get in front of a judge, we got to think about what are the implications of this

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.320
because he was about to transition to an unsupervised parenting. This is the kind of stuff

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:25.120
that can amp up the amount of work the lawyer has to do, which then translates to money. I get paid

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.600
for my time and the time of my team. I have attorneys and paralegals who work for me.

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:39.360
When you have a team of lawyers working on a case, you can burn tens of thousands of dollars a day

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:47.200
if it's a big enough case. There are also very complex financial cases. People move and hide

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:58.240
money. The high net worth space is a different world. If an average person owns a home,

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:05.360
they own a home in their name or their name with their spouse. A high net worth person

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:14.240
owns an LLC that owns that home. That LLC is owned by a trust. They are a beneficial

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.560
interested party in that trust. This is how some of my clients who make

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:25.360
tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay less in taxes than a cop or a firefighter

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:32.640
because they have structures. The structures that were designed for tax planning purposes

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:42.800
then in a divorce become very tricky to unwind and to figure out what is mine and what is not.

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:48.800
Then that takes us to the question of prenups. What's your view on prenups?

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.120
Prenuptial agreements. It's not popular to quote Kanye West, but

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.400
if you ain't no chum, Paula, we want prenup. We want prenup. That's what he had to say.

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:01.760
Meaning prenup is a good idea.

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:10.800
Prenup is an excellent idea. Prenup is a contract between two people that binds their respective

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:15.360
rights and obligations in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues. That's all it

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:24.160
is. There's a lot of reasons to have them and there really aren't any reasons not to have them

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.200
other than the fact that it requires an uncomfortable conversation.

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:33.680
There's a few questions here. First, do they work legally in general?

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:40.400
Yes. If they are crafted correctly, which is not that hard to do for a lawyer to do. I'm

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:45.120
saying for a lawyer to do because with the internet, everybody thinks, why would I spend

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:50.080
$1,000? I can just Google prenup agreement and I can get one and then it'll be, that is a bad idea.

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:56.000
It is like a will. If you're going to have a document that binds your rights at that level,

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:05.600
the most expensive prenup I've ever done was like three grand. That's ridiculous. That's not a lot

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:12.400
of money. There's no reason you wouldn't do it, but people will still. I've had clients that have

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.680
hundreds of thousands of dollars and they did their prenup downloading something from the internet

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.800
because of some imperfection. It doesn't have the right, what's called acknowledgement,

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:27.040
which is the section where the notary signs and it has to say that it was duly sworn before this

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:31.600
person on this date. If it doesn't have that, it's invalid. It's not binding. There are weird

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.120
technicalities, but prenups are binding. As long as there's been some minimal asset disclosure,

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:43.360
which is easily done in a prenup, and as long as there's not a language deficiency, meaning that

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:48.080
the person who is reading it understands English to the level that they understand what they're

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.880
signing and if they don't, that at least they've acknowledged in their native language that there

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:58.320
is some opportunity for this to be translated for them. Yeah, they're binding. They're

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:04.560
presumptively binding. We live thankfully in a culture where people are allowed to

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:10.880
enter into contracts about money. What are some prenups that you've seen that can be

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:18.240
effective or that people converge towards in terms of what does an agreement look like?

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:24.800
Because the popular conception is when there's no prenup, both sides get half.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:33.120
That's generally true that both sides get half. Equitable distribution, which is what the law

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.840
is called. It's the law of equitable distribution. It's not called the law of equal distribution

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:44.000
for a reason because it's equitable, not equal. Equitable is presumed to be equal,

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:49.440
but there are exceptions to that presumption, and that's where lawyers can get into

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:55.200
fun and or trouble, depending on how you view it. It's where we make our money. We make our money

02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:05.680
arguing that the fair result will not be just a 50-50 split. There's the very generic standard

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:13.840
prenup, which is easy. I call that yours, mine, and ours. If it's in your name, it's yours,

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:19.680
whether it's an asset or a liability. My name, it's mine. Joint names, we split it 50-50. Simple,

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:26.240
clean. You go in to the marriage now knowing what the rules are. If you get a bonus at work

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:31.440
and you put it in your sole name, then it's your separate property in the event you divorce.

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:36.480
You go out and buy a boat, and she doesn't support you buying the boat, but you got a big loan on

02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:44.400
this boat. You're responsible for that loan. I like that because I like people having some control.

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.680
I also like people having to have discussions. Well, why are we putting that bonus just in your

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.200
bank account? Why wouldn't we put it in the joint bank account? We should have that discussion while

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.200
we're married, not when we're in a divorce lawyer's office 10 years later, because we should be able

02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:06.640
to talk about those kinds of things. What's interesting about prenups is that somehow people

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:13.920
think there's something like it takes away from the romance of a marriage, but I've said it before

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:21.040
and I'll say it again, all marriages end. They end in death or divorce. Having life insurance or

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.960
having a will, it doesn't mean you can't wait to die. It doesn't mean you're looking forward to

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:31.360
death. It doesn't mean that you're predicting your demise sometime imminently. It just means

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:37.840
that you're being realistic and honest. When you marry, and I don't mean spiritually marrying,

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:45.920
having a marriage ceremony. I mean legally marrying. You're making changes to your rights

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.120
and obligations under law. That's what you're doing. Marriage, from a legal standpoint,

02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:58.240
what we mean when we say I got married is a state agency. It's been created by the state.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:05.520
This is a legal status that most people who are in it know nothing about.

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:12.320
They just did the most legally significant thing they're ever going to do other than dying,

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:20.080
and they have no idea what rights and obligations it created in them. The first time they're going

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:24.800
to get an education about it is in my office. That's crazy. When they get divorced. That's crazy.

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.520
Prenup is an opportunity to learn something about it at the start. First of all,

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.920
whenever someone approaches me about prenups, and that's like four or five times a week probably,

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.240
depending on the season. Right before wedding season, we get a lot. When's wedding season?

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:45.120
Well, it used to just be the summer. They say when you marry and you're a bride all your life.

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:50.560
That's from some Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Now the fall is very big too. People love fall

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:56.160
content, fall weddings, pretty pictures and things. Fall content. It's good on the gram.

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:02.480
Weddings is for the gram. I have to tell you, weddings is performative, man.

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.520
The problem is though, it's curated. Here's us picking the cake. It's not here's us doing

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:12.880
the prenup. You know how many people I've done prenups for that I've watched on their social

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:18.400
media or them being interviewed by Andy Cohen on Bravo and saying, well, no, we don't have a prenup.

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:21.840
Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. You do. It's in my office. It's in a folder. Yeah.

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.080
No, that's beautiful. But prenups are not published any place. They're not filed with a court.

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.600
They're maintained by the two people that signed it and they're lawyers. That's it.

02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:34.080
Nobody has to admit that they have a prenup. Beautiful.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:41.760
Yes, but there's a certain problem with that in so far as a lot of people have prenups and we need

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:46.880
to normalize prenups. Like there's no reason not to normalize prenups. There's no reason not

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.920
for until some famous people say, yeah, we have a prenup. We're crazy about each other.

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:55.440
That's why we're getting married, you know, but yeah, look, we're getting, you know,

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:59.920
I don't want to get a car accident, but I got a seatbelt, you know, like you have it just in case.

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:06.000
I mean, what do you do if you're running a company?

02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:11.920
Like what does that have to do with the prenup? You know, you're running a hundred billion dollar

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:18.240
or a trillion dollar company, Jeff Bezos. I suppose his marriage was before Amazon.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:22.000
Yeah, his was before it was anything. But like, how does that work in a prenup?

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:31.120
Well, no, actually it's the same. I mean, what you're doing with a prenup is you're identifying

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:38.720
you're identifying how things will be classified in advance. So you're creating a set of rules

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:45.040
and then you both can function under those rules during the marriage. So like I, for a brief time,

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:51.520
I taught a family law drafting class at a law school and when we would do separation agreements

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:56.000
and we would do pleadings, you know, it was lots of fun. When we would do prenups, I would say to

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.080
the students, you know, what's the main thing you need when you're doing a prenup? And they would

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:04.160
say, well, you know, you need asset disclosure. And I'd say, well, that's not the main thing.

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.800
And they'd say, well, you need, you know, technical language. I said, nope. Main thing you need is a

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.520
crystal ball. And the main thing you need is the ability to see what's going to happen in the

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:17.440
future. Who's going to have money? Who's not? Who's going to be successful? Who isn't? What

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:22.400
people will inherit? Problem is we don't have that. We don't have that. So what can we do?

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:28.880
We can create tranches. We can create structures. We can create systems. And then people can live

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:36.000
with those in mind. You enter the game knowing the rules, right? So you know if this is going

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.760
to be a submission only event, you know, if this is going to be no time limit, you know, if we're

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:44.640
after a certain number of minutes, we're going into points now. Okay. So I can work with that rule set

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:50.960
and I'm going to amend my game based on that rule set. Same thing. Same thing. You're just going to

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:57.680
say, look, what's the rule set? Let's agree on the rule set. And then let's conduct ourselves with the

02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:03.520
rule set in mind. Let's plan the rule set in mind. And I think that, you know, by the way,

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.480
and if you're going to cheat, you cheat with the rule set in mind. You know you're cheating,

02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:13.840
right? You know you're trying to get around the rule set. So prenups are, when I do a consult for

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:19.200
a prenup, the first thing I do is here's what's going to happen legally if you marry without a

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:27.280
prenup. Here's what happens to your rights and obligations. Then what we can change with that,

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:32.400
there's almost no limit. You can amend anything you want to. The example I always give is there

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:38.800
was a case that went up to the appellate court where a high net worth guy married a very beautiful

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:44.000
woman and there was a provision in the prenuptial agreement that said for every 10 pounds she gained

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:51.520
during the marriage, she would lose $10,000 a month in alimony if they divorced. And there was,

02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:55.920
here's her baseline weight as of the time of execution of this agreement. And I wondered if

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:03.360
did what a wrestler does. Did she bulk up right before and then cut when she eventually got

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:10.160
divorced? Is she in there with a sauna with the suit on? And the appellate court essentially said,

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:17.120
I don't know why you married this person, having had them make you sign this, but it's binding.

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:22.480
I wish somebody would do a contract like that, like the rent for this place would be

02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:28.160
more expensive if I was fatter and cheaper, if I was skinnier. And that way I would have to weigh

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:37.600
in. Yeah, exactly. That kind of prenup is motivating. Well, I think Tim Ferriss says that

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:43.440
about how he does like, he said you should make bets with people. Like it's like, if you gain this

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.600
much, I got to give you this amount of money. I think he says that in one of his early books.

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.480
And trying to make it binding somehow, which is tough.

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.600
Yeah. I think when we create incentives of that kind, you know, that's why like there was like

02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:02.240
the no nut November, no shave November, you know, sober, like all those, it was a competition. When

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.640
people make a competition of something, they gamify something. It makes it something that

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.240
people are more likely to stick with. So, I mean, I guess a prenup be interesting there. The problem

02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:20.160
is there's also people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses. Fidelity clauses,

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.240
people still do these. I discourage people from doing them. The two things that people put in

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:28.880
prenups that I discourage people from putting in prenups, but very often people still put in prenups,

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:34.880
even with my caveat, is fidelity clauses and sunset clauses. So fidelity clauses is,

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:39.520
I'm waving alimony, I'm waving this, I'm waving that. But if you cheat,

02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:44.320
I get a million bucks or I get this much alimony or I get this amount.

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:52.000
And I know the intention is to disincentivize the person from cheating. It's a deterrent

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.760
to have them cheat. But all it really does is just creates like an interesting legal battle

02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:04.000
for lawyers. Like how did you prove that they cheated or not? Oh, right. Because what constitutes

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.800
cheating also- Right, right. Is an emotional affair an affair? Is oral sex cheating?

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.000
And by the way, how do you prove it? Well, I was in a hotel with her, but how do you prove that I

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:23.360
had sex with her? And it's very, very, you're opening a can of worms with that kind of a thing,

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:29.200
but people sometimes still put them in. And sunset clauses. Sunset clauses is if we're

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:34.000
married X period of time, this goes away as if it never existed. And why is that a bad idea?

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.360
The same reason the community property law in California is a bad idea. So the community

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.920
property law is after a certain number of years, I think it's seven, everything,

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:50.720
including your premarital property, all becomes marital property. And the idea of that was supposed

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.840
to be that if you've been married that number of years, like you're in enough of a serious

02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:02.960
relationship now that everything is one unit, you're one person. What it actually does is

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.920
creates a very uncomfortable thought experiment that people have to have at the six year mark.

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:13.760
Because you have to, now the honeymoon's kind of over. You might have a kid or two

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:23.040
and you go, okay, wait a minute. Am I so happy in this relationship that I'm willing to take all of

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.720
my premarital assets and throw them in the pot right now? Because if not, I got six months to

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:36.080
get divorced. So if you say to someone, if you got married tomorrow and then you found a company

02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:43.600
that's worth a hundred million dollars and under your prenup, that's your separate property.

02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.400
But there's a sunset clause that says that your prenup goes out the window in 15 years.

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.280
Man, at year 14 and six months, you got to ask yourself some serious questions about where's

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:59.760
this relationship going to be in five, 10 years. That's brilliant. And that's why kids, you pay

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:05.120
for a lawyer. That's it. We get paid to see around corners. I get paid to be paranoid. I tell people

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.840
that all the time. Okay. So you just mentioned infidelity. You write in the book, which everybody

02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:15.360
should get. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a window into your soul. You in this book,

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:18.960
that there's five kinds of infidelity. Do you remember? Can you explain?

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.720
Yeah. What I wanted to say is that all infidelity is not the same, that there's different kinds.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:35.040
And some of them are more obvious than others. There's the soulmate. That's the one I think I

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:42.720
see most often, which is a person meets another person or rekindles on social media or elsewhere

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:49.360
a reconnection with another person in their life. And they go, oh my God, this is the person I'm

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:54.880
supposed to be with. I'm in love. The heart wants what the heart wants. Like I'm leaving you for

02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.520
this person because I have found my true love. That's one type. And it's an incredibly common

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:07.040
type. And there are plenty of cautionary tales associated with that where people thought that

02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:15.920
they found their someone. And then it turns out it was just unfair. And a man who leaves his

02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.880
wife for his mistress just leaves a new job opportunity open. And we should also mention

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:26.960
that you talk about Facebook and Instagram. Oh yes. If we were going to invent an infidelity

02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:31.360
generating machine, it would be called Facebook, which by the way is a function of the fact the

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:35.920
book was written in 2019. I would now change it to Instagram. Oh, because you said just Facebook.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.960
Yes. But now if I had to rewrite it, it would be if we were going to invent an

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:42.400
infidelity generating machine, it would be called Metta. That would be what would happen.

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:50.080
There you go. Very tech forward. It was a function of what Facebook and I think Instagram also are,

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:56.080
which is it is a communication tool that has people looking into windows that I think are

02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:01.680
antagonistic to marriage. You're looking into the lives of other people. You're looking into

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:08.880
the social lives of people that you meet casually. So there was a time where you would

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.440
be at your son's soccer practice and see the attractive mom across the way.

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:18.800
And you wouldn't really talk to her, interact with her. If you did, it would just be at practice.

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:25.360
But now we add on social media those people because for legitimate reasons, we need to

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:30.000
maybe communicate about when practices or we want to message the person. But now it's sort

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.840
of an invitation to a connection. And then there's a picture of her on vacation in a

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:40.560
bikini. That's very intriguing. And then you have a benign, oh, I saw you guys went on vacation.

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.960
Where did you stay? Oh, was that good? Did you like that? Oh, that's nice. And now we're talking

02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:50.320
and now we're having an interaction. And now this is how the spark of affairs begins.

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.360
People don't usually meet and go, would you like to potentially wreck your marriage? Yes, would you?

02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:01.920
Oh my God, let's do this. It slowly happens. So when I talk about types of infidelity,

02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:08.480
the soulmate, the unexpected soulmate, this connection that you didn't expect.

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.640
I didn't expect to fall in love with this person, but I did. And the heart wants what the heart wants

02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:21.040
and I'm sorry. That one's tough. That one's tough because it's an interesting distinction between

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:28.960
men and women to some degree. That when a man finds out his wife was cheating, the question is,

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.480
did you fuck him? And when a woman finds out that a man cheated, the question is, do you love her?

02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:42.560
And those are different things. I feel like there could be many and have been many books written

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:48.800
on that. Yeah, there have been by much smarter people than me. But I think that

02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:58.720
the soulmate thing is very, very painful for a lot of my female clients. When a man says,

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:06.080
listen, I found the one. I found the one and it's not you. That is really, really hard to get past.

02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:12.880
Even when it turned out to be true. I mean, I've seen some people that it was an affair that turned

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:21.280
into 20 plus year marriages. An unhappy marriage and then a happy affair that turned into a very

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:28.000
happy marriage. There's not a formula. I've been doing it long enough now that I've seen

02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:33.200
I've been doing it long enough now that I've seen permutations I never would have expected.

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.120
So that's one type of infidelity. The other is what I call the push out of the closet,

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.640
which is and that I think happened more often earlier in my career. There have been tremendous

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:52.160
strides, I think, in the lesbian and gay community where including marriage equality, obviously,

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:57.440
where there's a lot of change as to people accepting people as being gay or lesbian.

02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:06.240
I think that there was a time where people were having being in the closet was much more

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:11.520
important. You were subject to professional scorn and all kinds of things if you were gay or lesbian.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.160
People were sneaking around and having affairs with their same sex partners and then they get

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:23.840
caught and then it really was a function of the fact that they were closeted.

02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:32.560
Again, that's another kind of complicated dynamic because I haven't had that happen to me where a

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:41.840
woman left me for a woman, but I'd like to think it would be easier for me because if you left me

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:48.960
for a man, you're saying I want one like you but better than you. Whereas if you leave me for a

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:57.280
woman, well, that's a whole different set of equipment. I don't have that. It's not me,

02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:01.600
it's you. It's something you want that I can't offer. We don't serve that at this restaurant,

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:09.200
so it's okay. I get it. There's a betrayal, there's a sadness, whatever, but this is a different thing.

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:18.400
The saddest type of infidelity in my opinion is the mistake, which is someone just makes a mistake.

02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:29.040
People do dumb shit when it comes to sex. People just, in a moment, they follow temptation,

02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:37.360
their impulse control is poor, and they do something that doesn't reflect their

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:42.640
morality or doesn't reflect the depth of their feelings. If you spend enough time in a room with

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.600
people who've cheated in a relationship and are speaking candidly to you about it because you're

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:55.760
their lawyer, they'll say to you very openly, no, I really love my wife. I really love my wife. I

02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:01.440
just, I don't know, I was just an idiot. I saw this bright shiny object and I went for it. I

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:07.840
really wanted to sleep with that woman. I wanted to fuck her. I love my wife. I make love to my

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:14.080
wife. I love my wife, but I just want to sleep with this one. We created a culture where

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:22.720
one of those eradicates the other. That's a whole nother discussion. Is there ethical non-monogamy?

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:32.160
Should we, is marriage about who I have sex with or is marriage a different kind of a partnership?

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:39.600
Is it a pair bond that's about building a life together? Where does monogamy fit into that?

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:46.320
People like Esther Perel, those are people who are making very intelligent discussions about that.

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:50.640
Yeah, that's a complicated one. Just to actually just linger on that,

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:56.880
a view, how often have people with open marriages have been in your office?

02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:02.240
Well, let's see, and this is one of those, from a research perspective, this would be flawed

02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:07.600
because I see the, they're in my office because their marriage is falling apart.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:14.640
There may be lots of people having open relationships that don't end up in a divorce

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:20.480
lawyer's office, so I'd never meet them, but I meet a lot of people that that was the Hail Mary

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:27.840
Pass. I meet a lot of people that they tried that, but in retrospect, it was a Hail Mary Pass.

02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:34.080
It was like, look, we've just figured, let's try this. Maybe this will keep the glue together on

02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:44.400
this thing. I've also seen open relationships go wrong where we agree we're just going to have

02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:48.400
sexual connections with other people or we're going to bring other people into the bedroom,

02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:53.760
but together, we're going to be together with other people or with another person.

02:21:54.640 --> 02:22:02.480
Then that connection of those two people, do you think it's a soul mate all of a sudden now?

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:07.920
It goes in this other, and again, is that novelty? It's the reason why I don't understand why people

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:12.880
have threesomes. It's like when someone sings to you, I don't know where to look.

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:17.280
Like, I don't know where to look. If someone's singing to me, I don't know where to look. It

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:26.160
feels weird, right? This is a conundrum. I'll say this to you, this will never ... It's the reason

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:32.480
I can't go to strip clubs. I don't know where to look. If I go to a strip club, you go to strip club

02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:37.680
and there's the part where the woman's on the stage and she walks past each person who does a

02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:42.160
little thing and then next person and then there's a little thing. When she's right in front of you,

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:47.120
I like a woman's face and I like a woman's body. I like both of them.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.480
I'm looking at the woman's face and she's very beautiful, but she's naked. I think, oh, she's

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:56.960
naked. I should be looking at her naked body because obviously it's almost rude not to because

02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:01.360
she's naked in front of me. Of course. Then I'm looking at her naked body, which is lovely to

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:06.560
look at, but then I find myself going, oh my God, you should look at her face for God's sake.

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:11.440
Then I look at her face and find myself having this whole thing in my head where I'm going like,

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:18.880
oh my God, where am I supposed to look? I think a threesome with two women you don't hardly know

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:25.600
or you're not, that's different, but a threesome with a long-term partner who you're in a

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:33.600
relationship with and a new person seems to me a very dangerous ground because you're going to

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:40.480
want to enjoy the novelty of this new person, but you're going to have to spend time with this person

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:48.000
after. How much attention do you spend to the new novel exciting thing without creating the impression

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:54.080
that you're not interested in this because you're my favorite person, but this is fun,

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.640
so I want to just try this for a few, but then also I don't want to forget about that. It just

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:03.120
seems tricky. That analogy, by the way, is brilliant. Also, I guess it's tricky because

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:08.080
the consequences of mistakes are quite high because you're going to have to talk about it.

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:16.240
There's an easy way to misinterpret the data. If I really like sleeping with my partner,

02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:22.640
but I get one chance to sleep with this other person, well, of course I should indulge in that

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:30.480
because I can do this anytime, but this person, my partner might interpret that as, oh, so you're

02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:36.800
more interested in her than me because that voice in my partner that would be insecure might hear

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:43.920
that. Why would you open yourself up to that level of chaos? You seem to love chess in the

02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:49.920
courtroom. It's the kind of intimate human chess of sorts. Yeah, no, that's too high risk.

02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.280
How do we get on threesomes? Oh, open marriages. Well, we get on threesomes. I don't know. I was

02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:00.720
wondering how people get on threesomes. I think if one is fun, two must be better. If two is better,

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:10.080
three must be better. Yeah, I think the way that this becomes an issue is why would you have a

02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:17.680
non-monogamous relationship? What is it about your sex life with this person that's not satisfying?

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.080
I think that that is the question that's harder to ask yourself and to try to answer with your

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:29.360
partner. You've said that this idea of soulmates is great for your business, but

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:37.280
a human being and a partnership can't be everything. Is that true? I think it's

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:44.800
unrealistic. It's a true romance, right? The document that we keep referencing here.

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.720
I think it's wonderful that we do because sometimes now people don't get that reference anymore.

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:56.800
When I try to teach negotiation to young lawyers who come work for me, I tell them to watch the

02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:04.400
Gary Oldman scene where he offers them the Chinese food. Why is that scene the one that really-

02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:10.000
Because it's the best negotiating lesson I've ever heard in my life. Where he comes in,

02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:20.960
Gary Oldman plays a pimp and his girl is Patricia Arquette. Christian Slater's character,

02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:27.840
the protagonist, is coming in to tell Gary Oldman that he no longer owns this girl,

02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:38.880
Alabama. Alabama is going to be with him now. Gary Oldman is an amazing performance. He's sitting

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:46.640
in a living room with a shotgun next to him with armed guys around him watching television and

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:52.000
eating Chinese food. He's got Chinese food laid out in front of him. Christian Slater comes in and

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:58.800
he says, I need to talk to you about Alabama. Gary Oldman says, do you want some Chinese food?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.720
Christian Slater is taken aback by the question. He says, no, I came to talk about Alabama.

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:10.880
She's with me now. He proceeds to tell him what his offer essentially is. Gary Oldman says,

02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:17.680
you know you fucked up, right? In Summon Substance, he says, if you'd sat down and

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:24.160
started eating my Chinese food, I would have thought, who's this guy? He didn't have a care

02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:29.200
in the world, just sitting down eating my egg foo young. But instead, you tried to be hard

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:36.960
and now I know you're full of shit. I think that scene summarizes how in negotiation,

02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:42.560
the more you enter into it with that. Anytime I deal with another lawyer and they're like,

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:49.120
well, we'll see you in court. See you in court. Empty barrels make the most noise. You and I,

02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:55.120
as people who've been in the jujitsu community, I know some dangerous people. I know FBI SWAT

02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:02.640
people. I know people that they know how to do things to people. They're the calmest guys you

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:08.400
ever meet in your life. You scuff their sneaker. Don't worry about it, it's okay. They're quick to

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:14.400
apology. They're just chill. What were we talking about? We were talking about...

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:21.120
Oh, wait, True Romance. Oh, The Soulmate. Yeah, The Soulmate. You're saying that this idea,

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:25.040
with that film underlying, there's this current of they were made for each other.

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:32.560
Yeah. I think there's a distinction between the feeling that someone is your missing puzzle piece

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.840
that you're made for this person. I think what that just means is there's a lot of overlapping,

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:45.200
beautiful connections. I love them intellectually. I love them sexually. I love them interpersonally.

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:51.360
We have some shared history. We have some shared commonalities. We were raised in the same culture,

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:56.960
raised in the same religion. We view, we have politically similar ideas. These are all,

02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:01.440
or we have totally opposite ones, but they're complimentary. I've always joked that finding

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:08.080
someone with complimentary pathologies. I'm obsessively disciplined, so having a partner

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:15.760
who's flexible and spontaneous is really good for me. Also, me being like, no, no, no, come on,

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.840
come back. We're going to do this now. No, no, it's time to actually do this now. We're good

02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.760
for each other. It's barefoot in the park. It's this idea of the yin and the yang.

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:30.880
So what I have an issue with is that the definition of soulmate that I think is sold

02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:38.640
to so many people now is this idea that if your partner is disappointing to you in any way,

02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.920
meaning they're not the perfect travel companion, they're not the perfect vocabulary companion,

02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:49.280
they're not the perfect roommate, they're not the perfect lover. The odds of someone being

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:56.080
all of those seems crazy to me. It's infinitesimally small and they don't have to be

02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:04.640
everything. If I go to a restaurant and eat 10 courses and one of them is subpar

02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:11.600
and the other nine are the most amazing culinary experience I've ever had, how dare I say, well,

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:16.400
that wasn't the right restaurant. What do you mean? That's a great restaurant. What are you

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:22.560
talking about? Of course there was one little thing. So I think it's impossible to have someone

02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:28.640
never disappoint you. It's impossible to have someone who never lets you down or doesn't say

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:33.600
and do the exact right thing at the exact right time and to create the idea or expectation in

02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:40.240
anyone that your partner should never let you down, never disappoint you, never not know what to say

02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:47.600
is I think crazy. I find for myself when someone, for example, loses someone, when someone

02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:54.320
loses a family member or a pet, I often say the same thing to the person. I'll either

02:30:54.320 --> 02:31:00.720
talk to them or send them a text or call them and I'll say, I wish I knew the perfect thing to say

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:07.760
because I would say it right now, but I know there isn't. I don't say that part, but I know

02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.400
there isn't. There isn't a perfect thing to say, but if there was a perfect thing to say,

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:16.880
I would say it right now. Love to me is not that you never let this person down. It's that you

02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:24.640
never want to let this person down. Love is a verb. It's this feeling of I never want to disappoint

02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:32.560
you. I will disappoint you, but I never want to disappoint you. I will hurt you, but I never want

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:39.600
to hurt you. When I hurt you, it will be my insecurity, my stupidity, my humanity that causes

02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:45.440
me to hurt you, but I will never intentionally hurt you. I will betray your trust. I'll never

02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:52.480
intentionally betray your trust. I will, by my stupidity, say the wrong thing or loose-lipped

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:56.080
say something to someone that you didn't want me to, but it won't be intentional. I will always

02:31:56.080 --> 02:32:01.840
try to be on your team. That feels to me like a realistic thing. Yeah, the intention leaves the

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:08.800
way, but there's some aspect of like, you know, just like the 10 course meal that over time,

02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:15.040
there's a kind of convergence towards perfection. And along the way, there's the rose-colored

02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:19.760
glasses where you see the beauty and everything. So it just, it feels,

02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:28.000
it's probably destructive just to really internalize the idea of soulmate because then

02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:34.560
any imperfections can make you doubt, can make you step away, can make you lose the connection,

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:41.920
but it just feels like, I don't know. It's too heavy. It just feels, I feel like when you see

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:48.880
a couple that's 90 years old and they've been together for 60 years, 70 years,

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:56.160
there is of course a temptation to think about all the beauty that they've seen on that journey

02:32:56.240 --> 02:33:01.680
together, the children, the grandchildren, maybe the great grandchildren, all the joy that they've

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:09.040
seen, all the pain they've endured and struggled together, you know? But they've also disappointed

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:13.520
each other a whole bunch of times, probably let each other down. They probably lie to each other

02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:21.200
a bunch. And yet, and to me, that is a beautiful thing. Like that's what, that is not, it's great

02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:26.800
in spite of that. It's great because of that. They still love each other, even though they've

02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:32.480
been so flawed and imperfect and they're human and they still love each other. They still

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:37.600
rode that thing together because the reasons to do so were greater than the reasons to not.

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:44.720
We've mentioned some of this, but I'd love to get your opinion on having seen things gone wrong.

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:51.600
How much, and having mentioned Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, how much fighting do you think

02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:59.760
is okay in a relationship and how to resolve the fights such that they don't escalate to

02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:04.880
that disconnection? Is there some wisdom you have for that? I imagine you've seen some epic fights.

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:11.600
Yeah, you know, it's very, I've seen some crazy fights. I have, even on my phone, I have some

02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:19.760
recordings because now there's cameras everywhere. It's like Nest cams and Ring cams. So a lot of

02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:26.240
this gets recorded and people have phones so readily available that they can record the other

02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:31.280
person and know it. And I listen to the way people speak to their, first of all, I listen to the way

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:34.560
people speak to each other and I'm shocked. I listen to the way people speak to their romantic

02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:40.240
partner, to their spouse and I'm blown away. I'm blown away. Disrespect or what? Just

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:50.720
disrespect, insults, profanity, just degradation, just brutality. And then to then kind of go on

02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.800
like the next day, you kind of go on like nothing happened. I'm shocked by it. I mean, I listen to

02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:02.000
it and I think like, if someone ever spoke to me that way, I don't know that I could ever really

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:09.440
feel deep connection to them freely. I would feel so betrayed, that they're just so brutal.

02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:20.480
I can't imagine speaking to someone that way, such vicious insults to someone. But I understand

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:28.240
that's how some people communicate perhaps. I guess the question of how much fighting is too

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:34.960
much fighting in the relationship is for me a bit like the question how much sex is enough sex in

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:45.360
the relationship. It depends on the two people and their individual tastes. But what's problematic

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:54.160
is when there is a disconnect between the two people. Like, so if, you know, there's a,

02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:02.800
I think it's Annie Hall. It's one of the Woody Allen films where Diane Keaton and Woody Allen

02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:05.920
are both talking to their respective therapists about the relationship,

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:12.880
but it's like a split screen. And she says, I mean, we have sex all the time. We have sex

02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:20.160
like once a week. And he goes, we never have sex. We have sex like once a week. And it's funny

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:27.040
because it's true. It really is this, they both know the same data, but they're interpreting that

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:33.280
data set completely differently. And I think, you know, the question you have to start asking is,

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:36.960
like, what is, you know, Steve Harvey actually once said something funny to me. He said that

02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.120
success is not where you are. Success is where you are in relation to where you started.

02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.720
He says, because if success is where you are, Oprah's got us all beat. Or maybe

02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:52.080
Ilan's got us all beat. I don't know. But if it's where you are versus where you started,

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:55.440
because there's a lot of people that started on second and, you know, started on third act

02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:59.520
like they hit a double, you know, like, well, I was given 10 million, but then I turned it

02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:05.680
into 100 million. Well, the first million is the hardest. So, you know, come on. But I think the

02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:10.880
question of like, how much sex were we having at the beginning of the relationship, that might be

02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:14.240
the wrong gauge because that's like, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. And we just,

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:20.240
it's novelty. But, you know, like how far, how much sex we're having post-children versus before

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:24.560
the children, that might be worth looking at. You know, like how do we compare it? You know,

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:31.920
like am I overweight compared to what? When I was 20 and running marathons or most 50 year old men?

02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.080
I don't know. I got to, I got to like, what do you compare it to? So I think fighting,

02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:43.760
there are some people that I think they enjoy fighting. Like they enjoy argument. You know,

02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:48.400
I know people that enjoy political debate. I don't particularly enjoy political debate. Not that I'm

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:55.120
not very interested in political concepts, economic concepts. I just, I argue for a living.

02:37:55.120 --> 02:38:03.680
So in my free time, I don't find argument that enjoyable when it's intense. I find discussion

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:09.440
more interesting. That's so interesting that you, you just keep the battle to that particular,

02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.680
to your main profession and everywhere else you want peace. Well, did you ever, you know, Bob,

02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.680
Bob Goldthwait, Bobcat Goldthwait, the comedian, very, very funny. And he had a whole second

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:22.640
chapter as like a director and a writer, but he has this, you know, I saw an interview with him

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.920
once where he said, you know, yeah, he says like, I'm a comedian. I've been a comedian a long time.

02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:28.480
People always come up to me and they're like, oh, you're a comedian. Do you want to hear a joke?

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:32.800
He's like, and all I can think is, oh yeah, that'd be a real fucking treat. Like I haven't heard

02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:39.040
jokes all day, all night for years. That would be a real special occasion. Yes. Like I get it,

02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.680
you know? Yeah. And I mean, a sadder story. I've been reading quite a bit about Robin Williams and

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:49.680
his wife would talk about how quiet and introspective and thoughtful and

02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:55.840
intellectual he was and not really that humorous in his private life. But that may be a function of,

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.800
you know, that it is enjoyable to be the other thing. Yeah. You know, one of the things I've

02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:11.920
always thought was very funny in relationships, my own relationships, is most women I know

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:17.280
who have a husband who doesn't wear a suit every day for a living.

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.720
When their husband gets dressed up, like they're going to a wedding or something,

02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:29.040
they get like, oh my God, look at like, look at him, you know? And I wear a suit every day,

02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.880
you know, on the weekends I don't, I wear like jeans and a black t-shirt, but the rest of the

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.160
time I wear a suit. And I remember, I think this has been true in every relationship I've been in

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:44.080
since I was a lawyer, including Mike's wife. It was always like, if I had on jeans and I wasn't

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:52.880
shaven, it was like, look at you. Are you kidding me? Like, really? Like, whereas the suit, they

02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.040
wouldn't even notice, wouldn't even notice the suit. Sometimes the other thing. Well, that's what it

02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:00.720
is. It's the novelty of the other thing. So I think that if you're Robin Williams and you're

02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:05.440
like being shot out of a cannon in terms of your performative style and your energy and explosive,

02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:11.440
yeah, being quiet must be very refreshing. Like I imagine, you know, incredibly intelligent people

02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:17.520
must love just watching stupid humor or having a dumb, it's why some of the smartest people I know

02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:24.400
like really dumb shit, you know? It's why like Rick and Morty, I think is brilliant because it's

02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:30.320
both smart and dumb. Yeah. It's a perfect combination. It really is. Yeah. I think it's

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:36.320
possibly the perfect show. Is there advice you can give to somebody like me on how to

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:43.440
interview? Well, how to do conversations? Well, is there, do you think there's something

02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:50.880
transferable from the courtroom to this setting with complicated people? Yeah, I think so.

02:40:51.440 --> 02:41:01.280
I think what can be learned about interviewing is the distillation, like what is most important.

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.320
When I hear a story that I have to present to a judge, the totality of someone's parenting,

02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:10.880
the good of their parenting, the bad of their parenting, the good of the other parent, the bad

02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.960
of the other parent, I have to sort of boil down what are the best examples because I can't lay it

02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:26.080
all out. And then what greater principle do they speak to? You know, the best jiu-jitsu teacher

02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:33.040
that I think I've had is Paul Schreiner. And Paul doesn't teach, just teach you techniques.

02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:40.080
He's teaching you ways of thinking about concepts in jiu-jitsu. And then here are some techniques

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.960
that illustrate that. John Donoher, from what I can see, does a lot of that as well. I think

02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:50.720
they're like soulmates in the jiu-jitsu world. Yeah. And then there's that element that you spoke

02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:58.000
to, which is maybe considering the other side. Well, always. Devil's advocate kind of thing.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.760
Yeah, I mean, straw man, steel man stuff, you do a lot of that. And I think all the best

02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:06.080
interviewers do. But yeah, I think it's really, really important to think about.

02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.800
I have to know the other side's case much better than my own. You know, I have to know what are

02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:20.320
their defenses? What are their strengths? I have to map out a strategy that keeps those in mind.

02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:29.840
And that's hard because early in my career, I would attribute to the other side

02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:36.320
an intelligence and strategy that sometimes wasn't applicable. Like I've learned like,

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:42.640
you know, there's like the simplest explanation is the accurate one, you know, the Occam's razor.

02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:49.120
I think like Sexton's, you know, would be never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed

02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:55.680
to stupidity or laziness, because I have lots of adversaries that like they'll not file a motion.

02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:59.760
I thought they were going to file and I'll go, wait, why didn't they file that? Like tactically,

02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:03.920
what are they thinking I'm going to do? And what is that about? You know, and I would go, well,

02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.160
if I didn't file it, why wouldn't I? And the answer is like, they just didn't think to file it or like

02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.000
they were too lazy to draft it or they went on vacation last week. So that's why they didn't.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:17.120
And I'm, you know, driving myself crazy going, there's some tactical read, there must be.

02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:26.160
So I think you have to look honestly and don't attribute to the other side, your constitution.

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:30.960
You know, if I said that, I'd be saying it sarcastically. If you said it, maybe you weren't

02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.600
saying it sarcastically. Like you have to think about the fact that we're unique human beings who

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:40.960
express themselves differently. And for you, the audience is usually the judge. Yeah, it's the

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.640
jury. No, we don't do jury trials. That's the interesting thing about family law attorneys.

02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.560
Family law attorneys don't do jury trials. We do bench trials. We just persuade there's a person

02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.400
in a black robe. That's the only person I have to convince. Does the person in the black robe,

02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:57.520
do they have emotions? Are they human or are they very? They are human. They are all too human.

02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:03.520
Do they impose that humanity on you? Like, do you feel it? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh no. Do you feel it?

02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:13.360
Like they're human. They're working their shit out. They're parents. They're husbands and wives.

02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:21.680
And you're talking about stuff they deal with. I had a woman on the stand, an expert witness

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:31.360
on the stand who was talking about the emotional and physical abuse that was perpetrated on a

02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:38.400
seven-year-old. And this person had written a bunch of reports that were in evidence in this

02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:44.720
trial. We're on day six or seven in the trial. And there's all of this information in the record

02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:50.800
about this verbal abuse and mental abuse and gaslighting and really intense stuff that this

02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.680
woman was doing to this seven-year-old. And the judge was vaguely paying attention for most of the

02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:02.480
time. And at some point the person says, well, when a parent is abusing a child and the judge

02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.480
just interrupts, she goes, well, look, you know, do you think like if a person spanks a child,

02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:12.880
that that's abuse? She's like, well, like a person in general, like, and by the way,

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:17.040
if my adversary asked that question, I could object, but I can't object when the judge asks

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:22.880
the question. They get to rule on that objection. So I'm like, where's this going? She's like, well,

02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.640
no, I mean, I mean, spanking can be a form of abuse. She's like, right. But like, you know,

02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:30.560
are you saying like everybody who spanks, and I'm sitting here going, what is going on in your house?

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:35.440
Yeah. What went on with your parents? Like, cause you're, you're, you're bringing some stuff here.

02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:41.600
That's not, this is not what you're supposed to be. This is not your role, you know, but there are

02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:49.120
good judges and bad judges. And, and that's a big, big deal. Well, I've noticed that I don't have

02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:55.600
kids. So I have a certain perspective on the world. I really want to have a family and have kids,

02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:03.120
but I've noticed when I talk to people that have kids and gender matters also, like fathers are

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:10.880
like with, uh, with daughters and so on, like it changes the landscape of the conversation.

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:16.960
It sure does. It's like, you're no longer this intellectual that's like, wow, there's this and

02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:27.040
there's this. It's, it's more like, like go fuck yourself. Anything that fucks with, uh, kids can,

02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:33.360
can like burn it to the ground. I don't care. I don't care what the nuance is of the little

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:39.040
intellectual thing. Oh, you want to learn about this. Represent someone is accused of child sexual

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:45.040
abuse. I've had about a dozen of those cases where I've represented someone who's alleged to

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:50.800
have perpetrated sexual abuse of a child. You are guilty until proven innocent. And let me tell you

02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:59.760
as a lawyer, that is the toughest cases because you put sex and kids together and everyone loses

02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:07.280
their goddamn mind immediately. There's a rush to judgment. There is a disregard for procedure.

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:14.160
There is a confirmation bias. There's a desire to be a protector. And again, all motivated and

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:19.680
informed by really good things. The desire to protect the innocent, the desire to protect

02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:26.880
the vulnerable. But, but gang, no, like we have these, I like living in a world that has due

02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:34.080
process. I like these rules. I like the rules of evidence. I like innocent until proven guilty.

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:40.160
I like that. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's such a, I'm so torn on it because

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:47.120
I also like living in a world where people are so emotionally invested in,

02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:53.280
in connection to other like, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. It shouldn't be.

02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:59.760
I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity.

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:05.280
I don't think you have to. I have to tell you, I once actually went off on a, on a DA,

02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:12.960
on a district attorney who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case that I was

02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:21.120
involved in. And I remember I, I, it was, I came in, thankfully I came in very early in the case.

02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:25.920
So the accusation was made and I came in right away because very often you get this case,

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:31.200
there've been 15 interviews. This person's been interviewed by police, by child protective services,

02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:35.600
and it's like they've already, they're already so far down a hole. They didn't even know they dug

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:41.600
themselves into, you know? So I got in very early on and I just kept saying, she's like, well,

02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:44.800
we're going to do this. We're going to do this. I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't,

02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:53.920
we should both want this to be fair done properly. Like there's an expert, a well-respected expert

02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.320
who's a clinical psychologist who their job is they're a validation expert. So their job is to

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:04.160
interview a child. They record the interviews with a hidden camera so that everyone can see

02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.600
they didn't have suggestive questioning. There are very stringent standards that they follow

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.120
to prevent like suggestive questioning or any of those kinds of things. And I was saying, listen,

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:21.920
no, no one should be interviewing this child other than this person who's a neutral qualified person.

02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:25.760
And I kept saying to the other side, like, wait, you know, you're, see, this is the problem. Like

02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:32.640
you want to win. You're a lawyer. You want to win. I want to win too. Right. But we want to win

02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:36.160
fair. Like that's like saying, you know, I'm going into a boxing match. I want to win. So if the

02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:40.320
referee is looking to the side, I'm going to kick the guy in the nuts. Like, okay, then you might have

02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:47.440
won, but you didn't win boxing. You won some other thing. You know, like I want to win a fair fight.

02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:54.400
Like I want to go in with the rules set, the law, the rules of evidence. I don't want a judge who

02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.320
doesn't understand evidence. I don't want an adversary who plays it fast and loose with the

02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:05.360
rules. I want to go in and win a fair fight. And that's where when it comes, our passion to protect

02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:11.440
the innocent, to emotionally connect, to feel deeply about children and protecting them.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:17.360
I don't think that that's antagonistic to, like, we always treat danger with decapitation in this

02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:23.200
culture and I don't understand it. And that's what I like about the law. The law, there's rules.

02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:30.160
And there's rules about procedure. And so that's our job is to bring out the truth using the rules

02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:36.720
and the procedure. And I love that job. But still there's a human being and the judge, right?

02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.680
That's the problem. It seems like a really hard job. Because you have to pay attention

02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:46.560
to the whole thing. You have to pay attention to the whole thing. And everyone is trying to persuade

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:53.520
you and lie to you. And everyone can keep their shit together in a court appearance most of the

02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.080
time. It takes a rare kind of crazy to blow up in a courtroom. So most of the time everybody looks

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:02.080
really put together and like, yeah, you got to have an amazing bullshit detector. I'm not saying

02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:05.440
they don't have a really hard job. They have a really hard job. They have a way harder job than

02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:11.840
I have. What's their source of ground truth? Like, how do they sharpen the radar for bullshit?

02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:16.720
I think that they're assessing credibility, which is what you call it in the law,

02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.600
is something that I think you're supposed to develop it on the job.

02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:25.600
Do you have the data of who was lying in the end or not?

02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:31.200
No, not really. Not really. I mean, you can try to demonstrate a lot. What I always tell clients,

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:41.600
and this is the art of advocacy, right, is I want to use examples of misrepresentations to show that

02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:48.480
this person's a liar. Like I'm trying to extrapolate from the small, the large. Like I'm

02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:55.040
trying to say, here's three times he lied, therefore he's a liar. When in fact, we know

02:51:55.040 --> 02:52:02.400
human beings don't really work that way. But I've seen people submarine, just torpedo their entire

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:11.200
case because they lied about some dumb shit, some dumb little thing. And I say to them, why did you

02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:18.400
lie about that? Like I had a case where a person was accused of child sexual abuse and on cross

02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:22.800
examination, they were asked, did you have an affair with this babysitter? And they're like,

02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:27.760
no, no, no, no, no. And then it was shown through text messages and things. They clearly had an

02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:32.480
affair with the babysitter. And I said, why did you lie? And they said, well, I didn't want that

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:39.120
to come out. And I said, right, but now you're a liar. Like, did you molest your child? Because if

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:44.960
the answer to that is no, and now you destroyed your credibility because you didn't want to

02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:49.760
admit that you slept with an adult woman. By the way, it would have been good for your case.

02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:53.440
It would have been good for your case for you to say, yeah, I slept with her because I like sleeping

02:52:53.440 --> 02:53:00.640
with adult women. That's how I am. I don't sleep with children, much less my own, you know? So why

02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:08.240
would you lie? And so that concept is incredibly important. And judges, theoretically, they have

02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:14.160
to make very tough calls. I feel like it's the most impotent place to just sit there and

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:19.440
dispassionately sort of listen and rule on objections. Like, I just would be so frustrated

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:24.560
because I'd want to get up and, you know, I had to do jury duty once. And it was like a

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:27.440
horrific experience for me because I'm sitting there and-

02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:28.320
You have no power.

02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:31.120
Yeah, I'm just watching these two lives. I'm like, why did you ask that question that way?

02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:34.240
I would never have asked it that way. Why would you object like that? When you object,

02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:37.840
you bring more attention to what are you doing? Like, I'm watching both of them. It's like

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:42.400
watching like a jiu-jitsu. But probably what it'd feel like for like John Donahue to watch

02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:46.800
two white belts spar. Like, why are you doing? Wow, my God, what are you doing? Why would you

02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:52.400
grab that? What are you thinking? Like, and, you know, it's frustrating. It's frustrating to watch.

02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:55.040
And as a judge, it must just be unbelievable.

02:53:56.480 --> 02:54:00.800
So divorce lawyers sometimes get a bad rap. Is there a reason for this?

02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:07.360
I mean, no one's ever happy to be spending time with a divorce lawyer.

02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:12.240
Like, if you have a criminal lawyer, they're defending you against the maelstrom of injustice

02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:17.600
and false allegations. They're protecting your freedom. And maybe you're acquitted and then

02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:22.640
you're like, oh, that person saved me, you know. You buy a house, you know, that lawyer helps you

02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:26.800
get the house. You know, you're happy about that. Sign the paperwork. You do a will. Like, you help

02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:33.280
them make you feel secure. Like, at best, I'm a representative of a chapter in someone's life that

02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:39.200
was very unpleasant. I have a friend who's a Juilliard-trained classical pianist, and he

02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:45.680
was having a humidification system installed in his home because his piano required a certain level

02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:52.000
of humidity. And it was very expensive to install this humidification system. And we went out to

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.840
dinner and then we came back to his place and he said, man, this is the most depressing

02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:01.520
$15,000 I've ever spent. And I said, why? And he said, because there's nothing different.

02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:07.920
Like, I spent $15,000 and I feel absolutely nothing different. My piano does, but I don't.

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:10.960
Like, I don't have anything to show for it. Like, you finish getting divorced,

02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:16.960
you don't really have anything to show for it. Yeah. You know? At best, it's the same.

02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:20.960
It's one of the things I think that's interesting about divorce is in our increasingly performative

02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:27.760
society, you can't pretend you meant to get divorced. You can't. Like, everything everybody

02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:31.040
does. Like, well, I wrote that album for me. It didn't matter that it was not going to be

02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:35.440
popular. No, you wanted that album to be popular. Like, come on. Like, you're lying. And that's

02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:39.600
fine, but you're lying. Oh, I think my haircut came out great. I wanted it to look this fucked

02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:43.920
up. No, you didn't. You didn't. You're lying. And that's fine because we live in a society now

02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:49.280
where everybody's just, oh, yes, I meant to do that. Okay. Divorce? Nope. You got married.

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:54.480
You break up in a relationship, not a marriage. Okay. Well, we were only going to be together

02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:57.520
for a little while. It was never serious. We were just like, you know, we were having fun.

02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.840
That's all it was. It wasn't. We were never going to be happily ever after. No, you got married.

02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:09.920
You got married, guys. You got up there and you said forever. And it didn't go forever. So you

02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.040
can't bullshit anybody anymore. Like, no, it didn't go the way you thought it was going to go. It

02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:22.400
didn't go the way you signed on for. So now that that's undeniable, like, what can we make it?

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.520
What can we make it into? Like, it can be beautiful. The barn's burned down. Now I can

02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:30.800
see the moon. You know, like, let's make it something. And so for me, I think people look

02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.960
at a divorce lawyer and they just go, yeah, like, this is this horrible chapter and I associate you

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:44.000
with it. Also too, listen, some of the things we do, it's difficult to simultaneously prevent

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:51.520
and prepare for war. Yeah. The things you do to protect your clients sometimes look like acts of

02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:58.400
aggression, but really they're just trying to shore up a defense. And so I get paid to be

02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:02.400
paranoid and I have to say to clients sometimes like, well, are you sure that they're not doing

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:06.400
this? And then they go, well, I don't know. And I go, well, let me inquire. Did she accuse me of

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:11.280
that? No, no, I'm not accusing you. I'm just trying. Like, we get a reputation, divorce lawyers,

02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:17.360
as amping up a conflict because we get paid for the conflict, right? It's like, if you get paid

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:24.240
by the bullet, you're going to start a lot of gunfights, right? It doesn't really work that way

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:30.160
with most good divorce lawyers. Like, there are plenty of people that are bad lawyers and they

02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:36.240
stoke up conflict because it jacks up fees. They usually don't do well. They don't build a successful

02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:41.840
career because you live and die by your reputation. Yes, reputation is everything. But good lawyers,

02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:49.760
good experienced divorce lawyers, we do the whole, you know, hey, listen, you're going to say this,

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:53.520
I'm going to say this, you're going to do this, I'm going to do this. Let's skip it. We're going

02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:56.800
to end up here. You know, we got Judge Bluff of law and you know what he's going to do. He's going

02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:00.400
to go right here. So why don't we just agree right now to X, Y, Z? Sounds good. We're done. We're

02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:04.800
good. So you want to minimize the number of bullets. It's like the two, it's like Moyamata

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:10.080
Mashashi. It's like the two swordsmen who see each other and they just stand there at the edge

02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:14.640
and they see the whole fight in their minds and they know who won and who lost and they walk away.

02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:20.400
Like it's, we do a lot of that. We do a lot of, okay. You know, it's like when you watch high

02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:26.400
level chess and someone resigns and you go, wait, what happened? He didn't wait. And you go, no, no,

02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:33.280
the other guy won. It's 15 moves from now, but he won and the other guy sees it. So now we're done.

02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:41.680
Can you speak to some recent high profile divorces? Like the most recent I saw is Kevin

02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:45.920
Kozner. Yeah, Kevin Kozner is a great, I mean, I don't know him. I'm not involved in the case.

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:49.440
By the way, Yellowstone is just so great. Oh, it's so good. And I hope Matthew McConaughey,

02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:55.760
who I've gotten to know, I hope he does one of these shows. Yellowstone or anything else,

02:58:55.760 --> 02:59:00.480
he's just born for the role, frankly. But anyway. He'd be amazing in that. Yeah. Your conversation

02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:05.600
with him was great. The Kevin Kozner divorce is interesting because Kevin Kozner had one of the

02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:12.960
most expensive from a distributive award perspective. Like he gave a huge payout to his first wife.

02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:20.800
And then this time he had a prenup. So it's actually, it's a very public showing of the

02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:27.680
fact that once bitten, twice shy. Like he had a very public divorce that cost him a lot of assets

02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:33.360
in terms of the division of assets. And now it appears by all acknowledged reports that he had

02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:42.240
a prenuptial agreement that was well-crafted and enforceable. And the argument now is over

02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:46.960
what is child support, what is spousal support, what's covered in the prenup and what isn't.

02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:51.360
So it seems like the prenup worked actually. The prenup worked. And Kevin Kozner's career,

02:59:51.440 --> 02:59:59.120
which has always been a steady career. I don't know that in the Hollywood stock market,

02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:04.320
that people would have bet on Yellowstone. I think you would have said, hey, the best years

03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:10.080
of that guy's career are behind him. How do you get better than dances with wolves and Robin Hood

03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:16.080
and all these big, big, the bodyguard and then Yellowstone. And it's like, holy cow,

03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:19.760
did he knock that out of the park? And he's central to it. I mean, he knocked the skin off

03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:24.880
the ball. So I think that's why prenups are important. You don't know what your career is

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:29.440
going to do. You don't know where it's going to go. And so he saved himself a lot of money.

03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:36.640
He also has a great lawyer. He has Laura Wasser. Laura Wasser is LA, just a top professional,

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:43.920
brilliant lawyer, even-tempered, but intense in the courtroom and just a smart, smart human being.

03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:50.160
The thing I liked just, you know, I haven't been following it, but I saw a few comments he's made

03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:58.560
and he refused to comment negatively about his spouse. But the way he said it, it wasn't

03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:05.760
lawyer advice. It's good lawyer advice probably. But he said it from the heart, which I always like,

03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:12.400
I like seeing that. Where he refuses even the drama, even the public nature of it

03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:19.680
to throwing jazz. Well, Laura, his lawyer is actually notorious for like not speaking to

03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:24.400
the press about cases in an extended way. And that's smart move. Like I don't speak about

03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:29.680
pending cases I'm involved in publicly and I discourage my clients from doing so. I can't

03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:35.360
always stop them, but I discourage them from doing so. I don't think there's any good to come of it.

03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:38.480
There are lawyers who try things in the court of public opinion.

03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:45.760
I think there is a, to take it to the broader principle you just brought up, I think there is

03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:53.840
a lot of value in talking about your ex in a favorable way. I have to say, when I first got

03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:58.640
divorced many years ago, I went on a date with a young woman. It was one of my first dates as a

03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:05.920
divorced man. And she was a divorced woman. And she's a beautiful woman. And we were having dinner

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.120
and it was going quite well. And it was one of those things where I was like, Oh, I definitely

03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:13.280
want to see this girl again. And I said something about, Oh, you know, there's going to be this

03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:16.320
thing at this museum. We should go. And she's like, Oh yeah, that'd be a lot of fun. And I'm like,

03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:20.000
yeah, we should definitely, you know, maybe the next thing we do together. And she was like,

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.240
yeah, we should go next weekend. Like the kids are with the asshole so we can go. And I just,

03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:29.840
it was like, you could hear that record scratch, like, you know, I just went, Oh yeah, no, this

03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:34.960
isn't good. Like I'm not, you're referring to the father of your kids as the asshole. Like we're,

03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:38.320
like we're already, I'm walking into something here that I don't know that I want to be involved

03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:45.200
in. Matthew McConaughey, before he was married, you know, if you look at his history, he dated

03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:56.240
some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood in their prime. And none of them ever talked bad

03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:01.920
about him in the press. They all were like, Oh my God, he's such a great guy. Such great. And I

03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:09.440
always wondered like, how do you, he got out of all of those relationships without a scratch on

03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:15.840
him. And when you'd watch an interview with him, they would say like, so you, you know, you dated

03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:23.440
Penelope Cruz and he go, Penelope, that's just, that's just a special lady. It's just a, what a,

03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:28.960
what a special lady. She just a wonderful, what a wonderful woman. I was just so blessed to have

03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:33.120
the time with her. What a beautiful, wonderful woman. And I would think to myself, I'm like,

03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:40.240
you're a genius. Like he's a genius because like it, he never came off as petty, spiteful, bitter,

03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:47.600
any of that. He just came off as like, just dignified, strong, smart, self-assured. And like

03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:54.560
it left, you know, it left like, it left the viewer with the impression that like when he was

03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:58.480
looking off and specifically, he's probably like just thinking about some wonderful time he had

03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:03.440
with her. And you think to yourself like, God, that guy, like he just became cooler and cooler.

03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:09.040
Whereas if he got into like the whole, you know, oh yeah, that was ugly. And then, you know,

03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:12.880
this happened and that like, nobody wants to hear it. It's awful. The funny thing about him just

03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:18.400
having interacted with him a bunch. I don't think he's in the, he's in the Rogan school of thought.

03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:24.960
I think that I don't see him ever having a fight. Now his parents were, as he, as he's spoken about

03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:31.520
a bunch nonstop fighting, they got divorced and remarried and just insane. And they were volatile.

03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:37.760
Yeah, very. He seems maybe you kind of, it's a pendulum swinging the other way. He just seems

03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:44.400
cool as a cucumber, like always. Just lets it roll off. But you know, even if it's internally,

03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:53.440
yeah, not rolling off, there is value in just rising above it in your discourse.

03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:59.760
That's true. Yes. Like, like you lie to your children. Like people say this to me all the

03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:05.040
time, clients, they're like, you know, why did you tell your child that dad had an affair? Well,

03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:10.400
I'm not going to lie to my kids. Fuck you. Yes, you are. You lie to your kids all the time.

03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:14.800
Mommy, are you going to die someday? Yes, babe. I'm going to die and daddy's going to die. And

03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:18.400
then someday the earth's going to hurl into the sun and we're all going to die. Sweet dreams.

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:22.720
Like that's not, you lie to your kids all the time. You know, what's wrong with me? We don't

03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:25.600
know what's wrong with you. We're going to take you to the doctor and hopefully it's nothing serious

03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:29.680
and you won't die. Like you lie to your kids all the time. You tell them that Santa Claus exists

03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:35.360
when he does, whatever. So, so to say, I'm not going to lie to my kids. Like you lie to your kids

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:39.840
all the time. You don't like your husband. That's okay. You don't like your ex-husband, but it's

03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:44.720
their father. So just grin, you know, Oh, daddy took me to meet his new girlfriend, Kiki. Oh,

03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:48.000
that's nice. Did you guys have a good time? Good. Oh, that's yeah. And she helped me do my hair and

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:54.480
she did my makeup. Listen, I'm sure that's burning you inside. But you go, Oh, that's great. Cause

03:05:54.480 --> 03:06:00.080
why you love your kids. Well, that's what I mean. Again, McConaughey has a, as a way bottom with

03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:07.200
that. He's like, he basically says never lie, but a little bullshit is okay. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean,

03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:14.560
I'm very, uh, Tom Waits has that song lie to me. Uh, you got to lie to me, baby. Uh, I, you know,

03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:18.880
honesty is a funny thing, but Tom Waits also believes that God's a way on business. So I think

03:06:18.880 --> 03:06:25.440
his words, man, and who do we, who are the ones that we left in charge killers, thieves, and lawyers.

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:30.880
That's a Tom Waits quote. Well, it must be true then. Yeah. Um, I don't know how many, I don't

03:06:30.880 --> 03:06:37.440
know how many limbs I have, but I will give all of them to talk to Tom. And he's a very private

03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:42.320
person. I feel like he's the musical equivalent of Cormac McCarthy. Yeah. Even if you get the

03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:46.400
interview, you're not, I don't think going to get in there. No, I don't think you want like, uh,

03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:52.400
honestly, I don't think you want to. I think I've seen his public interviews over the years with

03:06:52.400 --> 03:07:02.240
Letterman and I think he just, he is the poetry. I would put Tom Waits, um, Cormac McCarthy,

03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:11.040
Maynard James Keenan, like these, these are artists that like, I think they want the art to speak for

03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:19.360
itself. They would like to be lessened. They don't want you to. And I remember early, early days of

03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:27.360
tool that he like this, he could not have been less interested in the spotlight to the point

03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:32.800
where I think it was almost to the detriment of the band early on, you know, and that's,

03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:39.120
there's no surprise that those are three artists that I think are unbelievable and in a category

03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:46.400
of their own and that you hear their performance. Like you can give me a page of a Cormac McCarthy

03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:51.600
novel and I'll know it's a Cormac McCarthy novel. You can, a few notes of Maynard James Keenan or

03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:57.440
Tom Waits voice, you know that that's them. Yeah. It's genius genius highs from the spotlight,

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:02.320
but you know, it doesn't stop me from feeling sad about it. But anyway, yeah, that does,

03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:07.200
I would like to hear that interview. She's the girl that got away. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just standing

03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:12.480
outside of that girl's house. You just with the sign. Yeah. Just playing in your eyes with Peter

03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:19.280
Gabriel. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, what does it lie to me? This, this whole idea of honesty in

03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:26.080
relationships is interesting. I mean, clerks with a blow jobs. Yeah. I, I don't know how to phrase it

03:08:26.080 --> 03:08:34.000
eloquently, but like there's stuff you should be honest about and there's stuff maybe you don't

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:41.920
need to be honest about. So in the law, it is illegal to commit fraud. Fraud is a material

03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:48.960
misrepresentation of fact, but the law specifically says you're permitted to engage in quote,

03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:56.000
mere puffery. Nice. Puffery. Puffery. So, and that's the, that's the term that was used for it.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:02.720
Puffery and puffery is when you are inflating something, you're being like hyperbolic,

03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:08.800
but, but people wouldn't necessarily think you're telling the truth, you know, like that it, it's

03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:15.920
not, you know, like if I say to you, this bottle of water, you know, was held by Elvis and that's

03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:20.560
why you should pay me $50 for it. That's fraud. But if I say, this is the water that has been,

03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:25.600
it's, this water is drank by the finest people. Presidents drink this water. This is a,

03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:31.600
now this is puffery, you know? And so I, I, I advertising marketing is based on puffery.

03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:35.840
It's not fraud. When it's fraud, it crosses the line. So I think there's a difference between

03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:46.400
honesty and candor, right? So, so in relationships, being honest is good. Being totally candid is

03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:54.080
probably not a great idea. Like it's indelicate to be totally candid about some things. If a woman

03:09:54.080 --> 03:10:00.880
you're in a romantic relationship with says to you, do I look good in this dress? And they don't.

03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:06.800
Mm hmm. You, or do I look fat in this? That's a, that's a better way. Any heterosexual man

03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:10.240
who's ever been in a relationship has had that question asked of him. Do I look fat in this?

03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:14.080
Does this make my butt look big? Or does, whatever, does this, do I look fat in this?

03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:20.800
If you go, yes, that's indelicate. It's honest, but it's indelicate and it's almost mean,

03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:26.960
right? But there's, and if you say no, but it's true. She doesn't look good in that. Like the

03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:36.240
concern she sees is a legitimate concern. Do you lie and go, no, no, you look great in that. It's

03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:45.040
great. That's not a good thing either. So what do you say? You know, that blue dress you have

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:50.560
really compliments your body. Like in a way that one doesn't, you know, that the cut of that dress

03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:56.160
is such that it doesn't flatter you. I see what you're saying. Now, now it's the dress. It's not

03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:01.760
you, babe, you know, but I'm telling you the truth. Like I'm addressing your concern. Like this is

03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:08.640
what, this is the distinction. Like don't, don't material, misrepresent the facts. Like don't

03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:13.040
steer people down roads that they're, you know, you know, that that's not how it's going to go.

03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:17.440
Right. But, you know, so it's like, if the woman says I love you and you don't love her,

03:11:17.440 --> 03:11:21.840
don't say I love you back. You know, you do the like, oh, you know, I have very strong feelings

03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:26.000
for you as well. Or, you know, like there has to be some middle ground. You don't just pretend

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:31.200
you didn't hear them. Yeah. I mean, the, uh, I guess all of it requires skill, just like you

03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:37.840
described it. I think just being honest in quotes is not enough. Well, it's not a specific enough

03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:42.880
instruction. I mean, that's the problem is when you write a relationship book, which I never intended

03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:50.560
to do, people come to you and say, you know, like, what are some, you know, what are the things I

03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:55.040
should do to help my relationship or what is the cause of divorce? And you go, well, disconnection,

03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:59.680
but like, what do you mean by that? Or like, how do I improve my relationship? Pay more attention,

03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:05.920
make small gestures. Okay. What does that even mean? Like, what do you mean? Like acts of love,

03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:09.920
you should show your partner that you love them more often. What do you mean? Like what I say,

03:12:09.920 --> 03:12:14.080
what I do, we should have more sex. Like, what are you at? What are you saying? Like people want

03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:19.760
measurable specific things. So that's why I tried in my book to be like very specific about like

03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:25.680
things you can do, things you shouldn't do, you know, and, and they're practical suggestions,

03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:31.040
like, like, like leaving a note. I talk a lot about leaving a note. Like if you're dating someone,

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.440
or you're living with them, or you're in a serious relationship, send a text, leave a note,

03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:40.080
just little every day, just some little thing that just tells them how much you like them.

03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:46.480
Like this is a low cost, high value move, doesn't take much. And it's a practical thing. But, but,

03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:51.440
but we speak in these sort of like broader axioms, these broader concepts that people

03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:56.560
just don't have any idea how to practically apply. I can't wait to listen to the audio book

03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:04.240
where you talk about managing marital finances as like anal sex, which your, your, your mastery of

03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:11.040
the metaphor touches one's heart and soul. You're Shakespeare of the 21st century, really. I don't

03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:15.360
know that Shakespeare would have brought anal up in that context, but I appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah.

03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:22.960
My thesis there, or my point there was, you know, proceed carefully and have discussion

03:13:22.960 --> 03:13:28.800
in advance. Yes. And don't just spring it on someone. Sure. And realize that this,

03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:35.680
if this goes wrong, it will go catastrophically wrong. So good communication is important.

03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:42.480
And, you know, yeah, I, I don't think it's something you should just dive into unless

03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:46.400
you're prepared for that to have potentially a very negative impact.

03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:52.240
And, you know, finances is one of the sources of a huge amount of stress in relationships,

03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:58.480
which is tremendous. Because it's, it's about value, I think. I mean, it's aside from

03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:05.360
having painful conversations about what you tried to do and were able to do,

03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:09.200
or what your impulse control was in terms of what you spent money on. Like there's,

03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:12.720
you know, there's the conversation and then there's what's underneath the conversation.

03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:16.320
You know, there's gender stuff about men feeling the need to be a provider.

03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:22.720
There's gender stuff of, of, of men or women thinking material goods will fill the void

03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:29.440
and buying things and then creating stress on their partner. There's the very human desire

03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:34.640
to make things seem effortless. So your spouse doesn't feel any stress when in fact it's causing

03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:39.760
tremendous financial stress and then when the dam breaks, it breaks hard. So yeah, there's a lot.

03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:46.960
Finance is tricky stuff and, and you could probably be wonderful romantic and sexual partners

03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:53.600
and have very different styles of, of how you handle your finances. And how you handle your

03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:59.760
finances is informed by, you know, not only your individual psychology, but also how you were raised

03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:04.640
and, you know, how your family taught you about finance and how you should conduct your finances.

03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:09.040
So, and there's interesting power dynamics and play tremendously. Yeah. And those are,

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:18.000
those are very tricky because the standard of living of a couple becomes important in a divorce,

03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:24.480
but sometimes the toxic standard of living that created toxic levels of stress

03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:31.200
is one of the causes of the divorce. And so you're asked, they're asking the court

03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:39.440
to maintain a financial obligation on you. That is the reason why the marriage fell apart.

03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:44.320
And that feels like a particularly insulting form of, of indignity.

03:15:45.840 --> 03:15:50.240
Well, you're a fascinating human being on many levels, but you're also exceptionally

03:15:50.240 --> 03:15:55.520
productive. And you've talked to me about waking up early for you. We've met today at 11 a.m.

03:15:56.240 --> 03:16:02.240
and for you, that's what late, late afternoon, I suppose we had to negotiate and come to an

03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:07.040
agreement because I went to bed at 4 a.m. And I was up at, I get up at four every day.

03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:11.520
You woke up at four a.m. Well, I woke, it's three o'clock local time. So I woke up at three local

03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:17.200
time. Nice. Yeah. I wake up at four naturally. Then my body just wakes up and wakes up full on

03:16:17.200 --> 03:16:23.600
this speed. Wow. Like, like my most productive writing and speaking is from four a.m. until

03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:31.360
noon or one. So can you take me through a productive, like a perfectly productive day?

03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:37.760
I wake up at four a.m. very naturally. I wish I didn't, but I do check my phone first thing,

03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:42.560
because I want to see if any emergencies came in from a client overnight. So work emergencies.

03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:45.200
Yeah, work related emergencies. It is a divorce lawyer.

03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:54.000
Our definition of emergency can be very serious. It's people absconding with a child. It's a

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:58.080
police being involved in a domestic violence. And so they can be like time sensitive things.

03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:03.440
And when someone is hiring a divorce lawyer, I think they're hiring, they want someone responsive.

03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:09.600
My clients have my cell phone number and I go to bed early because I get up early. And so I go to

03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:14.720
sleep by eight p.m. latest. I don't think I've seen nine p.m. even on New Year's Eve.

03:17:15.920 --> 03:17:21.120
So I wake up at four. I check my phone, check my email. Usually even if there's something that's,

03:17:21.120 --> 03:17:24.640
you know, time sensitive, it's usually not so time sensitive that it needs to be responded to

03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:30.240
at four a.m. because most other normal people are asleep. I have espresso, black espresso,

03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:37.520
which I enjoy very much. And then I work out. And that someday is going to be weights. A lot of days,

03:17:37.520 --> 03:17:41.840
it's just going to be cardio. I've changed my habits now that I'm in my early fifties.

03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:46.160
It used to be much more intensive weight training and deadlifts and stuff like that. And then I

03:17:46.160 --> 03:17:53.200
herniated my L5S1. So 485 was my max deadlift. And now I don't hardly do deadlifts.

03:17:53.200 --> 03:17:55.840
Well, you can still relive the past glory.

03:17:55.840 --> 03:17:57.520
I do. I still have some pictures of videos.

03:17:57.520 --> 03:17:58.080
You have pictures.

03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:00.400
I have videos. I have videos of me putting 485 for three.

03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:04.240
But you can, in stories, when you talk about it, you can exaggerate how much you've actually

03:18:04.240 --> 03:18:04.560
lifted.

03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:09.120
That's true. But then you can't pack it up. See, I'm very evidence-based. So if I don't have a

03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:16.240
photo or video of it, it's just puffing, mere puffery at that point. But I work out. And then

03:18:16.240 --> 03:18:22.240
I try to work out for like a good hour. And I do that partly because of stress. I think when I don't

03:18:22.880 --> 03:18:28.240
work out, it's difficult. I had a group of guys that I would do jiu-jitsu with at five a.m. They

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:32.960
were mostly law enforcement. They were cops who would either be starting a shift or coming off

03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:37.520
of a night shift. And we would train together, just do like an open mat. And it was at five a.m.

03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:41.520
till six. And that was heaven. I love training jiu-jitsu first thing in the morning, if I can.

03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:47.520
And then I always do either a sauna or steam for 20 minutes, half an hour. And then I do a cold

03:18:47.520 --> 03:18:53.680
plunge. Or if I don't have access to a cold plunge, a cold shower. And then I have breakfast.

03:18:54.400 --> 03:18:59.360
And it's usually a very uncontroversial, simple breakfast. I like to eat, you know,

03:18:59.840 --> 03:19:06.640
slow carb, Tim Ferriss type style. And then I get right to work. I try to do my drafting early in

03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:13.360
the day, prenups, motions, things like that. From, you know, let's say six or seven until

03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:19.920
nine, nine thirty, which is when court begins. So drafting is like writing up different documents?

03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:24.560
Right. Writing prenups, writing separation agreements, writing settlement proposals,

03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:28.960
writing motions for the court, pretrial memos, which is like research that I want to present

03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:34.320
to a judge that supports my arguments. I do drafting. I review documents that the attorneys

03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:40.720
who work for me have drafted and refine them. And then court is usually from nine o'clock until noon.

03:19:40.720 --> 03:19:46.320
And if we're on trial, then it's a whole different pace because trials, the lunch break isn't really

03:19:46.320 --> 03:19:50.080
a lunch break. You're preparing the afternoon's witnesses and you're trying to do damage control

03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:55.280
on what happened in the morning. But if it's just court conferences, like most cases,

03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:58.880
there's conferences. Conferences is you go in, you make oral argument, but you don't have

03:19:58.880 --> 03:20:02.240
witnesses on the stand. You're not taking testimony. It's like everybody's just shouting

03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:08.480
allegations back and forth and making temporary arguments pretrial. It's kind of the foreplay of

03:20:08.480 --> 03:20:13.600
the trial. Is that exhausting, by the way? It's exhausting when you're done with it.

03:20:14.240 --> 03:20:20.080
Like while you're doing it, it's exhilarating. I always say that I never sleep as poorly as

03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:24.880
the night before a trial and I never sleep as well as the night I finished a trial.

03:20:24.880 --> 03:20:34.080
Because when I am on trial, I am speaking, listening, watching the judge closely to see

03:20:34.080 --> 03:20:37.920
what they're reacting to and when they're paying attention or not paying attention,

03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:43.600
watching opposing counsel and the opposing party. When is the opposing party writing a little note

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:48.160
to their lawyer to show it to them? What is the opposing counsel objecting to? My client is trying

03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:53.600
to pass me notes half the time while I'm speaking and making my arguments. I'm trying to adjust what

03:20:53.600 --> 03:21:00.640
I'm doing strategically based on the objections that the judge is ruling on. I'm so hyper stimulated

03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:07.280
on trial that when you finish, you can't even talk. You're gone. Your brain is jello.

03:21:07.280 --> 03:21:10.560
Conferences is harder because at least with a trial, there's a singularity of focus.

03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:16.480
With a trial, it's just one case and they have all my attention. The problem is then on the

03:21:16.480 --> 03:21:21.520
lunch break, all the other cases that I've been ignoring for the last several hours while I was

03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:27.200
on trial, they all have stuff going on. It's like, hey, where's that settlement proposal on this? Hey,

03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:32.960
she just did this. We need to file a motion. Now it's like, okay, I have an hour to eat and to answer

03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:36.480
all of this in some preliminary way to delegate some responsibilities. Then I got to go back in

03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:42.800
and put 100% of my focus on this other case again. That's why I'm very disciplined is you

03:21:42.800 --> 03:21:48.320
find yourself in a place where I live my whole life in six minute increments,

03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:53.520
tenths of an hour because we bill in tenths of an hour. Everything I do, it's like 0.2,

03:21:53.520 --> 03:22:00.400
0.4, 0.6 and I'm logging time throughout the day. You find yourself at the end of the day.

03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:08.800
My son is a lawyer, my older son. He's a district attorney. I'm very proud of him. He gets to put

03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:18.720
bad guys in jail and he's very smart. He's doing a great job about a year ago. When he graduated

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:26.240
from law school, we were very close and we were talking and he said, we were just talking about

03:22:26.240 --> 03:22:31.040
the career and the law that he was about to embark on. I said to him, you know the feeling

03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:37.680
at the end of the day when all your homework or all your work is done and you just go,

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:44.000
it's all done now and I'm going to go home, you'll never have that feeling ever again.

03:22:45.760 --> 03:22:52.880
Ever. You're just going to every day go, all right, it's enough. It's enough. I got to get

03:22:52.880 --> 03:23:00.800
out of here because you could with every one of these cases, you could stay up 24 hours focusing

03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:07.360
just on it. You have to have the discipline to go, yeah, no, that's it. I'm done for now. I've done

03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:12.560
what I could do today and now I'm going to sit and read for a half an hour. I'm going to watch

03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:19.040
this show for a half an hour. I'm going to have this meal because it's never done. So that's

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:25.600
challenging. That's a hard part of this job but I think my discipline helps with that and then,

03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:34.880
like I said, I finish my day around 5, 30, 6 o'clock and I have something to eat and I try

03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:40.960
to wind down a little and I'm usually in bed by 7.30 and I sleep by 8. You mentioned jiu-jitsu.

03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:45.680
You're a brown belt. What role has jiu-jitsu played in your life?

03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:51.760
I love jiu-jitsu. I trained martial arts from the time I was a little kid. I think I was seven or

03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:58.000
eight. I took up Okinawan Goju karate and I did judo and it was always part of my life and then

03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:01.920
I got to college and grad school and I didn't have time for it and I didn't do it so much.

03:24:02.640 --> 03:24:06.640
Then I got divorced. I was quite young still when I got divorced and I had two young kids

03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:13.360
and I thought, well, I can grow a goatee and buy a convertible and do the thing you're supposed

03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:20.160
to do when you're a dude with kids close to middle age or I can try to do something more productive.

03:24:21.040 --> 03:24:26.720
So I said, well, maybe I'll go back to martial arts. So I took up Muay Thai kickboxing and they

03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:33.840
had a jiu-jitsu class at the same school after the Muay Thai class and I had been around the

03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:39.280
orbit of jiu-jitsu having been my kids took karate and there was jiu-jitsu there. It was a Gracie

03:24:39.280 --> 03:24:50.480
academy and I stayed for a jiu-jitsu class and I had a 120-pound girl rag doll me because I just

03:24:50.480 --> 03:24:54.480
knew nothing about grappling and I remember just going, well, I got to learn what this is

03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:00.800
and that was it. I just dove into it. My first professor was Lou Ventolaro in New Jersey. He's

03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:06.000
a Hoyler Gracie black belt, great teacher, taught me amazing fundamentals, took me all the way up

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:10.400
to purple belt and then right after I got my purple belt, I moved to the city. I moved to

03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:15.600
Manhattan. I actually chose my apartment based on its proximity to Marcello Garcia

03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:23.520
and I moved to West Chelsea because it was a short walk to Marcello's academy. My core

03:25:23.520 --> 03:25:30.000
jiu-jitsu was up to purple belt. It was Lou Ventolaro and then it's been Marcello. Marcello,

03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:35.120
Paul Schreiner, who's really phenomenal at his academy and all the people at his academy are all

03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:40.480
phenomenal. Bernardo Fajardo was there for a period of time that I was there and before he

03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:47.440
went to Boston. Marcos Tanaka was like his lasso guard stuff. He was at Marcello's for a long time

03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:54.400
and what a teacher. I mean, my lack of skill at jiu-jitsu is not based on a lack of quality

03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:59.760
instruction. It's based on an inability to retain the information for very long.

03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:05.440
For me, that's one of the most reliable places I can go to humble myself.

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:13.840
I love jiu-jitsu. I love the progressive humility that it drives home constantly.

03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:19.920
I love the impossibility of perfecting it, although Gordon Ryan's probably come close

03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:24.880
and Marcello's probably come close to perfecting it. Let me ask you, since you mentioned Gordon

03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:32.400
Ryan, so apparently some close with Gordon and there's, I'm sure you know in Austin,

03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:37.280
just this jiu-jitsu scene that's incredible. It's like jiu-jitsu Mecca. I'm actually seeing

03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:44.880
John Donahue this evening. I mean, yeah, this is like a truly special place. But anyway,

03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:54.000
apparently long ago, you mentioned Jersey. There's a bit of a conflict between you and Gordon and

03:26:54.000 --> 03:27:00.960
you mentioned to me offline that you love him and just how much respect you have for him as

03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:06.400
an athlete and so on. Can you explain why is this? Yeah, I'm actually glad I have that. It's funny

03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:09.680
that you bring it up and of all the, you know, we're talking about all these heavy topics and

03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:16.560
this is probably the one that I find most, the most actually emotional. But, you know, Gordon's

03:27:16.560 --> 03:27:21.920
very, I think a very young man still. He's like probably in his 20s or early 30s and it's hard

03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:26.240
to imagine that because he's accomplished so much as an athlete and as a business person.

03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:32.240
But there was a time, you know, not that long ago, I think it was eight or nine years ago,

03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:38.400
where he was just a young guy on his way up. He's only, I think, a couple of years older than

03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:44.880
my oldest son. And I, through a series of circumstances, Jiu-Jitsu wasn't, you know,

03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:50.000
it's really exploded in the last 10 years, but there were not as many people sponsoring,

03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:54.160
quote unquote, superfights. There really weren't like Jiu-Jitsu superfights being sponsored,

03:27:54.160 --> 03:28:00.160
even Jersey and New York in particular. And I got involved in sponsoring some Jiu-Jitsu superfights.

03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:07.840
And I also got involved in sponsoring some Jiu-Jitsu athletes. And Gordon was a young

03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:14.080
part of the Donna Herd Death Squad. I was friends with Eddie Cummings. I'm still friends with Eddie.

03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:18.480
I was friends with John. I'm still friends with John. But I didn't really know Gordon.

03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:21.680
I actually don't know that I've still ever met. I don't think I've ever met Gordon.

03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:28.560
I've been in the same room as him. But there was a fight that I had sponsored some other fights with

03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:34.880
this particular promoter. And they asked me to sponsor one. And it didn't involve anyone

03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:40.320
from Marcellos. But it involved Gordon. He was one of the people. And I liked John very much.

03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:43.840
And I liked everybody in the Donna Herd Death Squad. I like watching them compete. And I thought,

03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:48.240
you know, I think John's just brilliant. I mean, everyone at Marcellos has such respect for John

03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:52.480
and for everyone. And the stuff they were doing, like when they were the early days of that Donna

03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:56.720
Herd Death Squad, like the Eddie Cummings, like his leg locks, like he just blew the whole game

03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:03.040
up. Like it just was a whole other thing, you know. It was like insane what they did, such innovation.

03:29:04.240 --> 03:29:14.880
And Gordon, at the time, he was online. And I'm much older than that, you know. I'm in

03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:18.800
my early 50s. And that's not, I guess, chronologically that much older. But generationally,

03:29:18.800 --> 03:29:26.560
I think it's quite a bit different. And Gordon was smack talking about a guy who I was

03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:31.360
sponsor of, who I knew. And who I knew was a very good athlete and had been through difficult things

03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:38.960
in his life. And Gordon just, you know, said some like nasty things about him. You know, it falls

03:29:38.960 --> 03:29:42.560
into the category of totally appropriate smack talking, looking at it now. And looking at what

03:29:42.560 --> 03:29:47.920
Gordon became, you know, which is he's someone who talks trash, you know. It's like part of his brand

03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:52.800
is to talk trash. And I see now that that's like a Muhammad Ali thing. At the time, I just didn't see

03:29:52.800 --> 03:30:00.960
it as what it was. And although it doesn't excuse it, my mother was dying. I was not at my best. I

03:30:00.960 --> 03:30:10.000
was having a hard time. And Gordon had spoken ill of this person. And I got upset. And I reached out

03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:14.800
to John and to Tom de Blas. And I said to them, hey, like, can you tell this guy to knock it off?

03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:19.680
Like, don't talk about this person who I sponsor if I'm sponsoring his fight. I don't even know

03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:26.240
this Gordon Ryan kid. And I'm sponsoring his fight. And like, he should say thank you. Don't

03:30:26.240 --> 03:30:32.000
talk bad about a person who I financially sponsor. Like, that's not cool. And I think on Facebook,

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:39.120
he like wrote some comments. And then I wrote some comments back. And I was incredibly obnoxious.

03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:48.080
And very soon after, I felt really gross. Because I was an adult. And I was talking to a young person

03:30:48.080 --> 03:30:54.000
this way, who's on their way up, who's a little older than one of my kids. And I just said these

03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:03.840
obnoxious things to him. And I felt really like, that's gross. But I never really thought much

03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:09.920
about it again. I watched his star rise. And I was very, I mean, who is not impressed by Gordon

03:31:09.920 --> 03:31:15.600
Ryan? And everyone at our academy was always very thrilled to see him rise. And I've stayed

03:31:15.600 --> 03:31:19.200
friends with John. And every time Gordon would have a big victory, I would always text John and

03:31:19.200 --> 03:31:23.760
be like, because Gordon's victories are John's victories, too. They have such a great bond.

03:31:24.320 --> 03:31:27.360
All the people in his orbit are all people that I respect and like.

03:31:28.400 --> 03:31:32.240
And I just would say, hey, listen, congratulations. And please pass on my congratulations to Gordon.

03:31:33.520 --> 03:31:36.960
But we don't know each other. I don't have his number. I have no way to contact him to

03:31:36.960 --> 03:31:46.720
apologize to him. But if Gordon hears this, I am profoundly sorry. I don't say that because

03:31:46.720 --> 03:31:51.280
I'm trying to get in your good graces. I don't know that we'll ever meet each other. But that

03:31:51.280 --> 03:31:58.080
was an unbelievably wrong, stupid thing to say to a young person. Well, thank you for saying that.

03:31:59.200 --> 03:32:03.040
This warms my heart in general. See, you talk to a divorce lawyer and it warms your heart. Look at

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:12.800
that. Well, speaking of which, you're romantic, actually. You've seen love,

03:32:12.800 --> 03:32:17.440
you've seen love break down completely. What role does love play in the human condition?

03:32:18.800 --> 03:32:26.640
I mean, I think it's kind of everything, right? Romantic love, wars are fought for romantic love.

03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:39.600
Empires fall because of romantic love. It takes down kings. We're all just struggling for it.

03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:44.560
We're all just chasing it. We're all chasing the dragon. It's like the rush we all are.

03:32:44.560 --> 03:32:52.400
So it's huge. It's huge. I mean, sex and love, which I like to believe are in some way connected,

03:32:53.120 --> 03:32:56.640
and love and romance, which again, I like to believe are in some way connected.

03:32:57.760 --> 03:33:08.640
I think it's huge. Look, I've always thought most of what men do, including me, we do to get laid,

03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:17.040
like on some level. You want to be successful. Why? So you can have money. Why? So you can have

03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:23.360
nice things so that you can attract attractive members of the opposite sex. A lot of things come

03:33:23.360 --> 03:33:30.480
down to that. Even for men, like red pill men who are like, yeah, I don't care about women. Well,

03:33:30.480 --> 03:33:35.840
you talk about them an awful lot. For someone that's not interested in women, you sure are in

03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:40.080
the orbit of women who you're telling how much you don't care about women, which kind of feels

03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:45.440
like you're doing that to attract a certain kind of woman, which I get. More power to you. But

03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:51.760
like a person who worships an idol and a person who destroys an idol are both idolaters.

03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:58.160
Yes. So if all you're talking about is how you don't need women, you're talking about women an

03:33:58.160 --> 03:34:07.920
awful lot. So it's just such a splinter in people's mind, relationships, breakups, and like it's such

03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:14.160
a great equalizer. I mean, you're spending some time in the rarefied air now of like big celebrity

03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:19.840
people. And I remember when I started out as a lawyer, just doing like the regular, like the cop

03:34:19.840 --> 03:34:24.800
and the teacher with a 401k and they didn't have any assets. I remember thinking like, well, someday

03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:31.600
if I represent celebrities or wealthy CEOs, like it'll be different. They'll be like smarter.

03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:37.760
They'll be like different. It's just the same weird petty shit, the same infidelity, the same-

03:34:38.320 --> 03:34:42.880
The same kind of insecurities, the same kind of jealousy, the same kind of fights.

03:34:43.440 --> 03:34:52.960
It's all the same. But it is. And it's all the same insecurity, sadness. It's the same like

03:34:53.840 --> 03:35:01.040
desire to be validated, like mommy issues, daddy issues, like intimacy issues. And it's all the

03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:08.080
same stuff. And just because you're really good at other things, like I've represented professional

03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:18.000
athletes who are phenomenal, world-class doctors, business people, and they suck at relationships,

03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:25.440
no better than like anybody else. There's no connection between the skills that made you a

03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:30.160
good entrepreneur and the skills that made you a good spouse or partner. I'm sure there's some

03:35:30.160 --> 03:35:36.960
overlap, like patience is good and thinking strategically is probably good. But I'm just

03:35:36.960 --> 03:35:43.120
humbled by how we're called to it still. And even when we lose and even when like our greatest

03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:49.200
pains were caused by our desire to love and be loved in a romantic sense, we just keep putting

03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:54.640
the money on the table and playing. We won't just quit. We just keep going, you know?

03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:56.160
A whole mess of it is worth it.

03:35:57.920 --> 03:36:03.360
I guess so. It's calling us. I don't know if it's worth it or not. That's a value judgment,

03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:10.800
right? But we don't stop. I don't know a lot of people that they played the hand,

03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:15.520
they lost, and they went, well, no more of that game for me. I'm not a good poker player. I'm

03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:19.680
not playing poker anymore. I know people who've done that. I know people that are like, listen,

03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:24.080
I don't drink. I'm allergic. I break out in handcuffs and hospital bills. I'm not drinking

03:36:24.080 --> 03:36:30.240
anymore. But I don't know people that are like, man, that relationship, I screwed that up,

03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:35.120
or I got screwed on that one. I'm not doing that anymore. You can say that. Everybody says that.

03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:40.480
I'm through with love. I'm done. They're not. They keep going. They'll go up again.

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:46.000
Never going to fall in love again and then a few weeks later.

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:50.560
Yeah. I got job security, man. I got job security. People are not going to stop

03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:56.400
walking down that aisle. They are not going to stop having kids with people that they

03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:00.000
probably should have thought through whether they would have kids with that person or not.

03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:04.640
I'm glad they are. I'm glad they're taking that leap. I'm glad they're taking that risk.

03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:09.520
It's this whole beautiful mess that we're all a part of. It's like taking that risk,

03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:13.760
taking that leap of vulnerabilities of what this whole thing is about.

03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:23.040
What a danger if we didn't. You hear about people like Alexander Hamilton or you hear about

03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:30.640
people who were born of circumstances that these two people should never have had a kid.

03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:40.240
Then they did. That kid changes the world and moves the dial forward. What a great mistake.

03:37:42.320 --> 03:37:46.400
You can't ever say it's a mistake. What an amazing thing that happened.

03:37:47.280 --> 03:37:52.720
I think that that's one of the things I like about divorce as a practice and almost looking

03:37:52.720 --> 03:38:00.720
at it like a spiritual practice. I think you just don't know what is a blessing in the world.

03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:08.320
You just don't know. My father, I've spoken about this before publicly and he does frequently,

03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:13.040
my father is an alcoholic. My father has been in recovery now for seven years, I think. Yeah,

03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:20.480
but he was a bad alcoholic, Vietnam veteran my whole life and only got sober when I was in my

03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:29.520
40s. A lot of the personality characteristics I have are consistent with those of adult children

03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:40.000
of alcoholics. Desire for control and control issues, a lot of those things. I love my life.

03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:45.840
I'm having a great time. If I died tomorrow, man, I did more, learned more, earned more,

03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:55.120
loved more than I ever dreamed. I'm so glad my dad was an alcoholic. If you said to me,

03:38:55.120 --> 03:38:59.360
how do you raise kids? I wouldn't say, well, you definitely want to be an alcoholic because

03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:06.000
your kid's getting a lot of really good discipline lessons from that experience. No, I wouldn't want

03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:15.280
that. All these wonderful things were born of this awful situation. I think divorce is the same thing.

03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:22.000
We make these mistakes, but they're not really... I often have to say to my clients when they're

03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:27.120
like, oh, I wish I'd never married this person. I'm like, you love your kids, right? Your kids

03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:34.720
are half that person. They would not be the organism they are without that person's DNA.

03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:42.480
You can't regret being with that person if you love your kids. If you love your kids,

03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:49.680
those kids don't exist without that person. I don't know how we refocus on that. I don't know.

03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:56.000
I've actually had a theory, which I've not said out loud, but I'll say it to you,

03:39:56.560 --> 03:40:05.600
because it's just us talking. I think if we could figure out a way to take a divorcing couple

03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:14.080
that is interested in potentially mediating and put them in a setting where we could give

03:40:14.080 --> 03:40:20.240
them both psilocybin, like a good dose, like two and a half, three grams, and have them do

03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:30.320
individual sessions with controlled setting with a guide, and have them start to do that inner work

03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:37.440
and then have them do some kind of a session together after they've had that experience,

03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:41.920
that psychedelic experience. I actually think you could do transformative divorce work,

03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:47.360
because I have found myself and certainly the many people that I've talked to who've had

03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:53.520
psilocybin experiences in particular, but any psychedelic experience, many of the empathogens,

03:40:53.520 --> 03:41:05.360
right? Or even MDMA, which is an empathogen. If we brought that space and the divorce and

03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:13.600
conflict resolution space together, that sort of psychopharmacological intervention on empathy,

03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:20.960
one's empathy receptors or one's connectivity, I think that could be radically transforming.

03:41:21.040 --> 03:41:25.680
It would be logistically an absolute nightmare. It would never get done from a legal standpoint,

03:41:25.680 --> 03:41:35.840
but man, I think sometimes, because I think the more that you can bring people to the

03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:43.840
awareness of connection that comes from many people's psychedelic experiences,

03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:50.240
I think they could then extrapolate that into their understanding of the conflict and disconnect

03:41:50.240 --> 03:41:58.160
they're having with their partner. Really lean into the... Use this brink of divorce

03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:03.280
as a kind of catalyst for doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of growth together.

03:42:03.280 --> 03:42:08.960
That was what appealed to me about it. Before I started doing it, it was this idea that this is a

03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:17.120
opportunity for radical reinvention. It was an opportunity for people to say,

03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:24.400
okay, now what? I didn't expect that, now what? It was to be part of the architecture of that.

03:42:24.400 --> 03:42:30.080
I didn't look at it like I'm helping demolish the building. It was like I'm tearing down the

03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:35.920
building so we can build the new one, which I hope is filled with joy and abundance and peace

03:42:35.920 --> 03:42:43.600
and love and real love, real satisfaction. My ex-wife is married for over a decade now

03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:51.920
to a phenomenal guy who is perfect for her. He's nothing like me, by the way. If you met him

03:42:52.640 --> 03:42:58.400
and you met both of us, you'd go, well, no one could love both of these guys. If you like

03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:04.000
this flavor, you wouldn't like this flavor. I'm impatient, fast talking, skip to the end,

03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:10.640
we got to land this plane, come on. He's therapist, he's chill, he's patient, and

03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:15.760
they're perfect together. I can say that as someone who loves her and loved her and knows

03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:30.480
her or knew her. I think if we can radically view honestly, without jealousy, without the sense of

03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:36.560
look at it and just go, yeah, okay, this is the love this person needed. That doesn't mean my love

03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:42.000
sucks. It just means it wasn't the right one for this person. There's a lid for every pot.

03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:45.600
She found her lid. I want her to find her lid. That's good.

03:43:46.720 --> 03:43:50.720
And there's billions of pots out there. We just need to match them with the proper lid.

03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:53.280
Yeah, not hit each other over the head with them all day long.

03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:57.680
Yeah, man. This is such a romantic few hours we've got to spend together.

03:43:58.880 --> 03:44:00.640
And there's even a candle burning over there.

03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:01.840
Is there? Oh, that's lovely.

03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:03.040
All right, brother. Thanks so much, James.

03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:04.880
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

03:44:04.880 --> 03:44:08.560
Thanks for listening to this conversation with James Sexton. To support this podcast,

03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:13.440
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:21.280
Rumi. Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within

03:44:21.280 --> 03:44:28.320
yourself that you have built against it. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
