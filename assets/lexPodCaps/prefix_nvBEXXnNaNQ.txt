WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
I get so passionate about it.

00:01.760 --> 00:05.100
I get so angry, you know, because there's a saying like,

00:05.100 --> 00:06.480
oh, can you beat him in a hook?

00:06.480 --> 00:09.840
Can you beat, man, win, win.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.680
That's it.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.380
Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.440
You believe the match is finished.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.520
And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.360
You see this?

00:20.360 --> 00:21.180
Yeah.

00:23.080 --> 00:23.920
Quit.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.300
The following is a conversation with Devon Larratt,

00:29.300 --> 00:32.200
considered by many to be one of the greatest

00:32.200 --> 00:34.740
arm wrestlers in history.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.040
This is a Lex Fridman podcast.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.340

00:40.340 --> 00:44.380
And now, dear friends, here's Devon Larratt.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.020
You are considered to be one of the greatest

00:48.020 --> 00:49.920
arm wrestlers in history,

00:49.920 --> 00:52.420
plus are one of the most charismatic

00:52.420 --> 00:54.820
and fun people to watch in arm wrestling.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.260
But let me first start with the ridiculous,

00:57.260 --> 00:59.060
the controversial opinion.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.820
I actually really enjoy Over the Top,

01:01.820 --> 01:04.420
the movie with Sylvester Stallone,

01:04.420 --> 01:06.020
where he's a trucker.

01:06.020 --> 01:08.460
It's like a father-son movie.

01:08.460 --> 01:12.140
It's like a bunch of sports have the definitive movie.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.940
So boxing has Rocky, maybe folk style,

01:15.940 --> 01:18.680
collegiate wrestling has Vision Quest.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.800
What else is there?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.520
Billiards has Color of Money.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.620
This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.780
So what did Over the Top get right?

01:29.700 --> 01:31.600
What did it get wrong about arm wrestling?

01:31.600 --> 01:34.200
That was actually based off of a real story.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.600
A lot of people don't know that.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.920
Yeah, the Over the Top movie,

01:37.920 --> 01:40.640
I mean, to a certain degree,

01:40.640 --> 01:41.880
that's actually real life.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.280
Like that tournament, Over the Top, was real.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.880
It was literally named Over the Top.

01:45.880 --> 01:46.720
Yes, yes.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.480
There was a trucker division,

01:48.480 --> 01:50.120
and the guy actually won a truck for real.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.020
His name's John Brazing.

01:51.020 --> 01:52.460
You know who that is, right?

01:52.460 --> 01:54.100
So the actual Over the Top tournament,

01:54.100 --> 01:55.720
the trucker division, was won by John.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.200
Who is John Brazing?

01:57.220 --> 02:01.060
He is, a lot of people talk about him as like a legend,

02:01.060 --> 02:04.660
and one of if not the greatest arm wrestlers of all time.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.660
John Brazing is every arm wrestler's father

02:11.300 --> 02:14.580
to a certain degree, all of us.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.340
The entire sport looks up to him.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.580
It's incredible what he's done.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.820
I mean, at 18, he won Over the Top.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.480
At 57, he just competed with me a couple months ago.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.720
Still at the world level, that's 40 years

02:33.720 --> 02:35.720
of being at the top of the sport.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.080
It's incredible.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.140
He's hailed as the greatest of all time

02:39.140 --> 02:41.480
in the sport of arm wrestling, yeah.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.080
And he doesn't, he's beaten some monsters.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.280
Oh yeah, yeah.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.680
And he doesn't.

02:46.680 --> 02:51.680
I mean, when you talk about like the evolution of the sport,

02:52.680 --> 02:56.580
he's responsible for so much of it.

02:56.580 --> 03:01.260
Like when you talk about like, a lot of times when you go

03:01.260 --> 03:04.100
back like 20 years, 30 years, a lot of us looked

03:04.100 --> 03:07.260
at arm wrestling, I think it's, I mean,

03:07.260 --> 03:09.420
as something you could kind of do.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.060
And he's the first guy who's like,

03:11.060 --> 03:12.100
if you want to get better at arm wrestling,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.420
you got arm wrestling.

03:13.420 --> 03:17.420
And it seems so simple, but you know,

03:17.420 --> 03:20.460
he answered so many questions that all of us had

03:20.480 --> 03:23.880
about techniques in the sport, back, you know,

03:23.880 --> 03:26.680
pre video internet.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.160
Yeah, he's everybody.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.520
He's been everybody's target for like 40 years.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.160
So in terms of strength, in terms of power,

03:33.160 --> 03:34.980
in terms of skill, what did he teach

03:34.980 --> 03:35.960
the sport of arm wrestling?

03:35.960 --> 03:38.040
So if you look, how did the sport change

03:38.040 --> 03:41.320
from 80s, 90s to the aughts?

03:41.320 --> 03:44.480
You were at the top of the world for many years, you know,

03:45.760 --> 03:48.020
many argue you're still at the very top of the world,

03:48.020 --> 03:51.120
but like you were very dominant both left and right hand

03:51.120 --> 03:56.120
in, I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.040
So how does that sport evolve to today?

04:00.040 --> 04:03.880
So it's hard for me to comment, you know,

04:03.880 --> 04:07.400
prior to, you know, when I came to the sport

04:07.400 --> 04:09.680
was kind of mid 90s, like I've been arm wrestling

04:09.680 --> 04:13.080
my whole life, but I wasn't really involved

04:13.080 --> 04:16.360
in the sport to a major degree until probably,

04:16.380 --> 04:21.380
you know, mid 90s, but I'll say that before the mid 90s,

04:22.580 --> 04:25.580
it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling,

04:25.580 --> 04:30.400
very difficult, everybody was doing it wrong really.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.020
Like it was really rare to find people

04:33.020 --> 04:35.020
who were technically good arm wrestlers.

04:35.940 --> 04:39.580
It was very underground, you know, when I got into sport,

04:39.580 --> 04:41.940
it was a flyer that came in the mail,

04:41.940 --> 04:45.180
you had to know somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody

04:45.200 --> 04:47.680
and then you go to a club and you can't do anything

04:47.680 --> 04:52.400
with these people and they knew how to arm wrestle,

04:52.400 --> 04:56.120
they did, but real masters were rare.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.920
And, you know, then internet, internet helped everybody,

05:00.920 --> 05:04.500
communication, the transfer of knowledge

05:04.500 --> 05:09.160
became so much faster, people became technically,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.560
you know, invested, people started train,

05:12.560 --> 05:17.560
sharing ideas by I'd say 2000,

05:20.620 --> 05:23.140
well, probably around the turn of the millennia,

05:23.140 --> 05:27.240
I'd say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up,

05:27.240 --> 05:31.300
more organized, bigger productions,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.780
started to attract more athletes,

05:33.780 --> 05:35.580
more people took it seriously.

05:35.580 --> 05:39.340
By 2010, I'd say there was another jump,

05:39.580 --> 05:42.820
more serious leagues, little bit more money.

05:43.980 --> 05:47.400
By 2015, more major media,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.560
like people were investing a lot of money,

05:49.560 --> 05:53.260
like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people

05:53.260 --> 05:55.620
were organizing events, setting up leagues.

05:56.500 --> 06:01.060
And yeah, I mean, the past five years, it's just blown up.

06:01.060 --> 06:05.080
The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back to when I started,

06:06.080 --> 06:10.320
you know, what took me 10 or 15 years to learn,

06:10.320 --> 06:11.760
I mean, new guys are showing up

06:11.760 --> 06:14.360
and they've got it down in like a year, yeah.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.320
Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport

06:18.320 --> 06:21.440
is it's, like I was telling you off mic,

06:21.440 --> 06:26.440
it's a battle of one versus one.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.360
And then that can turn into battle of nations,

06:30.360 --> 06:33.240
which, you know, there is, there's Canada,

06:33.280 --> 06:34.880
there's the United States,

06:34.880 --> 06:39.880
there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia,

06:39.880 --> 06:43.800
all of that, that's what makes some of the greatest sports

06:43.800 --> 06:46.160
in Olympics great, like weightlifting.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.480
It's a battle of nations,

06:47.480 --> 06:48.960
not just the battle of individuals.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.840
And it's almost like these two humans

06:50.840 --> 06:52.640
represent the two nations.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.000
And I see that very much,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.480
we'll talk about your matches coming up,

06:55.480 --> 06:59.760
but there is that battle between North America

06:59.760 --> 07:01.520
and that other part of the world.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.120
Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.200
You know, the North American champion

07:07.200 --> 07:09.160
is always highly sought after

07:09.160 --> 07:12.400
because they're typically the most famous.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.000
Even still when, you know, quite arguably,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.560
there's always somebody in Eastern Europe

07:18.560 --> 07:20.880
who's just monstrous.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.200
It's typically the North American athlete

07:23.200 --> 07:24.760
who's more recognized.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.200
By the way. Oh yeah.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.360
We'll have a cup here with some maple syrup.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.600
Cheers, Lex. Cheers.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.480
Which should probably show,

07:32.960 --> 07:34.600
you just downed that whole thing.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.320
No, no, no, I'm gonna sip it.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.400
I'm gonna sip it, you know, but by all means.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.400
It's really good, right? That is delicious, yeah.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.760
That is maple syrup.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.600
Yeah.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.600
That's a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle, yeah.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.680
So you're on a total tangent.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.080
You are known for appreciating food

07:59.080 --> 08:00.000
in all kinds of ways,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.960
but one of the things you're known for is pancakes.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.960
That is, yeah, that's gone to a crazy place in the sport,

08:06.960 --> 08:08.240
but yeah, like.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.600
Where did that originate?

08:09.600 --> 08:12.800
So where that originated.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.400
When it went from like your actual love for pancakes

08:15.400 --> 08:16.240
to the meme.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, so I think what happened was,

08:22.120 --> 08:26.560
so I had a match with Michael Todd, big match.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.240
Michael, great champion.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.760
He's another guy who's, you know,

08:31.760 --> 08:34.080
he's never gonna get off the horse.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.360
You know, he's, Jesus.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.880
His elbow is a complete disaster.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.960
Probably one of the most loved and hated guys

08:42.960 --> 08:44.280
in the sport right now.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.720
Is it because of the King's move?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.560
Yeah.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.400
One of the.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.600
Yeah, the King's move brings him a lot of hate.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.840
Not from me, not from a lot of people,

08:52.840 --> 08:56.240
but a lot of observers have a big problem

08:56.920 --> 08:57.760
with the King's move.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.960
What's wrong with being a little bit controversial?

08:59.960 --> 09:00.960
That's fun.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.320
You know, I get so passionate about it.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.520
I get so angry, you know,

09:05.520 --> 09:06.640
because there's this saying like,

09:06.640 --> 09:08.040
oh, can you beat him in a hook?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.800
Can you beat, man, win, win.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.120
That's all that matters.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.320
Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.360
If you can win with style, win with style,

09:18.360 --> 09:21.880
but don't talk to me about anything but winning.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.160
That's the priority.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.720
So you had this match with Michael Todd.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.560
Yeah.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.360
So I was in a terrible place.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.440
I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.320
It's 2022 now, right?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.360
No, it's 2030.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.680
What are you talking about?

09:35.680 --> 09:36.520
That's right.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.280
I think it is actually 2030.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.720
We're way ahead of schedule.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.560
Yeah.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.380
Oh man.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.220
That's right.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.060
So when was this?

09:43.060 --> 09:43.880
This was like a decade ago or no?

09:43.880 --> 09:47.120
No, this is like a year and a bit ago.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.200
Oh, this is very recent.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.600
Very recent, yeah.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.120
So I got really sick.

09:52.120 --> 09:52.960
Is that the match?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.760
Yeah, this is the match, right?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.720
Awesome match.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.560
So this match is for the Legacy Hammer.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.160
So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer

10:02.160 --> 10:05.680
and Michael took it from me in I think 2018.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.320
And then COVID shut everything down

10:08.320 --> 10:11.560
and Michael went overseas to try and set up,

10:11.560 --> 10:12.800
because at that time,

10:12.800 --> 10:15.080
Michael was a North American champion.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.600
He beat me and he went to Dubai

10:18.600 --> 10:21.560
and he organized this great big match with Levan

10:21.560 --> 10:23.000
and the whole thing fell apart.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.800
Organizers, leagues, wouldn't let it happen,

10:25.800 --> 10:28.920
but there was still an ability to have a match

10:28.920 --> 10:30.480
of significance happen.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.800
So Michael's like, who do you want?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.640
And I'm like, let's give Devin a rematch.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.360
And I'm like, yeah, yes.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.480
And I was really sick at the time.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.960
I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism,

10:41.960 --> 10:45.320
I was mentally in a terrible place

10:45.320 --> 10:47.000
and I got offered the match

10:47.000 --> 10:50.280
and I just totally turned my life around.

10:50.320 --> 10:55.320
And I committed really hard.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.880
What happened in this match, by the way?

10:59.880 --> 11:01.760
Oh, I just totally destroyed him.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.800
I just beat the piss out of him.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.040
Michael's a good friend of mine, but-

11:11.040 --> 11:12.600
Yeah, there's a lot of camaraderie

11:12.600 --> 11:14.520
and you guys talked afterwards.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.240
But we fight like brothers,

11:17.240 --> 11:20.400
so we let each other really fight hard against each other.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.440
But so I was, I knew, I mean, strength and mass,

11:24.440 --> 11:26.360
they go hand in hand.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.800
And I committed to just getting as big

11:29.800 --> 11:30.800
and as strong as I could.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.000
And literally I was eating pancakes every day.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.200
Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit

11:37.200 --> 11:38.760
of garbage food I could eat.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.440
I was trying to eat healthy also,

11:40.440 --> 11:42.000
but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.320
What do you mean bacon and pancakes isn't healthy?

11:44.320 --> 11:45.160
What are you talking about?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.000
Exactly.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.720
People should go watch, there's a video

11:48.720 --> 11:53.720
where you make the Canadian meal of bacon

11:54.200 --> 11:56.440
with some bacon cooking tips, water,

11:56.440 --> 11:57.280
that was interesting.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.120
Yeah.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.400
And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup

12:01.400 --> 12:02.240
all over the whole thing.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.120
Yeah, you're making me very hungry.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.400
I've caused more diabetes than, you know,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.640
probably gonna get in trouble karmically

12:10.640 --> 12:12.720
for making the world obese.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.760
You should probably write like a book,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.680
The Pancake Diet with Devin Larratt.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.800
Yeah, I think I will do that one day.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.720
So you said mass and strength go hand in hand

12:21.720 --> 12:24.280
just at a big level about arm wrestling.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.360
What's more important, strength, power,

12:28.360 --> 12:31.840
endurance, skill, strategy, or mental toughness?

12:31.840 --> 12:35.560
Like how do these components all come into play

12:35.560 --> 12:36.960
in arm wrestling?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.360
They're all important.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.960
You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy

12:42.000 --> 12:43.920
based off of the tools that you have.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.360
I would say if I could pick ever just one thing

12:48.360 --> 12:53.360
to have more of, I would say that it would be strength

12:53.520 --> 12:56.320
gained while fighting.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.120
While actually arm wrestling, so not off the...

12:59.120 --> 12:59.960
No, no, no.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.200
So you get stronger from arm wrestling.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.720
How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?

13:03.720 --> 13:06.160
Like in jiu-jitsu and grappling, you can get good

13:06.160 --> 13:11.080
by training with people much technically worse than you.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.960
So with white belts and blue belts,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.160
it's actually beneficial.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.000
Agree.

13:15.000 --> 13:15.840
Because you get to work stuff out.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.680
Right.

13:16.680 --> 13:21.680
But I wouldn't say it develops like that intensity

13:23.000 --> 13:27.960
and power required to go against people at your level.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.080
So how do you balance that?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.160
Is it okay to go against people that are much weaker

13:32.160 --> 13:36.440
than you or do you really have to go against people

13:36.440 --> 13:38.040
at the same level?

13:38.040 --> 13:43.040
I think that a blended strategy is probably the best.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.520
I'd say kind of a rule is whatever you do,

13:48.520 --> 13:49.880
you get better at, right?

13:49.880 --> 13:54.200
So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.440
You don't wanna get hurt.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.680
And it's just about investment.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.240
And the answer is not always the same.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.280
Things are gonna change.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.400
I am currently a big believer

14:07.400 --> 14:09.960
in what I call tower building, right?

14:09.960 --> 14:14.960
So you have to do a lot of volume to build a great tower.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.760
You need to have a ton, a ton of volume.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.200
So when you look at how to best build volume,

14:23.200 --> 14:27.480
you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging

14:27.480 --> 14:31.440
to make you feel good and do them so that when you add them

14:31.440 --> 14:35.120
all together, you get the biggest number.

14:35.120 --> 14:40.120
So many easy workouts a day that are as specific as possible,

14:41.320 --> 14:45.480
in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation

14:45.480 --> 14:47.040
for an extreme peak.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.920
And precision, right?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.680
Like there's no more precise way to get strong

14:53.680 --> 14:55.400
at arm wrestling than arm wrestle.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.600
So how often can you arm wrestle?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.520
What's your training regimen?

15:02.520 --> 15:07.520
You've talked about this as the climb.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.800
What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?

15:12.920 --> 15:16.360
Well, again, it's gonna depend on what level you're at.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.640
The answer at the beginning might not be the same.

15:21.640 --> 15:25.160
For me, a guy who's been doing it almost 30 years,

15:26.200 --> 15:27.560
I have to harvest.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.400
I have to harvest energy from clubs.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.440
I call it cosmic punch.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.400
Sorry to interrupt, you were here in Austin, Texas.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.480
You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the,

15:37.480 --> 15:38.320
what was it called?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.000
The water tank.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.320
You had an awesome crowd.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.240
It was great.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.080
I get to watch, I get to interact with a lot of those guys.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.200
Just amazing community, amazing human beings.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.000
I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.120
He's an engineer, his wife is an engineer,

15:56.120 --> 15:59.880
so he's a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest,

15:59.880 --> 16:01.800
I guess, guys you faced there.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.840
You faced, I don't know how many people.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.920
It must have been hundreds of matches.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.400
The bar was full.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.240
Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.720
Yeah, so if I go in and just kind of be,

16:13.720 --> 16:18.120
I'm like a lightning rod, and I just absorb everything

16:18.120 --> 16:21.640
that I can get from people, all their effort.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.080
That's perfect, that's perfect,

16:25.080 --> 16:28.720
but I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.720
If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal,

16:35.040 --> 16:37.520
but because I'm strong enough, I've been doing it

16:37.520 --> 16:39.480
long enough that I can kind of absorb it

16:39.480 --> 16:43.840
without damaging me, this is perfect, this is perfect.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.920
I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match,

16:47.920 --> 16:51.880
I'll try and do that three or four times a week,

16:51.880 --> 16:54.360
and then the days in between,

16:54.360 --> 16:58.560
I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.760
I will never hit a PR, a record, I'll never do it anymore.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.920
I don't do it, I used to, a lot of things change,

17:06.920 --> 17:09.640
and that's why I say there's a lot of ways to do it.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.400
This is currently a system that's working very well for me.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.840
So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak,

17:17.840 --> 17:19.840
you're just building and building and building.

17:19.840 --> 17:24.880
Yeah, my only peak that I care about is for this cycle,

17:24.880 --> 17:27.760
the 25th of June, that's my only PR.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.760
Oh yeah, let's talk about the 25th of June.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.600
Oh yeah.

17:31.600 --> 17:36.600
Let's talk about Levan Saganashvili, the Georgian Hulk.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.480
Question number one, is it possible to beat him?

17:42.480 --> 17:47.480
He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person

17:49.720 --> 17:51.640
in arm wrestling today.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.960
Is he beatable, and if so, how?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.280
Everybody's beatable, everybody's beatable.

17:57.800 --> 18:02.800
Levan is incredible, he is what this modern peak

18:05.040 --> 18:07.200
of arm wrestling represents.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.800
So for people who are just listening,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.480
we also have an overlay of a video of Levan

18:12.480 --> 18:17.200
going against Vitaly Lledin, another top three person

18:17.200 --> 18:20.440
in the world, perhaps, in arm wrestling.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.880
And Levan is the guy in the right, just big.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.640
I love it.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.160
The aggression, I mean, actually, sort of underneath it all

18:30.160 --> 18:33.880
seems to be a teddy bear, but when he turns it on,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.560
it's raw power.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.040
He's the full package.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.040
Levan is, he represents the pinnacle.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.080
There's Dennis in the background.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.120
He's like, I wanna be back in there.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.840
Levan has a lot of bases covered.

18:49.840 --> 18:54.240
He's, I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm.

18:54.240 --> 18:58.760
I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling

18:58.760 --> 19:03.760
is so far ahead of the field, is very, very strong.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.600
But it's absolutely possible, it's absolutely possible.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.200
The one thing that I'm confident about,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.160
well, I'd say there's two things.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.200
The two things I'm confident about

19:18.200 --> 19:21.200
is that I have more experience than he does.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.200
And experience counts for a lot.

19:25.320 --> 19:30.320
The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.880
So if ever there's an opportunity for the tide to turn,

19:37.480 --> 19:40.160
that's, I think, where he'll never get it back.

19:40.160 --> 19:45.160
So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game,

19:45.160 --> 19:46.920
then yeah.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.400
So you want to hold off the initial assault of power

19:51.400 --> 19:56.400
and then wear him out to find the hole,

19:56.440 --> 20:00.480
and then, how much of that is mental?

20:00.480 --> 20:03.440
How much of it is just the physical ability to do,

20:03.440 --> 20:06.280
for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?

20:08.080 --> 20:11.360
I like to make the sport bigger.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.120
And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers

20:17.200 --> 20:20.840
believe the sport is, I always try and push those boundaries.

20:21.840 --> 20:26.200
So there is definitely a mental aspect to it

20:26.200 --> 20:29.720
when you're faced with something that you've never seen before.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.080
That's when things like experience comes in,

20:34.080 --> 20:36.040
he can become surprised,

20:36.040 --> 20:40.280
where what's a surprise for him is routine for me.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.960
So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.720
Yeah, that's how I get in.

20:47.720 --> 20:48.920
That's how I get in.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.760
Yeah, I play a dirty game.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.400
You know?

20:52.400 --> 20:55.240
So some of it, how important is confidence

20:55.240 --> 20:58.400
in the progression of the match?

20:59.800 --> 21:03.200
Is there ups and downs of confidence?

21:03.200 --> 21:06.360
Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.360
Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.320
There's some of my favorite moments,

21:10.320 --> 21:12.000
I don't know if those are fake or not

21:12.000 --> 21:13.600
in terms of your expressions,

21:13.600 --> 21:15.480
if it's fake until you make it,

21:15.480 --> 21:18.360
but whenever you shake your head or whatever,

21:18.360 --> 21:23.360
you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.720
And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.600
When you start to actually,

21:30.600 --> 21:33.680
so I'm sure you're doing things in like precise detailed

21:33.680 --> 21:36.680
things with your hands to also indicate

21:36.680 --> 21:38.360
that you believe they're finished,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.040
but you're facially just-

21:40.040 --> 21:40.880
See this?

21:40.880 --> 21:41.720
Yeah.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.720
Quit.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.560
Yeah.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.920
Oh, that's right, because it's facing the other.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.200
So that's ultimately what the battle is about.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.840
It's like, you're done, you might as well give up.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.880
Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?

21:59.880 --> 22:04.720
Like, I always kind of try and bring things

22:04.720 --> 22:08.360
to a level of commitment that's uncommon.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.800
I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well,

22:11.800 --> 22:15.640
is because I just get so committed in the whole process.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.440
And by the time that I actually show up to fight,

22:19.440 --> 22:22.240
I sometimes just wish that they would kill me, you know?

22:22.240 --> 22:23.960
I wish that they would,

22:23.960 --> 22:27.080
because that's how far I want to go.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.600
People talk about how committed are you to the match?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.360
If you're committed to the match and you lose,

22:32.360 --> 22:33.360
you should be hurt.

22:34.720 --> 22:39.280
I'm often unhappy when I lose a match

22:39.280 --> 22:40.400
and I don't have an injury.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.920
I'm like, damn, I'm like, what the fuck?

22:41.920 --> 22:46.160
Like, I should've, I feel like I didn't commit, you know?

22:47.840 --> 22:50.280
I don't know if you know Dan Gable is the wrestler.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.680
Oh yeah, he was on-

22:51.680 --> 22:52.840
He was on the podcast?

22:52.840 --> 22:53.680
Yeah, yeah.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.920
He talked about his whole career.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.160
He dreamed of working so hard that he gets,

23:00.160 --> 23:03.600
he can't get off the mat by himself.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.160
And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career

23:08.160 --> 23:10.160
because he was always able to get off the mat

23:10.160 --> 23:11.520
on his own accord.

23:11.520 --> 23:15.200
So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat

23:15.200 --> 23:17.000
just from exhaustion.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.120
So that's what commitment looks like.

23:19.120 --> 23:19.960
Yeah.

23:19.960 --> 23:20.800
But what is this process?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.480
What is this climb for probably

23:23.480 --> 23:26.520
the toughest match of your career?

23:26.520 --> 23:31.520
I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.720
I mean, it's really building up,

23:33.720 --> 23:36.480
you are the, as you said, North America.

23:36.480 --> 23:41.480
That's, I mean, I think by a constant menu,

23:41.880 --> 23:43.760
one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.280
He is one of the scariest arm wrestlers ever.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.200
And so this match, by the way, where is it happening?

23:50.200 --> 23:51.040
It'll be in Dubai.

23:51.040 --> 23:51.860
In Dubai.

23:51.860 --> 23:52.700
Yeah. June.

23:52.700 --> 23:55.480
So what does the climb look like?

23:55.480 --> 24:00.480
The climb for me, what I have to change in my life always,

24:01.600 --> 24:04.040
people talk about being a professional.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.040
I've always loved the sport.

24:06.040 --> 24:10.480
I've loved it like crazy, but to me,

24:10.480 --> 24:15.480
the path is about simplicity and removal of distractions.

24:18.680 --> 24:23.680
I do better and better the more I get rid of everything,

24:23.880 --> 24:28.880
nothing else so that my life is just the goal,

24:29.360 --> 24:33.120
just the target and everything else is off the table.

24:33.120 --> 24:38.120
And that's where I need to get to where there's nothing,

24:38.400 --> 24:39.880
there's nothing between me and him.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.560
And every single day you're putting in the volume.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
Every day, all day.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.600
Now you said you worked out,

24:45.600 --> 24:49.440
so yesterday you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches,

24:49.440 --> 24:51.520
and then today you said in the morning you still worked out.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.640
So what was that workout?

24:52.640 --> 24:57.000
So you're mixing up stuff where you're doing weights also?

24:57.000 --> 25:00.600
This morning, I try to really focus

25:00.600 --> 25:03.480
on what's administratively easy.

25:03.480 --> 25:06.440
That's a big part of me, everything I do.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.880
So I just travel with bands.

25:08.880 --> 25:13.300
Yeah, I got bands with me and it's rehabilitative in nature.

25:13.300 --> 25:17.280
So I'm really focusing on blood flow,

25:17.280 --> 25:20.640
feeling good, doing proper movements.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.840
But yeah, just a band workout in the hotel.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.400
What does a band workout look like?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.800
So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?

25:27.640 --> 25:28.760
See what you did there?

25:28.760 --> 25:29.600
What's that?

25:31.720 --> 25:32.720
That you want to bring him in.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.920
Yeah, up, up.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.400
Oh, the up thing?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.360
Up into your center, right?

25:38.360 --> 25:40.920
You think, what can you control out here?

25:40.920 --> 25:42.720
No, you bring everything close.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.880
You want every, just that's it.

25:43.880 --> 25:44.720
Don't worry about pinning.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.560
Pinning happens once it's close to you.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.280
Yeah, pinning is, people always think about pinning.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.200
Don't think about pinning.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.000
How much of the body is a part of this too?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.640
Like the core, the torso,

25:57.480 --> 25:59.440
because it feels like there's that almost like

25:59.440 --> 26:01.680
Mike Tyson punch power, right?

26:01.680 --> 26:06.120
Does it come from the hips too and the legs?

26:06.120 --> 26:08.600
It's definitely the whole body.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.360
It's definitely the whole body.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.560
Everything is working.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.540
You're connected to the table at times

26:14.540 --> 26:15.380
as far as your base.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.360
Sometimes your base is your feet,

26:17.360 --> 26:19.640
but a lot of times you can base off the table.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.960
So you can base off your hips.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.000
But I'll tell you,

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
no arm wrestler cares about doing squats.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.920
No arm wrestler is doing planks.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.200
Yeah. Okay.

26:30.200 --> 26:34.040
It's all about the forearm and the actions of the hand.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.240
That's always the limiting factor.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.360
You look at a guy like Oleg Zok.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.760
Okay, do you know this guy?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.800
Oleg Zok, he's marvelous.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.400
He's a total hell boy.

26:43.400 --> 26:47.360
He's my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.200
But-

26:48.200 --> 26:49.400
What's pumpkin training?

26:50.560 --> 26:51.760
Probably we'll get into that,

26:51.760 --> 26:53.720
but I only train my right arm.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.720
That's it.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.120
Yeah, with homework.

26:56.120 --> 27:00.560
But back to full body, it is full body.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.040
My good friend Matt Mask, when he arm wrestled me,

27:04.040 --> 27:09.040
he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.160
So yeah, people walk away from tournament.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.160
Their calves can be sore sometimes.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.920
It happens, but no, oh, there he is right there.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.960
Yeah, Oleg, he is a real life hell boy.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.440
He's like 170 pounds there.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.520
Look at his arm, look at his arm.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.640
Crazy.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.560
Yeah, yeah, he's totally crazy.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.960
That's you doing left right there.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.600
So by the way, Levant, you're going right.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.120
Yeah, yeah.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.520
So can you say more about the mental side?

27:39.520 --> 27:42.240
Are you visualizing what it takes to beat him?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
Are you trying to get in his head?

27:44.240 --> 27:45.840
All of these things.

27:45.840 --> 27:46.680
So-

27:46.680 --> 27:48.680
Do you think it's possible to get in his head?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.800
There's definitely strategies that you can do

27:52.800 --> 27:55.280
depending on who it is you're facing.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.040
It's very good to know who it is you're fighting

27:58.040 --> 28:00.600
and choose the correct strategy mentally.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.480
But I always follow a process

28:06.480 --> 28:09.120
when it comes to my mental preparation.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.680
When I'm far away from an event,

28:11.680 --> 28:15.440
I just always build up my opponent.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.240
Build them, I build them, I respect them.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.520
To a point where I almost start to fear them

28:21.520 --> 28:23.520
and start to believe that they'll beat me.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.160
And this is a very vital part of my preparation.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.520
And that's where I am right now with Levant.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.400
I just build them up,

28:30.400 --> 28:33.480
build them up into this thing that scares me.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.840
And it forces me to be responsible,

28:37.040 --> 28:39.760
because I don't want to lose, I want to win.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.920
So the greater my opponent,

28:42.920 --> 28:46.040
the greater I can build their worth in my mind,

28:46.040 --> 28:47.640
the more motivation it gives me.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.800
Then there comes a point when it changes.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.760
And then I start to degrade them.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.920
And yeah, that's when it normally starts to get fun.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.560
And normally by the time I face them,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.800
I just try and completely dominate

29:07.800 --> 29:10.600
from every interaction from start to finish.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.600
Yeah.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.680
When in the actual moment of the match,

29:17.840 --> 29:21.080
in the moments leading up to it, what's the feeling?

29:21.080 --> 29:26.080
Is it fear, is it confidence, anxiety?

29:26.640 --> 29:28.560
What's going through your mind?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.040
I love to fight.

29:31.040 --> 29:31.880
I love it.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.640
I always have.

29:36.360 --> 29:41.360
There's every day where you have the distractions of life

29:42.480 --> 29:45.000
and then there's really living in the moment, right?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.520
That's whatever you love to do.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.640
And that's when you can really be free.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.120
I'm free when I'm fighting, right?

29:52.120 --> 29:56.080
So you put me in that good fight and I just love it.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.280
And I don't think about the past,

29:57.280 --> 29:58.400
I don't think about the future.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.680
I just think about killing that dude in front of me

30:00.680 --> 30:02.760
and I enjoy that.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.800
And just being intensely in the moment.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.640
That's it.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.440
Just right there, just fighting as hard as I can.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.520
Do you study the opponent?

30:09.520 --> 30:12.480
Like do you have you for this particular match,

30:12.480 --> 30:14.760
do you study videos of Levan?

30:14.760 --> 30:17.680
I've seen everything.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.040
I've read everything.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.040
I get opinions from other people.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.360
I watch very closely, yeah.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.160
What do you make of his evolution?

30:27.160 --> 30:32.160
So he's grown in size, but also you've talked about his,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.520
evolution technically as well.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.840
Levan studying him.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.840
Since we're in the build your opponent to be

30:44.760 --> 30:48.320
a terrifying stage, what makes him great?

30:49.480 --> 30:50.440
He's very impressive.

30:50.440 --> 30:54.720
The greatest thing about him is his strength.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.720
That's the thing that sets him apart from everyone.

30:58.720 --> 31:02.000
His strength, specialized strength,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.880
exact strength for arm wrestling.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.000
I believe it's unmatched.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Can we just linger on that word strength?

31:12.160 --> 31:13.880
What does strength mean?

31:13.880 --> 31:15.160
What does it feel like?

31:15.160 --> 31:20.160
Are we talking about bicep, shoulder?

31:21.720 --> 31:25.280
Are we talking about whatever controls the wrist?

31:25.280 --> 31:29.360
Is it the, how does strength manifest?

31:29.360 --> 31:32.760
When I touch your hand, when we grab arms,

31:32.760 --> 31:36.200
I feel like, fuck, that's strong.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.040
There's control.

31:37.040 --> 31:37.880
What is that feeling?

31:37.880 --> 31:40.120
Where does that come from in arm wrestling?

31:40.120 --> 31:41.760
When you're at the top of the world,

31:42.600 --> 31:43.880
where does that come from?

31:43.880 --> 31:44.800
It's chains.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.240
There's chains of strength.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.640
In arm wrestling, this is technical strength.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.400
We use these technical chains to fight each other.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.200
The chains that I'll talk about is,

31:59.240 --> 32:02.760
remember how we talked about the post, this upwards drive,

32:02.760 --> 32:04.960
this ability to close this angle?

32:04.960 --> 32:05.960
This is a chain.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.920
It can be used, it's a technical attack.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.600
It's also an attack that can be built with training.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.600
Just the ability to drive upwards.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.920
There's a chain where you cup, cup your wrist in.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.000
Cup your wrist in, and the anchor and the chain

32:22.000 --> 32:25.160
brings you right to your heart, right to your center.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.920
This chain, and this can be done at any time.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.040
There's a pronation chain,

32:29.040 --> 32:32.320
and that's to turn your thumb over.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.360
Turn your thumb over,

32:33.360 --> 32:36.320
and you attack the person's cupping chain.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.800
And there's a huge number of muscles

32:37.800 --> 32:39.160
involved in each of those chains.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.280
And that's why I say it's a chain, right?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.320
But they're movements,

32:43.320 --> 32:46.400
and these movements you can develop

32:46.400 --> 32:48.400
in the gym or through practice.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.880
So you don't mean, it's easy to interpret strength

32:51.880 --> 32:55.360
to mean how much you curl, essentially.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.800
But you mean the chain.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.640
It all has to do with the-

32:57.640 --> 32:59.840
Right, and people talk there's a bicep.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.880
I mean, yes, there's bicep for sure involved,

33:01.880 --> 33:04.400
but I'll always be inaccurate

33:04.400 --> 33:07.160
if I try and tell you what muscles are the...

33:07.160 --> 33:09.800
So I prefer to explain it in a movement,

33:09.800 --> 33:12.760
and then everything that's involved to do that movement.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.760
Right?

33:13.760 --> 33:17.400
Yeah, and Levan's movements for arm wrestling

33:17.400 --> 33:19.360
are incredibly impressive.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.840
What do you attribute to?

33:20.840 --> 33:22.320
How much of that is genetics?

33:22.320 --> 33:27.320
How much of it is some training thing he's doing?

33:28.320 --> 33:31.960
I think that Levan is very special

33:31.960 --> 33:34.000
in terms of his genetics.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.200
Not everybody can be Levan, you know?

33:37.200 --> 33:39.320
Yeah, there's not many Levans out there.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.920
But what I've encountered in the bias that I always see,

33:44.920 --> 33:48.040
like when people talk about people like Levan,

33:48.040 --> 33:51.440
they discount the other side so very quickly.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.480
And the thing is Levan rarely has to show the other side

33:54.480 --> 33:56.560
because he's so far ahead.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.280
You talk about the technical application of the sport.

33:59.280 --> 34:03.440
He so rarely needs to show it, but he's clearly incredible.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.120
If you watch his progression,

34:06.120 --> 34:10.320
he came up having very difficult technical struggles

34:10.320 --> 34:11.160
to overcome.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.920
Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.400
There's this guy, Gennady Kvykvinia,

34:15.400 --> 34:19.040
who no one would ever say is not technical.

34:19.040 --> 34:23.720
And it took him years to defeat him

34:23.720 --> 34:27.000
to a point where now it's not even a discussion.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.280
Yeah, you talk about the progression.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.880
They had a lot of battles together over the years.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.040
It's fascinating to see the tides turn.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.720
And once they've turned,

34:34.720 --> 34:38.880
it's like completely, completely different level.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.880
Yeah, I mean, he's got strength, he's got technique.

34:43.720 --> 34:48.640
Some people will argue that his technique is flawed.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.760
At times, they've shown matches where

34:51.760 --> 34:54.920
he hasn't shown the best technique, but he still won.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.720
And I think sometimes he just plays with people.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.360
There's a famous match that he had with,

35:02.360 --> 35:05.560
they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling,

35:05.560 --> 35:08.640
a guy called Ongarbaev, Kurti Galli Ongarbaev.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.640
They had a match in the top eight, great match.

35:11.640 --> 35:15.560
Kurti Galli is like 220-pound guy from Kazakhstan,

35:17.520 --> 35:20.120
brilliant technician, but power-wise,

35:20.120 --> 35:22.560
not in the same world.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.760
And Kurti Galli did well, even though he lost six-nothing.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.920
He still did well.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.920
But in my opinion, Levan didn't care.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.880
Levan was like grabbing him low and just like, whatever.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.200
I will show him things that he's not seen before, I will.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.000
He hasn't competed often in this rule set,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.640
which will be a challenge for him.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.280
But yeah, what can I say?

35:48.280 --> 35:50.480
Levan, he's Everest.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.800
Yeah. Yeah.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.560
Yeah, you are seen by basically everybody

35:54.560 --> 35:56.200
as the big, big underdog.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.840
But you're also, even in the Eastern,

35:58.840 --> 36:01.480
even, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.280
You know that moment in Rocky,

36:05.280 --> 36:06.880
when they start cheering for Rocky?

36:06.880 --> 36:07.960
Yeah, yeah.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.000
You're kind of the, they love you, they want you to win.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
And just, it's not even, just the battle itself is inspiring.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.760
And it's like the culmination of your career,

36:19.760 --> 36:24.000
because you were at the top for a long time,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.880
but it's like, it's almost like it should be over for you,

36:26.880 --> 36:28.400
but no, you're returning.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.640
It is like this big moment.

36:31.640 --> 36:32.480
Yeah.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.040
The big climb.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.640
I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.120
Yeah.

36:40.120 --> 36:40.960
Beautiful.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.680
Well, let's, thanks for bringing that match up.

36:43.680 --> 36:48.680
Let's talk about just the match against Dennis,

36:50.160 --> 36:51.640
your left-hand match.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.480
Yeah.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.640
It's still terrifying.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.960
It seems one of the strongest,

36:54.960 --> 36:58.120
probably the one of, if not the strongest,

36:58.120 --> 36:59.800
left-hand arm wrestler.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.640
Yeah.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.800
There's a lot to be said there.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.320
Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.040
Why did you take on this match?

37:08.040 --> 37:10.840
Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand?

37:10.840 --> 37:12.360
Can you tell the story?

37:12.360 --> 37:15.040
Okay, Dennis the Plankoff.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.080
There's so much about this match.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.240
I love Dennis.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.320
Russian guy.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.520
Yeah, Russian guy.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.280
Russian, I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.520
What a monster.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.520
He kind of led, I'd say, this new era of arm wrestling,

37:34.640 --> 37:37.640
where the super heavyweight strength level

37:37.640 --> 37:40.240
has just gone through the roof.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.240
I wanted the match for such a long time.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.280
We tried to get the match.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.480
We couldn't get it organized.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.640
This is back in like 2008 to 2012.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.480
Couldn't get the match, couldn't get the match.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.440
I've always been more of a one-on-one puller.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.200
He was doing the tournament format.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.280
I was ranked number one in the world.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.640
And towards the end, it kind of was very undecided.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.320
I ended up getting surgery.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.400
I ended up abandoning the super heavyweight division.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.680
I went down to the 225s for a few years.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.120
WAL failed temporarily.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.960
So the 225 pound division was scrapped.

38:17.720 --> 38:21.040
I'm gonna go for the big crown once again.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.680
And I started to go after super heavyweights.

38:26.040 --> 38:31.040
The 2018 season was right-hand.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.080
I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.040
We'd been chasing the match for 10 years.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.320
They wanted to do it left-hand.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.360
I wanted to do it right-hand.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.320
I just wanted to do the match.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.640
I wanted to do the match with Dennis.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.840
I wanted to meet Dennis.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.040
So people should know that you were,

38:51.040 --> 38:53.600
the right-hand has always been your strongest.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.600
It has been, I mean, I had surgery in 2016.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.240
I hate to make excuses.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.360
I hate to do it.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.120
Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.880
If you had gone back my entire career,

39:07.880 --> 39:11.640
at no single day do I beat Dennis Zplankoff in 2018.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.400
I would like to think that I could maybe do it now,

39:14.400 --> 39:16.800
but at that point there would be no version

39:16.800 --> 39:19.080
that could have beat him.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.480
Left or right?

39:20.480 --> 39:23.680
Right-hand, no, I'm curious about the right.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.520
But left-hand.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.600
So is the world.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.480
Well, it might still happen, it might.

39:29.480 --> 39:34.480
But Dennis completely destroyed me

39:37.000 --> 39:40.560
and I learned a lot from it.

39:41.280 --> 39:45.440
I think before the Dennis match,

39:45.440 --> 39:46.720
I think I was, I don't know.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.840
I don't know exactly what word to use.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.880
Maybe I felt like my thinking was a little bit elitist

39:54.880 --> 39:57.080
and I really learned a lot.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.920
I was really humbled that day

40:01.360 --> 40:06.120
by how far and how professional and how prepared Dennis was

40:06.120 --> 40:09.480
and how seriously he took the sport.

40:09.480 --> 40:14.480
There's a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness to him,

40:14.960 --> 40:17.880
which only comes with extreme preparation, I think.

40:17.880 --> 40:21.120
Yeah, his level of dedication

40:21.120 --> 40:23.440
was extremely inspiring to me.

40:26.280 --> 40:31.280
I used to do a job where it was serious enough

40:34.400 --> 40:37.760
that the price could be death, right?

40:37.760 --> 40:41.640
And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period

40:41.640 --> 40:46.280
and I always kind of looked at, you know,

40:46.280 --> 40:50.920
the cost of doing an activity being death

40:52.840 --> 40:54.840
limited to soldiering.

40:55.880 --> 41:00.320
And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.640
I realized that anything that you're in love with,

41:04.600 --> 41:06.680
once you get far enough down the road

41:06.680 --> 41:09.600
and professional enough at it, it's gonna kill you.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.440
Like, doesn't matter what you're doing,

41:11.440 --> 41:13.800
if you're crazy enough about anything,

41:13.800 --> 41:16.640
it's probably gonna take your life from you in some way.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.400
And that doesn't mean you rush towards death.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.200
It's just your level of investment and level of risk

41:24.200 --> 41:27.640
can have some catastrophic effects.

41:27.640 --> 41:31.200
Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think has the quote,

41:31.200 --> 41:33.000
do what you love and let it kill you.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Right. Like that.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.480
Right.

41:35.480 --> 41:40.480
And I understood that Dennis's level of professionalism

41:40.680 --> 41:44.800
far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time.

41:45.680 --> 41:50.400
And I realized that, you know, I was no longer employed.

41:50.400 --> 41:54.360
I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.

41:54.360 --> 41:58.720
And I realized that, you know, what was I doing?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.640
Like how serious was I?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.840
So Dennis is an incredible guy.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.560
Is there moments in that match,

42:04.560 --> 42:07.760
there's just humility there too from him.

42:07.760 --> 42:11.680
That was a fascinating sort of,

42:11.680 --> 42:14.560
it seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall

42:14.560 --> 42:16.200
and you were not ready enough for it.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.880
It was incredible.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.640
There was so many things that I remember

42:19.640 --> 42:21.000
about the Dennis match.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.200
I mean, I remember, you know, seeing video of somebody

42:25.200 --> 42:28.160
and then meeting them in person, it's different.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.280
I remember in the weigh-ins, sorry, not the weigh-ins,

42:30.280 --> 42:32.920
in the standoff that we did, you know, before the match,

42:32.920 --> 42:34.720
I'm looking at him, like I'm close,

42:34.720 --> 42:39.440
I'm looking at his arms and his bicep,

42:39.440 --> 42:41.960
it looked like an ass.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.520
Like it was like a fricking glute muscle.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.120
Like his entire structure was so sinewy

42:48.120 --> 42:51.640
and just so strong.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.160
I was like, wow, like he's physically so impressive.

42:55.160 --> 43:00.160
And I remember when I arm wrestled him at a certain time,

43:01.120 --> 43:04.640
he allowed me to kind of set my position.

43:04.640 --> 43:09.280
You can't really tell because it happens very quickly,

43:09.280 --> 43:10.760
but he let me set my position,

43:10.760 --> 43:13.480
which means I kind of got my locks in

43:13.480 --> 43:17.200
where you can kind of really do a great hold.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.360
And he just ripped through me.

43:20.360 --> 43:23.920
So you were able to get this great position.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.080
So it was...

43:25.080 --> 43:27.240
Tore right through me.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.080
Yeah.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.720
It was the first time I ever thought

43:30.720 --> 43:33.280
that I had torn something.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.760
I thought like after the match, I'm like,

43:34.760 --> 43:36.760
geez, did he rip my chest right in half?

43:36.760 --> 43:37.600
Like...

43:38.720 --> 43:40.480
What, did it?

43:40.480 --> 43:41.320
No, I think...

43:41.320 --> 43:42.160
It was 100% just...

43:42.160 --> 43:43.920
Yeah, no, I didn't actually,

43:43.920 --> 43:45.960
nothing went purple or anything,

43:45.960 --> 43:50.960
but yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.360
So could he...

43:54.360 --> 43:56.560
What would it take to beat him on that day?

43:58.480 --> 44:02.240
It would take me just being a little bit stronger

44:03.960 --> 44:06.600
and more healthy, yeah.

44:06.600 --> 44:10.000
My left was not as healthy as it should be.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.840
Like I didn't have a full rounded technical arsenal.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.760
It takes a time after surgery.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.600
It really does.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.800
Like, I mean, you can be good,

44:18.800 --> 44:22.200
but after a surgery, like what I had,

44:22.200 --> 44:24.160
you're probably looking at three or four years

44:24.160 --> 44:26.800
before you're starting to hit technical proficiency

44:26.800 --> 44:28.760
the way you should be.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.240
And yeah, just a bit stronger.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.720
How do you interpret the calmness on his face?

44:33.720 --> 44:35.200
Well, what is that about?

44:35.200 --> 44:36.040
Is he actually...

44:36.040 --> 44:37.040
It's very Russian, isn't it?

44:37.040 --> 44:37.880
It's a Russian thing.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.920
It's a Russian thing, I think.

44:38.920 --> 44:39.760
I don't know.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.800
I see a lot of Russians like that.

44:40.800 --> 44:44.800
You know, they're so like stoic and I'm such a fan of Russia.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.280
I really want to go to Moscow.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.520
I've been saying it forever.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.360
You've never been...

44:48.360 --> 44:49.280
Not yet, not yet.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.040
I want to go, I want to just go

44:51.040 --> 44:53.480
and live there for like a month and just train.

44:53.480 --> 44:56.600
Moscow has got such a crazy arm wrestling scene.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.720
From what I understand, they just have so many clubs.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.600
There's so many strong athletes.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.440
Just go and just lightning rod.

45:03.440 --> 45:04.280
Yeah.

45:04.280 --> 45:08.000
Have you considered doing something of that sort?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.840
It's like Rocky IV again.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.680
Oh yeah.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.960
Like, and lead up to June.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.600
I would certainly consider it.

45:14.600 --> 45:18.080
I've got only one trip planned at the moment.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.880
Administration is very important.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.080
What do you mean by administration?

45:24.080 --> 45:25.400
So like managing your time and...

45:25.400 --> 45:26.440
Management, yeah.

45:26.440 --> 45:29.000
The management has to be very efficient.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.920
You know, when I'm a tourist, when I'm a visitor,

45:31.920 --> 45:33.400
a little bit of that goes down.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.160
You know, when I'm at my home and things are familiar,

45:37.160 --> 45:39.880
I've got a really great grasp on my time.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.840
You know, everything's in place.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.960
Everything's perfect.

45:42.960 --> 45:46.320
You know, if I could magically transport Moscow

45:46.320 --> 45:50.120
into my hometown and just go out and visit them, yeah.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.480
So it's very difficult when you're traveling,

45:51.520 --> 45:53.200
you have to keep all the,

45:53.200 --> 45:55.840
you have to figure out what are you eating,

45:55.840 --> 45:58.520
how are you getting the food, all the socializing.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.960
Plus you're more and more a celebrity.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.240
So there's a social interaction, which I don't know

46:04.240 --> 46:06.000
how draining that could be on you outside

46:06.000 --> 46:07.560
of the arm wrestling table.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.600
So you have to manage all of that

46:09.600 --> 46:13.920
because ultimately you have to focus on the fight ahead.

46:13.920 --> 46:14.840
Yeah.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.680
Yeah.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.640
A lot of my strength comes from just being

46:18.640 --> 46:22.280
in a familiar place, doing my routine.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.720
I love to travel.

46:23.720 --> 46:28.720
I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.360
But when I just want to really prepare for a big match,

46:32.360 --> 46:35.600
yeah, home is where I get strong.

46:35.600 --> 46:39.120
So that loss against Dennis was one of the few losses

46:39.120 --> 46:40.880
in your career.

46:40.880 --> 46:45.160
How did that feel in the moments after,

46:45.160 --> 46:47.360
in the days after, in the months after,

46:47.360 --> 46:50.560
in the years after, how has it changed you

46:50.560 --> 46:52.440
as an arm wrestler, as a human being?

46:53.280 --> 46:57.200
Well, it's tough to lose.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.240
Still haunt you?

47:01.840 --> 47:02.680
I don't think so.

47:02.680 --> 47:05.240
I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis

47:05.240 --> 47:08.480
because sometimes when you lose a match,

47:08.480 --> 47:10.360
there's a lot of matches that have lost

47:10.360 --> 47:14.120
where they upset me because I know I made a mistake.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.360
I didn't make a mistake with Dennis.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.280
He was just way better.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.760
There's nothing I could have done that day.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.160
I'm really at peace with it.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.280
Dennis, to me, was just a big inspiration.

47:25.280 --> 47:28.240
I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left-handed that day

47:28.240 --> 47:31.600
just let me touch probably one of the strongest

47:31.600 --> 47:34.320
human beings on the arm wrestling table that's ever lived,

47:34.320 --> 47:35.160
left-handed.

47:36.800 --> 47:41.680
So knowing that's possible is almost like inspiration

47:41.680 --> 47:43.360
to you that I can be at that level too.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.320
Yeah, yeah.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.920
Seeing what Dennis did, just trying to absorb

47:48.920 --> 47:53.720
a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me.

47:53.720 --> 47:57.000
Yeah, I mean, when I look at my career,

47:57.000 --> 47:59.040
it's a bit like the stock market,

47:59.040 --> 48:02.080
but for sure I'm trending upwards.

48:02.080 --> 48:07.080
And since really kind of wrapping my mind around

48:07.320 --> 48:09.200
some of the Russian philosophies,

48:09.200 --> 48:12.200
they really changed my training systems.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.400
There was some base philosophies

48:14.440 --> 48:16.560
that they talked to me about over there

48:16.560 --> 48:19.680
that massively impacted my training.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.000
Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies

48:22.000 --> 48:22.840
into words?

48:22.840 --> 48:25.920
Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
Never smile.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.560
Ah, right?

48:29.560 --> 48:32.440
Man, it takes a while to break the ice

48:32.440 --> 48:33.640
with a lot of these guys.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.520
Well, once you do,

48:35.520 --> 48:37.880
I mean, that's the deepest bonds you can form there.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.680
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

48:39.680 --> 48:43.360
I think that I was raised under,

48:43.360 --> 48:46.040
I believe it's a flawed,

48:46.040 --> 48:49.520
I mean, it's not flawed because it has its value as well,

48:50.640 --> 48:54.720
but it's best if you understand both philosophies.

48:54.720 --> 48:57.240
I think a North American thing

48:57.240 --> 49:02.240
that's just so ingrained in our fitness society

49:02.600 --> 49:05.360
is no pain, no gain, you know?

49:05.360 --> 49:09.440
And just pushing and like sweating and going harder

49:09.440 --> 49:12.960
and like fighting through like, and grit and tough.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.280
But, and then you talk to the Russians

49:16.280 --> 49:18.240
and they're like, yeah, never fail.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.120
You never fail.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.680
Never go to failure.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.160
Always feel good.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.000
Always feel good.

49:24.000 --> 49:24.840
It should always feel good.

49:24.840 --> 49:28.520
Don't, and those two philosophies

49:28.520 --> 49:30.640
express themselves very differently.

49:31.920 --> 49:36.400
And if you wanna get strong, yeah, don't fail.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.560
Don't fail.

49:37.560 --> 49:41.680
So that's how you, they also are believers of volume.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.920
Yeah, there's a lot of strategies,

49:44.920 --> 49:47.360
but volume is a massive principle.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.600
And volume is very hard to achieve

49:50.600 --> 49:53.800
when you're believing in no pain, no gain, right?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.360
They don't really go together.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.600
No pain, no gain, more injuries.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.400
So the, is there parallels?

50:00.400 --> 50:03.080
Cause in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers

50:03.080 --> 50:06.440
of all time are Russian and they were big,

50:06.440 --> 50:07.480
Dan Gable talks about it.

50:07.480 --> 50:11.480
They were big on play, like lighter wrestling.

50:12.240 --> 50:15.520
Probably ultimately actually it boils down to

50:15.520 --> 50:17.920
that's how you achieve higher volume.

50:17.920 --> 50:22.280
Like over the stretch of years, the way to reduce injury.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.520
I mean, in wrestling also technique

50:27.640 --> 50:32.240
might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.800
Obviously technique is extremely important in arm wrestling,

50:34.800 --> 50:39.800
but power is like, can defeat technique, it seems like.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.560
In wrestling, you can get away.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.640
There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,

50:46.640 --> 50:49.000
sort of use leverage on those kinds of things.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.840
So there's even more incentive to do play

50:51.840 --> 50:53.400
and all that kind of stuff.

50:53.400 --> 50:57.040
But do you see the parallels between the two worlds,

50:57.040 --> 50:58.120
wrestling and arm wrestling?

50:58.120 --> 51:01.480
100%, you saw what I did the other night, right?

51:01.480 --> 51:04.240
So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?

51:04.240 --> 51:09.160
So that's my number one training thing that I do

51:09.160 --> 51:14.000
is I go on the table for hours and I play, yeah.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.800
Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video

51:16.800 --> 51:20.320
that's on Devin's channel, the water tank one?

51:20.320 --> 51:22.120
Oh, it's like 180p.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.560
It's like the wifi in there was so bad, yeah.

51:25.560 --> 51:26.880
It's great, I love it.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.720
It's maybe the, I don't know if it was fisheye,

51:29.720 --> 51:32.320
but it had a fisheye feel, it was crowded.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.880
I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing.

51:34.920 --> 51:39.280
But maybe just a brief mention of Dimitri,

51:39.280 --> 51:44.280
the Russian guy, what in that play,

51:46.560 --> 51:48.920
what are some memorable things here?

51:48.920 --> 51:51.280
Like when you go against a bunch of different people,

51:51.280 --> 51:54.040
a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences

51:54.040 --> 51:55.480
and how do you grow from them?

51:55.480 --> 51:56.480
How do you learn from them?

51:56.480 --> 51:58.040
Well, everybody's a bit different.

51:58.040 --> 52:02.160
So I love to go to new clubs

52:02.160 --> 52:04.320
because the energy's always high.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.080
The first time you go to a club,

52:06.080 --> 52:07.480
everybody's trying to kill you.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.320
Yeah.

52:08.320 --> 52:11.040
There's excitement and so you feed off of that.

52:11.040 --> 52:11.880
Yeah, you do.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.400
You can, if you're able to be strong enough

52:14.400 --> 52:17.000
to absorb it without injury, it's awesome.

52:17.000 --> 52:17.840
It's awesome.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.440
Because they're giving you everything they can.

52:20.440 --> 52:23.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

52:23.720 --> 52:26.000
So it's very specific, right?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.080
Like I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.320
And what I try and do when I go to these places

52:31.320 --> 52:33.120
is I make an assumption.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.120
I make an assumption that I'm the best guy there.

52:36.120 --> 52:41.120
And so I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them

52:41.400 --> 52:43.400
because the more I can protect them

52:43.400 --> 52:47.320
and kind of keep them kind of in a good position,

52:47.320 --> 52:49.720
they can actually give me more, right?

52:49.720 --> 52:52.760
So I kind of give them little pieces

52:52.760 --> 52:55.480
that I think will put them in a place

52:55.480 --> 52:58.280
that they can really give me more.

52:58.280 --> 53:00.400
And so yeah, that's what I'm doing.

53:00.400 --> 53:03.680
And then when I see somebody like Dimitri,

53:03.680 --> 53:06.200
I pull that in a little bit, right?

53:06.200 --> 53:09.640
So okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.320
Lots of respect to the guy.

53:12.320 --> 53:15.000
I won't give him all the pieces

53:15.000 --> 53:17.800
until I really kind of gauge where he's at

53:17.800 --> 53:21.440
because I certainly in training don't wanna fail.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.280
I don't want that.

53:22.280 --> 53:25.880
I don't want to, when you fail in arm wrestling,

53:25.880 --> 53:28.480
it's just imagine it's just bad technique

53:28.480 --> 53:30.040
and you're trying and bad technique,

53:30.040 --> 53:31.880
you're gonna get hurt, yeah.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.000
So you always wanna be in a strong position here.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.040
What about, how does endurance come into play here?

53:37.040 --> 53:39.960
And here's video strapping up with Dimitri.

53:39.960 --> 53:40.800
Yeah.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.120
How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don't know,

53:43.120 --> 53:43.960
two hours.

53:43.960 --> 53:44.880
Yeah, it was long.

53:44.880 --> 53:47.320
So the first, this first run of the video,

53:47.320 --> 53:49.120
I think was a little over an hour.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.840
Then I took a break and I probably did

53:50.840 --> 53:53.360
another 45 minutes or so, but.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.560
I mean, do you, how can, are you okay

53:57.560 --> 53:58.840
with the endurance aspect of this?

53:58.840 --> 54:00.320
Yeah, that's probably like,

54:00.320 --> 54:01.720
when you talk to the arm wrestling world,

54:01.720 --> 54:05.040
that's probably what I'm best known for is my endurance.

54:05.040 --> 54:07.120
So this helps build that.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.840
It does, but that's not why I'm doing it.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.040
I'm doing it to get strong.

54:11.040 --> 54:14.760
In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong,

54:14.760 --> 54:18.000
especially far away from a tournament

54:18.000 --> 54:19.380
or any kind of an event.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.080
I wouldn't wanna do this, you know,

54:24.080 --> 54:27.000
even a month or even six weeks

54:27.000 --> 54:29.760
or even maybe even eight weeks before a big event.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.320
I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume,

54:33.320 --> 54:35.720
but far away from an event, yeah,

54:35.720 --> 54:37.480
as much volume as your body can handle

54:37.480 --> 54:39.360
and you'll feel it, you'll feel it.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.600
Like I felt it at times, like, you know,

54:41.600 --> 54:43.120
after the hour mark, I'm like, okay,

54:43.120 --> 54:45.600
I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.720
I can feel like the blood that's going to my muscles

54:48.720 --> 54:53.360
is kind of like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.440
It's, I'm starting to break down and you don't want that.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.960
You don't want that.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.880
Quick pause, bathroom break?

54:59.880 --> 55:00.720
I'm good, I'm good.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.600
Okay, I kind of need one.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.360
I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit, is it cold?

55:05.360 --> 55:06.200
Does that matter?

55:06.200 --> 55:08.440
Does that care for chemical engineering or something?

55:08.440 --> 55:09.280
I can make it warmer.

55:09.280 --> 55:10.800
No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on, it's fine,

55:10.800 --> 55:12.200
but that doesn't matter.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.920
And I still love the idea of you going to Russia

55:14.920 --> 55:16.960
and training there.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.880
I'm also making a trip out to Russia.

55:18.880 --> 55:19.720
Oh yeah, when?

55:19.720 --> 55:20.560
For different reasons.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.280
Well, it's hard with the current conflict,

55:23.280 --> 55:24.200
the tensions there,

55:24.200 --> 55:26.520
but I'm hoping before your match actually,

55:26.520 --> 55:30.480
so May, for a couple of interviews with a couple of folks,

55:31.320 --> 55:32.800
some of which people know.

55:34.400 --> 55:39.000
Maybe I could ask you about to comment on some matches

55:39.000 --> 55:42.840
that stand out to you in your career.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.680
Sure.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.360
Is there something, is there a particular,

55:48.360 --> 55:50.040
I have a bunch that I really enjoy,

55:50.040 --> 55:52.000
but is there something that stands out to you

55:52.960 --> 55:54.280
as memorable?

55:54.280 --> 55:59.280
We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps, to Dennis.

56:00.680 --> 56:04.920
Then you faced Michael Tyler, like we mentioned,

56:04.920 --> 56:08.720
John Brzenk, you faced Matt.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.720
Is there something that stands out to you

56:11.720 --> 56:14.600
that technically or psychologically

56:14.600 --> 56:16.680
you've learned a lot from?

56:17.960 --> 56:20.320
I feel like I try and learn something from every match,

56:20.320 --> 56:22.640
but there is a very special match to me

56:22.640 --> 56:25.000
that to this day, I can't explain.

56:27.840 --> 56:30.320
Very weird phenomena.

56:30.320 --> 56:35.320
So I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas.

56:38.720 --> 56:42.600
So it was a active tour.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.680
Among other things, I got shot during that tour,

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
we got blown, a long tour, rough tour.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.560
And I trained the whole time through

56:53.560 --> 56:55.200
knowing that at the end of this,

56:55.200 --> 56:56.960
I was gonna have a big match.

56:56.960 --> 57:01.240
So there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.040
He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk,

57:05.040 --> 57:06.640
there would be Ron Bath.

57:06.640 --> 57:11.280
Okay, so extremely decorated, unbelievable arm wrestler

57:11.280 --> 57:13.200
from the United States.

57:13.200 --> 57:16.280
And this is kind of when I was just kind of coming up

57:16.280 --> 57:17.600
in the sport still.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.360
I was fairly well established.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.000
I was definitely the best guy in Canada.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And I had been for a few years,

57:23.000 --> 57:26.760
but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much.

57:27.640 --> 57:32.400
So I had a one-on-one match with Ron Bath

57:32.400 --> 57:35.280
and that's the one.

57:35.280 --> 57:39.360
Yeah, extremely hard fought battle.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.560
Was three one, I think, three one,

57:41.560 --> 57:45.920
but every match was really close and he won the first one.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.160
And I had to kind of like dig my way out of the trenches

57:49.160 --> 57:51.440
and ended up coming back and winning.

57:51.440 --> 57:55.280
But it was a match that was,

57:55.280 --> 57:58.280
it was probably one of my closest matches ever.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.760
And it was-

58:00.760 --> 58:02.360
Seems like there's frustration on you.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.200
What is that?

58:03.200 --> 58:06.720
What was going through your mind here with these?

58:06.720 --> 58:07.960
Was it, first of all, going in,

58:07.960 --> 58:09.880
did you think you could beat him?

58:09.880 --> 58:10.720
What was the level of confidence?

58:10.720 --> 58:12.160
I always think I can win.

58:12.160 --> 58:13.480
I can always do.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.880
But a lot of respect to the guy.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.120
But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.640
So what lessons did you take away from it?

58:24.640 --> 58:26.400
Why is it so meaningful to you?

58:27.480 --> 58:29.560
Well, it's what happened afterwards.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.840
So I had some kind of a release afterwards

58:34.000 --> 58:36.280
and that was the strange thing to me.

58:36.280 --> 58:40.080
So match ended

58:41.040 --> 58:44.840
and I felt like so relaxed afterwards,

58:44.840 --> 58:49.600
so calm, so satisfied

58:49.600 --> 58:51.760
because it was one of those matches

58:51.760 --> 58:54.720
that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it.

58:55.840 --> 58:58.800
And I was relaxing in the chair

58:59.800 --> 59:03.480
and I've never had the sensation before.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.360
I've never had it afterwards,

59:05.360 --> 59:09.800
but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded.

59:10.720 --> 59:14.680
And it was like, so weird, right?

59:14.680 --> 59:16.480
Because I'm not really spiritual that much

59:16.480 --> 59:17.880
or religious even,

59:17.880 --> 59:20.840
but it's like a fire just ripped through me

59:20.840 --> 59:22.760
and it only lasted an instant.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.640
Just exploded through my whole body,

59:25.640 --> 59:30.040
out the top, through my feet and then it was gone.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.640
That was it.

59:31.640 --> 59:33.880
Weirdest thing I've ever felt my entire life.

59:35.120 --> 59:39.800
Yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match

59:39.840 --> 59:42.720
and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.

59:46.880 --> 59:48.400
How did you interpret it psychologically?

59:48.400 --> 59:51.720
Was it like some kind of,

59:51.720 --> 59:53.680
I mean, not to be spiritual or whatever,

59:53.680 --> 59:55.560
but some kind of superpower that was

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.280
like a lingering feeling like, holy shit.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.600
I can't explain it

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.400
and I haven't really tried hard enough to try to.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.440
But something changed.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.400
Something happened there, yeah.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.320
Something happened to me.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.720
I was sore for about three or four months afterwards.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.440
It's like it's smoked out my entire body.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.200
Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.480
And yeah, and then after that,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.960
like two or three years later,

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.080
that's when I won the world championships.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.040
Yeah, I mean, all the matches are,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.640
you get something from people,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.880
you study them, you take something from them.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.640
People have an invisible crown and he had one.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.400
And I think I took it from him.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.240
Yeah.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.880
Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.760
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.120
What about all the trash talk?

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.560
How much of that did you learn?

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.880
Does that come naturally to you?

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.960
You're one of the most charismatic, fun,

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.000
I mean, there's always like respect behind it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.120
I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports,

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.840
you're one of the greatest trash talkers in all of sports

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.200
that I've ever seen because you're able to talk shit,

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.720
but there's so much love and respect behind it.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.880
It's just masterful.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.800
But you also get into people's heads in the moment.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.760
It's beautiful to watch because it really gets,

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.240
it gets to some people.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.440
So where does that come from?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.160
It's powerful weapon, right?

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.000
Yeah.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.840
Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.480
And it's underutilized by so many athletes

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.880
because they think that it's not sportsman-like

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.200
or something like that.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.200
But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person,

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.040
but with your voice,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.840
you can influence and change any number of things.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.360
And the same thing happens in a fight between two people.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.680
If you can just be a never ending flow

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.960
of negative encouragement to someone

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.960
or suggestion, anything can happen.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.880
It's a tool.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.320
And when you're fighting a person,

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.400
you're not just fighting them.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.840
You're fighting everyone who's watching.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.240
You're fighting the crowd, the referees.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.240
And to get in the most ideal positions, situations,

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.120
you need to use your voice.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:27.960
Yeah.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.520
There's, for people who haven't seen,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.040
I definitely recommend you watch

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.320
a bunch of arm wrestling matches

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.040
because there's a crowd really gets into it.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.000
And it feels like there's a really intimate connection

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.360
with the crowd, I suppose,

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.400
because the crowd is allowed to be very close to you.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.240
I love it.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.560
I want the crowd right up on me.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.720
Yeah.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.160
So sometimes.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.000
Oh yeah.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.480
So whenever you talk to somebody,

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.240
you literally pick somebody from the crowd.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.080
Oh yeah.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:02:59.920
Oh yeah.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.040
I'll fuck him.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.200
Like I'll start fucking off his fans.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.720
And like, yeah.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.360
Like I'll start talking to their wives or whatever.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.200
Yeah.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.040
Yeah.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.760
There's Jodie.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.120
She's pretty dangerous to listen to also.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.320
But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solaris,

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.560
who's, you know, really good arm wrestler

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.880
was cheering for him.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.360
So I started to go after him.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.200
Yeah.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.800
Smiling the whole time.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.120
Yeah, it's fun, right?

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:29.960
It's fun.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.800
It's fun, it's fun to listen to.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.360
But it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.680
some of the people you're facing.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.800
They get frustrated.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.640
Yeah.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.460
It's great to see.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.920
Well, you have to fight, right?

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.000
Like a lot of people think things will be given to them.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.560
And the thing that, you know,

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.520
I've always believed from the time I was very young,

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.520
like I was convinced that our inevitable death

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.840
was gonna come from aliens, right?

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.120
Like some super aggressive, super violent species

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.600
was gonna come and smoke us all, you know?

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.440
And I'm like, I'm not like that.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.920
I'm like, but as soon as one person is,

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.720
then you're forced to have to accept it as reality, right?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.720
So I like to fight for every single thing.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.280
I like to try and be more and more aggressive.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.240
And if someone matches me,

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.000
that's when I can use my endurance.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.400
And if they don't, then I have the tactical advantage.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.160
So that's kind of my balance point.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.680
And then, by the way, you also yell at the ref.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.520
Yeah.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.400
I mean, the games, there's like levels to this game.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.440
But, you know, the feeling sometimes

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.680
when people get frustrated is like,

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.360
okay, this person's cheating,

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.480
or like you're trying to get a good grip

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.320
before the go, before it goes.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.040
And I think some of the frustration

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.720
in combination with the trash talk

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.640
is what this person is cheating.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.480
Right.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.600
But everybody is like kind of trying to cheat.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.880
Get an edge within the rules.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.800
Yeah.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.000
So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.760
But, you know, everybody's different.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.880
I've learned how to play the game

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.320
based off of the tools that I have physically.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.760
And for me, this works because, you know,

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.440
my genetic makeup is more of a persistence hunter, right?

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.560
So like, I need to extend things.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.000
And that works well for me.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.000
You know, if I was more explosive,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.560
I probably wouldn't have the same strategies.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.400
Yeah.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.280
By the way, for people who are watching,

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.760
you're wearing a No Limits hoodie,

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.280
which is one of your nicknames.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.360
I don't wash this thing too much.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.440
It's my bacterial shield to the world.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.280
Yeah.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.520
Yeah.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.360
Awesome.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.120
Jody, she's often in your corner

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.760
and does perhaps more trash talking than even you.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.400
So, I mean, if we could step away,

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.280
she's an incredible human being as sort of as a fan.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.120
It's fun to watch the two of you,

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.360
both when you're arm wrestling and just as people.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.680
You just see so much, I don't know,

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.840
kindness and love radiating from the two of you

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.040
whenever you're trash talking or talking about

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.640
random things or just talking about life.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.040
It's just a beautiful thing to watch.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.440
And thank you for sharing that with the world.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.440
But maybe, can you, she paid me to ask you this.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.200
Of course you did.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.680
What are the things you love about Jody, your wife,

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.520
Jody Larratt?

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.560
What are the ways she has affected your life?

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.640
Jody and I go way back, right?

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.240
We were in high school together.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.240
The thing that I admire most in people is bravery.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.800
To me, it's the most admirable quality.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.840
And Jody always has inspired me

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.840
because she's such a fighter.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.840
If she believes that something's true,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.960
she does not back down, she will not.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.040
And not to say that she can't change her mind,

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.400
because she can, but while she is convicted,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.360
she will not stop fighting.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.400
She's pulled me out of the fire repeatedly.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.640
We've lived through so many things, very lucky.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.240
How has she made you a better arm wrestler?

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.160
She's fed me.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.320
Yeah, I could see your videos of your house

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.560
basically coming apart when she's not there.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.680
Yeah, without Jody, I'm on the street,

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.080
living in a tent, and eating dog food.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.000
Bravery.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
What about love?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.680
How has love made you stronger?

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.160
Now we're gonna make Devin uncomfortable.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.200
Love is difficult to accept.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Love is one of those things that a lot of times

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.560
you don't feel worthy of it.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.880
And so it's hard sometimes to accept someone's love.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.880
And someone who really loves you,

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.840
they'll love you even when you don't.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.000
And here you go, you're gonna make me cry, Lex.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.560
Yeah, Jody and I have been through so much.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.480
And she's shown me how she's supported me

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.640
just repeatedly, repeatedly.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.640
Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.840
and all those things.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.680
That's like when love really shows itself.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.880
It's like sticking through together for years,

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.120
even when you're through the shitty times.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.480
Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe.

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.480
Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.080
As a world, even between people.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.080
When love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.040
And I've been graced by the love that Jody's given me.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.840
It's allowed me to continue to build.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.680
When you have love between people, then you build together.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.800
I love my family, I love Canada,

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.440
I love the arm wrestling community.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.640
I have a love for what we're trying to achieve

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.840
as a human species.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.760
When that falls apart, we don't have much.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.560
Yeah, she's with my boy there, yeah.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.400
Yeah.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.120
You also mentioned you once had a job

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.560
where your death was a real possibility.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.040
So you were on the Canadian Special Forces.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.560
What did you take away from that experience,

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.920
that time in life?

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.880
It was such a great life.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.160
Really, really loved it.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.640
Honestly, I never wanted to leave.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.880
I never thought I would leave.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.680
I thought I'd be there my whole life.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.320
Real honor to get to serve.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.760
What did you get to do?

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.640
What was the things you loved, craftsmanship-wise,

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.920
fun things you get to do, learn and challenge yourself,

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.920
and you mentioned honor in terms of the serving part.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.080
Yeah.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.480
Yeah, my favorite thing about serving

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.160
in the Special Forces was,

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.520
for sure, the people that I worked with.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.720
That's probably the first thing I could say.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.400
I never, I always felt totally comfortable

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.520
in putting my life in the other guy's hands.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.960
I was so happy to be in a place

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.360
where I felt I could follow.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.920
It didn't matter.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.400
I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.600
I knew the people beside me were incredible.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.000
Just having that faith in your team is very special.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.600
To know that they're there for a reason

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.280
that has nothing to do with money.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.600
That's what brings everybody together,

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.520
is you're there for a higher purpose.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.360
In terms of being an adrenaline junkie,

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.720
there's nothing like it.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.760
There's nothing like going out at night and fighting.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.600
When I say fighting, my whole life I wanted to fight.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.880
To me, there's a lot of,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.480
and look, I've said this in the past,

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.880
and I think it's been a personal failure of mine

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.600
because I've said things like,

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.120
it's the highest level that you can do,

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.320
and I don't believe that to be true anymore.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.320
At the time, I thought it was the best way I could express

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.240
my drives that I had, to be a fighter.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.760
So your sense in the past, and maybe in part now,

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.480
is that fighting is when humans get a chance

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.520
to express themselves deeply.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.200
That mix of the bravery, the integrity,

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.280
whatever that is that makes us human,

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.120
that human spirit can really shine.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.680
And I don't believe that anymore.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.920
I believe that you can do that in any field,

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.520
in any discipline.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.680
If you go hard enough, it all kind of starts

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680
to feel the same.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.840
But at the time, that expression to me

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.400
was really, really awesome.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.680
I loved close quarter battle.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.880
That was my favorite thing.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.080
That's really the whole reason I was there.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.320
Can you describe close quarter battle?

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.160
Close quarter battle is team fighting.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.640
So, and it can look a lot of different ways,

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.440
but basically it's ground troops

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.480
doing some kind of a mission.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.240
And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.400
The orchestrated movement and the drills

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.160
done quickly and accurately, it's very difficult.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.760
With communication?

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.600
With communication.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.280
Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together,

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.240
communicating, there's some strategy,

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.920
there's some adapting to the changing environment.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.480
And the more the team works together,

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.080
the less communication there is.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.600
And that's an amazing thing to do, to be part of a machine,

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.640
well, machine, a team of people

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.800
who can fight together like that.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.320
I think we're really designed to do it.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.600
As good as we can fight as individuals,

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.000
the thing that makes us really good

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.440
is our ability to fight as a team.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.760
Yeah.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.520
Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.960
is that collective intelligence is a social aspect.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.640
And fighting is the highest of stakes,

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.280
so that social interaction under the highest of stakes

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.280
really does bring out something that's deeply human.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.400
I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.600
It does.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.440
It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:19.960
that it results in so much loss of life

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.920
and well-being.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.360
Let me, if it's okay for a brief moment

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.680
to take us back to arm wrestling.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.680
We did this like offline, we talked about,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.040
you gave me some advice about arm wrestling,

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.200
but maybe do a high level overview of

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.000
like the different styles and strategies

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.400
that we've talked about.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.640
We talked about the importance of strength and power,

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.920
but is there like offensive, defensive styles?

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.760
Is there, we mentioned king's move.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:55.800
What would you classify your style as?

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.320
It's nice for people that don't know,

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.720
maybe even zoom back out.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.720
So arm wrestling is a sport where two people

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.840
have to, when we talk about strictly the sport,

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.200
put their elbow on a particular pad,

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.440
means they have to keep that elbow on that pad,

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.480
and they win when the back of one of their hands

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.800
crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.120
And when you actually lock up,

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.760
you do so depending on the organization without straps,

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.720
meaning there's just you agree,

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.080
it's like mutual agreement that you're going to

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.120
clasp your hands in a way that's fair,

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.600
and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair,

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.920
but of course there's these little games going on.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.360
And then when you actually go all out with this battle,

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.840
if there's no straps, you can slip out.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.920
So often you'll put the straps,

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.360
which means it's like marriage, you're committed,

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.320
for like somebody will have to lose essentially,

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.560
there's no pulling out.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.280
So that's sort of the battle within that.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.480
What are the different styles that you can speak to

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.520
that people that don't know arm wrestling could understand?

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.560
Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance around

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.160
the subject a bit.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.880
I'd say there's a lot of different types.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.880
There's specialists, and there's kind of blenders

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.080
and people who are very versatile.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.320
A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.320
They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll,

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.920
and their style is very kind of focused.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.600
And you'll see it with a lot of athletes,

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.160
like kind of talk about a guy who's very active,

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.760
a guy called Jerry Catterett.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760
Okay, as soon as you think Jerry Catterett,

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.000
he's got a very unique style.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.040
He's got a flop wrist press, okay?

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.680
So most of his technique is built around this one system.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:09.480
Flop wrist means what it sounds like.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.800
So your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're losing.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.520
So he is pushing from a losing position.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.080
No, he will be offensive.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.400
So he will be in a press, so offensively.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.520
So he'll give his hand away

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.760
so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.400
So he doesn't, wow.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.240
So you can press, press means like push.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.080
Push. Yeah.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.280
Without having that hook position.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.320
Right, which is what most people are always looking for.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.840
And Jerry's looking for it as well.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.760
And then, so example, there's another one.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.400
There's another specialist, Matt Mask.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.240
Yeah.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.280
He's a top roller.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.760
Right.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.800
Basically, that's his great move, the top roll.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.760
And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.880
Just incredible top roll.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.440
And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.320
They have a lot of good options.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.120
I think that I'd probably fall more into that category.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.760
You have people who are more speed guys.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.760
So they try and do very little, I'd call it attrition.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.400
So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.280
because they have faith that their gas tank or their pool

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280
eventually will tire the other person out.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.280
So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.600
Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan,

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.640
he was very, very well known as being extremely explosive.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.280
But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.600
Based off of your genetics, your hands,

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.560
there's a lot of ways to skin it.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.760
So I think you said something like,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.880
you're a 20 second guy.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.720
That's right.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.320
I'm a 20 second guy.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.240
So what are the seconds we're talking about?

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.800
So a lot of the power people,

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.880
they wanna win in the first maybe five seconds.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.200
Even shorter.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.920
Just that first push, that first press.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.840
Absolutely.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.760
And that's it.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.640
Right to the pad, yeah.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.440
And so you're trying to hold off that attack.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.480
Yeah, if I beat you in a second,

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.880
we're not in the same world.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.600
When I'm with my peer group,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.880
I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.800
That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.760
Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers,

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.360
they'll win in a second, right?

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.200
That's how they do it.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.040
That's the way they're built.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.680
That's the way they train.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.120
Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.080
starts to kinda get,

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.400
it starts to get more and more difficult

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.880
to be a specialist at the high level now.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.440
Some people just have little holes in their games.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.360
It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.440
It's very rare.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.520
Where would you put Lavon?

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720
I would not say he's a specialist.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.680
I'd say his top roll is the strongest move.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.520
Top roll.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.760
Top roll is the strongest move, yeah.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:18.680
And the interesting thing about the specialist

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.760
versus the blender,

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.840
there's a counter, right?

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.320
Every move has a move

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.400
that theoretically should be the right choice.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.680
So if you're a single move guy,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.640
there's gonna be a guy out there who'll get you.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.480
Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.160
But when you come to a tournament,

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.600
typically specialists do much better

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.400
in tournament scenarios because their singular move

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.880
can get them through a tournament

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.040
very quickly and efficiently,

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.320
whereas you get a blender in a tournament,

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.800
they typically will have longer and more difficult matches.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.440
But in supermatch format,

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.840
typically blenders do better.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.720
So we offline also talked about arm sumo

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.520
or freedom arm wrestling.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.720
I don't know how you wanna call it.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.120
Oh, I love freedom.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:14.960
Well.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.200
Exactly, North American way.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.400
So this is this idea,

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.920
and I watched a few videos and it looks fun,

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.040
is basically removing the restriction

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.120
of having to keep your elbow on the pad

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.400
and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.040
I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.840
is it might be injury prone or something like that.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.040
So can you describe this arm sumo,

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.520
freedom arm wrestling idea?

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.520
When you come to freedom arm wrestling,

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.640
basically it removes the limitation

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.840
of a standard arm wrestling table.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.480
So basically every single thing

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.080
is a freedom arm wrestling table.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.960
Some are better than others.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.000
So looking for that nice table

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.120
where we can stand apart from each other

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:07.040
and we're anatomically in a fairly safe position.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.000
And the rules in freedom,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.760
the way you win is the knuckles

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.160
must either touch the tabletop

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.880
or you hold it off the edge for a three count, right?

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.240
So this is the main way to win.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.080
Yes, you can foul like if you lift your elbow up,

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.200
still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.840
So your elbow is no longer limited

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.600
to your seven by seven or seven by nine pad.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.000
So you can move it all over the table.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.080
You can move your body around the table a bit too.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.360
And if it's a big table,

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.280
your body could largely be on the table.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.120
Yeah, so it basically it's like adjusting your ring size.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.680
So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth, right?

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.360
So you're fighting in a field,

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.920
you're fighting, you know, just bigger.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.280
So it just makes the sport bigger.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.520
Yeah, this is Japan.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.120
But even on a small table there,

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.480
even in a slightly larger phone booth,

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.600
you can get a lot more fun and variety.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.440
It's very interesting to watch.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.480
Way more, I love it.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.840
I think it makes the sport bigger.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.520
I actually believe that it's the future of the sport.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.880
I really do.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.120
Because it makes it more accessible.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.240
Like you don't need the equipment,

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.320
right, you do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.920
Yeah, less equipment requirements.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.000
Kids, most kids start freedom.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.400
Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah, and like if you see a guy on the street,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.720
like whatever, like you can arm wrestle anywhere.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.440
You don't need to bring your table around with you.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.840
If we talked about the elite level,

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.840
if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.840
or like going from just like, you go to the gym,

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.880
you kind of lift, you've arm wrestled a few times,

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.920
trying to get better at it, trying to learn.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.040
How would you advise getting better

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.440
to where you can beat your closest buddies?

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.280
Yeah.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.320
That first step.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.760
First step, I'd say find people.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.040
Find people, find good people.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.560
It's volume.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.400
We'll get with a club.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.600
Get with people who know what they're doing,

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.000
who can mentor you.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.840
And that's really cool.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.640
I got to meet, I realized there's a club in Austin.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.480
Yeah.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.320
I'm sure there's in a lot of places.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.160
Well, they're everywhere.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.040
We got this app called Armbet, yeah.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.040
Which is a app that helps you find other people there.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.320
Yeah, very easy.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.480
But I mean, they're all over social networks.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.520
I mean, it's kind of widespread now,

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.840
but yeah, find people, find people.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.800
And it's just much easier to learn with another person

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.720
and you'll get stronger that way.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.400
But I mean, do the lifts.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.600
I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.960
And right away, those will technically prepare you.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.400
What are the lifts?

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.240
Can we describe what the lifts are?

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.080
Yeah.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.600
So I'd say if you want to just keep it very, very simple,

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.840
let's just talk about three.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840
There's much more than three.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.120
But when you talk about energy allocation,

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.680
these three lifts, in my opinion,

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.320
should be like 90% of your investment.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.040
It's very big, these three lifts.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.560
And the exact percentages, you can argue about it,

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.200
but we'll start off with the cupping of the wrist.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.240
Just this, it's a simple thing.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.880
And do it with a cable.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.960
You can get a thicker diameter,

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.240
so it kind of is more out on your fingers

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.320
where an arm wrestler's gonna attack you, right?

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.480
Because any good arm wrestler's gonna attack your fingers.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.080
So like open hand.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.280
No.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.880
Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.960
But if you want to be really specific,

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.680
you train exactly the way you would at a table,

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.000
in the position that you actually start that edge.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.520
And then you're just doing this kind of thing.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.240
Yes, to your center.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.320
One of the big misconceptions in arm wrestling

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.760
is that you're aiming for that pin pad.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.120
No, center.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:56.960
The chest up here.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.200
Bring it close to you.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.760
Make it come close to you, right?

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.080
You see, like whenever I do my exercises,

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.560
the vector is always pulling straight towards me.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.400
Yeah.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.040
Yeah, so just cupping close to you.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.520
The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:15.400
on an arm wrestling match is just pull me away from my body.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.440
That's a terrible thing for me.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.440
Yeah, so that cupping, that's a massive part of the sport.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.880
So now when you think,

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.400
what does the cup do to the other person?

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.120
If I cup, they get turned over, right?

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.120
So this has to get really strong.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.080
This pronation, so.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.960
So to fight that rolling.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.280
Exactly, yeah.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.280
So that's through the thumb.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.240
Yeah, oh, so you put, got it.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.800
You put on the thumb and you put this motion.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.680
Yeah.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.520
Got it.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.240
Yeah, and those two things, those two things together,

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.320
this cupping and rolling,

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.240
this is what's gonna make the person's hand bend back.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.360
And once the person's hand is bent back,

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.960
they're just, their whole game gets cut to pieces.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.880
They have very little good options.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.160
It's all like nasty stuff.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.080
Wow. Yeah.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:18.040
So those two things, that's a huge part of your investment.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.840
Rise.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.360
Always be climbing.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.240
Yeah, those three simple things,

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.680
that's what I would tell anybody

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.280
to spend most of their time on,

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.840
if you wanna become an art wrestler.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.120
So, and to use bands would be good for this.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.480
Bands are great because they're easy to transport.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.200
The only problem I have with bands is,

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.240
like, if you like to measure, you know,

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.240
and if you like to be precise,

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.680
bands just aren't that precise.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.200
Right, so to have growth.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.040
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.880
Just, I mean, it's just like, you know,

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.560
you know exactly what you need.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.400
The prescription is kind of, a band is kind of like,

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.600
and a lot of people, myself included,

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.600
I like to know exactly my outputs, so weights.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.160
So would it be like cables?

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.080
Yep, cables are nice.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.040
Bands are great too.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.680
I mix the two.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:13.400
Bands are when I kind of don't need to,

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.720
they're more like easy for me.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.360
When I train bands, bands are dangerous

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.160
because the acceleration is so high on them.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.000
Like when you screw up with band training,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.320
the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.680
So if you do something bad,

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.520
it can make it go really much worse.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.440
Yeah.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.040
It's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or...

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.680
Well, it's a chain.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.520
It's a chain.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.200
And so you're, I mean, the idea,

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.720
if you focus on these three, the other stuff catches up.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.360
Like, it's all involved.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.040
This whole thing is involved.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.920
So if you have an axe, right?

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.920
The blade of the axe, that's these things, right?

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.440
Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.520
to be awesome, right?

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.560
If you have a super sharp axe,

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.760
you could have a shitty hand.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.120
Exactly, yeah, right?

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.920
Yeah, so focus on that, the pointy, the tip of the axe.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.200
Yeah, the tip of the axe is so important, right?

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.120
Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it,

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.720
what's it good for, right?

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.640
Yeah, I think a lot of the motions

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.680
with the wrist that you mentioned are,

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.640
just thinking about jiu-jitsu, especially in the gi,

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.680
there's a lot of, I mean, there's so much importance to this

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.680
and people don't often work it explicitly.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.400
So many of the chokes require ability to,

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.480
it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.320
Very close.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.120
You're weak here, what's that called, flop wrist,

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.400
and you're strong with the cup, yeah.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.680
And so just getting the muscle, whatever that's involved,

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.360
the muscle, the turning, the pressure,

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.120
because that's where also the choke comes.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:57.680
That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.280
is also the thing that finishes the person

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.160
when you have them grabbed.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.720
The strength is very similar.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.480
Yeah, it's fascinating actually.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.280
Of course, like you said, if you want to be very good,

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.320
you should be doing the very specific, exact motion.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.640
So if I was gonna do jiu-jitsu,

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.560
I'd be like working out with the gi.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:20.280
Yeah, the problem is, it's difficult to construct

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.640
the exact, so you have to actually go with people

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.440
and then they don't like being choked on.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.640
Right, so like it's hard to, I'm actually a big,

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:34.160
we have these kinds of debates all the time is,

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.440
I'm a big believer in drilling.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.760
I love doing something thousands of times.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.120
Like John Donahue, somebody I mentioned to you

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.000
about the jiu-jitsu folks here,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
they're less believers in drilling.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
They see the value of, almost like the mind of going live

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.560
and exploring ideas, it's that play.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.920
You don't need to do the thing a thousand times.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.960
You just need to always be thinking about the little details

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.280
that make you better and then in action practicing,

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.920
like developing the strength, the power,

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.360
the explosion of the agility in action.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.800
So actually rolling.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.080
I agree with this, but I just believe in volume more.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.160
Yeah, so you can accomplish it through volume.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.760
You can play a lot.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.720
Yes, exactly.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.440
Well, if you really want to get it good,

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.960
is you're talking about, I mean, that's why

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.440
a lot of these folks are training three times a day.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.000
They're doing, they're putting in the hours,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.120
eight hours, nine hours, just-

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.880
Well, that's tough, oh my God.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.040
Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.400
It's just being on the mat.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.000
Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.800
watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.800
It's just, it's like, it's not just physical.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.880
It's mental too, because you're keeping in your mind.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.280
And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.840
that they've talked with, the fighters.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.000
At the top of their career, they basically,

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.360
George St. Pierre is like this.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.280
Another fellow Canadian is like,

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.400
he has stick figures in his head that he can't help.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.920
They're like in there, because if you train enough hours,

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.440
you're, it's just gonna be in your head

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.840
and they're all going to be playing around in your head.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.880
And some little detail over time,

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.800
it's almost like computing or something like that.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.560
And that ends up having a result,

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.760
even though you're not physically doing anything.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.760
It's always in there.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.320
I do have to return to diet real quick.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.880
I know we talk about pancakes.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.880
Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.200
I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.400
So you have to get big, you have to get powerful,

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.800
you have to get strong.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.800
What is the right diet for you for that?

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.040
Like, what do you eat?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.600
How often do you eat?

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.040
Yeah, from the highest detail to the smallest,

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.520
or the things that make you happy and feel good.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.520
Yeah, I've experimented with every diet.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.760
I've done it all.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.760
I've been a vegan, I've done raw, I've eaten only meat.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.600
I've eaten balanced, I've eaten like a bodybuilder,

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.560
you name it, I've probably tried it.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.760
I don't believe that it's as important

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.400
in the sport of arm wrestling

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.560
as it is perhaps in other sports.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.440
I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.200
I mean, if you're eating enough food,

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.700
you're probably gonna be okay.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.600
So it's just calories.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.040
I mean, really, I mean, not to overcomplicate it,

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.080
but I mean, that's where the conversation starts,

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.480
are you eating enough food?

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.560
And it can come in any number of ways,

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.360
and I don't think it's as important

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.120
as a lot of other people do.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.640
I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot,

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.400
but the thing is, back to like volume, right?

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:21.680
Like, you need to, if you wanna be a super heavyweight,

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.240
it's very different than if you wanna be

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.000
a weight category guy.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.680
If you wanna be a weight category guy,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.160
I'd say that you need to be more responsible,

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.960
make better choices.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.280
If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.280
So we're watching a delicious looking omelet,

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.760
so eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don't care, carbs,

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.400
so in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now,

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.040
and I landed on that, there's several things,

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.480
obviously I'm not, but I do a lot of sport,

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.640
and I was very surprised how my particular,

01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.600
very specific body can perform better with only meat.

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.480
Why better?

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.280
The sports I do, the mind matters,

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.160
and so for some reason, my mind's just clear,

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.040
and I don't think, because it feels unhealthy,

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.840
it just makes me feel really good,

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.720
I don't think I would recommend it to anybody else,

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:18.360
so it's interesting that that journey

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.760
of just exploring can take you to figure out

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.960
something about your own self.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.000
One of the most interesting things

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.360
that I heard about nutrition was,

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.200
I heard there was a-

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.240
I actually put Doritos on, I forgot about that.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.080
Now, I'd say over the last couple years,

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.800
I've really gone into carbs a lot,

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.200
and high glycemic carbs, and just to,

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.880
I feel like it's one of the best things you can do

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.320
if you're working out really hard, just-

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.880
Cheers. Add carbs, yeah.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.720
Exactly.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.240
But, oh, where was I?

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.960
So, you've added-

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:57.800
Distracted.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.640
Syrup is-

01:35:58.640 --> 01:35:59.460
I forget everything.

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.300
It's so delicious, it's distracting.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.600
No, so you've added high glycemic carbs into the mix,

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.600
so those help, but that's for mass building.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.160
Right, so there was a study that I heard about

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.960
by somebody who's trying to identify heart attacks.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.680
They did this great big study,

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.600
and at the end of it, I mean,

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.880
it didn't matter what the people ate,

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.620
the most important thing was how they felt

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.720
about the food that they were eating.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.600
Yeah, so if you believe in the food,

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.680
if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you,

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.800
and if you allocate it the right way,

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.400
it's gonna have a positive impact,

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.640
and I try and do that no matter what it is.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.140
I have my foods that I think do certain things,

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:45.140
and so, for me, I know that actually,

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:49.880
I mean, I learned about corn-fed pumps when I was overseas.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.340
I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn't.

01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.640
I ate super clean all the time,

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:03.540
and when I was faced with imminent death more,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.900
I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight,

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:12.080
let's have a couple ice cream bars, you know, like whatever,

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.120
and what I realized is if I eat an entire bag of chips,

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.720
or a bunch of chocolate bars,

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.020
and then I go and have a workout,

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:28.680
my workout will be incredible, it'll be incredible.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:35.240
There's something about easily processed carbohydrates

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.240
that will continue to quickly get into your blood

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.880
as fast as you can burn it,

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.640
and there's something about that

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.640
that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.940
And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that,

01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.420
and then believing it works,

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.640
and that's not how it makes it work better.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.480
Exactly.

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.200
I mean, I feel that way.

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.320
I think this is really not,

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.820
this has been frustrating to me about the health culture

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.920
in the United States, in the studies that are done.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.120
You look at like the importance of sleep,

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.060
the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things.

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.400
I wish incorporated into that

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.440
would be your mental relationship with all these things.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.960
So for example, people that tell me,

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:26.520
well, your sleep schedule is insane.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.280
Yes, perhaps, but also it's insane

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.680
because I'm doing what I love

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.720
and I don't see it as a problem,

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.720
and I think that's really important to understand.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.200
If you're sleeping crazy hours

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.040
is not affecting your stress

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.000
and is actually making you happy

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.680
or you're drawing some kind of source

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.160
of happiness and pleasure and satisfaction,

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.940
like being awake when others aren't,

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:57.600
it's like the Mike Tyson thing or something,

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.240
like training when you've convinced yourself

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.720
everybody's sleeping and therefore

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.160
you're somehow training much better.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.820
That's powerful even if you look statistically

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:10.140
six hours may be worse than eight hours

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:12.380
or four hours may be worse than six hours.

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.500
So the mind is a powerful thing.

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.260
Super powerful.

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:18.100
But if you wanna be a super heavyweight.

01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:19.500
Eat.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.380
You gotta eat like stupid amounts all the time, yeah.

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.380
You have to test your digestive system.

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:26.620
What's your favorite meal, by the way?

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:29.820
Just if you had to, you know, the last meal.

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:34.380
I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.740
It's tough, but I'd say the food that I rely on a lot

01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.060
when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi.

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.860
Just because it normally comes in an all you can eat format.

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:48.540
You know, so I love to go and just binge

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.740
all you can eat buffets.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.460
Sushi is just super convenient.

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:53.780
Yeah.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.220
If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.980
I'd be terrified when I saw you.

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.100
Have you had barbecue at Texas?

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.660
Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah.

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.100
So you, just a small tangent on this,

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.820
you face the mountain.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.660
Oh yeah.

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.500
You have four, well first of all you arm wrestled them.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.340
It's interesting to ask, so this is the mountain

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:18.580
from the Game of Thrones, strong man,

01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:20.540
one of the strongest people in the world for a time,

01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.020
the strongest person in the world.

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:25.220
What was it like, I know sort of you guys maybe

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.500
weren't going 1000%, but what's it like?

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.900
Well he probably wasn't going 1000%.

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.940
Yeah.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.060
But like what, it's interesting to think

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.820
what does that strength feel like?

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:41.300
So it's a specialized strength in another sport.

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.860
What did it feel like?

01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:46.100
What, how strong was he?

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.580
What is some kind of deep insights

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.620
you drawn from that battle?

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:55.260
I feel like if we were to go back 1000 years

01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.380
and if you give him armor and a two handed sword,

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:03.860
he will just rip across the landscape.

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.500
And no one will stop him.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.100
So this is a boxing match between the two,

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.820
but there's also a video of them arm wrestling.

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.740
Yeah, what a titan though.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.060
What a titan, you know, a guy like that,

01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:21.420
tall, strong, fit, disciplined.

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.220
I mean he is, he's quite a warrior.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.940
419 pounds.

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:29.820
Yeah, yeah, he's incredibly impressive.

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:33.660
I really like Hap Thor and I like Eddie Hall too.

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:38.540
I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:42.860
Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson,

01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:46.420
two of the strongest legendary strong men that we have.

01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.660
And they were the coolest,

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:52.500
they were the top when strong man was really super cool.

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.660
I don't know all the details,

01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.420
but they legit hit each other.

01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:00.500
Like legit.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.180
So I think it kind of stems.

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:03.820
I don't know, like I say,

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:05.500
I'm not right there with them,

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:10.500
but Eddie won the World's Strongest Man event

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.220
or something one year.

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:15.380
And like, and the thing is it was one of those victories

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:20.060
where Hap Thor, you know, was not accepting of his defeat.

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.020
Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth.

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:23.140
Basically from what I understand,

01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.060
they were gonna fight like the night

01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:27.220
of the World's Strongest Man.

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.180
And they kind of got pulled apart

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:33.460
and this heat between them got translated

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.660
into a potential boxing match.

01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.140
So it's very real.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.260
It's a very real fight.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.540
So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.460
are gonna fight each other.

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.340
So I've been like, you know,

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.780
cause arm wrestling is strong, man.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.660
It's kind of similar communities.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.580
Who do you got?

01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:53.900
If you were giving me financial advice.

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.340
Oh, Jesus.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.540
I am so bad.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.780
I always call it wrong.

01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:59.500
They're very different.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:03.740
I see Hap Thor's being, you know.

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.820
Eddie Hall is slimming down.

01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:06.300
Is that what you think as well?

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.820
I see Hap Thor is a bit more regimented,

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:13.740
but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric.

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:17.700
And like, I think he's a little bit more athletic,

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.460
but Hap Thor is bigger.

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:22.900
And, you know, they've chosen slightly different paths

01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:24.300
to prepare for the match.

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:27.340
But what happened was like they were about to fight

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.060
and Eddie Hall blew his bicep.

01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.300
So me, I was getting ready for LaVon in December.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.260
We were supposed to arm wrestle in December,

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.620
but he's got his movie.

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:39.460
And so I was like, okay,

01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.060
I can kind of get away from the sport just a little bit,

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.620
broaden my base.

01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:44.460
That happened.

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.140
And I was like, oh, an opportunity.

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:47.980
You stepped in.

01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.420
An opportunity to fight.

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:50.900
I'm like, I'll do it.

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.100
How much training, you trained a little bit.

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.740
So can you tell about your own decision to do that?

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.700
What was the training like?

01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.700
What was the experience like?

01:43:58.700 --> 01:43:59.980
Oh, it was so much fun.

01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:01.660
It was so much fun.

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.580
So basically I made a funny video

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.700
and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.740
that I would do it.

01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.580
I'm like, I'll do it.

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:13.820
I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it.

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.900
But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man.

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.940
Like I'm gimped up like everywhere

01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.540
outside the arm wrestling lanes.

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.620
I said, but I will 100%.

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.660
Like if you let me fight him, I'll give it my all.

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.580
And whatever, they didn't get back to me.

01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.420
They're like, yeah, whatever.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:33.540
Okay, so then they call me on a Friday,

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.060
like five weeks before the event.

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:39.980
And they're like, hey, Devin, were you serious?

01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:41.260
And I'm like, oh shit.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.500
And I'm like, yes, I was serious.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.580
Yeah, I'll do it.

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.700
And they're like, okay.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:54.420
They're like, it's down to you and like two other people.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:56.260
We'll get back to you in a day or two.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.700
But you would do it.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:58.540
And I'm like, okay.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:44:59.860
So they got back to me on Sunday.

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:03.180
So right away I'm like skipping rope.

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.580
And I'm like, and I only arm wrestle legs.

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.620
That's all I do.

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.540
So what was your, you did some striking training.

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:14.500
Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome.

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.420
Zach, Ben Bushida there.

01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.580
That was it from TriStar.

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.100
Do you know Farah Sahabi?

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.980
And yes, people in the comments,

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:25.860
I will interview him on this podcast.

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:28.340
He's brilliant, right?

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.740
He's an incredible guy.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.460
So right away, like I had no idea

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.860
about the fight community across Canada really.

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:37.260
And I got like, by the fifth message

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:40.340
that said you must train with Farah,

01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.220
I was like, okay, called him up.

01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.460
He was incredible right away.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.100
He's like, yeah, you can come and we'll just work with you.

01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:48.540
So I got the call.

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:52.020
I called him on like Monday at two o'clock.

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.820
By like seven o'clock I had my things packed

01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:58.540
and I went to Montreal and I spent four weeks

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:00.180
in the fighter dorms.

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.300
Just humbling yourself.

01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:04.900
Yeah, every day just getting punched in the face.

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:10.340
Over and over, going for runs with all,

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.140
like they're all like Olympians and pro fighters

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:14.020
living in the dorms, super cool dudes.

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.260
They were so good to me.

01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.260
Yeah, there's a good video of you and Farah just talking.

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:21.660
Yeah, I don't remember which stage this was,

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.220
but this is early.

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:25.460
But you were already beginning to get humbled.

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.700
Oh man, I knew.

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.660
I mean, I knew what I was getting into.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:32.020
Like I knew it was gonna be a losing battle,

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.340
but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor,

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.140
like how cool is that?

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:40.380
Like I had to say, I had to do it.

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.540
I loved the process and I learned a lot from doing it.

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.220
Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that

01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.060
with arm wrestling.

01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.300
I think we're big enough now

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:55.820
that we can have these kind of dorms, frat houses,

01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:57.100
whatever you wanna call it.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:57.940
What's the dorm like?

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.700
So you're basically staying there, food is there.

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:03.780
So you mentioned, what was the word you used?

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.620
Administration?

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.260
Yeah, exactly, that's it.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.460
So it removes all of that.

01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.500
Makes it so simple.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:09.700
You can just focus.

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.980
The gym is here, you live here.

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:15.260
But your life becomes simple.

01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:19.020
So there's a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America.

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:20.540
He's a famous coach.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.740
He has a place up in Boston.

01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:23.740
He has kind of a dorm like that too.

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:28.740
And that becomes essential when the community is small,

01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.380
but you're trying to do epic things

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.180
like win an Olympic gold.

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.980
So you have to really put the people together

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.820
in these kind of minimalist conditions

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.300
when they just focus on the training,

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.620
focus, focus, focus.

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:43.860
Yeah, it wasn't enough time.

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.780
I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks,

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.460
but I loved the journey and.

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.020
What are some of the fun things you enjoyed?

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:54.260
So you did mostly striking, did you?

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.100
Yeah, I guess it was.

01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:55.940
Yeah, it was boxing.

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:56.780
It was straight up boxing.

01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:57.940
Boxing, yeah.

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.860
What are some things that were transferable?

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.260
What are some cool things you learned from that?

01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.700
So from the world of armwrestling,

01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.180
have you taken anything back?

01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:08.980
Like some training regimens, ideas about training,

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:11.220
even just, even movements?

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.220
Because for us it's a unique mind as well for training.

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.580
Yeah, I don't know.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:23.860
I mean, I've gone very far down the path of armwrestling.

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:27.820
Boxing and armwrestling are very different.

01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:30.060
They're very different sports.

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.980
The physicality required is very different.

01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:39.020
You know, the mentality, I mean, it's fighting.

01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.140
So it's another form of fighting, which is cool.

01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:44.380
The big things that I took back from it,

01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.900
the things that I loved about it was I had to run again.

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.180
So really work on endurance.

01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.460
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.460
I was going for runs with guys in the dorms

01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:57.900
and they would just destroy me.

01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.900
Just like it was so bad.

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.260
Like how did you feel in the actual boxing

01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.380
in terms of endurance?

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.220
Were you able to?

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:10.060
No.

01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:12.020
It's just torture.

01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:13.500
It was terrible.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.340
And the thing is, it was so crazy for me

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.700
because I really was good once upon a time.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.260
I really was, like physically,

01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:24.900
like I had incredible full body endurance, you know.

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.940
But, you know, being so specialized,

01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:31.180
I realized how much I had slipped.

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:34.380
And yeah, it was fun to try and regain.

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.060
I think it's affected my body composition.

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.900
I think since that training, I've become much more lean.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.340
I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do.

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.980
Like health-wise, like I always think that,

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.660
you know, when you're far away from competition,

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:49.780
it's really good to kind of spread out.

01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.620
Really good.

01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:51.980
So I think that in that way.

01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.020
Also for your mind too.

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.860
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:54.700
Just like.

01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:56.900
Yeah.

01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.580
Yeah, so something about clearing your,

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.660
I think you've talked about this as like,

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:06.340
you're basically taking steps back

01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.620
before you take steps forward,

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:08.940
is I forget how you call it.

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:09.780
Yeah, the wave.

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.620
Yeah.

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.220
Yeah, under, you know, you have to go under.

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:14.660
You got to.

01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:16.300
You know, if you want to go above the line,

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.580
you have to spend some time beneath it.

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:20.300
And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.140
for a long time.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:26.940
But Mountain, I mean, like the interesting thing was

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:29.180
as incredible as he is,

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.980
you know, like what a monster.

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:37.340
And I think if you had to had him training in boxing,

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:40.260
you know, for a long time and like from his youth,

01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.020
I think you, you know, the guy could be world champion,

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:46.540
but you know, to be so specialized and then to switch,

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.740
you're at a disadvantage.

01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:48.580
Yeah.

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:52.980
And also like, I know from just fighting guys

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.580
in the gym in TriStar,

01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:58.700
some of those guys were way scarier for real.

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.260
Like as scary as Thor is,

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:03.740
like there's guys in that TriStar gym

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:08.020
that don't look like anything that would murder me.

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:10.340
Much worse, much worse.

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:11.940
Yeah, but also, you know,

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.460
that's the difference between being in the gym

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.100
and under the lights too.

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.220
I mean, GSB is an example,

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.380
George St. Pierre is an example,

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.860
somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying.

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:22.700
He's at the TriStar.

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:25.500
Yep, he trains at TriStar, but he's quite,

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:29.220
he's super nice, super humble,

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.820
is terrifying when he's fighting,

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:33.620
is dominating people.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:38.620
You mentioned death and your Canadian special forces

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:42.620
and in general, thinking about mortality.

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.460
Do you think about your death?

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:49.020
Do you contemplate the end that this thing,

01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.660
that this ride ends?

01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:52.060
All the time, yeah.

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:55.460
From, I've thought about death from a young age.

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.820
Are you afraid of it?

01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.100
Yeah, I hate it.

01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.420
Yeah, I don't wanna die.

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.620
Yeah, definitely, definitely don't wanna die.

01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:05.460
But there's times when I can rid myself of it.

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.980
Yeah, but for sure.

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:11.980
I mean, I'm not happy that, you know, death is inevitable

01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:16.340
and I'm not happy that potentially

01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.100
it's inevitable for all of us,

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:24.300
but it does, you know, I like to fight against it.

01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.780
Does it, if you could be immortal,

01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.300
would you choose to?

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.740
Oh, that's my only wish.

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.180
Oh, see, but here's the thing.

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:35.180
That's, but the point is to have that wish.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:40.180
It's like the all you can eat buffet at sushi.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:43.980
It's, that sushi's more delicious if you have a limit.

01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:47.180
Do you have a, oh, well, I don't know.

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:49.540
I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff.

01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.860
I'm very simple.

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:52.540
Yeah, I don't think I would get tired of it.

01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:53.940
I really don't.

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:56.180
I mean, if someone would pose it to you,

01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.740
do you wanna live forever?

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.460
You would choose no?

01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.620
Yeah, I would choose no.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.460
Choose no.

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.500
Well, my answer is probably yes.

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:09.500
Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button.

01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.340
Do you wanna, do you want to?

01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.820
Well, you could go to sleep.

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.060
But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep,

01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:20.220
but if I'm allowed to live forever,

01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:26.180
I'm going to delay all the crazy,

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.020
like all the ambitious goals, all the,

01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.540
because there's always time.

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:33.380
That's fine, but there is tomorrow then.

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.260
But there is tomorrow.

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.780
But see, I think that takes away from the richness of,

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.420
like the richness of the lived experience

01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:42.740
of just each moment.

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:46.180
I think the richness of each moment comes from saying,

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.420
like, I could die tonight.

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:51.940
Like that, it tastes delicious because you're gonna die.

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:54.540
I'm afraid if you're not,

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:55.860
I'm afraid all of that goes away.

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:58.940
All of that magic goes away if you can live forever.

01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.780
I don't know.

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.020
I don't know.

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:05.220
But I'll tell you, every time I have a near-death experience

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:08.340
or think I'm gonna die, I definitely live better afterwards.

01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.180
Yeah.

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.580
Like, it's always been that way.

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:14.300
But yeah, no.

01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.860
That's why the Stoics, you know,

01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:19.220
they really preach contemplating your mortality often.

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:21.620
It kinda reminds you,

01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:23.660
this whole thing could just end any moment

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.900
and it makes you really appreciate.

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:27.860
Yeah, I don't know.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.980
I don't know.

01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:33.980
Certainly improving the quality of life is important.

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:39.340
But part of me thinks that immortality

01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:43.540
is not as fun as we would like to imagine.

01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:45.780
Do you think that maybe you're,

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:50.140
in what you're building potentially is immortal?

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:53.580
Well, that's what I definitely think about

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:58.580
with robots, if they were to have a human-like experience

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.700
and be able to interact with humans

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.460
in a deep, meaningful way,

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.580
I think they too have to be mortal

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:08.420
in some fundamental way that means mortal.

01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:10.940
Like, their ride has to end as well

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:15.260
because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.020
unless that's the case.

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:22.260
Like, to have fear,

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:27.020
to have love, the ability to suffer,

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:28.700
the ability to miss somebody,

01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.820
I think scarcity is important.

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.660
You have to be able to truly lose somebody.

01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:38.460
You have to be, to fear things,

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:43.180
you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself.

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:46.420
And to have a sense of what it means to be a self,

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:51.100
you have to be able to lose it.

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.940
So if you're immortal, you're just going to be,

01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.020
I feel like you're going to be like a toaster,

01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.820
an intelligent toaster that just serves.

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:03.140
Such a negative perspective on it.

01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.060
And then mortality?

01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:05.980
Yeah, just think, well, now you just,

01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.500
you can get all those things done that you wanna do.

01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.700
I hope you're right, I hope you're right.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:14.260
Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.060
because you're like, wow, I'm actually gonna be able

01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.500
to get all this stuff done.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:20.580
I think about this a lot, I hope you're right,

01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:25.180
but I fear that the drive to create,

01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:28.100
I can even do more, all of that dissipates,

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.420
disappears if you have all the time in the world.

01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.460
I just know how lazy I am.

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.220
And if I have all the time in the world,

01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:39.140
I'm just gonna sit there and just like watch

01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:43.340
the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.260
Now, eternity's a long time.

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:50.380
Eat Doritos, Cheetos, and just get fatter and fatter.

01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:53.660
I can get in shape later, there's always time.

01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:56.100
That's like a long period of contemplation.

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:56.940
Yeah.

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.500
So for the first thousand years,

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.540
it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:06.580
Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for a thousand years.

01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:09.100
You mentioned aliens, very important topic.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.260
Do you actually think about this?

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:13.860
There's been an increased interest,

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:18.340
and there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters,

01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:19.180
all that kind of stuff.

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:22.340
The US government at least releasing data,

01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:27.340
releasing videos of pilots, pilot observations,

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:30.220
and from airplanes of UFOs.

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.860
Do you think about this kind of stuff?

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.900
Because you mentioned in the following context,

01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:36.780
you mentioned like our humans will get our shit together

01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:39.820
when the aliens eventually come.

01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.660
Yeah.

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.820
What do you make of all the sightings?

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:45.740
Is that something you think about?

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.940
I thought about it a lot when I was younger.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.180
And I've just, I made my conclusions and yeah,

01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:54.180
I don't think that there's a possibility

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.420
that there aren't aliens.

01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.180
I would think there would be impossible

01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:58.540
for there not to be aliens.

01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:03.900
I feel like this is pretty good real estate,

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:07.220
so you'd probably want it.

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:10.180
But we already might be, well, I don't even think might.

01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:11.700
I mean, it's probably quite likely

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.660
that we are to some degree aliens.

01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:16.900
I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien.

01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:18.980
I like the real estate, so the resources,

01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:21.380
but we're also kind of interesting.

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:24.260
Whatever this ant colony of living organisms

01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:27.220
that we've created, it's kind of interesting to study.

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.620
I tend to believe that the alien civilizations

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:33.740
that are going to reach us or have reached us

01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:35.260
are far more intelligent,

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:39.260
just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us.

01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:40.740
And so it's going to be very difficult,

01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:43.180
both ways actually, for us to understand them

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:46.380
and for them to dumb themselves down enough

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:47.540
to understand us.

01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.380
Yeah, probably.

01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:52.980
So they might even just miss our existence altogether,

01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:56.140
just because I tend to believe,

01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.060
I don't know what you think,

01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.340
that we're not that special

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.820
in terms of all the life forms in the universe.

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:04.940
There's a lot of cool stuff out there.

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:06.900
Has to be, has to be.

01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:08.500
But to us, we're special.

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.500
Yeah, well, that's all that matters, right?

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.340
Yeah.

01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.700
Even the human species is the most special to us humans.

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.380
There could be much more special species here on Earth,

01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.220
they were just totally oblivious to,

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.180
like trees on a scale of thousands of years.

01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:25.620
Maybe they're onto something.

01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:31.700
Lex, I think that so much of what makes a person special

01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:37.460
is what they pass on, your kids.

01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:39.820
But I think that you are quite special,

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:42.460
because you're part of this thing

01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:45.780
that's potentially giving birth to the next thing.

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.620
The robots.

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:49.460
The robots.

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.980
I should say, the funny thing is,

01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:53.900
while talking to Devin during this podcast,

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:57.620
I had a doorbell ring, had to go downstairs,

01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:00.020
and there was a big box,

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:04.460
medicine box with a new legged robot.

02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:07.620
So the hilarity of you saying that is,

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:11.140
because that robot is actually going to likely be

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:14.340
the main robot that I show to the world

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.940
in the coming months,

02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:20.020
because that's the highest compute level in that robot.

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.740
So I've been playing a lot with legged robots,

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.660
the four legs, like a dog.

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:30.420
I like all the robots,

02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.580
but there's something about when a robot has legs,

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.340
it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way,

02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.940
in the way a dog can, just show affection.

02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:43.740
Something about step, step, step, step,

02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.260
and then the robot realizes you're here,

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.540
and then it steps and then notices you

02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.380
in the way the dog does and raises its head.

02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:56.540
It makes me feel noticed and heard

02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.780
in the same way I do when a dog notices me.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:02.540
That excitement, that stupid excitement of like,

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:05.740
yes, fellow living organism.

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:09.380
And what excites me about legged robots

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.300
is that, holy shit, it's possible to engineer this.

02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:15.500
It's possible to create that feeling,

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:17.260
and I wonder where that can go.

02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:20.340
There's a lot of negative possible trajectories,

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.100
but I have a sense that there's positive ones too.

02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:23.940
Adding more love to the world.

02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:25.900
You think that they'll take us with them?

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.980
Yeah, I think so, because I,

02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:33.140
so there's this fear of robots

02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:34.900
that they become super intelligent

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:36.220
and run away from us humans,

02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:38.900
and basically become so intelligent,

02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:43.420
and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us.

02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:48.220
But I think in order for robots to become intelligent,

02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:51.340
they have to integrate themselves with society.

02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:56.340
So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent,

02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:58.980
have to bring us along.

02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:02.660
So it's not that there'll be this separate thing.

02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:06.100
They have to, like, we'll have robots in the home.

02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:07.460
They'll be interacting with us.

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.740
You have human kids, and you have a bunch of robots.

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.940
You have robot friends, you have human friends.

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.380
And the robots make your human-to-human relationships

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.180
much more meaningful and richer.

02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.020
They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated.

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:24.500
It's not like they'll be developing smarter and smarter

02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:30.460
as sentient beings by themselves.

02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:32.420
I think that's very difficult to do.

02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:34.460
You have to be doing that together with humans,

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:35.900
and so we'll come for the ride.

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:40.860
There's technical things like we might merge cyborgs

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:41.700
more and more.

02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.380
Well, we already are cyborgs, right?

02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:46.420
With the phones and so on, but more and more.

02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.860
So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots

02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:55.380
and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth

02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:56.900
at which they can communicate.

02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:58.700
So if we do implants in the brain,

02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:04.580
I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.340
about this as am I, but I think there's a lot of trajectories

02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.700
that are positive there, and that, to me, is exciting.

02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:13.580
And also, I just don't think it's possible

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.060
to stop this development, so we should steer it.

02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:20.020
Yeah, yeah.

02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:20.860
For good.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.460
Did you, I mean, you must have watched

02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.660
the movie Terminator, right?

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:25.220
Yeah, of course, I love Terminator.

02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:26.060
Yeah.

02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:26.900
I love Schwarzenegger.

02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.740
It's probably my favorite movie of all time.

02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:29.580
Yeah.

02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:32.180
Yeah, I mean, that's the big fear, right?

02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:37.060
Yeah, what's the conclusion with Terminator?

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:39.300
Isn't, ultimately, humanity wins?

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.220
I think they're at, like, Terminator 8 now.

02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:42.060
Yeah.

02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.300
You know, I don't know.

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.260
Yeah, so they're, and it's interesting, actually,

02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.180
I was gonna bring this up as you were talking about it,

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:54.460
but China and the United States actually don't know

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:58.300
where Canada is on this, but they both have agreed

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.780
that they're not going to put limits

02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:04.540
on autonomous weapon system development.

02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:05.380
They're not going to.

02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:07.700
They're not going to, so because China said

02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.220
we're not going to, and now US officially announced

02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:13.180
that we're not, we can't.

02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:14.020
Well, you can't.

02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:16.940
It's like, you never could, right?

02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:20.780
As soon as it exists and it's better, people will use it.

02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.780
Well, but you, there's been a global ban on bio weapons,

02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:28.860
so you were able to come to an agreement there

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:32.340
that we're not going to use biological weapons in war.

02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.980
So it was, a lot of people are really upset

02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:39.540
that in the case of AI-driven weapons,

02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:42.300
the world said, nope, that's okay.

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.140
And so now you have this potential

02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:48.660
for greater and greater automation in drones, for example,

02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:51.380
and picking bombing locations,

02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:54.540
and so the area at which they attack,

02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:57.580
and so you get some of that stuff that you mentioned

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:02.540
that drew you to the military,

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:05.860
is that teamwork between humans, that decision-making.

02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:10.220
So there's strategy, but built into that team

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:15.220
is a deep humanity, like even when there's an enemy,

02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:18.980
there's lines that you are aware of,

02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:20.780
of what is ethical and what is not,

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:23.060
what is just and what is not,

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:28.060
and it's so easy for a machine to miss all of that,

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:33.300
plow through it, and do deeply inhumane acts,

02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:34.860
commit atrocities.

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:38.860
That's something that worries a lot of people.

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:45.820
Because yeah, an AI-based war is just, it's terrifying,

02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:47.500
especially with cyber security,

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.700
which is becoming more and more of an issue,

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:54.740
which is hacking, sort of people that look a lot like me

02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:00.020
being the warriors of the future,

02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:03.460
which is meaning people behind a keyboard

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.500
versus the traditional warriors.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:09.540
Probably inevitable.

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.140
Yeah.

02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:13.060
And terrifying.

02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:14.700
It is, it is.

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:18.060
But I think if you believe that it's possible,

02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.580
it's certainly gonna happen.

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:22.500
Like at some point, it's just when, right?

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.420
When does it happen?

02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:25.660
So that, I mean, to me,

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:29.140
I'm ultimately optimistic about the future,

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.740
and to me, I'm excited about the world with AI.

02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:35.020
I'm even excited about the metaverse

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:36.540
and all these kinds of things,

02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:38.740
living more and more in the digital space

02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:40.020
in the virtual reality.

02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:43.300
I think, so it's a part of me that grew up

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:45.620
in the non-internet world, non-computer world.

02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:49.460
You know, it says, oh, kids these days with their video games.

02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:52.300
You know, there's part of me that's like that.

02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:56.980
But I think technology at its best

02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:59.860
can bring out the best of humanity.

02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:01.940
And so I think virtual reality,

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:04.220
all of these things over time,

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:08.100
we'll figure out how to fix it to bring out the humanity.

02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.100
Social networks, the first generation social networks,

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:13.660
now Facebook, Twitter, and so on,

02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.020
they have so many problems.

02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:17.100
They're bringing out the worst in people.

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.660
But I think we're learning from that.

02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:20.620
And I think the next generation of social networks

02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:22.380
will be better and better and better.

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:26.020
And so I'm optimistic.

02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.060
But of course, you know,

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:32.020
one reason we may have not seen aliens yet, obviously,

02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:34.180
like in a way that's obvious,

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.980
is because once you get clever and smart

02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:40.220
and have all this cool technology, you destroy yourself.

02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:42.980
And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.

02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.100
Yeah, yeah, there might be that limit

02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.980
that is hard to get right.

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:49.540
I'm hoping we get all our aggression between nations

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:52.420
out through arm wrestling, competition.

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:53.380
Right?

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:54.220
Just all of that.

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:55.660
Yeah, yeah, oh my God.

02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.660
Wouldn't that be great if it was that simple?

02:07:58.660 --> 02:07:59.500
Yeah.

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:00.420
Do you know if there's another

02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:02.300
over-the-top type movie to be made?

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:04.860
Oh yeah, yeah, there's always stuff in the works.

02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:07.260
There's actually, there's a tournament called

02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:09.940
Over the Top in Australia that's a couple months away.

02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:11.740
I think they're doing all the over-the-top scene.

02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:13.980
But there are arm wrestling movies

02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:15.060
that are being made right now.

02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:17.940
Actually, there's a documentary that's filming me

02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:19.660
for this Olyvahn thing,

02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:23.940
but yeah, we're probably due for another big one, yeah.

02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:26.380
But you're also, just with your YouTube channel,

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.580
you're doing a lot for the sport.

02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:28.580
That's really cool to see.

02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:31.420
Just being genuine, but just being like,

02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.860
looking not like you're looking today,

02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:34.700
but just like-

02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:35.540
Yeah, yeah.

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.380
Just a beard.

02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:37.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally a mask.

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.820
Just like sleepy, you know,

02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:42.900
and just putting yourself out there completely as you are.

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:44.300
That's a beautiful thing.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.500
The best thing about the sport

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:47.100
is it brings people together.

02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:47.940
That's it.

02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:50.220
Yeah, the community, the folks I got to interact with,

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:54.300
just so awesome, so excited, so full of kindness.

02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.940
I'm definitely gonna find the club here

02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:00.940
and start working on my arm wrestling game.

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:03.940
Devin, this is such a huge honor

02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:07.260
that you would spend your valuable time.

02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:09.060
You would come down to Austin.

02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:14.060
You would hang out with me and do this conversation.

02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.180
Super cool to talk to you, Lex, yeah.

02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:18.980
As I mentioned, in case people,

02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:20.980
people I'm sure will tell me.

02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:23.460
So I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time.

02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:24.460
He's a friend.

02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.060
I told him that he should talk to Devin.

02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:29.180
He's going through some stuff currently, you know.

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:31.260
But I'm sure that I hope the conversation

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.900
between you, Devin, and Joe happens eventually.

02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.020
That would be epic as well,

02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.780
because he's a, I'm sure.

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:39.860
Yeah, he loves fighting.

02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:40.820
He loves fighting.

02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:41.740
He loves wrestling.

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.460
He loves strength.

02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:48.460
And I think all of those are like so perfectly encapsulated

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:51.060
in the sport of arm wrestling.

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:52.700
So thank you so much for talking to me.

02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:53.860
Thanks so much, Lex.

02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:57.380
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:09:57.380 --> 02:09:58.700
with Devin Larratt.

02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:00.020

And now let me leave you with some words

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.700
from Miyamoto Musashi.

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:11.900
The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:15.460
And the only reason a warrior fights is to win.

02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:17.700
Thank you for listening.

02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:19.820
I hope to see you next time.
