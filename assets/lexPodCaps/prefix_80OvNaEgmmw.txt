00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
The following is a conversation with Michael Mina, his second time on the podcast.

00:04.720 --> 00:10.240
He's a professor at Harvard doing research on infectious disease and immunology.

00:10.960 --> 00:17.840
In my view, the most powerful, doable, and obvious solution to COVID-19 from the very beginning

00:17.840 --> 00:23.600
is rapid at-home testing. This is what Michael has been talking about and writing about since

00:23.600 --> 00:29.280
the beginning of the pandemic. The accuracy of these tests is high for the task of detecting

00:29.280 --> 00:34.800
contagiousness, which is what matters. Hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly and

00:34.800 --> 00:41.280
relatively cheaply. Privacy and individual freedoms are preserved. I believe that if you give people

00:41.280 --> 00:46.880
the power of information, information about whether they are contagious or not, they will

00:46.880 --> 00:53.040
do the right thing, at scale, all while respecting their freedom and minimizing the destructive

00:53.040 --> 01:00.400
effects of the pandemic on our health and our economy. This solution was obvious in May of 2020.

01:00.400 --> 01:06.800
It was obvious when Michael and I spoke the first time a year ago, and it is obvious today. We talk

01:06.800 --> 01:14.240
about why it has not yet been done and how we can still do it. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.840
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's my conversation

01:19.840 --> 01:28.240
with Michael Mina. We spoke a year ago about rapid at-home testing, and I think, you think,

01:28.800 --> 01:32.720
it should have been, still should be a big part of the solution to COVID.

01:33.360 --> 01:39.360
So let's recap. Where do things stand today in terms of rapid at-home testing?

01:40.720 --> 01:46.720
Well, it's certainly something that you're right. I do think we should have them today.

01:47.440 --> 01:56.960
We've now had almost 20 months of living in anxiety, uncertainty, being afraid for our health,

01:56.960 --> 02:01.920
for our family's health, for our friends, you know, shutdowns, economic instability,

02:01.920 --> 02:06.880
everything has been uncertain because of this virus. And then there's this little test,

02:06.880 --> 02:12.560
and it's the first time for many people that they're using it and they're feeling empowered.

02:12.560 --> 02:19.520
They're feeling like they can control their little slice of this pandemic. So as these tests have

02:19.520 --> 02:24.960
come out and more and more and more Americans have had an opportunity to go and buy them from,

02:24.960 --> 02:31.360
you know, CVS or Walgreens or wherever they're at, I think that it's really shifting the tenor

02:31.360 --> 02:39.360
of the discussion. For a long time, all of 2020, it was like, I often felt like it was me and a few

02:39.360 --> 02:45.280
other people against the world. You know, these tests should be public health tools. These tests

02:45.280 --> 02:50.640
are infectiousness indicators. They shouldn't be compared to PCR, you know, all of these different

02:50.640 --> 02:57.200
things. And we could, of course, go through and recap what the benefits and the metrics are that

02:57.200 --> 03:04.320
we should be looking at. But the point is, last year and most of this year was about educating

03:04.320 --> 03:07.680
scientists, educating public health leaders, educating physicians

03:09.440 --> 03:14.320
to get them to understand that there is a different reason to test in a pandemic than

03:14.320 --> 03:19.040
purely diagnostics and transmission blockade and severing transmission chains, the big one.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.520
So now I think we're at a point where people are now understanding and they're understanding

03:23.520 --> 03:27.200
because they are feeling it. They're holding it and they're doing it and they're seeing,

03:27.200 --> 03:32.560
they're feeling the delight of seeing a negative and saying, I feel more comfortable. It's not

03:32.560 --> 03:39.280
perfect, but it's pretty darn close to perfect to allowing me to go and see my mom without

03:39.280 --> 03:46.080
mistakenly infecting her or whatever the story might be. And now that that's happening, I think

03:46.800 --> 03:52.880
all of a sudden we're seeing a massive change politically for these tests. Biden just came

03:52.880 --> 03:57.520
out the COVID-19 action plan the other day and one of the main pillars of it was testing and

03:57.520 --> 04:06.080
in particular bringing rapid tests, scaling them up. So on that front, I think finally there is

04:06.080 --> 04:12.240
success. People are actually understanding and I haven't stopped beating this drum for far too long

04:12.240 --> 04:18.960
and I like hate rapid tests now. So maybe it's good to step back. Would you say most Americans

04:18.960 --> 04:24.320
have not taken a rapid at home test? Absolutely. Most have definitely not taken a rapid test.

04:24.320 --> 04:30.480
So like many of them probably don't know. They kind of probably say testing, they have like

04:30.480 --> 04:37.600
memories of testing, like PCR testing. They have to go into somewhere and they have to like a swab

04:37.600 --> 04:42.880
deep in their nose and that's the experience. Or maybe if you have to travel like Canada or

04:42.880 --> 04:48.160
something like that, you have to get tested, that kind of stuff. So what are rapid at home tests?

04:48.800 --> 04:54.800
Yeah, so the rapid at home tests are, I like to call them paper strip tests.

04:55.600 --> 05:01.280
They're simple tests that, I wish I brought some today but I didn't. They're simple tests that

05:03.200 --> 05:08.720
you swab, at the moment most of them use a swab that you just swab the front of your nose. So

05:08.720 --> 05:15.600
it's not one of the deep swabs that goes into your brain and so it's not very uncomfortable.

05:15.600 --> 05:25.920
It's just like picking your nose and you put that swab into a little tube and the tube has

05:25.920 --> 05:31.760
some liquid in it and then you put a few drops of that liquid onto a paper strip or you drop the

05:31.760 --> 05:39.760
paper strip into the tube just like one of those indicators for the pool. And just like a pregnancy

05:39.760 --> 05:45.120
test then if you get two lines you're positive, one line you're negative. It's super simple,

05:45.120 --> 05:50.480
takes 30 seconds once you know how to do it of hands-on time and you wait around 10 minutes

05:50.480 --> 05:58.240
and then you read the result. They are extraordinarily effective to answer one question,

05:58.240 --> 06:06.080
am I infectious? And that is the public health question that we need to answer and consistently

06:06.080 --> 06:12.800
ask during this pandemic, are you infectious? Am I infectious? Because it's only when we know

06:12.800 --> 06:20.560
that we're infectious that we can be empowered to not mistakenly infect others. The PCR test is a

06:20.560 --> 06:29.520
little different and we can go into the pros and cons but one of the major differences is that a

06:29.520 --> 06:37.280
PCR test gets a lot of people talking about the PCR test say it's much more sensitive

06:38.800 --> 06:48.720
and at an analytical level it is. It can detect one molecule instead of 100,000 but for public

06:48.720 --> 06:54.880
health we don't want a test that can detect one molecule. In fact that has created a net negative

06:54.880 --> 07:00.000
for public health. We just want to know am I infectious and to know that question,

07:00.000 --> 07:07.120
to know if I'm infectious I only need a test that is going to be positive if I have a high viral

07:07.120 --> 07:12.800
load like a million and when you're and the virus grows so fast it will grow from zero to a billion

07:12.800 --> 07:18.000
in a day. So you don't really need even on the front end of an infection you don't need better

07:18.000 --> 07:23.920
sensitivity if the trade-off is that you don't get the result for one two or three days. You

07:23.920 --> 07:29.360
absolutely want a rapid result that can tell you yes you're infectious you're transmitting

07:29.360 --> 07:35.840
to others right now and I'm going to give you the result right now. So it is a much more effective

07:35.840 --> 07:41.520
tool because it's fast because it's accessible. We can use them in the home and there's some

07:41.520 --> 07:46.640
issues with using them at home. We can talk a little bit about what those issues are like reporting

07:46.640 --> 07:51.280
and how do you use everything on the honor system if you have a test that you're taking at home and

07:51.280 --> 07:57.280
you use it to go to work but they can be they can be accessible. PCR has to go into a lab.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.840
It takes a lot of time for somebody to get a PCR test. They either have to go online and order it.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.160
It takes the next day for it to come back. They swab themselves. They ship it out the next day

08:06.160 --> 08:12.400
and then they get a result two days later. That's four days minimum for the most part and you know

08:12.400 --> 08:16.080
at that point you're not even infectious even if you did happen to be infectious when you first

08:16.080 --> 08:20.720
ordered the test. Right. So it's really the speed of these tests and the accessibility

08:20.720 --> 08:24.960
and distribution of them that makes them so immensely powerful. So you have this like amazing

08:24.960 --> 08:32.640
graphic you tweeted. It's exactly what you're saying which is a rapid antigen test answers the

08:32.640 --> 08:38.320
question am I currently infectious and you have I think a comparison of three different sorry seven

08:38.320 --> 08:45.360
different tests based on the viral load and based on the viral load across these different tests

08:45.360 --> 08:51.280
you look at the likelihood of infectiousness. So what does this graphic show? We can overlay

08:51.280 --> 08:56.480
that for people. I think it's just really nice and really clear. Yeah so what that's showing

08:56.480 --> 09:02.320
is that we can never ask what's the sensitivity of a test and just let that be the answer. That's

09:02.320 --> 09:07.920
what the FDA does currently and that question doesn't mean anything. We have to say what is

09:07.920 --> 09:13.760
the sensitivity of the test to detect what. Right. And so we can have different viral loads for

09:13.760 --> 09:19.600
example. We can have you can have a viral load of one or you can have a viral load of a trillion

09:19.600 --> 09:26.080
and a PCR test will tell tell you that you are positive regardless of whether it's one or a

09:26.080 --> 09:33.520
trillion. Now so we can't ask the question how sensitive is a rapid test compared to PCR

09:33.520 --> 09:37.440
because that covers the whole gamut. What we really want to say is how sensitive is the rapid test

09:38.080 --> 09:45.040
to detect me if I am infectious. And that gets to about 97 percent or so sensitive.

09:45.600 --> 09:50.640
If the question is how likely is it to detect me if I'm a super spreader that's a really important

09:50.640 --> 09:55.920
one to be able to detect. They're all about 100 percent sensitive. So if you have extraordinarily

09:55.920 --> 10:00.560
high viral loads to the point where you might be a super spreader these simple rapid tests will

10:00.560 --> 10:06.160
essentially always catch you and tell you you're positive. And then as you go down the line if

10:06.160 --> 10:12.960
you're no longer infectious at all then these rapid tests might have a zero percent sensitivity

10:12.960 --> 10:18.080
compared to PCR. But that's actually a good thing. The FDA and others look at it as though

10:18.080 --> 10:23.200
it's a bad thing because they average it all together and say oh this is only a 40 percent

10:23.200 --> 10:29.200
sensitive test compared to PCR. But that's not the right way to look at it. You want to say well out

10:29.200 --> 10:33.920
of all of the samples how many of them were not transmissible how many were mid moderate high

10:33.920 --> 10:38.320
extremely high super spreader and you should at the very least create a weighted average based

10:38.320 --> 10:44.160
on transmissibility potential. We don't do that. And that's why nobody in America has these tests

10:44.160 --> 10:50.560
because that's why they're very rare because we have slowed down their authorization because of

10:50.560 --> 10:56.880
that misunderstanding that they don't have to be 80 or 90 percent sensitive compared to anytime PCR

10:56.880 --> 11:03.440
positivity. They need to be 80 or 90 percent or more if you're infectious. And for that question

11:03.920 --> 11:09.360
they're like 95 up to 100 percent sensitive when you're most infectious. So you have a lot

11:09.360 --> 11:15.520
of iron particles in you so that's what it means when you say viral load that means you're going

11:15.520 --> 11:21.200
to be very infectious. The more you have the more infectious you are and this test is basically

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
very good at detecting when you're very infectious. Why don't we have a rapid at home test? So you

11:30.000 --> 11:35.600
said there's a bit of confusion. FDA is involved. You've talked about you continue to talk about

11:36.800 --> 11:43.440
that these at home tests are classified as I guess medical devices. That's right. And so because of

11:43.440 --> 11:52.240
that FDA is looking at them differently than they probably should be looked at. So what's the problem

11:52.240 --> 11:57.920
here? Can you sort of explain what does it mean to be a medical device? Why is that an issue?

11:57.920 --> 12:04.720
Where is the FDA messing up? When we declare something as a medical device and we evaluate

12:04.720 --> 12:10.400
as a medical device then it makes sense that the comparison if you're trying to get a new one onto

12:10.400 --> 12:15.840
the market that the comparison would be against a gold standard medical device for that purpose.

12:17.120 --> 12:25.280
So PCR is currently the gold standard or at least in the in the eyes of the FDA the PCR

12:25.280 --> 12:32.400
test is the gold standard medical device. And as a physician that's because it's so sensitive.

12:33.280 --> 12:39.440
As a physician I have one patient in front of me at a time and that patient comes to me and I don't

12:39.440 --> 12:47.120
have to care about the 99.99999 percent of people in the world who are not in front of me. I only

12:47.120 --> 12:51.920
care about that one patient. And so when I get a sample from that patient and that patient's saying

12:51.920 --> 12:56.240
doc you know I don't feel well I haven't been feeling well for the last few weeks do you think

12:56.240 --> 13:02.960
this is COVID? Well for that question I want to have the absolute best sensitivity test

13:04.080 --> 13:08.800
regardless of what it means for transmissibility because my patient isn't sitting in my office

13:08.800 --> 13:14.080
saying doc do you think I'm infectious? They're saying doc do you think I have recently been or

13:14.080 --> 13:20.320
am infected? And these are totally different things. One is medicine and if the patient's

13:20.320 --> 13:24.560
infected you know the time isn't of the essence because they're sitting there in my office I can

13:24.560 --> 13:29.920
say look I'm sorry you're not feeling well let's get a PCR test on you we'll be able to tell you

13:29.920 --> 13:36.560
if you have any evidence that there has been recently an infection inside of you and you'll

13:36.560 --> 13:42.560
get the result in a couple days. And it might be expensive and so insurance is going to pay for it

13:42.560 --> 13:47.440
and you're just one person and so I don't really care how many resources it takes to get you this

13:47.440 --> 13:53.760
answer. On the other hand there's rapid and there's public health testing and public health testing

13:53.760 --> 13:59.840
is it has to account for all of the people you're not seeing as well as the person you're testing

13:59.840 --> 14:06.240
at the moment so accessibility becomes a central theme. Frequency of tests it has to account for

14:06.240 --> 14:10.720
all the days that you're not sitting there in front of your doctor's office getting a test as

14:10.720 --> 14:15.440
well as the one you are so it has to say how frequently what if you're infected tomorrow but

14:15.440 --> 14:20.480
you're at the doctor's office today getting a negative COVID test. That PCR test at the

14:20.480 --> 14:25.280
doctor's office today is going to do nothing to let you know that you get exposed and infected

14:25.280 --> 14:32.240
tomorrow. The only way to know that is to be testing yourself frequently. So and the reason

14:32.240 --> 14:38.800
it matters is that these tests can be accessible if we are okay with saying the real purpose of a

14:38.800 --> 14:44.800
of a public health test is to answer the question am I infectious. The reason we want to answer that

14:44.800 --> 14:52.960
is if you're infectious that's when you isolate. We actually don't want to isolate PCR positive

14:52.960 --> 14:58.480
individuals who are no longer infectious. That's bad public health practice like

14:59.440 --> 15:03.200
if I haven't been infectious for three weeks I don't want to have somebody tell me that I need to

15:03.760 --> 15:09.600
go and isolate for 10 days just because I happen to use a PCR test today three weeks after I was

15:09.600 --> 15:16.400
infectious and furthermore I definitely don't want the public health agency to come and you know

15:16.400 --> 15:21.200
round up all the people I was with last night and say you guys have to quarantine for 14 days

15:21.200 --> 15:25.920
because you were with Michael who wasn't infectious yesterday. It's nonsensical to do that.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.760
It's a huge disincentive to actually get tested. That's exactly right huge disincentive to get

15:31.760 --> 15:35.760
tested people you know if it's too sensitive especially with flights things like that like

15:36.720 --> 15:41.440
we shouldn't be stopping people from taking a flight if they haven't been infectious for 60

15:41.440 --> 15:47.680
days and to be clear people are only infectious for I don't know somewhere between three and seven

15:47.680 --> 15:55.520
days but can be positive on a PCR test for 30 to 70 days. So I mean it's it's potentially a

15:55.520 --> 16:00.880
tenfold difference in terms of how long you're PCR positive versus how long you're infectious.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.800
So we don't want to be taking people during those 30 to 70 days and saying you need to isolate just

16:06.800 --> 16:11.840
because you go and get a swab or you can't go on your trip just because you had COVID last month.

16:12.640 --> 16:19.920
That's not good use of a test. So the reason we don't have these tools right now is because

16:21.440 --> 16:29.760
when we evaluate a rapid test as a medical device the FDA says well this has to achieve the

16:29.760 --> 16:36.320
properties that we expect from a medical device which again doesn't have to take time into account

16:36.320 --> 16:41.440
doesn't really have to take cost or resources or scalability or access into account it only

16:41.440 --> 16:49.680
takes sensitivity and specificity to catch molecules. And so just by definition I mean it

16:49.680 --> 16:56.320
is a mathematical fact you know that that if you have a perfect public health test for COVID which

16:56.320 --> 17:04.720
means that it would be 100% sensitive and 100% specific for contagious people or for the infectious

17:04.720 --> 17:13.920
stage of an infection then it literally can't it it is an impossibility for that test to achieve

17:13.920 --> 17:20.400
an 80% sensitivity at a population level against a medical device which is what the FDA asks for

17:20.400 --> 17:27.280
and that's because you're only infectious for maybe 20% so theoretically it should only have

17:27.280 --> 17:34.160
a 20% sensitivity against the PCR while still being a perfect medical a perfect public health

17:34.160 --> 17:39.120
test. And the test is answering the question am I infectious that's what you're testing for not for

17:39.120 --> 17:44.560
the exact counting of the virion particles in your system. That's that's exactly right. Okay so what

17:45.280 --> 17:52.960
why are we still here? So have you had conversations with folks you said that there's a bunch of

17:54.960 --> 17:59.360
leaders that are kind of starting to wake up to this idea but why is this taking this

17:59.360 --> 18:07.280
so long? Why don't we still have hundreds of millions of at-home tests? The reason it's

18:07.280 --> 18:16.320
taking long I think is because every agency and government is generally deferential to the FDA

18:16.320 --> 18:22.960
and in this context I would argue that government hasn't been particularly creative.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.240
So for example last year when Trump was still president I would or or in the transition and I

18:30.240 --> 18:35.200
recall talking to the White House a number of times and saying here's a plan to give us our

18:35.200 --> 18:40.800
lives back. I think that was actually the title of the Atlantic article you know and this plan

18:40.800 --> 18:46.480
can stop shutdowns it can it can stop outbreaks it can allow society to keep running and could have

18:47.360 --> 18:52.720
prevented the outbreaks of last winter and fall and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.720
So when I bring that to the White House or to the government of federal government whoever it might

18:58.720 --> 19:04.080
be and I say here's a plan like this this would work they say you know what I get back is this

19:04.080 --> 19:09.680
sounds really interesting Michael it looks like it checks out but there's one problem we don't

19:09.680 --> 19:14.560
have the test there's no scale and that's kind of where it all dropped it's like this defeatist

19:14.560 --> 19:21.360
attitude of like oh don't have the test so so we can't act on it but now it's really changing.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.520
Well and so that's really where things have been and so nobody's paid attention it's always been

19:25.520 --> 19:30.720
this like esoteric thing that yeah maybe one day we'll get around to it but really it's not that

19:30.720 --> 19:36.080
important and the pandemic's going away but you know this was like 100 percent predictable

19:36.080 --> 19:40.640
everything that's happening today we predicted it last year you know it's not this isn't like

19:40.640 --> 19:46.160
rocket science or anything variance and all those kinds of things so the FDA can start to understand

19:46.160 --> 19:54.160
why but also like one question I want to ask is it possible to go around the FDA yeah so why has the

19:54.160 --> 20:02.480
FDA not changed and why has nobody tried to push the FDA to change like the I think what the real

20:02.480 --> 20:10.240
reason is the FDA has one job around these tests and it is to authorize them as medical devices

20:10.240 --> 20:16.400
they haven't been charged with doing anything else so in their eyes they're doing exactly what

20:16.400 --> 20:22.240
they're supposed to do they're evaluating these tests as medical devices and they're telling

20:22.240 --> 20:27.680
company after company after company sorry you don't make the cut and the only way to make the

20:27.680 --> 20:33.520
cut is really to kind of skew your clinical trials to favor the rapid tests being positive

20:33.520 --> 20:37.280
which isn't really good practice we shouldn't be trying to skew clinical trials

20:39.040 --> 20:43.680
but that's kind of what's happened that's been it's been forced upon the companies to do that

20:44.400 --> 20:48.960
and so I think the FDA truly believes from the bottom of their heart that they are doing the

20:48.960 --> 20:54.640
right thing here and I would argue that to an extent they are I've been pretty hard on the FDA

20:54.640 --> 21:01.040
but maybe the issue is a higher level issue like the the in vitro diagnostics division is

21:01.760 --> 21:05.600
they get applications and they evaluate them and the applications are for medical claims

21:06.800 --> 21:10.960
that's however because there's been a misunderstanding of these tests and

21:10.960 --> 21:17.360
the companies only know to apply for these as medical claims because there is no there's

21:17.440 --> 21:24.240
nothing else in this country to apply for except a medical claim so we we don't have a public health

21:24.240 --> 21:30.720
pathway to evaluate a test and authorize a test it doesn't exist we have defunded and devalued

21:30.720 --> 21:36.240
public health for so long that we literally don't have a language for it we don't have laws a

21:36.240 --> 21:41.840
language words is it called a public health test is it called something else I call it a public

21:41.840 --> 21:49.120
health test because I'm trying to create a new definition here but that's why that's why nobody's

21:49.120 --> 21:53.760
acted because no because everyone says well there's no other pathway so the FDA in vitro

21:53.760 --> 22:02.080
medical diagnostics division is the only pathway so what I am trying to do is to say look the FDA

22:02.080 --> 22:10.720
very clearly states that they do not authorize or review public health tools and not and they

22:10.720 --> 22:18.080
don't authorize or review public health tests for for covid so what I want the president of

22:18.080 --> 22:24.880
the United States to do is to utilize executive powers and take an executive action that can

22:24.880 --> 22:32.080
simply state like one line one line could potentially change all of this and it's a pretty

22:32.080 --> 22:40.640
obvious and simple line and it is that any tools used for public health testing during this public

22:40.640 --> 22:47.920
health emergency will be designated as public health tools like it's obvious like it's public

22:47.920 --> 22:52.160
health emergency it's a tool used for public health it should be designated as a public health tool

22:53.280 --> 22:59.120
if we can do that if we can get that language out there so that that's the president's decision

22:59.840 --> 23:06.080
then all of a sudden the FDA is off the hook they're not trying to to cram a square peg through

23:06.080 --> 23:12.720
a round hole they can say look the antigen tests are not on us anymore at least if they're going

23:12.720 --> 23:18.720
to be used for public health like when you test a thousand people at a time or test a school

23:18.720 --> 23:24.080
school classroom if they've been exposed this is public health and so then the CDC could take it

23:24.080 --> 23:31.040
over the CDC could say okay what are the metrics we are interested in and they could say we're

23:31.040 --> 23:35.840
interested in a test that can catch you if you're infectious so you want high viral load detection

23:35.920 --> 23:41.760
that's fast that's scalable and hey you know if your test has been used in Europe for months

23:41.760 --> 23:47.200
and has performed extremely well then then we'll give you a certificate by right you know

23:47.200 --> 23:53.120
immediately and that could actually get hundreds of millions of additional tests into the United

23:53.120 --> 23:58.480
States tomorrow so you need some kind of classification from an FDA from somebody

23:58.480 --> 24:03.760
to call it a public health tool in order for it to be manufactured is it possible to just go around

24:03.760 --> 24:11.280
all of this and just for somebody to manufacture at scale tests and well you if you did that

24:11.280 --> 24:15.040
and you just called them you put a claim on them that called them public health tools

24:16.960 --> 24:23.040
the FDA has a very weird view of this and they will tell you that it's illegal that it's a crime

24:24.880 --> 24:29.520
is there a way to say like Elon Musk did with the flamethrower it's not a flamethrower

24:29.520 --> 24:35.120
yeah believe me i've tried i've tried to think of all the different approaches

24:36.240 --> 24:40.480
you know there's weird there's like very there's major inconsistencies here so it's not like we

24:40.480 --> 24:45.680
don't have a precedent for a public health test even during this pandemic there is a very strong

24:45.680 --> 24:53.440
precedent pooled testing we have companies like ginkgo right based out here in cambridge that are

24:55.120 --> 24:59.120
you know working with a hundred different labs around the country so that might mean like not

24:59.120 --> 25:05.040
a ton of quality control over those labs doing i mean i don't want to say that they don't i'm

25:05.040 --> 25:09.520
just saying the reality is if you're working with that many labs it's hard to say they're running

25:09.520 --> 25:18.480
pooled testing of millions and millions millions of kids so here you have a company that's testing

25:19.280 --> 25:25.840
in each pool five to 25 kids at a time millions of kids in a pretty distributed way across the

25:25.840 --> 25:31.760
country in all these different labs and the fda doesn't care at all you don't need an eua it

25:31.760 --> 25:38.000
doesn't need a regulatory authority it's collection on site it's getting shipped to a lab there's no

25:38.000 --> 25:44.800
oversight of it so why does that have no oversight but a rapid test for you for pub for the exact

25:44.800 --> 25:50.560
same purpose you're just giving people immediate results instead of two day delayed pooled pcr

25:50.560 --> 25:56.400
results so it's a much more effective tool why is the rapid test used for the same purpose

25:56.960 --> 26:04.000
not designated as a public health tool but requiring fda authorization it's a ridiculous

26:04.000 --> 26:11.520
reason and it's because the fda says that if a test and this is actually cms that says this

26:11.520 --> 26:19.920
and then the fda adopts it if a test alters your behavior if you get a single result and it's going

26:19.920 --> 26:28.080
to alter your behavior then that is a medical device but the thing that i find ridiculous is

26:28.080 --> 26:32.800
like okay but you can give a pooled test that alters 25 people's behavior at once

26:33.840 --> 26:38.880
and that's not following like that's more risky one person turns positive in the pool and 25

26:38.880 --> 26:45.840
people have to be quarantined and how do they evaluate the accuracy so for people who don't

26:45.840 --> 26:53.680
know a pooled test is you're testing a small fraction of the people and if one of them is

26:53.680 --> 26:59.600
positive then you basically say we have to retest everybody in the pool or like yeah so you take

26:59.600 --> 27:04.240
let's say you have a school and each classroom you might have 20 kids each swab their nose in

27:04.240 --> 27:09.840
a classroom and all those swabs go into a single tube and then you rinse that tube out with some

27:09.840 --> 27:17.280
saline and you run a pcr test on that tube of 25 samples 20 samples and so if that tube turns

27:17.280 --> 27:24.560
positive in the pcr test then all 20 or 25 of those students are now having to quarantine

27:25.360 --> 27:31.760
and if there's no positive then all 20 or 25 students are interpreting that their result

27:32.000 --> 27:39.600
negative you know so it really is ridiculous decision by the fda to say that if the test

27:39.600 --> 27:44.480
itself only tests one sample at a time it's medicine because it will tell you one person

27:44.480 --> 27:49.120
at a time if you're positive or if you're negative but if you do it as a pool and you

27:49.120 --> 27:56.320
and you tell 25 people that your pool was negative then that's somehow different that's public health

27:56.320 --> 28:01.520
not medicine it it doesn't make there's no logic there was it just personalities and accidents

28:01.520 --> 28:07.840
of history or something like that for example you talk about the public health tools and cdc

28:07.840 --> 28:14.720
you look at masks so masks were decided to somehow be an effective tool to help with the pandemic

28:14.720 --> 28:21.760
like so i'm sure the evidence that was used there was probably not as strong as the evidence

28:21.760 --> 28:28.400
supporting antigen rapid tests i was very much reading a lot of research on masks it's tricky

28:28.400 --> 28:33.440
it's really tricky to show how well they stop the transmission of a virus especially when you don't

28:33.440 --> 28:38.480
fully understand how the virus is transmitted or the viral load required all that kind of stuff

28:38.480 --> 28:43.600
but then the cdc pretty quickly decided masks or whatever there's some oscillations back and forth

28:43.600 --> 28:50.400
but then they quickly decided all everybody decided masks is a good tool so masks being

28:50.400 --> 28:56.480
decided a good tool and then rapid antigen tests not a good tool is that just like certain

28:56.480 --> 29:00.720
personalities who didn't speak up in a meeting or who did speak up in a meeting

29:00.720 --> 29:04.000
is this just like a weird roll of the dice or is there a better explanation

29:04.880 --> 29:12.160
i think it's somewhat of a roll of the dice but i also think it's that testing so doctors

29:13.440 --> 29:20.800
don't pretend to like really understand much about like fluid dynamics and you know how well masks

29:20.800 --> 29:27.600
are working like that's like way out of their realm doctors do believe that they understand

29:27.600 --> 29:36.000
all aspects of the tests and so the greatest barriers to rapid tests being brought to market

29:36.000 --> 29:42.480
or sort of being being rolled out heavily and and supported as public health tools

29:43.680 --> 29:49.840
uh the greatest barriers came from physicians saying hell no we can't use a test that's not

29:49.840 --> 29:58.560
as sensitive as a pcr and look at what happens if you use this antigen test and not a pcr test you

29:58.560 --> 30:05.200
get people who are showing a positive on a pcr negative on an antigen and they just assume that

30:05.200 --> 30:11.680
that was a false negative on the antigen for public health i would call it a false positive

30:11.680 --> 30:19.040
on the pcr test but this type of thinking literally does not exist in medicine and i think

30:19.040 --> 30:26.240
the biggest problem here is that we placed physicians in decision-making power we have

30:26.960 --> 30:33.280
when this pandemic hit everyone called up clinical laboratory folks and microbiologists

30:33.840 --> 30:36.720
and physicians to ask well what kind of test should we use that kind of thing

30:38.000 --> 30:44.560
and there is no training in medical school for this kind of public health work like you have to

30:44.560 --> 30:52.000
optimize on the right qualities of a test that have nothing to do with medicine and then sometimes

30:52.000 --> 30:58.400
if not frequently they're actually at odds and i'll give an example why the physicians you could

30:58.400 --> 31:04.560
see why the physicians would have been against it from their perspective and they say uh if a

31:04.560 --> 31:12.880
physician is a tsa agent at the airport you know a tsa agent their role at any given time and the

31:12.880 --> 31:17.600
role they think that the instruments need to play is i want you to scan the bag as well as

31:17.600 --> 31:24.160
possible this is the only bag that i'm interested in at the moment and this is my lane this is my

31:24.160 --> 31:28.960
bag i want to make sure that my instruments doing i don't want the crappy instrument in my lane i

31:28.960 --> 31:35.040
want to make sure that i'm doing everything i can but what those tsa agents don't have to worry

31:35.040 --> 31:39.520
about is well how many other instruments are there in this airport is anyone getting through

31:40.160 --> 31:44.000
the lines here without going through security the average tsa agent doesn't have to worry about

31:44.000 --> 31:50.160
that they literally have one job to do and it's pay attention to this lane if there's a big gap

31:50.160 --> 31:54.960
in the security line and people are flowing through without going through security that's

31:54.960 --> 32:01.840
not on the tsa agent that's not a big systematic problem of that of of the system and we can't

32:01.840 --> 32:06.560
expect that tsa agent to have ever even thought about that like that's not on them they were

32:06.560 --> 32:13.040
trained to look at a to look at the bag and that's kind of like physicians and i you know

32:13.040 --> 32:17.360
probably some physicians will hear this and feel like i'm insulting it i don't mean to be likening

32:17.360 --> 32:21.040
you know the two professions and or anything like that i what but the point is is that

32:22.480 --> 32:29.120
a physician has one duty do no harm to this patient time isn't of the essence scale how

32:29.120 --> 32:35.680
many tests can my hospital perform in a day how many tests can my county or country perform in a

32:35.680 --> 32:42.960
day that's not a physician's training to think like that at all and so what has happened is

32:42.960 --> 32:48.240
doctors got on board early and said oh hell no we've seen these antigen tests before they're not

32:48.240 --> 32:52.640
particularly sensitive compared to pcr and and early in the pandemic there was like pissing

32:52.640 --> 33:00.480
matches between labs who had the most sensitive pcr and it just distracted everything it really

33:00.480 --> 33:06.400
i was trying to say pretty early like we don't need sensitivity we just need frequency we just

33:06.400 --> 33:11.680
need scale we need to think differently because our only goal if we're doing frequent routine

33:11.680 --> 33:17.200
testing of asymptomatic people is not medicine it's to say do you need to isolate now and if

33:17.200 --> 33:22.720
you have a pcr test that's taking three days to return and you're like if i was currently spreading

33:22.720 --> 33:27.760
virus before i walked in here and you handed me this actually happened to me today when i walked

33:27.760 --> 33:34.640
into harvard today was my first day back into harvard since february of 2020 i go in i scan my

33:34.640 --> 33:41.040
badge and they they hand me a pcr tube and they says they say like return this you know by noon

33:41.040 --> 33:46.560
or something before you before your workday is done and i'm looking at it i'm like what is this

33:46.560 --> 33:51.520
going to do like what if i'm super spreader right now yeah you're giving me free rein to walk around

33:51.520 --> 33:56.880
and infect everyone in the school and you're going to give me my result to tell me i did that in two

33:56.880 --> 34:02.880
days from now it doesn't doesn't really make sense so who is supposed to be so it's understandable

34:02.880 --> 34:09.840
that doctors kind of feel that way just like you said do no harm who's supposed to care about

34:09.840 --> 34:16.160
public health is it the fda is there some other organization you have to be created is it like

34:16.720 --> 34:22.640
just like with the military the reason we have civilian leadership when when you talk about war

34:22.720 --> 34:28.480
is it the president that's supposed to do like override fda override doctors override

34:29.120 --> 34:35.280
and basically politicians in representing the people in a state of emergency make big public

34:35.280 --> 34:41.680
health decisions like who is supposed to do it besides you on twitter it's like most people

34:41.680 --> 34:48.720
really thinking about solutions to covid will mention you or will mention this idea of rapid

34:48.720 --> 34:55.200
at home testing and it's it's you watch that happening this discussion that this is an obvious

34:55.200 --> 35:00.000
part of the solution and the solution is not happening so who is supposed to implement this

35:00.000 --> 35:07.200
idea i think the cdc that it should start there override the fda well i don't even think it needs

35:07.200 --> 35:11.280
to override it and that's why i think these should just be designated as a different tool

35:12.160 --> 35:17.440
so that the company is it's not overriding it's just saying look this isn't even this isn't in

35:17.440 --> 35:22.160
your jurisdiction to the fda this is just a a public health tool but the problem is

35:23.040 --> 35:28.560
the centers for medicaid medicare services designates any tool just like fda they designate

35:28.560 --> 35:33.280
these as medical devices purely because they could change somebody's behavior based on the

35:33.280 --> 35:39.600
result of one test so to change that at this point unless you can get cms buy-in you know

35:39.600 --> 35:46.480
we don't have there is no designation as a public health tool but the president can just say

35:47.440 --> 35:53.680
are public health tools these are not to be regulated as medical devices if their goal is

35:53.680 --> 35:59.600
not medicine but public health and if he does it he does have the authority to do that as president

35:59.600 --> 36:07.680
and to say i'm tasking the cdc to certify these tests or or authorize them for use in the united

36:07.680 --> 36:12.800
states and you know he has to say something like that he can't come out and say these are public

36:12.800 --> 36:18.640
health tools have free reign just you know any company start start shipping them in the us

36:18.640 --> 36:24.080
because that would create pandemonium and we'd have a lot of bad tests but there's a lot of

36:24.080 --> 36:30.320
really good tests out there we just are taking like six to 12 months to run trials they're

36:30.320 --> 36:37.120
failing because they can't keep up with pcr and if the president were to do this then the cdc

36:37.120 --> 36:43.040
could take it over and they could say okay it's on us we're going to decide the uk actually did

36:43.040 --> 36:49.440
this they early on they said okay they laid out a very clear regimen they said this is how we are

36:49.440 --> 36:55.680
going to evaluate rapid antigen tests because they're public health tools they did it in a in

36:55.680 --> 37:01.280
a domain that was outside of their normal medical diagnostic regulatory agencies and they they

37:01.360 --> 37:07.360
literally just had a very fast screening to say what are the best tests they went through

37:07.920 --> 37:11.760
a huge number of different tests they said okay these are the this is the rank order of which

37:11.760 --> 37:18.000
tests are good which are bad which are scalable which are not and they were able to start deploying

37:18.000 --> 37:23.840
them in weeks not years so i think the cdc really needs to take charge the problem is when it comes

37:23.840 --> 37:31.200
to like law if everyone currently perceives this as like fully within the domain of the fda and

37:31.200 --> 37:38.080
they've never heard of such an f public health test idea enabling but the but the fda itself

37:38.080 --> 37:44.000
has created the idea by saying we don't regulate public health tools so the word is out there the

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
fda has said we don't regulate them so that gives the president an opportunity to say okay

37:50.720 --> 37:54.240
these are those you know these are public health tools by definition

37:55.440 --> 38:00.560
and and i do think that this is a kind of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing but it's also a crisis

38:00.560 --> 38:04.720
of like really we're going to go through this whole pandemic and never figure this thing out

38:05.520 --> 38:09.840
that's just really sad you know if we get through this and don't figure out

38:09.840 --> 38:16.880
how to evaluate a damn rapid test so how do vaccines play with this so one of the things

38:17.840 --> 38:25.040
that when people discuss solutions to covid there's a sense that once you have a vaccine

38:25.040 --> 38:31.280
covid is solved so how does that interplay like why do we still need tests if we have vaccines

38:32.080 --> 38:37.920
yeah i am i actually wrote an op-ed in near times or wall street journal or something that was

38:37.920 --> 38:46.160
titled why we still need rapid tests with with vaccines and the real reason is because we have

38:46.240 --> 38:52.320
evaluated our vaccines based on their ability to stop disease in fact most of the trials didn't

38:52.320 --> 38:58.240
evaluate them based on their ability to stop transmission they didn't even evaluate that

38:58.240 --> 39:05.520
at all no less put it as one of the metrics for authorization and with a virus like this it would

39:05.520 --> 39:13.840
be a bit naive to think that it's really going to stop transmission well i think a lot of excitement

39:13.840 --> 39:18.400
happened right after the first clinical trials and i'm sure we were talking about it when when

39:18.400 --> 39:22.720
i was last here i would imagine given the timing but those first clinical trials came out and

39:22.720 --> 39:28.000
everyone you know jumped for joy that these things were going to be the the end to this pandemic

39:28.560 --> 39:34.720
but we had really short-sighted vision there by not recognizing two main features one is

39:35.680 --> 39:41.680
that they might not stop transmission another i guess three another is that new variants might

39:41.680 --> 39:46.240
come around that will break through the vaccine protective immunity and the third is that we

39:47.200 --> 39:53.760
were not we were measuring the efficacy of these vaccines during the peak of their performance in

39:53.760 --> 39:58.800
the first few months after people got vaccinated and that gives a skewed view of just how effective

39:58.800 --> 40:04.720
these are going to be long term so what happened with the vaccines is that everyone got very

40:04.720 --> 40:10.240
comfortable this including the cdc saying have you been vaccinated you know this is the end of the

40:10.240 --> 40:16.960
pandemic for you and let's keep it up but then delta comes along and waning immunity comes along

40:16.960 --> 40:22.880
and both of these things compound exactly as anticipated to get breakthrough cases and

40:24.080 --> 40:30.080
unfortunately what we're seeing now is the cdc and the administration went so all in on saying that

40:30.720 --> 40:35.440
breakthrough cases are rare that transmission doesn't really happen if you're vaccinated

40:35.440 --> 40:40.640
without great data especially with delta that once people started seeing breakthrough cases

40:41.680 --> 40:46.560
they started interpreting that as a failure of the vaccine the vaccines are still working to

40:46.560 --> 40:53.440
keep people out of the hospital for the most part but they're not working to stop transmission

40:53.440 --> 41:00.560
and if our goal is to stop transmission which until we decide as a society that we have different

41:00.560 --> 41:06.720
goals like we're okay with people getting ill and letting transmission go because we don't want to

41:06.720 --> 41:10.880
worry about it anymore we're not there yet so until we decide that we're not going to stop

41:10.880 --> 41:16.720
transmission we need other avenues besides the vaccine because it's it's not doing it it also

41:16.720 --> 41:21.280
means that herd immunity isn't going to happen and unfortunately as long as we keep letting

41:21.280 --> 41:27.520
spread happen in the context of vaccinated people we're kind of giving this virus a boot camp

41:27.520 --> 41:33.280
of exactly what it needs to do and mutate to get around our vaccine derived antibodies

41:33.840 --> 41:39.600
and that makes me very nervous so the more we can do to stop spread in the unvaccinated in the

41:39.600 --> 41:46.400
elderly vaccinated and in other people the better we we just should be focusing on that

41:46.400 --> 41:51.760
so in your eyes the solution would look like this you would have make enough tests where every single

41:51.760 --> 41:57.920
person will get tested every single day i think that that would be i don't want to do that actually

41:57.920 --> 42:03.440
i want to do a variation on that i think what we should do is have a dynamical testing program

42:04.000 --> 42:11.040
it doesn't have to be complicated it's every household has a box of tests in their cupboard

42:12.160 --> 42:17.360
and if you haven't seen any cases in your community for a long time stop testing do

42:17.360 --> 42:23.520
wastewater testing to see if there's any rna coming back if you start to see rna in the

42:23.520 --> 42:28.080
wastewater that represents the virus and you're still wanting to stop outbreaks you say hey

42:28.960 --> 42:32.000
you know those tests that are in your cupboards households in this county

42:32.560 --> 42:36.320
why don't what is in each household or each person each household use one test per week

42:37.440 --> 42:44.560
and can you start to just pause on that idea that's really cool the the wastewater testing

42:44.560 --> 42:49.440
that's the thing so you can you can get a sense of how prevalent the virus is in a

42:49.440 --> 42:54.640
particular community by testing the wastewater that's exactly right and so the viral load

42:54.640 --> 43:01.440
associated uh the viral load that you can find in the community represents the prevalence of the

43:01.440 --> 43:06.800
virus in the community which is really quite nice that's nice that's a nice way to paint like a map

43:06.800 --> 43:14.240
of the the intensity uh of the virus okay so when it when it goes above a certain level

43:14.880 --> 43:21.520
you can start doing much higher frequency testing per household in each household that's right so

43:21.520 --> 43:25.680
i don't want people to be in testing purgatory like that's not what i want i just want us to

43:25.680 --> 43:32.320
get through this damn pandemic and and so we can monitor the wastewater or any other methods we

43:32.320 --> 43:37.120
can monitor the hospitals in the clinics and if somebody does come in with covid-like symptoms

43:37.120 --> 43:41.040
and then a few other people come in you realize okay we got spread happening in our community

43:41.920 --> 43:45.680
send out a text message put it on the news put in the newspaper whatever you need to do

43:46.720 --> 43:52.480
tell people tell families use your test and if the cases get worse because you're just doing

43:52.480 --> 43:56.080
it once a week that's not going to stop transmission but it's going to enable you

43:56.080 --> 44:03.040
to identify where outbreaks are happening if you start to find outbreaks in pockets then the rule

44:03.040 --> 44:08.080
is simply okay let's squash the outbreak real fast so everyone in that area uncertain zip code or

44:08.080 --> 44:13.680
whatever it might be test every two days you know for seven days or every day for seven days

44:14.400 --> 44:21.120
and you'll get rid of the outbreak we can do that and if you've now gone again you know a week or

44:21.120 --> 44:28.080
two with no cases identified stop the testing again that's the nice thing that everything

44:28.080 --> 44:34.160
changes when people have the tests in their home it becomes dynamic it can become easy

44:34.160 --> 44:39.120
send a text message take your test today if some people don't do it that's fine the only goal

44:39.920 --> 44:46.240
is to get r below one and you stop the outbreak people think it has to be near perfect i always

44:46.240 --> 44:51.440
hear people say oh what if somebody doesn't doesn't use it or what if somebody lies like

44:51.440 --> 44:56.720
well you you have 98 of people testing or even 50 that's a whole lot better

44:57.520 --> 45:01.360
and you know another big difference that people i think oftentimes have their

45:01.360 --> 45:05.440
have a problem wrapping their head around especially to an extent

45:06.640 --> 45:10.800
physicians who are used to really like who are used to different kinds of metrics is that

45:11.760 --> 45:17.600
all we have to do to completely stop an outbreak from spreading in a community is to get for every

45:17.600 --> 45:25.520
hundred infected people to get them to go on and infect 95 most people would say oh my god that's

45:25.520 --> 45:31.040
a horrible you know that's a horrible program you're still letting 100 people go and infect 95

45:31.040 --> 45:37.680
people but that's for for a virus like this that's a massive public health win if you can get 100

45:37.840 --> 45:42.960
people to infect 90 most people doctors i would say like a lot of people would say that sounds

45:42.960 --> 45:49.360
like a failure to be honest but if you do that for multiple days in a row then in a couple of

45:49.360 --> 45:54.320
weeks you've gone from a big outbreak to a very very small outbreak and on the other hand if you

45:54.320 --> 46:00.000
don't do that if you allow 100 people to just infect 140 people because you're not doing the

46:00.000 --> 46:05.840
testing then instead of having 20 people at the end of those four weeks with the testing you

46:05.840 --> 46:12.880
literally would have 600 massive differences here and all the only goal then is to get our below one

46:12.880 --> 46:18.480
have 100 people infect less than 100 and you stop the outbreaks and everyone stays safe from

46:18.480 --> 46:24.240
everything you've seen how cheap can these things get from like in the past year in in terms of

46:24.240 --> 46:30.240
developments you've seen with the various test manufacturers how cheap can it be to make a test

46:30.240 --> 46:36.640
to manufacture a test so there's the manufacturing process that could be 50 cents maybe less it's

46:36.640 --> 46:40.640
hard to get it's hard to really have eyeballs inside these companies you know in terms of

46:40.640 --> 46:46.960
where they're producing them in china and taiwan number of other places some of them are produced

46:46.960 --> 46:51.920
here in the united states too but 50 cents save is a very very reasonable generous number for how

46:51.920 --> 46:57.840
much it costs per test you look at a place with high market competition that has actually

46:57.840 --> 47:03.200
authorized a lot of these tests like germany germany has 60 70 some odd different companies

47:03.200 --> 47:09.200
of high quality rapid tests authorized you can go there and buy it for 80 cents you know that's and

47:09.200 --> 47:14.800
they're still making profit and so so it's extremely cheap market competition can drive

47:14.800 --> 47:23.840
these tests way down in terms of cost i think one of the most important features of a rapid test

47:23.840 --> 47:30.640
program is what do you do with the result is it going to be used for you to gain entry to school

47:30.640 --> 47:37.040
or work is it going to be reported to the public health agencies you know all of these the primary

47:37.040 --> 47:41.120
mode should be just get people tests but really if you're going to be using it for a workplace

47:41.120 --> 47:45.840
thing like what biden is now saying vaccinator test which is going to lead to a crisis if we

47:45.840 --> 47:49.680
don't fix this soon because we're going to have massive demand for testing in the next couple

47:49.680 --> 47:55.360
weeks but when he says that that's essentially saying okay companies need to make sure that

47:55.360 --> 48:01.440
their people are testing so are you going to base it on the honor system i would say you probably

48:01.440 --> 48:07.920
would not base testing on the honor system if it's like to take somebody who would otherwise be

48:07.920 --> 48:12.800
quarantined from in school and so you can go to school as long as your test is negative so test

48:12.800 --> 48:18.000
to stay program is a big thing that i've been pushing for and others have businesses bringing

48:18.000 --> 48:24.560
people into work who needs to test they need to have verification but they don't want to like

48:24.560 --> 48:29.120
set up nursing stations in their lobbies or in the school parking lot or whatever like everyone's

48:29.120 --> 48:33.360
tired of that we need to bring the test into the home but that means we need the technology

48:33.920 --> 48:41.440
to enable it and so i was at a conference recently do you know mike milken milken institute he's a

48:42.080 --> 48:46.720
very wealthy billionaire but he's done a lot of philanthropy and he hosts a conference to raise

48:46.720 --> 48:52.880
money for prostate cancer research i was at this conference recently francis collins a number of

48:52.880 --> 48:59.280
other people were there and every morning we all had to test in the morning which i thought was a

48:59.280 --> 49:06.160
great idea obviously before we walked into that conference and but you didn't have to test there

49:06.160 --> 49:11.760
and they didn't base it on the honor system every morning i'll i scan i scanned a qr code on the box

49:12.240 --> 49:19.360
and emed which is a service that provides test verification popped up with a proctor right on

49:19.360 --> 49:25.600
my phone or on my computer and said okay let's go through your tests like and they watch you they

49:25.600 --> 49:31.680
videotape you using the test so it's all recorded it's all a reportable type of test and at the end

49:31.680 --> 49:36.240
of it just from your home you don't actually see the proctor you know they're but they're

49:36.240 --> 49:41.600
just verifying that you actually do it they verify the test they verify the test result with you

49:42.560 --> 49:47.680
and at the end of it you've then gotten from from your couch or from your car wherever you are

49:48.240 --> 49:54.720
an actual verified laboratory report that can be considered proof that you yourself use the test

49:54.720 --> 50:00.480
and you yourself got a negative so the tools are out here if we want to use them at scale in

50:00.480 --> 50:07.600
effect the cdc uses emed now to enable people to come back into the united states through an

50:07.600 --> 50:10.960
antigen test so before you get on your flight you're sitting in the airport in heathrow or

50:10.960 --> 50:17.440
wherever you are you can get on your computer use your emed test and you get the negative and

50:17.440 --> 50:22.240
cdc will accept that tsa will accept you to come back into the us with a rapid antigen test that

50:22.240 --> 50:26.800
you did without anyone else watching except for this proctor on your phone super simple

50:27.840 --> 50:33.760
how much private information is being collected so like this you know people have in the united

50:33.760 --> 50:41.600
states the american way they have a hesitancy on the overreach of government in things like vaccine

50:42.240 --> 50:50.720
passports like using any mechanism any mechanism of verification that's controlled by government

50:50.720 --> 50:58.800
can lead to overreach by said government so there's a concern of that do you see there a way of

50:58.800 --> 51:06.000
achieving testing that's verified but does not violate people's privacy or sense of freedom

51:06.000 --> 51:12.720
absolutely i i think so the way that um right now in the united states they're requesting that

51:13.760 --> 51:19.520
these tests get that the results get delivered to public health agencies but i've long held that

51:20.560 --> 51:25.280
while that's ideal it should never be the thing that holds up somebody being allowed to know

51:25.280 --> 51:32.480
their own status but if you are going to work and you have to let your boss or your manager

51:32.480 --> 51:37.200
whomever know that you were negative that day or if you're going to school i think it's going to

51:37.200 --> 51:45.200
be hard to maintain complete privacy uh in that situation because they need to know your name

51:45.200 --> 51:51.120
but sure i mean could you cut off the public health reporting yes you could but i worry i

51:51.120 --> 51:55.840
mean can you opt out maybe you could opt out that should be a feature i want to opt out

51:55.840 --> 52:01.360
of the public health reporting because you know for whatever reason otherwise i'm not going to

52:01.360 --> 52:05.280
do the test and but that means that okay then you're not going to go to work so right now

52:05.280 --> 52:12.800
there's a serious tension and i am very uncomfortable with the idea that we force anyone to do anything

52:12.800 --> 52:17.920
but there is a tension between these two things for sure and how do you balance that during a

52:17.920 --> 52:24.640
public health emergency i think first and foremost let people everyone has a right to

52:24.640 --> 52:29.760
know their status right the fact that we have made it hard for people to know their status

52:29.760 --> 52:35.440
on their terms i think is a travesty i mean it's just so terrible that we have

52:37.200 --> 52:43.200
prioritized us knowing at the expense of you know essentially what public health has long said

52:43.200 --> 52:48.880
during this pandemic is if i'm public health it's if i can't know then you can't know your status

52:49.520 --> 52:54.240
like that's not the right way to look at public health we need to engage the public

52:54.240 --> 52:57.600
and if some of them don't want to participate in the public health part but want to know

52:58.240 --> 53:03.200
their status by default they are participating in public health whether they know it or not

53:03.200 --> 53:07.520
because they're not going to go get their mom sick by mistake at least most people wouldn't

53:07.520 --> 53:16.640
and also you can create systems where you can individuals can form relationships based on their

53:16.640 --> 53:24.720
status without ever reporting it to a centralized place so you you can go to i don't know a local

53:24.720 --> 53:31.840
business owner might require that you show that you're negative but that doesn't require reporting

53:31.840 --> 53:41.200
it you can like there might be um basically like an id that's only in possession you are the only

53:41.200 --> 53:46.400
person in possession of that so you literally show it exactly here's a test i took it's negative

53:46.400 --> 53:51.360
and nobody else knows about that test so that could very well be done even through a company

53:51.360 --> 53:58.240
like emad i think and i might be wrong here uh i believe that they take the test result and

53:58.240 --> 54:04.800
because they are considered a cleo wave laboratory like a digital laboratory they report their results

54:04.800 --> 54:10.160
by law out to uh the public health agencies but let's say there was something a little different

54:10.160 --> 54:14.640
let's say you were verifying an over-the-counter test and it doesn't have to be a cleo wave because

54:14.640 --> 54:20.800
it's over the counter then you're not bound by cleo rules and you could create the same service

54:20.800 --> 54:25.040
but that just doesn't report out to the public health agencies it gives people the option

54:25.600 --> 54:31.440
to opt in or out of public health reporting and you know i know that public health people

54:32.400 --> 54:38.560
get a little queasy when i talk about this but as a public health person myself like yes of course

54:38.560 --> 54:44.080
i would prefer that the data be available to evaluate to know where the cases are but first

54:44.080 --> 54:50.080
and foremost i want to make sure that the people using the test are are going to use the test and

54:50.080 --> 54:54.640
if that means that they're not reporting and if that's the only way that they will use it

54:54.640 --> 55:01.680
is if it's not reported then that's better than no test especially given that the central to the

55:01.680 --> 55:08.400
vaccine hesitancy is a distrust of authority and the distrust of government so you're asking

55:09.680 --> 55:18.480
you're asking people to get tested uh and report their status uh to a centralized authority when

55:18.480 --> 55:23.840
they're clearly and do not trust that authority it doesn't make any sense it seems like a perfect

55:23.840 --> 55:31.360
solution to let people who are hesitant on the vaccine to uh get their own status and have full

55:31.360 --> 55:36.000
control of that information and opt in provide that information if they wish to but they have

55:36.000 --> 55:41.520
the full control of it and they have the freedom to do that information what they want i fully agree

55:41.520 --> 55:47.200
with that i i really do i think we can have the verified services and we could have the privacy

55:47.200 --> 55:51.120
if you want it if you want if you need to go into a restaurant and there's a rule that you have to

55:51.120 --> 55:57.280
be a negative test have it on your phone and only your phone and it's okay like emails you the the

55:57.280 --> 56:03.440
lab report you have it you can say look that's my name i use it this morning negative and in that

56:03.440 --> 56:08.480
case you'd want something that just is there and is not going anywhere else and i think that those

56:08.480 --> 56:15.920
services like i think they can exist and it's a struggle because for those companies they don't

56:15.920 --> 56:23.120
want to fall out of favor with the cdc or with the fda and so this is a big problem in our marketplace

56:23.120 --> 56:31.920
in general by having by having private companies who want to be the be the public health agents

56:31.920 --> 56:37.360
of this pandemic we lose a lot of control because the companies ultimately have to do what's going

56:37.360 --> 56:42.320
to make them money so they survive and keep performing the service it's really it's really

56:42.320 --> 56:49.120
just such a hard problem and i this is why last time i was here i'm guessing i was probably really

56:49.120 --> 56:55.200
pushing for the government to be producing these tests i think i would have still been pushing for

56:55.200 --> 56:59.280
that you know at this point i've decided okay government's clearly not going to do that i've

56:59.280 --> 57:06.640
been thinking i really want elon musk to produce the tests like i i really am sort of serious that

57:06.640 --> 57:11.200
these tests are simple to make but we've been using like machines to make them that have been

57:11.200 --> 57:17.840
around for a long time scale is an issue right now kind of really it's the eua process and getting

57:17.840 --> 57:22.240
the companies to be allowed to market in the u.s that's the issue but let's just say scale is the

57:22.240 --> 57:28.720
issue and one company wants to make 20 million tests a day these aren't that hard like we we

57:28.720 --> 57:33.200
should be able to do that we just need a faster machine a better machine yeah and a quicker one

57:33.200 --> 57:37.520
and there's a few folks like you mentioned know how to solve that problem i've had a lot of

57:37.520 --> 57:41.920
discussion with uh with tesla folks and you know with with people they used to work a test like

57:41.920 --> 57:47.360
jim keller about how to make stuff much cheaper much better that's basically what tesla is world

57:47.360 --> 57:54.880
class at and it's like okay does this thing have to cost a thousand dollars no it can cost ten

57:54.880 --> 57:59.120
dollars right and let's figure out how to manufacture it those those those folks are

57:59.120 --> 58:05.200
like the best in the world at doing that okay but um what about this biden action plan

58:06.160 --> 58:14.720
so it sounds like the guy agrees with you vaccinate or test so i think given that choice

58:14.720 --> 58:20.560
a lot of people go with test in america because there's there's like a division it seems like

58:20.560 --> 58:25.840
so what is this just uh politics is is this just words or do you think this is actually

58:25.840 --> 58:32.160
going to lead to something and maybe can you explain what the action plan sure is so there's

58:32.240 --> 58:38.000
there's a number of pillars to the action plan um the two that i've been most focused on i mean

58:38.000 --> 58:43.760
some of them are we want to get everyone vaccinated all these things and one pillar is saying any

58:44.480 --> 58:49.280
company in the united states that has more than 100 employees

58:51.440 --> 58:57.520
is now required to ensure that any unvaccinated individuals in their workforce

58:58.400 --> 59:07.040
test weekly another pillar is that the president's going to reduce the cost of pcr tests

59:08.400 --> 59:18.000
by 35 which is pretty moderate reduction and is going to reduce the cost of antigen tests

59:18.000 --> 59:24.480
and scale them up and make 280 million tests and put two billion dollars into it

59:24.480 --> 59:30.320
so those are the two that i found most intriguing for the kind of mission that i've been on which is

59:30.320 --> 59:35.600
to just educate people around hey we have really really powerful public health tools we have yet to

59:35.600 --> 59:46.240
deploy um the issue at hand though is that now that the president has said vaccinate or test

59:47.280 --> 59:52.480
there's a problem inherent in that you know it's essentially to coerce people around vaccinated to

59:52.560 --> 59:56.880
get vaccinated because vaccinator test doesn't make sense when the vaccinated people can transmit

59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.920
the virus just fine it should be vaccinate and test exactly it's the problem that i have with

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:09.760
that vaccinate or test idea is it's great if you want to use it as a coercive uh effort to get

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.960
people vaccinated like i'm not going to wade into that argument do i agree with it or not i'm just

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:22.400
not going to even put my words under i disagree with let me say i disagree as opposed to doing

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:29.920
great science communication this weird like people talking down to the populace as if they're

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.640
children trying to trick them here have some candy uh this kind of like everyone with common sense

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.160
somebody told me i was having a conversation like if the government is going to give you money to

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.400
take the vaccine people that were already hesitant about the vaccine are not going to

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.440
trust whatever the heck you're doing so don't trick people into taking the vaccine be honest

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.400
and communicate transparently everything that's known about the vaccine communicate the data

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:08.960
inspire people with uh with uh transparency and like real communication of all the uncertainty

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.800
around it and all the difficult decisions of risk and all those kinds of things and as opposed to

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.600
trying to trick them like children into taking the vaccine anyway yes but okay well i didn't have to

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:28.320
say it so there we go but you're saying it should not be uh uh like vaccinate or test that's that's

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.200
that trade-off does not exactly vaccinate by saying vaccinate or test is absolutely confusing

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.480
because it implies for anyone who's thinking about it it is implying and and i've seen this

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.080
because i business leaders call me fortune 500 business leaders who call me and say

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.600
what do i do like i have 8 000 employees where am i going to get my tests you know and a lot of

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.840
people are saying they're calling this a pandemic of the unvaccinated these types of divisive

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.160
this divisive language doesn't help this isn't a pandemic of the unvaccinated this is a pandemic

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.880
of a fucking virus you know like don't ever put it on the unvaccinated who frankly are just scared

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.480
they don't know who to trust and we haven't given them a lot of reason to trust public health to be

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:21.680
frank so i agree i mean now that you've opened the door i'll just say my piece like absolutely

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:28.000
we need to be the most honest we can with all of this this this is confusing language to say

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.440
vaccinate or test we need to say we need to be very upfront that says and say look vaccines aren't

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.840
stopping transmission very well unfortunately this is the world we have we have delta we're

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.280
going to have new mutants we have a vaccine that's that wanes somewhat over time you know this is

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:53.120
biology i'm sorry i'm you know this is just what it is and then we say but the vaccines are really

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.480
protective for your personal health they're going to keep you out of the hospital this is what you

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.640
should care about as an individual and as a population we need to figure out okay we have

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.600
to stop transmission if that's our goal so we should use the tools that are going to stop

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.760
transmission if that's our goal and saying vaccinate or test if our goal is to actually

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.400
stop transmission that's confusing because vaccines are not stopping it there may be mildly

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.080
lowering the risk of transmission so i i'm just not a fan of that language i think we should be

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.200
being very very clear like you said and upfront about what are the limitations of the test of

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.560
the vaccine and of the test and we should be very clear that like you know it can only help

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.560
the american public in aggregate is extremely intelligent to you know they will figure out

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.880
when you say that vaccine breakthrough cases are rare and then they start seeing story after story

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.320
of like whole parties of people who are vaccinated have outbreaks and and everyone knows more people

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.120
now who are having breakthrough cases than they knew who had regular cases before the vaccine

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.560
people start to wonder hmm well this is weird they say that the vaccines are working breakthrough

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.280
cases are rare maybe the whole vaccine program is failing entirely and so it ends up shooting

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.200
ourselves in the foot if we try to create false expectations because we think it's going to be

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.320
beneficial for one thing when it's not for the other and so the other so to get back to the

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.920
action plan sure vaccinate or test i think and and the and the increase in rapid tests

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.440
i do think it was a bold move i think it uh i i would say that it was the most prominent

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.120
sort of display encouraging display of the fact that rapid tests are indeed uh effective public

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:46.160
health tools my real concern now with with is that 280 million tests that's like less than one per

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.000
person per year in the united states so that's not the way that he said and delivered it and what

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.840
most people think of when they hear the word 280 million you don't usually put a lot of thought

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.040
into what does that number mean it sounds a big number most people are now going to be expecting

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:06.240
that these tests are actually going to be staying in stock on the on the shelves at cvs and walgreens

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:12.800
and amazon or whatever so that's crisis number one is like now the expectation is set for having

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.920
rapid tests but they're not going to scale that well we won't have them and then there's vaccinate

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.600
or test and that's going to bring millions and millions of people who are not currently testing

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.400
to have to start testing so that's going to overwhelm our pcr labs and it's going to create

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.800
five day delays again with pcr if not longer because we'll have backlogs and so the only real

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.920
solution to this is to just scale up the tests that are actually scalable and that's these simple

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.560
rapid tests and it's not even to scale them up through production and manufacturing here

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.440
it's to open the doors so the companies that already exist here and can scale

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.280
are allowed to do it and to bring in the international market some of the biggest

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.520
diagnostic companies in the world are not selling their millions and millions and millions of tests

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.800
in the billions of tests in the united states because i don't want to play the the game that

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.880
the fda is currently requiring of them so we have an opportunity and i i am very encouraged

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.720
that the president actually did put these into the action plan and i do want to say for the record

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:23.040
that i'm supportive of it in principle but i think now now we actually are in a in like a

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.440
a the timer has been set and we have to deal with the crisis before it happens otherwise there could

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.600
be some real political points taken off you know i do worry that the president if he doesn't pull

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.960
through with this and really make the tests available we end up getting into this other

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.320
test crisis this fall there could be political consequences to that and the reason is like these

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:48.000
rapid tests are so personal they become emotional almost there so they give people that empowerment

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.360
that i was talking about earlier and when people can't get that because the shelves are out of

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:59.360
stock they actually feel frustrated and then that converts into like anger like in the and blame

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.600
and so i do think that we have to be really smart about making a policy like this and then ensuring

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:12.880
that we can carry through with what the average american is actually expecting and speaking of

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.400
politics one of the great things about testing maybe you can correct me but for my sense it's

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.920
one of the only solutions to covet that has not yet been politicized so masks and vaccines whether

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:33.840
you like it or not have been heavily politicized where there's literally a red blue split on the

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:43.920
use of those or like proud use effective use of those tools and it seems like everybody i

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:50.800
talked to about testing everybody's on board red or blue they are which is why i am particularly

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.320
concerned about the vaccinate or test policy right because all of a sudden we just politicized it we

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:03.680
just brought it with this thing that was fully bipartisan really by part i mean i've talked to

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:10.640
the fully the the really right side of congress and the super liberal side of congress the senate

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.360
the same politicians governors everywhere in this country have asked me for support

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.560
around these rapid tests because it just you can have it reported or not you can have it in the

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.840
home in the privacy of your own home or not or you do it at school these these tools are just so

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.920
powerful to identify infectious people they didn't have to be politicized they still don't i don't

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.880
think that the action plan went so far that it's going to politicize them but i do think already

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:44.960
it's starting to conjure up emotion saying well now i have to get tested the have to part right

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:53.200
and that is where we go wrong it's i have to get tested or vaccinated you know screw that

01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:00.560
i am independent you know whatever and and i do worry that this thing that was purely bipartisan

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.560
that we could have just scaled up months ago people would have we could have delivered it to

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.160
every household didn't even have to ask people to request it just delivered packages to every home

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:16.720
in america by now easily if we were smart about it you know we could have done it the most unpleasant

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.600
thing about covid is the uncertainty and that's what leads to fear on both the um uh vaccine

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.480
hesitant the it's the uncertainty about the vaccine and uh people who are have taken the

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.640
vaccine the uncertainty around like am i in danger walking around can i go can i walk down the hall

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:43.120
like this fear of the world around you and i think testing allows you to uh remove a lot of

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:49.120
that uncertainty like you you gain back confidence that you can operate in this world and not get

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.720
infected and you become like a nicer person i i find myself every time i get tested i become a

01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:00.320
nicer person to others because i know i'm not putting them in danger i'm not putting people

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:07.760
in danger it's a it's a heavy burden to carry to worry am i infectious like i was out last night

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.320
but i do want to go see my mom today you know like am i infectious i don't know and and this has

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:20.960
created massive anxiety and i can't tell i completely agree that it is it's a relieving

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.960
feeling and and it's an amazing feeling to be in a room when and i did this in the middle of the

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.520
pandemic when everyone was supposed to be wearing a mask indoors and everyone rapid tests you know

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.440
and i said everyone should rapid test before you walk into this room and it was a wonderful

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.840
experiment because everyone was just so relaxed yeah you know the other the alternative is

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:52.480
everyone nobody tests and everyone wears a mask you have a mask that maybe gives you 20 percent

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.880
maybe protection during if you're all in the same room together if that or you have a rapid

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.920
test program or everyone rapid test before and that gives you like 95 percent to 100

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:10.320
protection not 100 but close and all of a sudden that allows everyone to take a big sigh and be

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.520
like wow this is the first time i've seen people without masks indoors in a long time and i feel

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.480
pretty good and restaurants like restaurants are scary right now because you just don't know who

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:27.920
might be infectious and nobody's masked and like wouldn't it be great to just go into a restaurant

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:35.280
where you know that everyone just tested negative that day it just really reduces anxiety it makes

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.280
individuals feel empowered and i mean at the end of the day covid and our response to covid is a

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:47.280
is a it's truly an information problem you know we why do we quarantine anyone why did we ever

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.920
close anything down we didn't close things down because everyone is positive we closed things down

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:58.640
because we didn't know if anyone was positive we quarantine a whole classroom of kids not because

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.040
they're all positive but because we don't know if one of them are positive and so we just quarantine

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.080
everyone when there's a positive in the case in the in the classroom like one day well then ask

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.320
the whole classroom not to come to school for 10 days that's not a biological problem that's an

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.560
information problem and the crazy thing is we have the tool to solve that information problem

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.680
it's literally our eyes on the virus it's how we see this virus and if everyone glowed green

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.640
when they were infectious we would have never had to close down anyone any society and we would have

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.600
never had the outbreaks because we would have been able to stay away from the green people

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.240
you know and yeah i like what you said the quarantine is an information problem that's

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.160
absolutely right what is there something you can say to what people can do like listening to this

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:51.280
individuals do you just complain like loudly like why can't we do this can you speak with

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:59.600
your money somehow what what can people do to help god it's it's amazing to think you're asking

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.440
me this question and this video will go out to you know the web and all the people that watch you

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.680
and uh last year in july maybe something like that june i forget exactly when it was i was on

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.280
twiv this week in virology um shout out to twiv those guys are awesome they are awesome i love

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.960
i love twiv and they asked me the exact same question towards the end they said this makes

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:28.240
so much sense you know why wouldn't we do this what can people do and so i said oh you know just

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.680
send me an email like write to me i'm sure you could find my email somewhere online and uh and

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.520
get in touch and i will you know and and we can try to figure out how to uh make something happen

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:46.240
yeah bad idea very smart way too many emails i didn't i feel bad because i didn't end up getting

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.840
back to anyone because i just got inundated but it did lead to the development of rapidtest.org

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.560
where we did automate the process of writing letters to congressional members and elected

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.640
representatives so that helps fast forward to today what can what can people do

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:11.840
do i honestly don't know like what can the average person at this point do we have tried

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:18.400
everything the fda is immutable on this they will not change and we shouldn't ask them to change

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.000
because they have decided that this is how they regulate medical devices and they're going to

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.920
stick to it so what we need to do and maybe this is something to do is get if you know people

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:35.120
who have sway over politicians lobbyists whatever it might be let people know to request

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.160
that the president literally the president of the united states uses executive powers

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.800
to just do a simple something as simple as designating these powerful public health tools

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:55.600
as public health tools allow the cdc and the nih or whomever it must be or or academic centers of

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:04.240
excellence designated by the cdc to evaluate the tests in a very fast fashion with the appropriate

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.400
metrics that these tests need to achieve for public health and within two days we can have

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.760
10 new tests authorized you know this doesn't have to be a six to 12 month endeavor this could be a

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.320
two-day endeavor we actually did it i just i judged the rapid test x prize and it went great we

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.640
actually got incredible metrics about how well does each test work and no clinical trials you

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.280
know just a couple days worth of work in the lab and boom and if we actually systematize it would

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:40.720
be an hour so in the lab you know so simple so i don't know i mean i don't know how to really

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.680
impact change i've thankfully you know i have a platform and i've been able to start talking with

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:53.040
people who are very close with the president and the white house and and i do think that some

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.720
change is finally happening because the silver bullet of the vaccine has not panned out to be

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.800
the silver bullet so now we gotta now i think we're moving from a country that was a vaccine only

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:10.720
approach to finally recognizing at the highest levels that there's other tools do you think it's

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.640
possible to reopen fully without solving the testing problem completely like do you think

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:26.080
this vaccine approach will get us to reopen fully i do yeah i think over time though i mean if we

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.680
a lot of people ask me like what's what's like happening like what's the end game here like

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:40.800
where does this end and um it's actually not a mystery the end game is we will grow out of this

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:49.840
virus um and by that i mean you and i and most people who are watching this are adults right

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:57.280
adults don't like to get infected with a virus for the very first time as adults babies are

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.240
okay with it and so what we have to do to understand how we're getting out of this virus

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.240
is to look at babies like at newborns and say okay how does a baby get out of their high risk

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.360
time period they get exposed they get like exposed multiple times or vaccinated of course and

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.840
eventually they get exposed enough that they build up this nice cushion of immunity that's

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.080
sufficiently diverse that they can battle whatever gets thrown at them because they've seen it all

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:30.960
already but one exposure doesn't do it i mean over the course of the first few years of life

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:36.320
kids get exposed to coronaviruses tons of times lots of different viruses they get so unfortunately

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.240
what's happening with us why this is so bad for us is that as we're adults we don't regenerate

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.160
tissue very well we have like over abundant inflammatory response we have all these problems

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:52.320
that when we get an infection for the first time it sucks it harms us it causes us problems but

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.600
over time just like a baby we're going to start building up our immunity through vaccines and

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.120
exposures you know i hate to say it but tons of people are getting exposed to delta right now who

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:12.000
don't know it tons and if you're vaccinated you don't know it is my point there and you know at

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.120
the end of the day this is actually i do not want this to be misconstrued as like saying go get

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.320
infected but the fact that people are getting infected you know will add to our level of

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.240
protection later on and so yeah but the question is how long that whole process takes i think

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.720
you know my guess is probably by the end of next year early 2023 we will probably start looking at

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.440
this as though it is not a particularly dangerous virus for most people the elderly though it will

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:45.040
still be but that's because their immunity like variants and stuff well i've heard other people

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.880
say this statement you just said a year ago about this spring right well that probably was

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.880
not wise well i mean it's because your the intuition is like okay now that there's a

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.680
vaccine you're either going to take the vaccine or get infected and then there'll be herd immunity

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:08.480
over like it'll be very quick so you know that that's the intuition but it seems like that's not

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:16.320
happening it seems like we're in this constant state of fear mongering for different reasons

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:23.520
it's almost it's almost like the virus got deeply integrated not into just our biology but

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:31.920
in the game of politics and in the fear mongering around the news because the virus now started

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:39.120
being together with the vaccine and the masks and it started getting integrated into the division

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:46.320
that's so effective at monetizing social media for example and so it's like all right

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:52.480
so how do you get out of that because you can always kind of present certain kinds of numbers

01:19:52.480 --> 01:20:01.280
about number of cases or how full hospitals are and start making claims about that we're still

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.640
this is as bad as it's ever been those kinds of statements and so i'm not sure exactly what the

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:14.400
way out is except the same way out as it was originally which is testing is information it's

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:20.000
information yeah and and i think we can do that we can keep outbreaks suppressed with testing

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.160
because it's information like people keep thinking of tests as being medical things they're not

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.880
they're information it can allow us to control things just like we drive down a road and

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.440
we look at the cars and we don't hit other cars because we have the information that they're

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:41.200
annoying next to us and they're moving over like that's just information like you said glow green

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:47.120
the problem the virus you don't have you don't see you're walking around and everybody is a potential

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:55.600
uh like infectious creature and so if you see the world as a potential potential for infection

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.120
you're going to be terrified of that that's exactly right and that is what has happened and

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.880
i and that's why i've been pushing so hard for for these tests because they can allow people

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.040
if you use them at a community level you can have enough people know that they're positive enough

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.000
people are good people that they won't go out and affect others and the other great thing about them

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.240
is again a 10-day isolation period especially for a vaccinated person but in either case

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.960
is also an information problem we don't have to isolate for 10 days if we're infected what if

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:31.040
we're only infectious for two yeah especially if we're vaccinated why are we telling people

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:37.760
the only reason the cdc ever and the who ever suggested a 10-day isolation or 14-day quarantine

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.160
is because we didn't know when people stopped being infectious there's actually some people

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:48.240
stay infectious for 14 days it's rare but there's a lot of people who stay infectious for like four

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.960
and that's a whole nother week that we're asking people to isolate people would probably be much

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.840
more likely to comply if they only have to isolate as long as they wake up each morning and see two

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.800
lines because you're actually seeing it for your own two eyes you're being empowered to make your

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.800
own decision you're not being told you need to isolate for 10 days and you're sitting there

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.520
thinking oh i feel fine i don't know why you know there's a lot of asymptomatic spread but if you see

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:18.000
the two lines every day then you actually get to you're doing a little experiment for yourself to

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.440
prove to yourself today i'm still infectious let's hope it's tomorrow come on immune system you can

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.040
do this you know and then you get to day four and boom you start being negative that's a much more

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:35.600
tolerable thing because you are you are being able to make that decision based on true data that is

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:41.600
empowering you and it really does change changes everything like because it's all fear and

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:48.720
and empowerment and these are empowering devices well i wanted to have this conversation with you

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.600
because obviously it's a great solution let's keep talking about it people who listen to this should

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.000
i guess pressure local politicians

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:07.360
right articles right articles with the title like dear produce yeah you know please designate these

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.960
as public health tools or just start talking about in the media talk it talk about on social

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:17.520
media anywhere testing is a public health good testing is a public health good we all like it

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:25.200
should not be considered a medical device i shouldn't have to pay to keep you safe like testing

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.800
should generally be free for that matter like subsidized by the government these tools exist

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.400
they we should all and i think the more people that generate noise to just say

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:42.240
a public health test is a public health tool you know period like it's you can't even argue

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.800
with it yeah i think if you talk about it enough than certain people that have even a bigger

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:57.680
platform like ilan musk sunday pache those folks that have power to really do like large-scale

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:04.320
manufacturing also influence governments will pay attention and that's the hope enough people talk

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.920
about it i think business leaders like business leaders obviously have so much power here yeah

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.960
you know they they pay the lobbyists who you know make things happen like let's be honest there's

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.480
people who pull levers that are not the politicians themselves and i do think

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.000
business leaders have so much to gain from these tools to keep their businesses safe to not have

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.840
to quarantine and lock down and i hope that all of them hear this message to say let's let's ask

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:36.240
the president or the people around the president to designate these as public health tools change

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.360
the system and if you can't change every aspect of the system then figure out how to change the

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:47.040
system enough so that you're doing everything in a safe way that is not endangering anyone but it

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:53.840
is only protective yeah you mentioned last time that you spent time as a buddhist monk

01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:00.400
we like didn't spend much time talking about i just would love to talk to you about about it a little

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:09.040
bit more maybe as uh by way of advice how do you recommend people can integrate meditation into

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:22.000
their lives or how does one meditate i i think for me meditation was um really an active effort

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.560
which sounds weird because most people think of meditation as like they lack the absence of

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:37.840
activity um but just like anything uh meditation is it requires exercise in this case it requires

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:44.480
exercise in quieting your mind and the whole well there's a lot of different reasons people meditate

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.760
most people watching this podcast or this show what is this called i don't know is this an

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:59.040
interview i'm not even recording this just you and i talk um it is you know most people are

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.960
meditating to like bring some balance and bring some sanity to their life and just like

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.200
be able to control their feelings and emotions a little bit more and for that purpose like i think

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:17.120
the best way to to you know what meditation is if you can call it what you will it's just getting

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.240
some alone time some time to think or not think you know whatever and it looks different for each

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:31.520
person for me it was a very active effort to try to quiet my mind with the explicit intent to detach

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:39.520
from things from lots of things and it's actually it sounds weird in our culture here to talk about

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:46.480
detachment as a goal detachment from loved ones detachment from objects is kind of easy to

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.560
reconcile like people understand that yeah i don't want to be too attached to my car or whatever

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.200
but detachment from a loved one is like a very hard thing because we want to do the opposite

01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:02.960
usually we want to love a loved one but in a lot of buddhist thought it is those attachments

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:11.040
that keep people in this cycle of rebirth now i don't personally um believe in rebirth in the way

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:20.400
that uh you know in a buddhist sense in that like you actually get born multiple times i think we

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:27.200
my personal feeling is we die and we're vanished you know um that's just me um and

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.600
but i still really um found meditation to be extraordinarily powerful to

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.600
feel control over a whole different part of my body that i never thought that

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.720
it could be controlled your mind like you close your eyes and most of us immediately start seeing

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:54.000
blotches and we start thinking about things and and it's an amazing feeling to start getting

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:02.080
to the point where you can actually actually quiet your mind and close your mind down so

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:09.120
that you can just have peace like silence of your mind for a long period of time and

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.840
you know i loved it it was you know but it's a it's kind of a dangerous slope because you

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.840
can kind of get caught up in it and like really start going from okay i'm trying to quiet my mind

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.200
to almost being like addicted to quieting your mind and it was a very active exercise every day

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:32.640
15 hours a day to just practice quieting my mind and eventually i could you know and and

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.920
in buddhism there's a whole lot of stages that you go through too once you hit that point where

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:43.040
you can quiet your mind then there's like other psychological things that happen

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:50.240
and eventually the the end goal for a buddhist monk who's spending their life meditating in the

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:56.960
forest is to achieve nirvana is to have an absence of any attachment to the point where

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.160
you're not even attached to your own foot or your own leg you can cut it off and

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:10.240
and so you don't even have an attachment to self like to ego to do you feel like a conscious

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.040
being or no like the goal i never attained it but you know is that the goal to escape

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.960
that would be so the goal is you have to first look at it through the eyes of samsara which is

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.720
the cycle of rebirth which is suffering it's a cycle of suffering is how it's viewed and the idea

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:33.280
is like if i really love this hat and then the hat gets lost i'm sad so that makes me suffer

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.440
and if i hate this hat and i see it then it makes me sad or mad and that you know is an it's an

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.360
emotion but if i have zero if i'm completely ambivalent about that hat i'll give it's there

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:52.400
i don't care if it gets lost if it's shredded then that is invokes no emotional rise out of me good

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.840
or bad and so the idea is to find the balance there where you are so detached from everything

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.240
that you're not getting a rise negative or positive and you know this is really it's

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:12.640
really such a distinct thing in a relative to our normal lives here in america where

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.880
we live for rises you know you want happiness and joy and then you also you know nobody wants

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:24.400
sadness but like when you come out of sadness you feel happy and either way it averages out

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:29.280
right and if it doesn't average out then you're you know you're in a bad spot like that would be

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.360
things like major depressive disorder where you're truly not averaging out but if you're

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.520
living a pretty happy life that's why there's no right or wrong you can go up and down and

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.560
you average out or you can just go that straight line and this is not necessarily

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:50.640
the the buddhist ideal is somehow obviously the ideal you should strive for but the actual

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.680
access exercise and meditation that they the buddhist monks use seems like um

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:06.560
seems like a great tool for becoming aware of your own mind and that seems to be important for

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:14.320
um appreciating life or some some kind of uh experiencing life on a deeper level

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.600
i i think so i mean that's my my personal opinion is yes and that i think it

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:29.760
i don't meditate anymore um back in the capitalist western world yeah well there's meetings and

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:36.240
that's right i mean i stopped i was a monk and then the tsunami hit and i lived in a refugee

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:41.920
camp and i was that was the indian ocean tsunami in 2004 and it just really

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.240
it was really interesting in srilanka they wanted me i asked well what can i do to help

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:55.920
it was it was a horrible horrible you know hell on earth um experience in many ways but

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:02.880
when i said what can i do to help the answer was well you could meditate like that's how you know

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.640
keep keep doing what you're doing like that's how you that's how we can get good karma and to me

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.080
coming from like western roots i just couldn't deal with that i i just said that doesn't make

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:20.000
sense to me why would i just sit and meditate when there's so much devastation happening here and

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.400
and so i kind of stopped meditating then and then never really recovered from that time in the

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:32.800
refugee camp but i do feel like i understand or like i am aware of of a part of me that most

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:39.760
people never get the privilege to be aware of and that is a pretty profound and it's a it's a

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.600
profound uh feeling i think or just awareness to to say i do have the if i ever need to go

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:51.520
back to that i have the capacity to do that and i do use it i mean i don't use it a lot

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.000
but i use it when i really need to um to try to like settle to settle myself to

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:05.920
to actually calm myself whether it's pain physical or emotional pain like it is possible to

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.640
make those things go away but it just like anything it takes training

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:19.840
have you if you take yourself back to that place you were you know sam harris talks about that

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.320
through his meditation practice he's able to escape the sense of free will

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:32.240
and uh this the sense of agency you can get away from that hey do you ever think about

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.880
consciousness and free will when when you were meditating like did you get some deep insight

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:45.840
about the nature of consciousness that you were somehow able to escape it through meditation

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:54.080
or no i looked at it in a much more utilitarian way i think and the sensation like minimizing

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.240
amount of thoughts in your mind and then beginning to really appreciate the sensation

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.960
yeah you weren't writing a book on the on free will right and uh i mean maybe if i kept at it

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.760
you know there's a good chance that if the tsunami didn't happen i might still be sitting there on

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.640
the top of that mountain uh the tsunami is you see a pain you see especially um uh if you see

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.480
cruelty and you're supposed to meditate through that that doesn't there's something in the human

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:29.360
spirit that pushes us to want to help if you see somebody who's suffering to react to that seems

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.480
like to help them as opposed to care less through meditation don't become attached to the suffering

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.720
of others exactly i mean that's i i do think that that's you know and they're two totally

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:49.360
valid ways to live life um they are generally i think they're ingrained in us pretty early

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:55.600
in society right and it's hard to escape yeah what about uh just in general becoming detached

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:03.040
from possessions like uh minimalism and uh not having many things so the the capitalist world

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:11.520
kind of pushes you towards having possessions and deriving joy from more and more and better

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:18.640
possessions have you uh have you returned back to the joys of that world or do you find yourself

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:28.880
enjoying the minimalist life uh a little of both i think i really don't like i find things to be

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:35.760
a burden to be a massive burden you know and and to me when you have a burden like that

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.400
you know even if it's just knowing that there's like boxes in your basement of stuff you know

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:50.960
whatever it might be it makes it hard to focus um and so i personally like i mean my ideal like if

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.760
i had a my house for example would be to have like nothing on anything it would just

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.480
and and that to me is like peaceful some people find that to be not peaceful

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.760
for me it's like i love that and i to have the night the idea that

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.400
if needed i could like pack up and move yeah and not worry about anything do i actually have that

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:23.680
in reality no um we're about to have a baby you know there's but it's like it's our i already see

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.760
it it's like stressful there's like boxes of stuff showing up at the house like bottles and

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:35.760
clothes and all these little hats and whatnot and i do i do have to like sometimes go into my

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:44.240
meditation to just just say like this is okay you know like it's yeah it's okay to have all of this

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:51.360
stuff it's not permanent you know and um but i do think that it's easy to get lost in it all

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.360
and it's important to remember given all that like people who buy houses

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:02.320
you know buy a home and buy a house and make a home out of it and you start a family it's easy to

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.640
forget that even though you have all these responsibilities you're still free

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.040
and like freedom takes work and it takes remembering it takes meditation on it but

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:18.320
you're you're free you're you're born free you live free i mean depends of course which country

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.120
but in the united states even with all the possessions even with all the burdens

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:32.240
of um sort of credit and owing money and all those kinds of things you can scale everything down

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.640
scale everything down and you're free but ultimately the people you love

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.960
you love each other it doesn't take much money to be happy together and for me i personally value

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:50.640
that freedom of having the freedom to always pursue your happiness as opposed to being burdened by

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:58.640
material possessions that uh you know yeah that basically limit your ability to be happy because

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.200
you're always paying off stuff you always catch you know trying to match the neighbors that are

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:08.800
always a little bit richer that kind of pursuit i think that pursuit is wonderful for innovation

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.560
and for building cooler better things but on an individual level i think you have to remember

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:20.000
that first of all life is finite and second of all like your goal is not to get a bigger house

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.360
your goal is to be just content and happy in the moment i completely completely agree with that

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:38.640
so in looking at our failure at scale to to engineer to manufacture to deploy tests

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:46.160
how do you feel about our prospect as a human civilization are you optimistic so this pandemic

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.520
it is what it is it um hurt a lot of people both it took lives

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.480
um but it also hurt a lot of businesses and a lot of people economically

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.120
but uh they're very likely to be a much worse pandemic down the line there might

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:11.600
be other threats to human civilization are you nevertheless optimistic oh i don't think i'm

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:18.080
optimistic about it all i think what are you most worried about it's it's one of those things it's

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:25.120
so existential that i don't worry about it um but i do think i mean let's in the united states

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:29.280
for example so you asked about the human civilization but let's talk about like a

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:36.480
american society for a moment i do think that like we're probably seeing like the end of a

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.360
really interesting experiment like the american experiment and we're seeing its limitations

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.960
we're probably going to become another blip like another one another power that's in the history

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:53.360
books that like rose and collapsed probably that's where we'll go in terms of civilization i think

01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:01.200
we're demonstrating a pretty significant inability to recognize the danger wherein

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.240
whether that's the pandemic or whether that's climate change

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.800
i think it's extraordinary that we we are not taking these things seriously

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.480
yeah and we're not acting with the urgency and i mean in some ways climate change

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:26.560
truly makes like this pandemic look like child's play in terms of like the destruction it has the

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.680
potential to wreak i tend to think if you just look at the progress of human history

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:41.200
that the people who do good in the world out power the people that are the that do bad in

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:47.600
the world so we kind of there's something about our minds that likes to focus on the negative

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:54.240
like on the destructive because we're afraid of it it's also for some reason more fun to watch

01:40:54.240 --> 01:41:01.440
destruction i don't i don't you know but it seems like the people who build who create solutions who

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:10.720
yeah who innovate and who just put like both on the emotional level so love out there and

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.960
like on the actual engineering level tools that make for higher quality of life i think those

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:23.040
win out if you look at human history but the question is whether the negative stuff can

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.000
sometimes peak to the level where everybody's just destroyed but as long as that doesn't happen

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:35.280
i i tend to believe that there would be like a gradual with some noise a gradual improvement

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.440
of quality of life in human civilization i do think so to a certain extent but it's that what's

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:47.120
what you said like unless there's like some significant peak of bad you know the and the

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:55.360
problem with bad is that it can happen like that you know good you can you can't build a society

01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:02.960
overnight but you sure can kill one like i just think about food crises and instability and and

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.520
just i don't know but i do hope that i mean i completely agree i think we can engineer

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:17.920
our way to a healthier better world like i truly do my concern is that the people who are doing

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:25.920
that until very recently don't generally rule the world now of course we're seeing non-elected

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:32.080
leaders and you know people who run massive corporations essentially

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:40.240
having as much or really more power than elected leaders or than kings and queens and such so how

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.960
they choose to wield that power you know is an interesting choice and i do hope that you're

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:54.960
right in that over time fear will drive companies to produce a better product or whatever you know

01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:01.440
something like over time it's just like predator prey models you get so bad or so everything like

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:06.320
it's so revved up that all of a sudden something cracks and they say okay i do want an electric

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:12.800
car or whatever and and that takes some combination of innovation letting people know that these

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.760
electric cars exist it's kind of rapid test too like you get to finally feel it and see it

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.560
have an electric car and then all of a sudden things change and everyone says oh this is so

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.520
bad and actually i'm doing good for the world relatively speaking and you know i guess the

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:36.560
paradigm shift yeah it becomes uh for lack of a better word viral positivity does and i mean i

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:44.320
believe that ultimately that that wins out because i think there's much more power to be gained so

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:52.000
i think most people want to do good and if you want to wield power you want to uh uh channel

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.440
people's desire to do good and i think over time that's that's exactly what people uh will do but

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.640
yeah this i mean both on the natural side the pandemic you know there's still biology at play

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.840
there's still viruses out there trying to kill us there's accidents uh there's nuclear weapons

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:15.440
there's unintended consequences of tools with this and then nanotechnology side or the artificial

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:21.040
intelligence side then there's the natural things like meteors and all that that kind of stuff and

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:29.360
climate change all of that but i tend to think we humans are a clever bunch and when there's a

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:37.600
deadline a real deadline or real threat before us we kind of step up i don't know but maybe you have

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:47.600
to believe that um until the very end yeah that's right it'll it'll i mean we'll have to see i guess

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.280
you know neither well ideally we won't be alive to see that

01:44:53.440 --> 01:45:00.800
well no mike i'm glad we talk again because um this has been such a difficult time

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:08.960
that feels like there's no solutions and it's so refreshing to hear that there's a solution

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:14.720
to covid and there's an engineering solution on the individual level something people can do

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:20.000
on the government level is something people can do on the global level something people can do

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:27.680
we should be doing rapid testing at scale it's obvious it's amazing that you still are

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:34.800
you know telling that story pushing that message bravely boldly i really really appreciate the

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:42.320
work you're doing and and i'm i will do in my small way the same to try to help out and everybody

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:49.040
else should too until we get hundreds of millions of tests in people's hands it's an obvious solution

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:58.000
we should have had a long time ago and um i like solutions not problems and this is obviously a

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
solution so thank you for presenting it to the world and thank you for talking about it

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.080
