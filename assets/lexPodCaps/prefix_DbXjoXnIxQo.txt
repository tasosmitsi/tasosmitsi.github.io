00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
What are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.340
How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.680
How far would they go to hang on to power

00:09.680 --> 00:12.640
when push came to shove is, I think,

00:12.640 --> 00:15.200
the thing that worries me the most

00:15.200 --> 00:17.480
and is plainly what worries most people

00:17.480 --> 00:19.120
about the risk of nuclear war.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.720
Like, at what point does that unchecked leadership

00:22.640 --> 00:24.880
decide that this is worth it,

00:24.880 --> 00:29.680
especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.320
The following is a conversation with Chris Blattman,

00:34.320 --> 00:36.320
professor at the University of Chicago,

00:36.320 --> 00:41.000
studying the causes and consequences of violence and war.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.160
This, he explores in his new book called,

00:44.160 --> 00:48.820
Why We Fight, The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace.

00:48.820 --> 00:51.120
The book comes out on April 19th,

00:51.120 --> 00:54.760
so you should pre-order it to support Chris and his work.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.760
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.760
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:58.760 --> 01:01.880
in the description, and now, dear friends,

01:01.880 --> 01:03.760
here's Chris Blattman.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.360
In your new book titled, Why We Fight,

01:07.360 --> 01:10.220
The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace,

01:10.220 --> 01:12.160
you write, quote,

01:12.160 --> 01:15.660
"'Let me be clear what I mean when I say war.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.320
"'I don't just mean countries duking it out.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.260
"'I mean any kind of prolonged,

01:20.260 --> 01:22.460
"'violent struggle between groups.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.860
"'That includes villages, clans, gangs, ethnic groups,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.560
"'religious sects, political factions, and nations.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.780
"'Wildly different as these may be,

01:31.780 --> 01:34.720
"'their origins have much in common.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.480
"'We'll see that the Northern Irish zealots,

01:37.480 --> 01:40.360
"'Columbian cartels, European tyrants,

01:40.360 --> 01:43.160
"'Liberian rebels, Greek oligarchs,

01:43.160 --> 01:45.480
"'Chicago gangs, Indian mobs,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.120
"'Rwandan genocide dares.'"

01:48.120 --> 01:50.320
A new word I learned, thank you to you.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.400
Those are people who administer genocide.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.000
English soccer hooligans and American invaders.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.900
So first, let me ask, what is war?

02:03.800 --> 02:06.820
In saying that war is a prolonged,

02:06.820 --> 02:08.460
violent struggle between groups,

02:08.460 --> 02:12.660
what do the words prolonged, groups, and violent mean?

02:12.660 --> 02:13.860
I sit at the sort of intersection

02:13.860 --> 02:15.500
of economics and political science,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.620
and I also dwell a little bit in psychology,

02:18.620 --> 02:21.460
but that's partly because I'm married to psychologists,

02:21.460 --> 02:23.700
sometimes do research with her.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.720
All these things are really different.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.680
So if you're a political scientist,

02:25.680 --> 02:27.400
you spend a lot of time just classifying

02:27.400 --> 02:30.600
a really narrow kind of conflict and studying that.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.160
And that's an important way to make progress

02:33.160 --> 02:34.200
as a social scientist.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.480
But I'm not trying to make progress.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.360
I'm trying to sort of help everybody step back and say,

02:38.360 --> 02:39.880
you know what, there's like some common things

02:39.880 --> 02:42.680
that we know from these disciplines

02:42.680 --> 02:46.320
that relate to a really wide range of phenomena.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.680
Basically, we can talk about them in a very similar way,

02:48.680 --> 02:49.880
and we can get really similar insights.

02:49.900 --> 02:54.380
So I wanted to actually bring them together,

02:54.380 --> 02:56.860
but I still had to like say,

02:56.860 --> 02:58.620
let's hold out individual violence,

02:58.620 --> 03:00.020
which has a lot in common,

03:00.020 --> 03:04.380
but individuals choose to engage in violence

03:04.380 --> 03:06.740
for more and sometimes different reasons.

03:06.740 --> 03:10.600
So let's just put that aside so that we can focus a bit.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.820
And let's really put aside short incidents of violence,

03:13.820 --> 03:17.440
because those might have the same kind of things

03:17.440 --> 03:19.500
explaining them, but actually there's a lot of other things

03:19.500 --> 03:20.740
that can explain short violence.

03:20.740 --> 03:25.040
Short violence can be really demonstrative.

03:25.040 --> 03:25.880
Like you can just,

03:25.880 --> 03:28.000
I can use it to communicate information.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.640
The thing that all of it has in common

03:29.640 --> 03:31.400
is that it doesn't generally make sense.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.060
It's not your best option most of the time.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.640
And so I wanted to say,

03:35.640 --> 03:37.960
let's take this thing that should be puzzling.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.560
We kind of think it's normal.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.300
We kind of think this is what all humans do,

03:42.300 --> 03:44.240
but let's point out that it's not normal

03:45.700 --> 03:47.440
and then figure out why and let's talk about why.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.380
So I was trying to throw out the short violence.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.180
I was trying to throw out the individual violence.

03:53.180 --> 03:56.580
I was also trying to throw out all the competition

03:56.580 --> 03:58.020
that happens that's not violent.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.500
That's the normal competition.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.440
I was trying to say, let's talk about violent competition,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.900
because that's kind of the puzzle.

04:03.900 --> 04:04.980
So that's really interesting.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.500
You said, usually people try to find a narrow definition

04:09.500 --> 04:10.900
and you said progress.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.780
So you make progress by finding a narrow definition,

04:13.780 --> 04:16.340
for example, of military conflict

04:16.380 --> 04:18.600
in a particular context.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.000
And progress means, all right, well,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.440
how do we prevent this particular kind of military conflict?

04:24.440 --> 04:26.280
Or maybe if it's already happening,

04:26.280 --> 04:29.940
how do we deescalate it and how do we solve it?

04:29.940 --> 04:31.760
So from a geopolitics perspective,

04:31.760 --> 04:33.640
from an economics perspective,

04:33.640 --> 04:36.340
and you're looking for a definition of war

04:36.340 --> 04:38.800
that is as broad as possible,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.840
but not so broad that you cannot achieve

04:41.840 --> 04:45.240
a deep level of understanding of why it happens

04:45.240 --> 04:46.820
and how it can be avoided.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.500
Right, and a common, basically recognize

04:49.500 --> 04:52.980
that common principles govern some kinds of behavior

04:52.980 --> 04:54.540
that look pretty different.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.120
Like an Indian ethnic riot.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.380
It's obviously pretty different

04:59.380 --> 05:01.620
than invading a neighboring country, right?

05:01.620 --> 05:04.620
But, and that's pretty different than two villages,

05:04.620 --> 05:06.220
or two gangs, a lot of what I work on

05:06.220 --> 05:08.060
is studying organized criminals and gangs.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.020
Two gangs going to war you'd think is really different,

05:10.020 --> 05:13.440
and of course it is, but there are some common principles.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.580
You can just think of a conflict

05:14.880 --> 05:18.660
in the use of violence, and not learn everything,

05:18.660 --> 05:21.160
but just get a lot, just get really, really far

05:21.160 --> 05:22.500
by sort of seeing the commonalities

05:22.500 --> 05:24.420
rather than just focusing on the differences.

05:24.420 --> 05:28.720
So again, those words are prolonged, groups, and violent.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.040
Can you maybe linger on each of those words?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.680
What does prolonged mean?

05:32.680 --> 05:36.280
Where's the line between short and long?

05:36.280 --> 05:39.120
What does groups mean, and what does violent mean?

05:39.120 --> 05:41.680
So let me, you know, I have a friend who,

05:42.600 --> 05:43.720
someone who's become a friend

05:43.720 --> 05:47.260
through the process of my work, and writing this book also,

05:47.260 --> 05:52.260
who was 20, 30 years ago, was a gang leader in Chicago.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.580
So this guy named Napoleon English, or NAP.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.380
And I remember one time he was saying,

05:57.380 --> 05:59.460
well, you know, when I was young, I used to,

05:59.460 --> 06:04.020
I was 15, 16, and he'd go to the neighboring gang's territory.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.500
He says I'd go gang banging, and I said,

06:05.500 --> 06:06.580
well, I didn't know what that meant.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.580
I said, what does that mean?

06:07.580 --> 06:09.860
And he said, oh, that just meant I'd shoot him up.

06:09.860 --> 06:13.420
Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.360
I wasn't trying to kill the, he wasn't trying to kill them.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.040
He was just trying to sort of send a signal

06:18.040 --> 06:20.800
that he was a tough guy, and he was fearless,

06:20.800 --> 06:24.760
and he was someone who they should be careful with.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.320
And so I didn't want to call that war, right?

06:27.320 --> 06:30.800
That was, that was, that's something different.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.220
That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic,

06:33.220 --> 06:36.280
and he wasn't, and he was basically trying

06:36.280 --> 06:37.560
to send them information.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.200
And this is what countries do all the time, right?

06:40.220 --> 06:41.900
We have military parades,

06:43.060 --> 06:46.000
and we might have border skirmishes.

06:47.260 --> 06:49.980
And I wanted to sort of, so is it,

06:49.980 --> 06:53.300
what's short, is a three-month border skirmish, a war?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.860
I mean, I don't try to get into those things.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.680
I don't want to, but I want to point out

06:57.680 --> 07:02.060
that like these long, grueling months and years of violence

07:02.060 --> 07:04.820
are like part of the problem and the puzzle.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.380
And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time

07:07.400 --> 07:12.320
talking about the international version of gang banging.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.520
It's a different phenomenon.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.560
So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap,

07:16.560 --> 07:19.280
let's call him, not to add confusion,

07:19.280 --> 07:21.880
that doesn't qualify for war?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.920
Is it the individual aspect?

07:23.920 --> 07:28.620
Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought,

07:28.620 --> 07:33.620
but the communication of information is what is sought?

07:34.440 --> 07:36.740
Or is it the shortness of it?

07:37.640 --> 07:39.280
Is it all of those combined?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.760
It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group,

07:41.760 --> 07:44.560
or he was becoming the head of a group at that point.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.440
And that group eventually did go to war

07:47.440 --> 07:49.320
with those neighboring gangs, which is to say,

07:49.320 --> 07:52.000
it was just long drawn out conflict

07:52.000 --> 07:53.880
over months and months and months.

07:53.880 --> 07:58.440
But I think one of the big insights from my fields

07:58.440 --> 08:02.960
is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?

08:02.980 --> 08:04.420
Whether you're officially negotiating

08:04.420 --> 08:05.340
or you're all posturing,

08:05.340 --> 08:07.860
like you're bargaining over something.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.860
And you should be able to figure out a way to split that pie.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.600
And you could use violence.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.180
But violence is, everybody's miserable.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.300
Like if you're napped, like if you start a war,

08:18.300 --> 08:20.020
one, you know, there's lots of risks.

08:20.020 --> 08:22.620
You could get killed, that's not good.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.140
You could kill somebody else and go to jail,

08:24.140 --> 08:26.620
which is what happened to him, that's not good.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.940
Your soldiers get killed, no one's buying your drugs

08:28.940 --> 08:31.220
in the middle of a gunfight, so it interrupts your business.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.920
So on and on, like it's really miserable.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.880
This is what we're seeing right now,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.840
as we're recording the Russian invasion of Ukraine

08:37.840 --> 08:40.040
is now the fourth or fifth week.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.920
Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before,

08:42.920 --> 08:47.200
it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.400
As you described, for everybody.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.720
So everybody is losing in this war.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.240
Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.120
Everybody loses something from war.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.960
And there was usually, not always,

08:59.220 --> 09:03.220
the point is there was usually a way to get what you wanted

09:03.220 --> 09:05.900
or be better off without having to fight over it.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.020
So there's this, it's just fighting is just politics

09:09.020 --> 09:11.860
by other means, and it's just inefficient,

09:11.860 --> 09:14.540
costly, brutal, devastating means.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.020
And so that's like the deep insight.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.580
And so I kind of wanted to say,

09:18.580 --> 09:20.940
so I guess like what's not war in my,

09:20.940 --> 09:23.860
I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions

09:23.860 --> 09:26.900
because some, you know, there's reams and reams

09:26.920 --> 09:29.080
of political science papers written on like,

09:29.080 --> 09:30.840
what's a war, what's not a war?

09:30.840 --> 09:31.820
People disagree.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.400
I just wanted to say,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.140
war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing,

09:38.140 --> 09:41.040
or war is the violence that doesn't make sense.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.500
There's a whole bunch of other violence,

09:42.500 --> 09:44.960
including gang banging and skirmishes

09:44.960 --> 09:47.080
and things that might make sense,

09:47.080 --> 09:49.720
precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating

09:49.720 --> 09:53.800
or they're not particularly costly.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.280
War is the thing that's just so costly

09:55.280 --> 09:56.160
we should be trying to avoid

09:56.340 --> 09:59.260
is maybe like the meta way I think about it.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.300
All right.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.780
Nevertheless, definitions are interesting.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.480
So outside of the academic bickering,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.460
every time you try to define something,

10:08.460 --> 10:13.460
I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.180
So the destination doesn't matter

10:15.180 --> 10:18.500
because the moment you arrive at the definition,

10:18.500 --> 10:19.780
you lose the power.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.820
Yeah, one of the interesting things,

10:21.820 --> 10:24.300
I mean, so people, you know, if you want to do, you know,

10:24.320 --> 10:26.920
some of what I do is just quantitative analysis of conflict.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.120
And if you want to do that,

10:29.120 --> 10:31.260
if you want to sort of run statistics on war,

10:31.260 --> 10:32.680
then you have to code it all up.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.360
And then lots of people have done that.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.480
There's four or five major data sets

10:36.480 --> 10:39.480
where people or teams of people have over time said,

10:39.480 --> 10:40.920
we're going to code years of war

10:40.920 --> 10:44.000
between these groups or within a country.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.360
And what's interesting is how difficult,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.160
these data sets don't often agree.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.640
You have to make all of these,

10:49.640 --> 10:51.880
the decision gets really complicated.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.000
Like when does the war begin, right?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.460
Does it begin when a certain number

10:56.460 --> 10:58.060
of people have been killed?

10:58.060 --> 11:01.980
Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing

11:01.980 --> 11:03.820
and sort of like little terror attacks

11:03.820 --> 11:05.860
or a couple of bombs lobbed,

11:05.860 --> 11:08.140
and then eventually turns into war?

11:08.140 --> 11:10.820
Do we call that, do we backdate it

11:10.820 --> 11:13.500
to like when the first act of violence started?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.340
And then what do we do with all the times

11:15.340 --> 11:17.340
when there was like that low scale,

11:17.340 --> 11:19.900
low intensity violence or bombs lobbed?

11:19.900 --> 11:22.580
And do we call those wars,

11:22.580 --> 11:24.340
or maybe only if they eventually get worse?

11:24.340 --> 11:26.900
Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.700
And the defensive and the offensive aspect.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.860
So everybody, Hitler in World War II,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.980
it seems like he never attacked anybody.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.640
He's always defending against the unjust attack

11:38.640 --> 11:41.280
of everybody else as he's taking over the world.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.520
So that's like information propaganda

11:44.520 --> 11:48.080
that every side is trying to communicate to the world.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.680
So you can't listen to necessarily information,

11:50.680 --> 11:52.280
like self-report data.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.080
You have to kind of look past that somehow.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.200
Maybe look, especially in the modern world,

11:57.200 --> 11:58.920
as much as possible at the data.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.360
How many bombs dropped?

12:01.360 --> 12:03.280
How many people killed?

12:03.280 --> 12:06.240
How the number of estimates of the number of troops

12:06.240 --> 12:09.080
moved from one location to another and that kind of thing.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.440
And the other interesting thing

12:10.440 --> 12:13.940
is there's quantitative analysis of war.

12:13.940 --> 12:17.280
So for example, I was looking at just war index

12:17.280 --> 12:19.080
or people trying to measure,

12:19.960 --> 12:23.400
trying to put a number on what wars are seen

12:23.400 --> 12:24.880
as just and not.

12:24.880 --> 12:25.720
Oh, really?

12:25.720 --> 12:26.560
I've never seen that.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.200
It's, there's numbers behind it.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.560
It's great.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.840
So it's great because again,

12:32.840 --> 12:37.840
as you do an extensive quantification of justice,

12:38.720 --> 12:41.920
you start to think what actually contributes

12:41.920 --> 12:44.580
to our thought that, for example,

12:44.580 --> 12:48.020
World War II is a just war and other wars are not.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.760
A lot of it is about intent

12:51.760 --> 12:54.240
and some of the other factors that you look at,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.840
which is prolonged, the degree of violence

12:56.840 --> 13:00.240
that is necessary versus not necessary,

13:00.240 --> 13:02.200
given the greater good,

13:02.200 --> 13:04.240
some measure of the greater good of people,

13:04.240 --> 13:06.120
all those kinds of things.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.640
Then there's reasons for war,

13:08.640 --> 13:13.640
looking to free people or to stop a genocide

13:13.840 --> 13:17.280
versus conquering land, all those kinds of things.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.360
And people try to put a number behind it.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.200
And a lot of-

13:20.200 --> 13:23.080
It's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is,

13:23.080 --> 13:26.200
I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.440
suppose I think my God tells me to do something

13:29.440 --> 13:32.480
or my God thinks that,

13:32.480 --> 13:34.740
or my moral sense thinks that something

13:34.740 --> 13:36.840
that another group is doing is repugnant.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.920
I'm curious, are they evaluating the validity of that claim

13:41.920 --> 13:44.360
or just the idea that, well, you said it was repugnant,

13:44.360 --> 13:46.760
you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?

13:46.760 --> 13:50.080
I think, and that could be corrected on a lot of this,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.560
but I think this is always looking at wars

13:52.560 --> 13:54.200
after they happened.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.880
So it's, and trying to take a global perspective

13:56.880 --> 14:00.720
from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.560
So you're not weighing disproportionately

14:03.560 --> 14:05.720
the opinions of the people who wage the war.

14:05.720 --> 14:10.720
Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because,

14:11.160 --> 14:14.840
I mean, one is to just point out that wars,

14:14.840 --> 14:16.880
actually most wars aren't necessary.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.600
And so in the sense that there's another way

14:19.600 --> 14:21.440
to get what you wanted.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.600
And so on one level, there's no just war.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.040
Now that's not true because,

14:28.040 --> 14:31.000
take an example like the US invasion of Afghanistan.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.840
The United States has been attacked.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.400
There's a culpable agent,

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
reliable evidence that this is Al-Qaeda.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.320
They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.560
And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.480
It seems that there was an attempt to say,

14:49.480 --> 14:53.200
hand him over or else, and they said, no way.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.840
Now you can make an argument that invading

14:56.840 --> 14:59.440
and attacking is strategically the right thing to do

14:59.440 --> 15:02.720
in terms of sending signals to your future enemies.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.440
Or you just, if you think it's important

15:04.440 --> 15:07.000
to bring someone to justice, in this case, Al-Qaeda,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.080
then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.760
But it hinges on the fact that the other side

15:14.760 --> 15:17.680
just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing,

15:17.680 --> 15:20.960
which is say, okay, we'll give them up.

15:20.960 --> 15:25.960
And so it was completely avoidable in one sense.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.120
But if you believe, and I think it's probably true,

15:28.120 --> 15:31.520
if you believe that for their own ideological

15:31.520 --> 15:36.120
and other reasons, Mullah Omar, in particular,

15:36.120 --> 15:39.640
and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this,

15:40.640 --> 15:44.560
then now you're not left with very, very good choices.

15:45.680 --> 15:49.440
And now, I didn't want to talk about is that a just war

15:49.440 --> 15:51.120
or what's justice or not.

15:51.120 --> 15:56.120
I just wanted to point out that one side's intransigence,

15:56.200 --> 15:57.160
if that's indeed what happened,

15:57.160 --> 16:00.640
one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you

16:00.640 --> 16:04.080
to basically eliminate all of the reasonable bargains

16:04.080 --> 16:05.440
that you could be satisfied with.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.520
And now you're left with really no other strategic option

16:07.520 --> 16:08.360
but to invade.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.320
I think that's a slight oversimplification,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.520
but I think that's one way to describe what happened.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.720
So your book is fascinating,

16:15.720 --> 16:18.360
and your perspective on this is fascinating.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.000
I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times

16:21.000 --> 16:22.880
to try to get a clarity.

16:22.880 --> 16:27.760
But the thesis is that war is costly,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.280
usually costly for everybody.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.880
So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war,

16:33.880 --> 16:35.480
because you're going to,

16:35.520 --> 16:40.520
from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins.

16:41.800 --> 16:46.800
And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason,

16:47.080 --> 16:50.800
a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication,

16:50.800 --> 16:54.640
or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.720
You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.520
But there's also human beings in this mix.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.160
And there is ideas of justice.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.480
So for example, I don't want to,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.240
my memory doesn't serve me well

17:11.240 --> 17:13.040
on which wars were seen as just.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.640
There's very, very few in the 20th century

17:15.640 --> 17:17.840
of the many that have been there.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.000
The wars that were seen as just, first of all,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.280
the most just war seen is World War II by far.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.200
It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold

17:28.200 --> 17:29.040
as seen as just.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.480
Everything is seen as unjust.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.520
It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.320
And I think the ones that are seen as more just

17:39.320 --> 17:40.720
are the ones that are fast,

17:41.760 --> 17:44.080
that you have a very specific purpose,

17:44.080 --> 17:46.480
you communicate that purpose honestly

17:46.480 --> 17:48.240
with the global community,

17:48.240 --> 17:51.520
and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.880
To do sort of, it's like rescue missions.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.560
It's almost like policing work.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.960
If there's somebody suffering,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.800
you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.160
I think World War II is seen in that way,

18:05.960 --> 18:09.680
that there's an obvious aggressor

18:09.680 --> 18:11.720
that is causing a lot of suffering in the world

18:11.720 --> 18:15.040
and looking to expand the scale of that suffering.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.040
And so you strike, I mean, given the scale,

18:19.040 --> 18:22.560
you strike as hard and as fast as possible

18:22.560 --> 18:25.960
to stop the expansion of the suffering.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.240
And so that's kind of how they see.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.520
I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework

18:32.520 --> 18:36.280
that you've presented and look at Hitler and think,

18:36.280 --> 18:41.280
well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia,

18:43.040 --> 18:48.040
Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union,

18:52.760 --> 18:55.840
America, the United States of America,

18:56.840 --> 18:59.040
same with Japan.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.440
Is it in their long-term interest?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
I don't know.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.720
So for me, who cares about alleviating human suffering

19:08.720 --> 19:11.880
in the world, yes, it's not.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.480
It seems like almost no war is just,

19:16.520 --> 19:21.520
but it also seems somehow deeply human to fight.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.560
And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.160
Can you try to like get at that?

19:28.160 --> 19:31.200
Cause it seems that war, there is some,

19:31.200 --> 19:35.880
that like drama of war seems to beat in all human hearts,

19:35.880 --> 19:37.560
like it's in there somewhere.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.240
Maybe it's, maybe there's like a relic of the past

19:41.240 --> 19:42.520
and we need to get rid of it.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.760
It's deeply irrational.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.180
Okay, so obviously we go to war

19:46.180 --> 19:47.560
and obviously there's a lot of violence.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.840
And so we have to explain something

19:49.840 --> 19:52.680
and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.880
So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with,

19:56.880 --> 19:58.880
I think it was just useful to sort of start

19:58.880 --> 20:01.120
and point out actually, there's really, really,

20:01.120 --> 20:03.560
really, really strong incentives not to go to war

20:03.560 --> 20:04.920
because it's going to be really costly.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.120
And so all of these other human or strategic things,

20:08.120 --> 20:10.600
all of these things, the circumstantial things

20:10.600 --> 20:13.120
that will eventually lead us to go to war

20:13.120 --> 20:16.760
have to be pretty powerful before we go there.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.440
And most of the time.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.560
Sorry to interrupt.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.600
And that's why you also describe very importantly

20:23.520 --> 20:25.680
that war throughout human history is actually rare.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.080
We usually avoid it.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.320
Most people don't know about

20:30.320 --> 20:33.000
the US invasion of Haiti in 1994.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.160
I mean, a lot of people know about it,

20:34.160 --> 20:35.760
but people just don't pay attention to it.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.680
We don't, we're going to, you know,

20:37.680 --> 20:39.600
the history books and school kids are going to learn

20:39.600 --> 20:43.680
about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades.

20:43.680 --> 20:47.560
And nobody's going to put this one in the history books.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.480
And it's because it didn't actually happen

20:50.480 --> 20:54.600
because before the troops could land,

20:54.600 --> 20:59.000
the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said fine.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.280
There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti,

21:03.280 --> 21:05.640
to this new dictator who's refused

21:05.640 --> 21:08.240
to let a democratic president take power

21:08.240 --> 21:11.880
and tries to convince him to step down or else.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.200
And he says, no, no, no.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.840
And then he shows him a video

21:14.840 --> 21:16.880
and it's basically troop planes

21:16.880 --> 21:19.000
and all these things taking off.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.320
And he's like, this is not live.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.000
This is two hours ago.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.800
So it's a, and basically he basically gives up right there.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.640
So that was-

21:27.640 --> 21:29.120
That's a powerful move.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.320
Yeah.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.080
I think Powell might've been one of his teachers

21:33.080 --> 21:34.520
in like a US military college

21:34.520 --> 21:36.640
because a lot of these military dictator trained

21:36.640 --> 21:37.480
at some point.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.480
And so they had some, there was some personal relationships

21:39.480 --> 21:40.760
at least between people in the US government

21:40.760 --> 21:42.880
and this guy that they were trying to use.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.800
The point is, and that's like what should have happened.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.840
Like that makes sense, right?

21:46.840 --> 21:51.040
And I was like, yeah, maybe I can mount an insurgency

21:51.040 --> 21:52.720
and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the cost of war

21:52.720 --> 21:54.560
because I'm the dictator and maybe he's human

21:54.560 --> 21:56.320
and he just wants to fight or gets angry

21:56.320 --> 21:58.240
or it's just in his mind, whatever he's doing.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.200
But at the end of the day, it's like,

21:59.200 --> 22:00.560
this does not make sense.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.640
And that's what happens most of the time,

22:04.640 --> 22:06.760
but we don't write so many books about it.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.720
And now some political scientists go

22:10.720 --> 22:13.080
and they count up all of the nations that could fight

22:13.080 --> 22:14.120
because they have some dispute

22:14.120 --> 22:15.960
and they're right next to one another

22:15.960 --> 22:17.520
or they look at the ethnic groups

22:17.520 --> 22:18.600
that could fight with one another

22:18.600 --> 22:19.840
because they have, there's some tension

22:19.840 --> 22:23.200
and they're right next to one another and then whatever.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.600
Some number like 900, 900 of a thousand don't fight

22:28.480 --> 22:29.920
because they just find some other way.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.800
They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace

22:32.800 --> 22:35.040
because that's the sensible thing to do.

22:35.040 --> 22:35.880
And that's what we all do.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.520
We loathe in peace and we loathe the Soviet Union

22:39.520 --> 22:41.040
in relative peace for decades

22:41.040 --> 22:44.360
and India loathes Pakistan in peace.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.800
I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.840
again, it was in the newspapers,

22:48.840 --> 22:51.480
but most people didn't, I think, take note.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.720
India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan

22:55.720 --> 22:57.680
and common suit.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.480
So they were like, yeah, this is,

22:59.480 --> 23:01.680
we do not wanna go to war, this will be bad.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.960
We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation

23:05.960 --> 23:07.240
that this was an accident.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.800
And so these things find to the radar.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.440
And so we overestimate, I think,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.680
how likely it is sides are gonna fight.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.000
But then of course, things do happen.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.440
Like Russia did invade the Ukraine

23:19.440 --> 23:22.680
and didn't find some negotiated deal.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.880
And so then the book is sort of about,

23:25.880 --> 23:28.680
half the book is just sort of laying out,

23:28.680 --> 23:31.120
actually like there's just different ways this breaks down

23:31.120 --> 23:32.640
and some of them are human.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.160
Some of them are this,

23:34.160 --> 23:37.240
I actually don't think war beats in our heart.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.600
It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.080
As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.200
We're really, really good.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.840
So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence

23:47.840 --> 23:50.120
and we're okay at getting angry and vengeance

23:50.120 --> 23:53.440
and we have principles that will sometimes lead us,

23:53.440 --> 23:57.080
but we're actually really, really, really good at cooperation.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.840
And so that's again, I'm not trying to write

23:59.840 --> 24:02.320
some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great

24:02.320 --> 24:03.840
and we're all happy and we don't really fight.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.520
It's more just to say, let's start, let's be like a doctor.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.280
As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?

24:10.760 --> 24:12.160
I know there's sick people,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.720
but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health

24:14.720 --> 24:16.360
and that most people are healthy

24:16.360 --> 24:18.000
and that's gonna make me a better doctor.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.320
And I'm kind of saying the same thing.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.160
Let's be better doctors of politics in the world

24:22.160 --> 24:25.200
by recognizing that the normal state is health

24:25.200 --> 24:28.400
and then we're gonna identify what are the diseases

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
that are causing this warfare.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.200
So yeah, the natural state of the human body

24:33.200 --> 24:35.760
with the immune system and all the different parts

24:36.760 --> 24:39.360
wants to be healthy and is really damn good

24:39.360 --> 24:41.880
at being healthy, but sometimes it breaks down.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.040
Let's understand how it breaks down.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.080
So what are the five ways that you list

24:47.080 --> 24:48.880
that are the roots of war?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.560
Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.560
There's sort of things that rhyme, right?

24:53.560 --> 24:54.400
Because it's not all the same.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.520
There's like lots of reasons to go to war.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.200
There's this great line,

24:57.200 --> 24:59.600
there's a reason for every war and a war for every reason.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.760
And that's true.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.720
And it's kind of overwhelming, right?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.440
And it's overwhelming for a lot of people.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.920
It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.200
And I think one of the gifts of social science

25:09.200 --> 25:11.480
is actually people have started to organize this for us.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.320
And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.360
Buckets that rhyme.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.360
Buckets with some economics.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.760
Yeah, terrible metaphor, right?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.000
I got it, metaphors.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.480
So the idea was that like that basic incentive,

25:22.480 --> 25:24.080
like something overrides these incentives.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.000
And I guess I was saying there's five ways

25:27.000 --> 25:30.200
that they get overrided and three are I'd call strategic.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.400
Like they're kind of logical.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.600
There's circumstances that,

25:34.600 --> 25:37.640
and they're sort of where strategic strategy

25:37.640 --> 25:40.080
is like this game theory.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.880
You could use those two things interchangeably,

25:41.880 --> 25:44.440
but game theory is sort of making it sound more complicated

25:44.440 --> 25:45.280
I think than it is.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.600
It's basically saying that there's times when this is like

25:48.600 --> 25:51.240
the optimal choice because of circumstances.

25:51.240 --> 25:55.040
And one of them is when the people who are deciding

25:55.040 --> 25:57.040
don't bear those costs.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.840
So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive

25:59.840 --> 26:03.640
that's gonna, if they're ignoring the costs,

26:03.640 --> 26:06.720
then maybe the costs of war are not so material.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.000
That's a contributing factor.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.160
Another is just there's uncertainty

26:10.160 --> 26:11.120
and we can talk about that,

26:11.120 --> 26:13.560
but there's just the absence of information

26:13.560 --> 26:15.400
means that it actually there's circumstances

26:15.400 --> 26:17.800
where it's your best choice to attack.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.520
There's this thing that political economists

26:19.520 --> 26:20.680
call commitment problems,

26:20.680 --> 26:23.080
which are basically saying there's some big power shift

26:23.080 --> 26:24.520
that you can avoid by attacking now.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.920
So it's like a dynamic incentive.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.160
It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something

26:28.160 --> 26:30.760
from happening in the future, I can attack now.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.000
And because of the structure of incentives,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.120
it actually makes sense for me,

26:34.120 --> 26:38.440
even though war is in theory really costly,

26:38.440 --> 26:40.720
or it is really costly nonetheless.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.880
And then there's these sort of human things.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.200
One's a little bit like just war.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.440
One is sort of saying there's like ideologies or principles

26:46.440 --> 26:50.920
or things we value that weigh against those costs.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.080
Like exterminating the heretical idea

26:54.120 --> 26:56.480
or standing up for a principle

26:56.480 --> 27:00.520
might be so valuable to me that I'm willing to use violence,

27:00.520 --> 27:01.960
even if it's costly.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.040
And there's nothing irrational about that.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.000
And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.240
all the passions and all of the most importantly,

27:11.240 --> 27:13.880
I think like misperceptions, the way we get like,

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
we basically make wrong calculations

27:15.880 --> 27:18.520
about whether or not war is the right decision we get.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.840
We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy

27:21.840 --> 27:23.160
or misjudge ourselves.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.520
So if you put all those things into buckets,

27:25.520 --> 27:29.880
how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way

27:29.880 --> 27:32.080
and how much of it is a giant human mess?

27:33.000 --> 27:36.120
So four of those five are really on some level,

27:36.120 --> 27:39.800
easy to think strategically and model in a simple way

27:41.280 --> 27:43.080
in the sense that any of us can do it, right?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.480
We do this all the time.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.640
Think of like bargaining in a market for a carpet

27:50.640 --> 27:52.840
or something or whatever you bargained for.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.120
You're thinking a few steps ahead

27:56.120 --> 27:58.960
about what your opponent's going to do.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.720
And you stake out a high price, like a low price,

28:01.720 --> 28:04.600
and the seller stakes out a high price.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.800
And you might both say, oh, I refuse to like,

28:06.800 --> 28:07.920
I could never accept that.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.920
And there's all this sort of cheap talk.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.400
But you kind of understand where you're going

28:13.400 --> 28:15.960
and it's efficient to like find a deal

28:15.960 --> 28:18.720
and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.240
So we all understand this game theory and the strategy,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.760
I think intuitively.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.680
Or maybe even a closer example is like suppose,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.120
I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict

28:30.120 --> 28:32.960
or any normal like kind of legal,

28:32.960 --> 28:34.400
it's not yet a legal dispute, right?

28:34.400 --> 28:36.000
Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor

28:36.000 --> 28:37.200
or somebody else.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.680
Most of us don't end up going to court.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.960
Going to court is like the war option.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.480
That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to avoid.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.320
We ought to be able to find something between ourselves

28:47.360 --> 28:51.120
that doesn't require this hiring lawyers

28:51.120 --> 28:53.360
and long drawn out trial.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.360
And most of the time we do, right?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.960
And so we all understand that incentive.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.000
And then for those five buckets,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.840
so everything except all the irrational

29:02.840 --> 29:05.360
and the misperceptions are really easy to model.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.680
Then from a technical standpoint,

29:06.680 --> 29:10.000
it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.520
And I'm not a game theorist.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.920
And so I'm more channeling my colleagues to do this

29:13.920 --> 29:15.000
and what I know.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.120
But it's not rocket science.

29:18.120 --> 29:22.040
I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book

29:22.040 --> 29:24.520
is like there's all these ideas out there

29:24.520 --> 29:27.560
that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars

29:28.640 --> 29:33.280
and just bring some order to the morass of reasons.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.120
Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.760
So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.800
People, I think.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.520
I'll defer to you actually.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.080
Well, I think it's because unfortunately it's very

29:46.080 --> 29:49.000
like engineering is very well defined.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.160
The problem is well defined.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.680
The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.600
So it is true it's not rocket science,

29:55.600 --> 29:58.600
but it is not true it's easy because it's not rocket science.

29:58.600 --> 30:03.600
But the problem, the downside of game theory

30:04.840 --> 30:08.440
is not that it helps us make sense of the world.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.240
It projects a simple model of the world

30:11.240 --> 30:15.280
that brings us comfort in thinking we understand.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.280
And sometimes that simplification is actually getting

30:19.280 --> 30:23.480
at the core first principles on understanding of something.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.040
And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.680
So for example, I mean, mutually assured destruction

30:30.680 --> 30:33.760
is a very simple model and people argue all the time

30:33.760 --> 30:35.880
whether that's actually a good model or not,

30:35.880 --> 30:38.760
but there's empirical fact that we're still alive

30:38.760 --> 30:40.280
as a human civilization.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.120
And also in the game theoretic sense,

30:43.120 --> 30:47.200
do we model individual leaders and their relationships?

30:47.200 --> 30:52.200
Do we, the staff, the generals, or do we also have

30:53.360 --> 30:58.280
to model the culture, the people, the suffering

30:58.280 --> 31:01.160
of the people, the economic frustration or the anger

31:01.160 --> 31:04.160
or the distrust, do you have to model all those things?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.760
Do they come into play?

31:05.760 --> 31:09.840
And sometimes, I mean, again, we could be romanticizing

31:09.880 --> 31:12.080
those things from a historical perspective,

31:12.080 --> 31:13.280
but when you look at history

31:13.280 --> 31:15.800
and you look at the way wars start,

31:15.800 --> 31:20.240
it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding

31:20.240 --> 31:24.000
escalates, escalates, escalates,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.280
and just builds on top of itself

31:28.280 --> 31:30.360
and all of a sudden it's an all out war.

31:31.440 --> 31:35.240
It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes.

31:35.240 --> 31:39.000
So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense

31:39.000 --> 31:42.080
that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things

31:42.080 --> 31:44.200
and take the game theory too seriously.

31:44.200 --> 31:49.200
And people who study those things and write those models

31:50.320 --> 31:53.120
and people like me who use them sometimes

31:53.120 --> 31:55.480
make that mistake, I think that's not the mistake

31:55.480 --> 31:58.400
that most people make most often.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.520
And what's actually true is I think most people,

32:00.520 --> 32:01.720
we're actually really quick,

32:01.720 --> 32:05.080
whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq,

32:05.920 --> 32:09.360
we're really quick to blame that on the humanness

32:09.360 --> 32:10.280
and the culture and that.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.840
So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's

32:14.840 --> 32:17.160
either desire for revenge and vengeance

32:17.160 --> 32:20.760
or some private agenda or blood for oil.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.560
So we're really quick to blame it on these things.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.560
And then we're really,

32:25.560 --> 32:30.280
we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack,

32:30.280 --> 32:31.600
which I think we're probably dominant.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.840
I think those things might've been true to a degree,

32:33.840 --> 32:35.280
but I don't think they were enough

32:35.280 --> 32:37.520
to ever bring those wars about.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.240
Just like I think people are very quick to sort of,

32:40.240 --> 32:44.240
in this current invasion, to sort of talk about

32:44.240 --> 32:49.240
Putin's grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great

32:50.280 --> 32:55.280
or nationalist ideals and the mistakes

32:55.540 --> 32:57.440
and the miscalculations were really quick to sort of say,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.000
oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.440
but maybe even stop there

33:01.480 --> 33:05.120
and not see some of the strategic incentives.

33:05.120 --> 33:09.000
And so I guess we have to do both,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.160
but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war

33:12.160 --> 33:13.720
is just such a big problem.

33:13.720 --> 33:18.620
It's just so costly that the strategic incentives

33:18.620 --> 33:21.240
and the things that game theory has given us

33:21.240 --> 33:23.760
are like really important in understanding

33:23.760 --> 33:27.520
why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain

33:27.520 --> 33:31.340
that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter

33:31.340 --> 33:35.420
or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions

33:35.420 --> 33:37.180
or vengeance actually matters,

33:37.180 --> 33:38.380
because those do matter,

33:38.380 --> 33:42.100
but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal

33:42.100 --> 33:45.220
is so narrow because of the circumstances.

33:45.220 --> 33:48.660
And so let's not, it's sort of like saying,

33:48.660 --> 33:52.920
like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?

33:52.920 --> 33:55.640
Pneumonia killed them, obviously,

33:55.640 --> 33:58.780
but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.300
All of the fundamentals and the circumstances

34:02.260 --> 34:03.100
sort of like made them very fragile.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.380
And that's how I think all the strategic forces

34:05.380 --> 34:08.020
make that situation fragile.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.900
And then the miscalculations

34:09.900 --> 34:11.600
and all of these things you just said,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.780
which are so important, are kind of like the pneumonia.

34:13.780 --> 34:16.420
And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.300
And you're saying that people don't

34:18.300 --> 34:20.480
disproportionately pay attention to the...

34:20.480 --> 34:21.320
It's hard.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.140
I mean, it wasn't...

34:22.140 --> 34:22.980
To the leaders.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.820
It took me a long time to learn to recognize them.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.700
And it takes many people, you know,

34:29.180 --> 34:31.620
and it took generations of social scientists

34:33.060 --> 34:35.780
years and years to figure some of this out

34:35.780 --> 34:37.580
and to sort of help people understand it

34:37.580 --> 34:38.960
and clarify concepts.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.260
So it's not, it's just not that easy.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.100
No, it's not hard.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.340
I think it's possible to,

34:43.340 --> 34:45.580
just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book

34:45.580 --> 34:47.300
in graduate school or from reading,

34:47.300 --> 34:49.780
and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff,

34:49.780 --> 34:50.980
but it's still really hard.

34:50.980 --> 34:55.180
And so that's kind of what I was trying to do,

34:55.180 --> 34:57.500
is like close that gap and just make it,

34:57.540 --> 35:02.100
help people recognize these things in the wild.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.500
Before we zoom back out,

35:03.500 --> 35:06.580
let me at a high level first ask,

35:06.580 --> 35:09.580
what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

35:09.580 --> 35:12.660
How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

35:12.660 --> 35:14.140
A Russian colleague of mine,

35:14.140 --> 35:15.660
Konstantin Sonin tells this story

35:15.660 --> 35:18.320
about a visiting Ukrainian professor

35:18.320 --> 35:19.160
who's at the university.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.340
And one night he's walking down the street

35:21.340 --> 35:25.100
and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.420
And a mugger stops him.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.340
And demands the phones.

35:29.340 --> 35:32.300
And it's sort of like deadpan way, Konstantin says,

35:32.300 --> 35:34.780
and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight.

35:35.940 --> 35:39.860
And I think that's a little bit like what happened.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.200
Most of us in that situation

35:41.200 --> 35:43.300
would hand over our cell phones.

35:43.300 --> 35:47.260
And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger

35:48.140 --> 35:49.740
and the Ukrainian people are being asked

35:49.740 --> 35:50.740
to hand over this thing.

35:50.740 --> 35:54.140
And they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over.

35:54.140 --> 35:59.140
And the fact is, most people do.

35:59.340 --> 36:02.700
Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant

36:02.700 --> 36:06.100
or an autocrat or a murderous warlord

36:06.100 --> 36:09.380
who says, hand this over, they hand it over.

36:09.380 --> 36:14.300
And that's why there are so many unequal,

36:14.300 --> 36:16.120
imperial relationships in the world.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.040
That's what empire is.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.420
Empire is success of people saying, fine,

36:20.420 --> 36:22.980
we'll give up some degree of freedom or sovereignty

36:22.980 --> 36:24.380
because you're too powerful.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.460
And the Ukrainians said, no way.

36:26.460 --> 36:27.920
This is just too precious.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.100
And so I said, one of those buckets

36:30.100 --> 36:32.300
were that there's a set of values.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.260
There's sometimes there's something that we value

36:35.260 --> 36:37.300
that is so valuable to us and important.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.980
Sometimes it's terrible.

36:38.980 --> 36:42.020
Sometimes it's the extermination of another people.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.660
But sometimes it's something noble,

36:43.660 --> 36:46.880
like liberty or refusal to part with sovereignty.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.060
And in those circumstances,

36:49.060 --> 36:52.300
people will decide, I will endure the costs.

36:52.860 --> 36:56.740
I mean, I think they knew what they were probably risking.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.740
And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians

37:00.740 --> 37:03.260
any more than I would blame Americans

37:03.260 --> 37:04.220
for the American Revolution.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.900
It's actually a very similar story.

37:05.900 --> 37:09.300
You had a tyrannical, militarily superior,

37:11.820 --> 37:15.580
pretty non-democratic entity come and say,

37:15.580 --> 37:17.380
you're gonna have partial sovereignty.

37:18.380 --> 37:23.100
And Americans for ideological reasons said, no way.

37:23.100 --> 37:25.460
And people like Bernard Bailen and other historians,

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
that's like the dominant story of the American Revolution.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.140
It wasn't the ideological origins,

37:29.140 --> 37:30.540
this attachment, this idea of liberty.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.140
And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons,

37:33.140 --> 37:35.340
I think, why this happened.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.700
But I think for me, it starts with Ukrainians

37:38.700 --> 37:42.500
failing to make that sensible, quote unquote,

37:42.500 --> 37:46.060
rational deal that says we should relinquish

37:46.060 --> 37:47.700
some of our sovereignty because Russia

37:47.700 --> 37:49.140
is more powerful than we are.

37:50.860 --> 37:55.700
So there's a very clinical look at the war,

37:56.860 --> 38:01.860
meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin,

38:02.980 --> 38:07.980
that makes a claim on a land, builds up troops and invades.

38:10.980 --> 38:15.420
The way to avoid suffering there

38:15.460 --> 38:19.420
and the way to avoid death and the way to avoid war

38:19.420 --> 38:24.420
is to back down and basically let,

38:26.380 --> 38:28.300
there's a list of interests he provides

38:28.300 --> 38:30.140
and you go along with that.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.820
That's when the goal is to avoid war.

38:37.740 --> 38:40.400
Let's do some other calculus.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.180
Let's think about Britain.

38:43.180 --> 38:48.180
So France fought Hitler but did not fight very hard.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.300
Portugal, there's a lot of stories of countries like this.

38:52.300 --> 38:57.300
And there is Winston motherfucking Churchill.

38:57.740 --> 39:00.780
He's one of the rare humans in history

39:00.780 --> 39:03.940
who had that we shall fight on the beaches.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.900
It made no sense.

39:05.900 --> 39:08.740
Hitler did not say he's going to destroy Britain.

39:08.740 --> 39:10.820
He seemed to show respect for Britain.

39:10.820 --> 39:13.480
He wanted to keep the British Empire.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.540
It made total sense.

39:16.540 --> 39:18.620
It was obvious that Britain was going to lose

39:18.620 --> 39:20.220
if Hitler goes all in on Britain

39:20.220 --> 39:22.140
as it seemed like he was going to.

39:22.140 --> 39:26.140
And yet Winston Churchill said a big F you.

39:26.140 --> 39:27.260
Yeah.

39:27.260 --> 39:31.180
Similar thing, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people

39:31.180 --> 39:33.700
said F you in that same kind of way.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.060
So I think we're saying the same things.

39:36.060 --> 39:38.660
I'm being more clinical about it.

39:38.660 --> 39:43.000
Well, I'm trying to understand and we won't know this,

39:43.940 --> 39:48.740
but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?

39:49.860 --> 39:51.700
Well, on the eve of the war,

39:51.700 --> 39:55.740
Ukraine was poor in a per person terms than it was in 1990.

39:55.740 --> 39:58.360
The economy is just completely stagnated.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.980
In Russia, meanwhile, like many other parts of the region,

40:00.980 --> 40:03.280
it sort of has boomed to a degree.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.740
I mean, certainly because of oil and gas,

40:04.740 --> 40:07.500
but also for a variety of other reasons

40:07.740 --> 40:09.900
Putin's consolidated political control.

40:09.900 --> 40:14.700
And from a very cold blooded and calculated point of view,

40:14.700 --> 40:18.140
I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this is this.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.500
Look, we were temporarily weak

40:19.500 --> 40:22.580
after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

40:22.580 --> 40:25.780
And the rest in the West basically took advantage of that.

40:25.780 --> 40:27.620
Like Bravo, you pulled it off.

40:27.620 --> 40:30.140
You basically crept democracy and capitalism,

40:30.140 --> 40:32.580
all these things right up to our border.

40:32.580 --> 40:35.460
And now we have regained some of our strength.

40:35.460 --> 40:37.260
We've consolidated political control.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.740
We've cowed our people.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.900
We have a stronger economy.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.460
And we somehow got Germany and other European nations

40:44.460 --> 40:46.980
to give up energy independence and actually just,

40:46.980 --> 40:49.100
we've got an enormous amount of leverage over you.

40:49.100 --> 40:52.620
And now we wanna roll back some of your success

40:52.620 --> 40:55.820
because we were powerful enough to demand it.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.420
And you've been taking advantage of the situation,

40:59.420 --> 41:04.140
which is maybe a fair impartial analysis.

41:04.140 --> 41:08.300
And in the West, but more specifically Ukraine said,

41:08.300 --> 41:11.740
but that's a price too high, which I totally respect.

41:11.740 --> 41:15.340
Maybe I'd like to think I'd make that same decision,

41:15.340 --> 41:17.620
but that's the answer.

41:17.620 --> 41:20.180
If the answer is why would they fight if it's so costly?

41:20.180 --> 41:21.420
Why not find a deal?

41:21.420 --> 41:24.300
It's because they weren't willing to give Russia

41:24.300 --> 41:28.300
the thing that their power said they quote unquote deserve.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.460
Just like Americans said to the Britain,

41:30.460 --> 41:34.220
yeah, of course we ought to accept semi-sovereignty,

41:35.980 --> 41:40.980
but we refuse and we'd rather endure a bloody fight

41:42.100 --> 41:45.140
that we might lose than take this.

41:45.140 --> 41:49.100
And so you need some of these other five buckets.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.900
You need them to understand the situation.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.100
You need to sort of, there are other things going on,

41:54.100 --> 41:59.100
but I do think it's fundamental that this noble intransigence

42:00.060 --> 42:03.700
is a big part of it.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.340
Well, let me just say a few things if it's okay.

42:06.340 --> 42:11.340
So your analysis is clear and objective.

42:12.860 --> 42:16.940
My analysis is neither clear nor objective.

42:18.700 --> 42:22.620
First, I've been going through a lot.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.740
I'm a different man over the past four or five weeks

42:25.740 --> 42:26.860
than I was before.

42:27.780 --> 42:30.780
I, in general, have come to,

42:33.380 --> 42:37.180
there's anger, I've come to despise leaders in general

42:38.980 --> 42:40.580
because leaders wage war

42:40.580 --> 42:42.660
and the people pay the price for that war.

42:44.100 --> 42:48.540
Let me just say on this point of standing up to an invader

42:49.580 --> 42:52.820
that I am half Ukrainian, half Russian,

42:52.820 --> 42:55.340
that I'm proud of the Ukrainian people.

42:56.340 --> 43:00.340
Whatever the sacrifice is, whatever the scale of pain,

43:00.340 --> 43:03.700
standing up, there's something in me that's proud.

43:03.700 --> 43:08.700
Maybe that's, maybe that's whatever the fuck that is.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.700
Maybe that blood runs in me.

43:12.340 --> 43:15.660
I love the Ukrainian people, love the Russian people.

43:15.660 --> 43:18.780
And whatever that fight is, whatever that suffering is,

43:18.780 --> 43:22.140
the millions of refugees, whatever this war is,

43:22.140 --> 43:26.180
the dictators come to power and their power falls.

43:28.140 --> 43:31.740
I just love that that spirit burns bright still.

43:31.740 --> 43:34.180
And I do, maybe I'm wrong in this,

43:34.180 --> 43:37.860
do see Ukrainian and Russian people as one people

43:37.860 --> 43:41.380
in a way that's not just cultural, geopolitical,

43:41.380 --> 43:43.260
but just given the history.

43:43.260 --> 43:46.820
I think about the same kind of fighting

43:46.820 --> 43:50.180
when Hitler, with all of his forces,

43:50.220 --> 43:53.860
chose to invade the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa.

43:54.940 --> 43:58.580
When he went and that Russian winter,

43:58.580 --> 44:02.260
and a lot of people, and that pisses me off

44:02.260 --> 44:05.140
because if you know your history,

44:05.140 --> 44:08.140
it's not the winter that stopped Hitler,

44:08.140 --> 44:10.580
it's the Red Army, it's the people

44:10.580 --> 44:14.860
that refused to back down, they fought proudly.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.140
That pride, that's something.

44:18.140 --> 44:20.180
That's the human spirit.

44:20.180 --> 44:23.620
That's in war, you know, war is hell,

44:23.620 --> 44:28.420
but it really pushes people to stand

44:28.420 --> 44:30.260
for the things they believe in.

44:30.260 --> 44:33.300
It's the William Wallace speech from Braveheart.

44:33.300 --> 44:35.020
I think about this a lot.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.020
That does not fit into your framework.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.540
No, no, no, I'm gonna disagree.

44:38.540 --> 44:41.660
I think it totally fits in and it's this,

44:41.660 --> 44:45.140
there's nothing irrational about what we believe,

44:45.140 --> 44:50.140
especially those principles which we hold the most dear.

44:50.380 --> 44:53.500
I'm merely trying to say that there's a calculus,

44:53.500 --> 44:56.700
there's one calculus over here that says,

44:56.700 --> 45:00.020
Russia's more powerful than it was 20 years ago

45:00.020 --> 45:02.940
and even 10 years ago, and Ukraine is not,

45:02.940 --> 45:05.220
and it's asking for something,

45:05.220 --> 45:08.020
and there's an incentive to give that up.

45:08.020 --> 45:10.660
That's obvious, like there's an incentive to comply.

45:10.660 --> 45:14.700
But my understanding is many of these post-Soviet republics

45:14.740 --> 45:17.700
have appeased, right, which is what we call compromise

45:17.700 --> 45:19.140
when we disagree with it.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.860
They've, all of these other peoples

45:21.860 --> 45:25.740
in the Russian sphere of influence have not stood up.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.820
And Russians, many Russians have tried to stand up

45:29.820 --> 45:31.740
and they've been beaten down.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.380
And now people have, we'll see,

45:35.380 --> 45:38.060
but people have not been standing up very much.

45:38.060 --> 45:40.540
And so lots of people are cowed

45:40.540 --> 45:41.860
and lots of people have appeased

45:41.860 --> 45:43.980
and lots of people hear that speech

45:43.980 --> 45:47.300
and think I would like to do that, but don't.

45:47.300 --> 45:50.980
And so, and my point is that, sadly,

45:50.980 --> 45:52.980
we live in a world where a lot of people

45:54.100 --> 45:58.300
get stepped on by tyrants and empire and whatnot

45:58.300 --> 45:59.300
and don't rise up.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.660
And so I think we could admire,

46:01.660 --> 46:04.820
especially when they stand up for these reasons.

46:04.820 --> 46:06.740
And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason.

46:06.740 --> 46:09.220
I think we could, that's why we admire the leaders

46:09.220 --> 46:11.060
of the American Revolution and so on.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.180
But it doesn't always happen.

46:12.180 --> 46:13.900
And I don't actually know why,

46:14.820 --> 46:15.660
but I don't think it's irrational.

46:15.660 --> 46:16.860
I think it's just, it's something,

46:16.860 --> 46:20.100
it's about a set of values and it's hard to predict.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
And it was hard for,

46:23.100 --> 46:24.980
Putin might not have been out of line

46:24.980 --> 46:27.380
and thinking just like everybody else

46:27.380 --> 46:30.140
in my sphere of influence, they're gonna roll over too.

46:31.380 --> 46:34.700
And I should mention, because we haven't,

46:34.700 --> 46:37.540
that a lot of this calculation,

46:37.540 --> 46:39.580
from an objective point of view,

46:39.580 --> 46:42.980
you have to include the United States and NATO

46:42.980 --> 46:45.340
into the pressure they apply into the region.

46:46.380 --> 46:50.500
That said, I care little about leaders

46:50.500 --> 46:54.060
that do cruel things onto the world.

46:54.060 --> 46:55.580
They lead to a lot of suffering,

46:55.580 --> 46:57.820
but I still believe that the Russian people

46:57.820 --> 47:00.700
and the Ukrainian people are great people that stand up

47:00.700 --> 47:03.140
and I admire people that stand up

47:03.140 --> 47:05.380
and are willing to give their life.

47:05.380 --> 47:10.380
And I think Russian people are very much that too,

47:11.380 --> 47:15.340
especially when the enemy is coming

47:15.340 --> 47:17.500
for your home over the hill.

47:17.500 --> 47:21.260
Sometimes standing up to an authoritarian regime

47:21.260 --> 47:23.980
is difficult because you don't know,

47:25.260 --> 47:30.260
it's not a monster that's attacking your home directly.

47:30.580 --> 47:32.980
It's kind of like the boiling of a lobster

47:32.980 --> 47:34.340
or something like that.

47:34.340 --> 47:39.060
It's a slow control of your mind and the population.

47:39.220 --> 47:42.180
And our minds get controlled even in the West

47:42.180 --> 47:44.500
by the media, by the narratives.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.140
It's very difficult to wake up one day

47:47.140 --> 47:52.140
and to realize sort of what people call red-pilled,

47:53.140 --> 47:55.220
is to see that they're,

47:55.220 --> 47:57.780
maybe the thing I've been told all my life is not true

47:57.780 --> 47:58.940
and at every level.

47:58.940 --> 48:01.580
That's a thing very difficult to do in North Korea.

48:02.620 --> 48:04.020
The more authoritarian the regime,

48:04.020 --> 48:06.420
the more difficult it is to see.

48:06.460 --> 48:09.460
Maybe this idea that I believe

48:09.460 --> 48:11.580
that I was willing to die for is actually evil.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.260
It's very difficult to do for Americans,

48:14.260 --> 48:17.020
for Russians, for Ukrainians, for Chinese,

48:17.020 --> 48:20.540
for Indians, for Pakistanis, for everybody.

48:20.540 --> 48:23.300
I think thinking about this Ukrainian,

48:23.300 --> 48:25.220
whether you wanna call it nobility or intransigence

48:25.220 --> 48:27.460
or whatever is key.

48:27.460 --> 48:32.300
I think the authoritarianness of Russia

48:32.300 --> 48:34.540
and Putin's control or the control of his cabal

48:34.540 --> 48:37.340
is the other thing I would really point to

48:37.340 --> 48:38.460
is what's going on here.

48:38.460 --> 48:41.260
And if you ask me like big picture,

48:41.260 --> 48:42.740
what do I think is the fundamental cause

48:42.740 --> 48:43.900
of most violence in the world?

48:43.900 --> 48:46.060
I think it's unaccountable power.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.940
In fact, for me, an unaccountable power

48:47.940 --> 48:49.340
is the source of underdevelopment.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.860
It's the source of pain and suffering.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.980
It's the source of warfare.

48:53.980 --> 48:57.220
It's basically the root source of most of our problems.

48:57.220 --> 48:59.660
And in this particular case,

48:59.660 --> 49:03.100
it's also one of our buckets in the sense that like why,

49:03.100 --> 49:07.540
what is it that why did Russia ask these things?

49:07.540 --> 49:12.540
Well, was democracy in Ukraine a threat to an average Russian?

49:13.700 --> 49:17.900
No, was capitalism, is NATO, is whatever,

49:17.900 --> 49:19.660
is this a threat to average Russians?

49:19.660 --> 49:24.660
No, it's a threat to the apparatus of political control

49:25.060 --> 49:27.620
and economic control that Putin and cronies

49:27.620 --> 49:30.300
and this sort of group of people that rule,

49:30.300 --> 49:34.660
this elite in Russia, it was a threat to them.

49:34.660 --> 49:38.340
And so they had to ask the Ukraine to be neutral

49:38.340 --> 49:41.580
or to give up NATO or to have a puppet government

49:41.580 --> 49:43.820
or whatever they were seeking to achieve

49:43.820 --> 49:45.740
and have been trying to achieve through other means

49:45.740 --> 49:47.300
for decades, right?

49:47.300 --> 49:49.660
They've been trying to undermine these things

49:49.660 --> 49:52.660
without invasion.

49:52.660 --> 49:53.940
And they've been doing that

49:53.940 --> 49:55.540
because it threatens their interests.

49:55.540 --> 49:57.300
And that's like one of these other logics of war.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.260
It's not just that there's something that I value so much

49:59.260 --> 50:00.580
and I'm willing to injure the cost.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.820
It's that there are people,

50:02.820 --> 50:06.060
not only does this oligarchy or whatever elite group

50:06.060 --> 50:08.820
that you wanna talk about in Russia not,

50:08.820 --> 50:10.060
first of all, they're not bearing,

50:10.060 --> 50:11.460
they're bearing some costs of war, right?

50:11.460 --> 50:13.220
They're very, and they're certainly bearing costs

50:13.220 --> 50:16.740
of sanctions, but they are,

50:16.740 --> 50:18.580
they don't bear all the costs of war, obviously.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.300
And so they're more, they're quick to use it.

50:20.300 --> 50:24.020
But more importantly, like in some sense,

50:24.020 --> 50:25.620
I think there's a strong argument

50:25.620 --> 50:28.380
that they had a political incentive to invade

50:28.620 --> 50:30.380
or at least to ask Ukraine

50:30.380 --> 50:32.500
this sort of impossible to give up thing

50:32.500 --> 50:37.500
and then invade despite Ukrainian nobility and transigence

50:38.220 --> 50:39.740
because they were threatened.

50:41.140 --> 50:45.100
And so that's extremely important, I think.

50:45.100 --> 50:48.940
And so that's, those two things in concert

50:48.940 --> 50:50.780
make this a very fragile situation.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.420
That's I think why we ended up,

50:53.580 --> 50:57.020
is go not all the way, but a long way to understanding.

50:57.060 --> 51:00.380
Now you could layer onto that these intangible incentives,

51:00.380 --> 51:01.820
these other things that are valued,

51:01.820 --> 51:03.300
that are valued on Putin's side.

51:03.300 --> 51:04.860
Maybe there's a nationalist ideal.

51:04.860 --> 51:08.220
Maybe he seeks status and glory.

51:08.220 --> 51:09.340
Like maybe those things are all true,

51:09.340 --> 51:11.900
and I'm sure they're true to an extent.

51:11.900 --> 51:14.580
And that'll weigh against his costs of war as well.

51:14.580 --> 51:17.540
But fundamentally, I think he just saw his regime

51:17.540 --> 51:20.180
as threatened, that's what he cares about.

51:20.180 --> 51:25.180
And so he asked, he made this cruelest of demands.

51:25.580 --> 51:28.660
I mean, I would say I'm just one human, who the hell am I?

51:28.660 --> 51:33.660
But I just have a lot of anger towards the elites in general,

51:34.540 --> 51:38.860
towards leaders in general that fail the people.

51:38.860 --> 51:43.860
I would love to hear and to celebrate

51:44.100 --> 51:47.820
the beautiful Russian people, the Ukrainian people,

51:47.820 --> 51:52.460
and anyone who silences that beautiful voice of the people

51:52.460 --> 51:55.980
anywhere in the world is destroying the thing

51:55.980 --> 51:59.060
that I value most about humanity.

51:59.060 --> 52:00.100
Leaders don't matter.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.500
They're supposed to serve the people.

52:02.500 --> 52:07.100
This nationalist idea of a people, of a country,

52:07.100 --> 52:10.300
is only makes any sense when you celebrate,

52:10.300 --> 52:15.300
when you give people the freedom to show themselves,

52:16.620 --> 52:17.980
to celebrate themselves.

52:17.980 --> 52:21.780
And the thing I care most about is science.

52:21.780 --> 52:26.780
And the silencing of voices in the scientific community,

52:26.940 --> 52:28.860
the silencing of voices, period.

52:31.020 --> 52:34.900
Fuck any leader that silences that human spirit.

52:37.780 --> 52:39.220
There's something about this.

52:39.220 --> 52:42.180
It's like, whenever I look at World War II,

52:42.180 --> 52:45.940
whenever I look at wars, it does seem very irrational

52:45.940 --> 52:50.940
to fight, but man, does it seem somehow deeply human?

52:52.660 --> 52:54.940
When the people stand up and fight.

52:54.940 --> 52:59.940
There's something that, you know, we talked about progress.

53:00.780 --> 53:03.900
That feels like how progress is made.

53:03.900 --> 53:05.580
The people that stand and fight.

53:05.580 --> 53:07.420
But let me read the Churchill speech.

53:08.580 --> 53:13.580
It's such, I'm so proud that we humans can stand up to evil

53:13.820 --> 53:14.900
when the time is right.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.660
I guess here's the thing, though.

53:16.660 --> 53:18.500
Think of what's happening in Xinjiang and China.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.540
We have appeased China.

53:21.540 --> 53:25.980
We've basically said, you can just do really, really,

53:25.980 --> 53:27.940
really horrible things in this region,

53:27.940 --> 53:30.500
and you're too powerful for us to do anything about it,

53:30.500 --> 53:32.060
and it's not worth it.

53:32.060 --> 53:35.820
And there's nobody standing up and making a Churchill speech

53:35.820 --> 53:38.220
or the Braveheart speech about standing up

53:38.220 --> 53:41.500
for people of Xinjiang when what's happening is,

53:43.100 --> 53:47.540
you know, in that realm of what was happening in Europe.

53:47.540 --> 53:50.700
And that's happening in a lot of places.

53:50.700 --> 53:53.700
And then when there is a willingness to stand up,

53:55.580 --> 53:58.060
people, there's a lot of opposition to those.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.100
You know, so there were a lot of reasons

54:00.100 --> 54:01.300
for the invasion of Iraq.

54:02.700 --> 54:04.260
For some, it was humanitarian.

54:04.260 --> 54:08.500
Like Saddam Hussein was one of the worst tyrants

54:08.500 --> 54:10.620
of the 20th century.

54:10.620 --> 54:14.260
He was just doing some really horrible things.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.900
You know, he'd invaded Kuwait.

54:15.900 --> 54:20.260
He'd committed domestic, attempted domestic genocide

54:20.340 --> 54:21.860
and all sorts of repression.

54:21.860 --> 54:24.980
And it was probably a mistake to invade in spite.

54:24.980 --> 54:27.340
So it's important not just to select on the cases

54:27.340 --> 54:29.620
where we stood up and to select on the cases

54:29.620 --> 54:34.340
where that ended up working out in the sense of victory.

54:35.380 --> 54:38.460
Right, it's important to sort of try to judge,

54:38.460 --> 54:40.660
not judge, but just try to understand these things

54:40.660 --> 54:45.140
in the context of all the times we didn't give that speech

54:45.140 --> 54:48.020
or when we did, and then it just went sideways.

54:48.060 --> 54:50.540
Well, that's why it's powerful

54:50.540 --> 54:52.860
when you're willing to give your life for your principles

54:52.860 --> 54:54.580
because most of the time,

54:54.580 --> 54:58.380
you get neither the principles nor the life.

54:58.380 --> 55:02.300
You die, but that's why it's powerful.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.580
We shall go on to the end.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.340
We shall fight in France.

55:06.340 --> 55:08.860
We shall fight on the seas and the oceans.

55:08.860 --> 55:10.780
We shall fight with growing confidence

55:10.780 --> 55:12.580
and growing strength in the air.

55:12.580 --> 55:16.140
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.020
We shall fight on the beaches.

55:18.020 --> 55:20.340
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

55:20.340 --> 55:23.500
We shall fight in the field and in the streets.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.300
We shall fight in the hills.

55:25.300 --> 55:27.220
We shall never surrender.

55:27.220 --> 55:32.220
This is before Hitler had any major loss to anybody.

55:33.060 --> 55:36.260
That was a terrifying armada coming your way.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.860
We shall never surrender.

55:37.860 --> 55:40.340
I just wanna give props.

55:40.340 --> 55:44.660
I wanna give my respect as a human being to Churchill,

55:44.660 --> 55:46.700
to the British people for standing up,

55:48.100 --> 55:51.100
to the Ukrainian people for standing up,

55:51.100 --> 55:53.940
and to the Russian people.

55:53.940 --> 55:57.700
These are great people that throughout history

55:57.700 --> 55:59.700
have stood up to evil.

56:00.980 --> 56:01.860
Let me ask you this,

56:01.860 --> 56:05.460
because you quote Sun Tzu in the Art of War.

56:05.460 --> 56:07.860
There's no instance of a country having benefited

56:07.860 --> 56:09.500
from prolonged warfare.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.820
This is the main thesis.

56:12.820 --> 56:14.860
Can we just linger on this?

56:14.860 --> 56:18.340
Since leaders wage war and people pay the price,

56:18.340 --> 56:21.860
when we say that there's no reason to do prolonged war,

56:22.700 --> 56:25.020
is it possible to have a reason for the leaders

56:25.020 --> 56:27.660
if they disregard the price?

56:27.660 --> 56:32.020
Sort of like if they have a different objective function

56:32.020 --> 56:34.020
or utility function that measures the price

56:34.020 --> 56:35.380
that's paid for war.

56:35.380 --> 56:39.500
Is that one explanation of why war happens?

56:39.500 --> 56:41.460
Is the leaders just have a different calculus

56:41.460 --> 56:42.980
than other humans?

56:42.980 --> 56:44.260
I mean, I think this links us back

56:44.260 --> 56:46.260
to what we were talking about earlier about just war,

56:46.260 --> 56:49.540
is in some sense just war is saying

56:49.540 --> 56:51.540
that in spite of the costs,

56:51.540 --> 56:54.700
that our enemy has done something,

56:54.700 --> 56:58.020
our opponent has refused to compromise

56:58.020 --> 57:00.540
on something that we find essential

57:00.540 --> 57:03.300
and is demanding that we compromise

57:03.300 --> 57:05.380
in a way that's completely repugnant.

57:06.540 --> 57:09.220
And therefore we're going to go to war

57:09.300 --> 57:13.380
despite these material costs and these human costs.

57:13.380 --> 57:17.780
So that, and then that principle that you go to war on

57:17.780 --> 57:18.860
is in the eye of the beholder.

57:18.860 --> 57:22.020
And I mean, I think liberty and sovereignty,

57:22.020 --> 57:23.780
I think we can understand and sympathize with,

57:23.780 --> 57:25.500
and maybe that's just a universal,

57:25.500 --> 57:27.540
maybe that's the greatest cause of just war,

57:27.540 --> 57:28.980
but other people make that,

57:30.220 --> 57:32.140
could go to war for something considerably less,

57:32.140 --> 57:34.620
a principle that's considerably less noble, right?

57:34.620 --> 57:36.180
Which is what Hitler was doing.

57:37.180 --> 57:39.380
That's an explanation.

57:39.380 --> 57:41.740
So that's a whole class of explanations

57:41.740 --> 57:43.980
that helps us understand that the compromise

57:43.980 --> 57:46.300
that was on the table, given the relative balance of power,

57:46.300 --> 57:48.500
was just repugnant at least to one side,

57:48.500 --> 57:49.340
if not the other.

57:49.340 --> 57:51.140
There's something they're unwilling to part with.

57:51.140 --> 57:53.220
And then you get to the leaders.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.300
Well, what happens when what the leaders want,

57:57.460 --> 57:58.980
what happens when the leaders are detached

57:58.980 --> 58:00.220
from the interests of their groups,

58:00.220 --> 58:02.300
which has been true for basically most of human history.

58:02.300 --> 58:04.620
There's a narrow slice of societies

58:04.620 --> 58:06.540
in the big scheme of things

58:06.540 --> 58:07.940
that have been accountable to their people,

58:07.940 --> 58:09.380
a lot of them exist today,

58:11.700 --> 58:13.180
where to some degree they're channeling

58:13.180 --> 58:15.500
the interests of their group, right?

58:15.500 --> 58:18.860
So the Ukrainian politicians didn't concede

58:18.860 --> 58:21.020
to these cruel Russian demands,

58:21.020 --> 58:22.100
because even if they had,

58:22.100 --> 58:23.380
it would have been political suicide,

58:23.380 --> 58:25.260
because it seemed, or I think,

58:25.260 --> 58:28.180
it seems that the Ukrainians would have just rejected this.

58:28.180 --> 58:30.340
So they were in some sense channeling

58:30.340 --> 58:33.140
the values of the broader population.

58:33.180 --> 58:35.500
Even if they, I don't know what was going on,

58:35.500 --> 58:38.260
and if they didn't share those principles,

58:38.260 --> 58:40.900
they self-interestedly followed them.

58:40.900 --> 58:41.860
Probably they shared them,

58:41.860 --> 58:44.100
but I'm just saying that even if they didn't,

58:44.100 --> 58:45.300
they wouldn't compromise.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.740
Occasionally you get the reverse,

58:47.740 --> 58:50.300
which is where the leaders are not accountable.

58:51.380 --> 58:54.180
And now they have some value, which could be glory.

58:55.220 --> 58:56.660
I mean, this is the story of the kings,

58:56.660 --> 58:59.220
and to some lesser extent, the queens of Europe,

58:59.220 --> 59:02.220
for hundreds of years, was it was basically a contest,

59:02.980 --> 59:04.180
war was the sport of kings.

59:04.180 --> 59:06.500
And to some extent, they were just seeking status

59:06.500 --> 59:08.620
through violent competition,

59:08.620 --> 59:11.700
and they paid a lot, a big price, out of the royal purse,

59:13.700 --> 59:15.860
but they didn't bear most of the suffering.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.780
And so they were too quick to go to war.

59:19.780 --> 59:24.780
And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders

59:26.460 --> 59:30.460
combined with, you mingle it with that one bucket,

59:30.500 --> 59:33.780
that uncheckedness, and you mingle that with the fact

59:33.780 --> 59:36.140
that leaders might have one of these values,

59:36.140 --> 59:39.220
noble or otherwise, that carry them to war,

59:39.220 --> 59:43.580
combined to explain a good number of conflicts as well.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.460
And that's a good illustration of why I think

59:46.460 --> 59:50.420
autocracy and unaccountable power is,

59:51.420 --> 59:53.420
I could make that story for all of the things,

59:53.420 --> 59:56.020
all five buckets, we're all more susceptible

59:56.020 --> 59:58.140
to these things, to all five of these things,

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.740
when leaders are not accountable

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.740
to the people and their group.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.940
And that's what makes it like the meta,

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.340
for me, the meta cause of conflict

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.220
in all of human history, and sadly today.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.740
Does the will to power play into this,

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.300
the desire for power?

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.580
Like that's a human thing, again, in the calculation,

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.780
that, shall we put that in the misperceptions bucket?

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.820
Or is it, is misperceptions essentially

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.660
about interaction between humans and power

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.300
is more about the thing you feel in your heart

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.900
when you're alone as a leader?

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.500
You know, I said there were three strategic reasons,

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.620
like the unchecked leaders,

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.220
the commitment problems, uncertainty.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.340
There were two sort of more psychological,

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.460
and I called them intangible incentives and misperceptions.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.740
The way that like a game theorist,

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.820
or the way that a behavioral economist would think

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.940
about those two is just to say preferences,

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.140
and then erroneous beliefs and mistakes.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.300
It's like, so our preferences are our preferences, right?

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.020
And so utility functions, whatever we wanna call it,

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.740
like there's not, that's why I wouldn't call them

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.740
a misperception or a rationality, we like what we like.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.860
If we like power, if we like relative status,

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:17.860
if we like our racial purity, if we like our liberty,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.260
if we like whatever it is

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.020
that we have convinced ourselves we value.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.580
Maybe you fell in love with a rival queen or king.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.180
Exactly, when I said it was a big bucket full of stuff

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.460
that rhymes, like that's a pretty messy bucket.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.140
Like there's a lot of different stuff in there.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.540
And I'm just trying to say like, let's be clear

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.020
that just about the shared logic of these things

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.900
is maybe just, you know, they're really dissimilar,

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.180
but let's be clear about the shared logic.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.900
And if it were true that deep down we were aggressive people

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.540
who just liked violence and enjoyed the blood,

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.660
or some percentage of us do,

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.860
that would be there too.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.180
And so I just wanna say that's,

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.500
but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.580
When we diagnose a war as an armchair analyst

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.660
or as a journalist or something, we really jump to those.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.180
We don't need a lot of help to like see those happening.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.140
So we probably put a little bit too much emphasis on them

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.420
is maybe the only thing that I would caution

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.100
because the others are more subtle

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.940
and they're often there and they contribute.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.660
So just to linger on something you said before,

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.460
would it be accurate to say when the leaders

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:35.460
become detached from the opinion of the people

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.180
that's more likely to lead to war?

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.340
And mechanically, it's just they're gonna bear fewer costs.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.420
So it's gonna basically narrow the set of deals

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.340
that they're gonna be willing to accept instead of violence.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.940
At the same time, most of the time, it's not enough

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.420
because the leaders still bear a lot of costs of war.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.060
You could be deposed, you could be killed,

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.780
you could be tried, and the public purse

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.860
is going to be empty.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.620
That's like the one story throughout history

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.700
is at the end of the day, your regime is broke

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.740
as a result of war.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.380
And so you still internalize that a little bit.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.540
If I had to say like, you know, in my three buckets

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.620
or through my buckets so far,

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.940
I've sort of started with like Ukrainian and transients.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.820
And then I jumped, and then I said the essential,

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.380
then you really have to understand Russian autocracy

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.380
just to understand why they would ask something so cruel.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.460
But I mean, I think the uncertainty

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.180
is really important here as well.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.860
Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things,

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.260
the way this has played out and just in some ways,

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.860
how many, in how many ways we've been surprised.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.040
We've been surprised by the unity and the coherence

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.660
of the West and the sanctions.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.780
What's happened is it was in the realm of possibility,

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.780
but it was sort of like the best case scenario

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.820
from the perspective of the West

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.140
and the worst case scenario for the Russians.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.140
The second thing is just the pluckiness

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.620
and the effectiveness and the intransigence

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.940
and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.940
That's again, was within the realm of possibility,

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.060
but wasn't necessarily the likely thing, right?

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.500
It was again, maybe the worst realization for Russia,

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.220
the best realization in some sense

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.860
or in terms of revealed strength and resolve.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.300
And then the other thing that's been revealed

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:24.180
is just how like the corruption and ineptitude

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.740
and problems on the Russian military side.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.940
Again, within the realm of possibility,

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.740
maybe people who really knew the Russian military

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.580
are less surprised than the rest of us,

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.540
but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:41.420
And so Putin asking this terrible price

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.100
and expecting Ukraine to roll over

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.300
or the West to roll over at least to a degree

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.820
was based on like a different set of probability.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.020
It was based on just expecting something

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.780
in the middle of the probability distribution

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.260
and not all these different tale events.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.900
And so the fact that the world's so uncertain

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.100
and the fact that Putin can come

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.180
with a different set of expectations

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.740
than the Ukrainians and the West

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.020
and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.700
on just what the facts are

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.980
because we live in an uncertain world.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.740
Everyone's quick to say, oh, we miscalculated.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.060
Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.060
I think he just, he got a really bad draw

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.300
in terms of what the realized outcomes are here.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:27.260
And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense,

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.620
except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.460
is the tragedy.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.660
So there's also economic pain,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180
not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people,

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.260
but the whole world.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.260
So, you know, you could talk about things

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.060
that we are surprised from an analysis perspective

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.780
of small victories here or there,

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.700
but I think it's universally true

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.620
that everybody loses once again in this war.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.740
Right, and so the question is just like,

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.140
when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.820
when Ukraine didn't give this up?

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.780
Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.420
what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved,

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.580
quote unquote, based on its power in the world,

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.700
it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.900
And the uncertainty around that made it potentially

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.020
more likely that he would choose to do this.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.380
But in particular, one of the other things

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.140
that I think is probably less important in this context,

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:30.620
but still plays a role, but less important than many wars,

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.180
is the fact that it's really hard

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.460
to resolve that uncertainty, right?

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.100
In theory, Ukraine should be able to say,

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.660
look, this is exactly how resolved we are,

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.660
we're super resolved,

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.860
and your military is not as strong as you think it is.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.940
You mean before the conference even begins?

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.980
Before the conference, everybody should be like,

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.220
you know what, here's my cards, here's your cards.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.140
Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this,

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.020
you can use that uncertainty to your advantage.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.340
I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.220
And so anyone who's ever played poker

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.980
and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficiency,

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.780
that's like, that's the analogy in some ways to war,

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.180
that's not the perfect analogy,

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.500
but the uncertainty in the circumstance,

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.500
you don't have to miscalculate,

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.340
the fact that you, if you bluff and lose,

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.220
it wasn't that you miscalculated,

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.860
you made an optimal choice,

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.220
given the uncertainty of the situation, to take a gamble.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.540
And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff,

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.500
and just to fold or to just not pay in that round.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.700
And so the uncertainty of the situation

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.460
gives both sides incentives to bluff,

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.220
gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth,

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.940
and then at some point, the other side says,

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.460
you know what, you say you're resolved,

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.460
you say you're gonna mount an uncertainty,

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.300
well guess what?

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:48.660
Every other people on my border has folded,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.060
and you're gonna fold too, the minute the tanks roll in,

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.500
and the minute the Air Force comes in,

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.220
I'm gambling that you're bluffing.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:01.140
And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.740
just causes a lot of short wars, actually,

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:11.420
because it's the sort of bluff and call dynamic that goes on.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.220
And the thing that's worth recognizing

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.220
is we might end up at a place in a few months

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:21.260
where the thing that Ukraine concedes

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.380
is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:29.780
Russia's on it, I want a neutral, I mean, who knows how,

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.420
it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted,

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.540
but if we end up in a place

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.540
where Ukraine is effectively neutral, never joins NATO,

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.820
is not being militarily supplied by the West,

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:48.700
and where Russia has de facto control over the East

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.980
and Crimea, if not fully recognized,

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.140
who knows if they'll get ever internationally

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.540
and Ukrainian recognized, but effectively controls,

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.860
Russia will have accomplished

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.660
what it asked for in the first place,

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.580
and both parties had to get there through violence

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.380
rather than through negotiation.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.660
And you wouldn't need misperceptions and mistakes,

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:17.660
and you wouldn't need Putin's delusions of glory

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.980
or whatever to get there,

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.820
you would just need the ingredients I've given so far,

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:25.500
which is like an unwillingness to do that without fighting

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.100
on the part of the Ukrainians,

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.300
an autocratic leadership in Russia

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.020
who would make those demands

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.420
because it's in their self-interest,

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.260
and then uncertainty leading them to fight.

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.540
And that sadly is like the best case,

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.020
that feels like the best case scenario right now,

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.980
which is the war's just five months and not five years.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.980
Given the current situation.

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.180
Given the current situation.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.580
Because the suffering has already happened,

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.500
in lost homes, people moving,

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.900
having to see their home in rubble,

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:13.780
and millions of people, refugees having to escape the country,

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.820
and hate flourishes versus the common humanity

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.780
as it does with war.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.100
And on top of all of that,

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.580
if we talk from a geopolitical perspective,

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.580
the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.140
They now got narratives,

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.260
and they got whatever narratives,

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.460
you can go shopping for the narratives.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.380
The United States has its narratives

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.580
for whatever geopolitical thing it wants to do

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:48.900
in that part of the world.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.500
That's another little malevolent interaction

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.620
between two of these buckets,

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.780
like those unchecked leaders,

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.540
and those intangible incentives, those preferences,

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.180
is that unchecked leaders spend,

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.940
autocrats, whatever, spend enormous amounts of time

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.860
trying to manipulate the values and beliefs

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.180
of their population, of their group.

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.420
Now, sometimes they do it nobly,

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.060
but that's what Winston Churchill there was trying to,

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.580
it's not clear that Britons were ready to stand up.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.980
There were a lot of Americans and a lot of Britons

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.900
who were like, you know what?

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.460
Hitler, not such a bad guy.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.900
His ideas, not so terrible.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.460
I never liked those Jews anyways.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.060
Many were thinking.

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.500
We had political leaders in the US

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.300
who were basically not pro-Nazi,

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.740
but were just not anti-Nazi.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.820
And Churchill was just trying to instill a different resolve.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.740
He was trying to create that thing.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.180
He was trying to create that value.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.180
And in the American Revolution, it was as well.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.940
The founding fathers, the leaders of the revolution,

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.180
it's not that everybody just woke up one morning

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.180
in the United States and had this ideology

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.260
of liberty and freedom.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.100
Some of that was true.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.920
It was out there in the ether,

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.980
but they had to manufacture and create it

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:02.220
in a way that I think they believed and was noble,

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.940
but there's a lot of manufacturing and creation

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.700
of these values and principles that is not noble,

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.100
and that is exactly what Hitler did so well.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.140
Yeah.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.340
The anti-Semitism was present throughout the world,

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.060
but the more subtle thing that I feel like

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.780
may be more generally applicable

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.060
is this kind of pacifism

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.380
that I think people in the United States felt like.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.380
It's not my conflict.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.380
Why do I need to get involved with it?

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:38.380
And I think Churchill was fighting that, the general.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.700
Apathy.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:45.700
It's like, it's the apathy of rational calculus.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:51.100
Like, what are we going to gain if we fight back?

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.820
Like, Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.940
He's saying he's not going, he's going to stop the bombing.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.980
You're still going to maintain your sovereignty

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.480
as the great people of Britain.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.820
Like, why are we fighting again?

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.940
And that's the thing that's hard to break

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.660
because you have to say, well,

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.540
you have to speak to principle.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.940
You have to speak at some greater sort of

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.620
long-term vision of history.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.020
So like, yes, now it may seem like

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.140
it's a way to avoid the fight,

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.540
but you're actually just sort of putting shackles on yourself.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.980
You're destroying the very greatness of our people

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.420
if we don't fight back.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.380
And to think about this with like the current case

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:41.660
with Russia, I mean, some people look at Putin's speeches

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.420
and papers he's written on Ukraine,

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.820
historically being a part of Russia,

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.360
and trying to deny the,

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.560
basically create all these nationalist narratives

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.380
and they think, well, Putin really believes,

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.300
and he might, Putin really believes this,

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.620
and that's why he's invading.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:00.340
And that might also be true and that would contribute

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:04.180
to just make a peaceful bargain even harder to find.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.180
But I suspect what's at least a minimum true

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.700
is Putin's trying to manufacture support for an invasion

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.740
in the population through propaganda.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:19.540
And so he's doing, on some level,

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.820
the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.420
in mechanical terms,

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:26.380
which is to try to manipulate people's references.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.500
But doing it in a sinister, malevolent, evil,

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.820
self-serving way, because it's really in his interest,

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.420
whereas this was anything but, right,

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.820
in the Churchill example.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.780
The dark human thing is like,

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.620
there's moments in World War II where Hitler's propaganda,

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.980
he began to believe his own propaganda.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:50.820
It's like-

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.940
I think he probably always believed,

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.040
I think he was a sincere believer.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.580
Well, no, no, no, but there's a lot of places

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.660
in where there was uncertainty

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.220
and they decided to do propaganda.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.220
And that propaganda resolved the uncertainty

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.220
in his own mind.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.580
So, for example, he believed until very late

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.500
that America is a weakling,

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.060
militarily as an economic power

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.940
and just the spirit of the people.

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.620
And that was part of the propaganda they're producing.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.140
And because of that propaganda,

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.580
when he became the head of the army,

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.580
he was making military actions.

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.900
He nonchalantly started war with America,

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.580
the United States of America,

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.220
where he didn't need to at all.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.740
He could have avoided that completely,

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.140
but he thought, eh, whatever, they're easy.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.500
So I think that propaganda first believes second.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.720
And I think as a human being, as a dictator,

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.220
when you start to believe the lies

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.300
with which you're controlling the populace,

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.740
you're not able to, you become detached

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.700
from this person that's able to resolve

01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.540
in a very human way the conflict in the world.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.500
I mean, when I said the meta,

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.780
the big common factor that causes war

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.780
over and over and over again is unaccountable power.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.620
It's not just because it's mechanically,

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.380
like one of my five explanations to saying,

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.220
well, if you're unaccountable,

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.220
you don't bear the cost of war,

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.860
you might have private incentives.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.880
So yes, bargains are harder to find,

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.180
but it leads to all these nasty interactions.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.740
So earlier I said there's this interaction

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.820
between the values and the unchecked leaders,

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.700
because those idiosyncratic values of your leader

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.940
become more important when they're unchecked.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.160
But the uncertainty point you just made

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.040
is like a deep point, it's to say actually

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.880
that the fundamental problem that all autocrats have

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.320
is an information problem,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.320
because nobody wants to give them the right information.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.780
And they have very few ways to aggregate information

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.440
if they're not popular, right?

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.320
And so there's a whole cottage industry

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.000
of political science sort of talking about

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.440
why autocrats love fixed elections

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.720
and why they love Twitter

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.680
and why they actually like it in a controlled way,

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.440
it solves an information problem.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.520
Like that's your crucial,

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.320
if you're like Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin,

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.960
you need to solve an information problem

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.880
just to avoid having rebellion on your hands

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.360
in your own country every day,

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.520
because uncertainty kind of gets magnified

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.300
and you get all this distorted information

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.660
in this apparatus of control.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.360
And so that's like another nasty interaction

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.760
between uncertainty and unchecked leaders

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.760
is you end up in this situation

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.440
where you're getting bad information.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.040
And it's not that you believe your own lies,

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.080
it's just that you never,

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.120
you sort of believe,

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.320
you're sort of averaging what you believe

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.800
over the available information

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.120
and you don't realize that it's such a distorted

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.600
and biased information source.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.120
And one of the other things about this time

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.860
that was a surprise to me in the fog of uncertainty,

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.920
how sort of seemingly likely nuclear war

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.640
became, not likely, but how it-

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.040
Less unlikely than before.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.640
Exactly, that's a better way to say it.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.520
It started to take a random stroll

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.400
away from 0% probability into this kind of land

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.760
of maybe like, it's hard to know,

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.440
but it's like, oh wow,

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.560
we're actually normally talking about this

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.240
as if this is part of the calculus, part of the options.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.200
But before we talk about nuclear war,

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.800
because I'm gonna need a drink,

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.720
do you need to go to the bathroom?

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.920
Sure, I'll take a break.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.560
So back to nuclear war.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.800
What do you think about this,

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.000
that people were nonchalantly speaking about nuclear wars

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.320
if it doesn't lead to the potential annihilation

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.000
of the human species?

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.600
What are the chances that our world descends

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.080
into nuclear war?

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.760
Within your framework, you wear many hats.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.760
One is sort of the analyst, right?

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.520
And then one is a human.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.760
What do you think are the chances

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.320
we get to see nuclear war in the century?

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.560
Well, you know, the doomsday,

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.040
the official doomsday clock for nuclear warfare

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.520
sits in the lobby of my building.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.000
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.640
sort of shares a building with us.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.320
So it's always there every day.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.080
Can you describe what the doomsday clock is?

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.600
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists,

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.960
it's something that this group of physicists

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.600
sort of marked just how close we are to nuclear catastrophe,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.440
and they started it decades ago, and it's a clock,

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.840
and it's sort of how close are we to midnight,

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.920
where midnight is nuclear Armageddon

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.800
or the destruction of humanity, and it's been sitting.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.840
I mean, it's actually, it hasn't moved as close to,

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.840
it hasn't moved as close to midnight in the last few weeks

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.120
as it probably should have,

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.280
only because it was already so close.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.240
There's actually limited room for it to move

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.360
for a bunch of other reasons.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.280
I think there's a whole political thing

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.320
that once it's really hard,

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.800
it's really easy to move it closer.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.360
And it's really hard if you're the person

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.440
in charge of that clock to move it away, right?

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.880
Because that's always very controversial.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.920
So it always sits there,

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.400
but it forces you to think about it a little bit every day.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.680
And I admit I was nonchalant about it until recently

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.780
in a way that many, many other people were.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.620
I still think the risk is very low,

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.860
but kind of for the reasons we've talked to,

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.580
it's just so unimaginably costly

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.420
that nobody wants to go that route.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.740
So it's like the extreme version of my whole argument

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.700
was why we most of the time don't fight

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.900
is because it's just so damn costly.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.020
And so this is, that's the incentive not to use this.

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.540
And if they do use it,

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:45.340
that's the incentive to use it in a very restrained way.

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.180
But that's not a lot of,

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.740
but because we know we do go to war

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.300
and there's all these things that interfere with it,

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:55.940
including miscalculation and all of these human foibles.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.380
And several of those nuclear powers

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.580
are not accountable leaders.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.660
I think we have to be a lot more worried

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.420
than many of us were very recently.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.500
I pointed out earlier,

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.020
like the whole reason we're in this mess

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.420
is because the only people who have this private interest

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.780
in like having Ukraine give up its freedom

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:16.500
is this Russian cabal and elite that gets there.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.500
Power and is preserved only

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.820
and is threatened by Ukrainian democracy.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:25.700
What would, how far would they go to hang on to power

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.020
when push came to shove is I think the thing

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.260
that worries me the most

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.500
and is plainly what worries most people

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.140
about the risk of nuclear war.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.740
Like at what point does that unchecked leadership

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.900
decide that this is worth it?

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.260
Especially if they can emerge

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.620
from the rubble still on top.

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.460
I don't know.

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:51.380
So, and I don't know that any of us

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.740
have really fully thought through all of that calculus

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.100
and what's going on.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.620
Very recently around the anniversary of January 6th,

01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.460
there were a lot of questions

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.860
about was the United States gonna have another civil war.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.060
On the one hand, I think it's almost unimaginable.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.780
Sort of like in the same way I think that a nuclear war

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.300
and a complete armageddon is unimaginable.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.700
But I remember something that

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.020
when both of those questions get asked,

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.780
I remember something I was in the audience

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.340
of listening to some great economists speak about

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.540
the 20 years ago, but the risk of an Argentina style

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.060
financial meltdown of the United States.

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.940
Like what's the total financial collapse?

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.140
And they said, you know what?

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.220
The risk is vanishingly small,

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.500
but that's terrifying because until recently

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.380
the answer was zero.

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.220
And so the fact that it's not zero

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.620
should deeply, deeply scare us all

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.780
and we should devote a lot of energy to making it zero again.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.980
And that's how I feel about the risk

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.020
of a civil war in the US.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.580
And that's how I feel about the risk of nuclear war.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.540
It's higher than it used to be

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.460
and that should terrify us all.

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.820
To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.740
seems to happen like overnight, like super quick

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.460
and it escalates super quick when it happens.

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.460
So it's not like, I don't know what I imagined

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:15.740
but it just happens like if a nuclear war happen,

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.620
it would be something like a plane,

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.820
like in this case with Ukraine, a NATO plane shut down

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.820
over some piece of land by the Russian forces

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.100
or so the narrative would go,

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.900
but it doesn't even matter what's true or not

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:38.900
in order to spark the first moment of escalation

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.660
and then it just goes, goes, goes.

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.180
Well, I think that happens sometimes.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.740
I mean, again, it's this thing

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.180
that social scientists call it selection

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.140
on the dependent variable.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.420
Like there's all these times when that didn't happen,

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:53.300
when it stopped, when it escalated one step

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.420
and then people paused or escalated two steps

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.220
and people said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.700
And so we remember the times

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.500
when it went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.980
and then the really terrible thing happened.

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.060
But fortunately that's not,

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.500
I start off the book with an example of a gang war

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.820
that didn't happen in Medellin, Colombia,

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.740
which is my day job is actually studying conflict

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.820
and gangs and violence and of these other kinds of groups,

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.820
also very sinister and most of the time they don't fight

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.060
and that escalation doesn't happen.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.820
So the escalation does happen quickly sometimes

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.420
except when it doesn't, which-

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.180
So we remember the ones when it does.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.020
It's really important to think about all that.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.940
Like I remember talking to,

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.780
I think Elon Musk on this podcast,

01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:44.420
I was sort of talking about the horrors of war and so on

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:49.300
and then he said, well, most of human history,

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.420
because I think I said mostly human history

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:59.260
had been defined by these horrible wars.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.220
He's like, no, mostly human history

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.420
is just peaceful farming life.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.780
We kind of remember the wars

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.220
but most of the human history is just, is life.

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.500
Yeah, most of the competition between nations

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.940
was like blood, I would say blood thirsty

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.020
without drinking that blood

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.740
in the sense that it was intense, it would loathe some.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.140
And so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of the competition,

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:30.900
which is also can be problematic in some ways is not violent.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.980
And most of human history is about the oppression

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.660
of the majority by a few.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.380
And there are moments when they rise up in revolt

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.140
and there's a revolution, we remember those,

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.740
but most of the time they don't.

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:48.460
And the story of political change and transformation

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.140
and freedom is there's a few revolutions that are violent

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.020
but most of it is actually revolutions

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:57.500
without that kind of violent revolt.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.620
Most of it is just the peaceful concession of power

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.620
by elites to a wider and wider group of people

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.460
in response to their increased economic bargaining power,

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.860
their threat that they're gonna march.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.620
So even if we wanna understand something like

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.620
the march of freedom over human history,

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:16.700
I think we can draw the same insight

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:20.420
that actually we don't, most of the time we don't fight,

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:23.060
we actually concede power.

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.900
Now you don't, the elite doesn't sort of give power

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:29.060
to the masses right away, they just co-opt the few merchants

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.260
who could threaten the whole thing

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.420
and bring them into the circle.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.140
And then the circle gets a little bit wider

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.900
and a little bit wider until the circle is ever wide

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.380
and maybe not ever but encompasses most if not all.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.580
And that's like a hopeful and optimistic trend.

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:47.740
Yeah, if you look at the plot,

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.660
if you guys could pull it up of the wars throughout history,

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.820
the sort of the rate of wars throughout history

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.380
just seemed to be decreasing significantly

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.540
with a few spikes and sort of the expansion.

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.620
It's like half the world is under authoritarian regimes

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.500
but that's been shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.500
Steven Pinker's one person, one famous scholar

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.180
who brings up this hypothesis.

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.500
I mean, there's sort of two ways,

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.580
there's actually two separate kinds of violence

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.780
that one where I think he's completely right

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.060
and one where I think we're not sure, probably maybe not.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.300
The where he's completely right,

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.860
sort of interpersonal violence, homicides, everyday violence

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.060
has been going down, down, down, down, down, down,

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.220
that's just unambiguously.

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.860
And it's mostly because we've created cultures and states

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.740
and rules and things that control that violence.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:40.740
Now the warfare between groups is that less frequent.

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:43.140
Well, it's not clear that he's right,

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.980
that there's fewer wars.

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.180
You might say that wars are more rare

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.940
because they're more costly

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.140
because our weapons are so brutal.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.700
The costs of war go up, as the costs of war go up,

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.460
not entirely but for the most part

01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:00.500
that gives us an incentive not to have them.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.700
But then when they do happen, they're doozies.

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:05.300
So is Pinker right?

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.140
I hope he's right,

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.900
but I don't think that officially that trend is there.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.900
I think that we might have the same kind of levels

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.820
of intergroup violence

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:20.940
because maybe those five fundamentals that lead to war

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.220
have not fundamentally changed

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:26.580
and thus made us, given us a more peaceful world now

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.060
than a couple hundred years ago.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.260
That's something to think about.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.060
So obviously looking at his hypothesis,

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.300
looking at his data and others like him,

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.940
but I have noticed one thing,

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.220
which is the amount of pushback he gets.

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.220
That there is this,

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.100
this is speaking to the general point that you made,

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.460
which is like we overemphasize the anecdotal

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.380
like the, and don't look objectively

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:51.500
at the aggregate data as much.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.860
There's a general cynicism about the world

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.300
and not, I don't even mean cynicism.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.780
It's almost like cynicism porn or something like that

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.860
where people just get,

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.940
for some reason they get a little bit excited

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.860
to talk about the destruction of human civilization

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.700
in a weird way.

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:12.220
Like they don't really mean it, I think.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:17.220
If I were to like psychoanalyze their geopolitical analysis

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.020
is I don't, I think it's a kind of, I don't know,

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:24.740
maybe relieves the mind to think about death

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.340
at a global scale somehow.

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:29.380
And then you can go have lunch with your kids afterwards

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.860
and feel a little better about the world.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.540
I don't know what it is, but that,

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:33.740
it's not very scientific.

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.300
It's very kind of personal, emotional.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.940
And so we shouldn't,

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.140
we should be careful to look at the world in that way.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.500
Because the, if you look broadly,

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.620
there is just, just like how you highlight,

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:50.460
there's a will for peace among people.

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.820
Yeah, you mentioned Medellin.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.220
By the way, how do you pronounce it, Medellin or Medellin?

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.060
Both are fine.

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.060
I think the, there they'd say Medellin

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.660
because that's kind of the accent is the zh on the double L.

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:05.700
But that's, but Medellin is, would be totally fine as well.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.580
What lessons do you draw from the Medellin cartel,

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.460
from the different gang wars in Colombia, Medellin?

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:15.180
What's the economics of peace and war

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:17.180
between drug cartels?

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:18.700
Here's what was really insightful for me.

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:22.500
So I live in Chicago and people are aware

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.300
that there's the violence problem in Chicago.

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.660
It's actually not the worst American city

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.700
by any stretch of the imagination for shootings,

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.700
but it's pretty bad.

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:33.500
And Medellin has these better, much, many more

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:38.500
and probably many better organized gangs than Chicago.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.140
And yet the homicide rate is maybe half.

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:48.060
And now, I mean, there have been moments

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.900
when these gangs go to war in the last 30 years

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.940
when Medellin has become the most violent place

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.780
on the planet.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.380
For the most part right now, they're peaceful.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.940
And so what's going on there?

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.260
I mean, one thing that is there's a hierarchy

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.740
of organizations so that above these reasonably well

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.220
organized neighborhood gangs, there's a set

01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.020
of sort of more shadowy organizations

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.540
that have different names.

01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.860
Some people call them razones.

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.980
Some people would call them bandas criminales,

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:13.860
criminal bands.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.500
You might just call them mafias.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:19.020
And they, there's about 17 of them,

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.580
depending on how you want to count.

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:25.340
And they themselves have a little operating board

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.220
called, sometimes they call it the office,

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:30.940
la oficina, sometimes they call it la mesa, the table.

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.100
Well, each individual one or as a group?

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.460
As a group, as a group.

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.580
So they meet and they don't meet personally all the time.

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.940
Sometimes they meet, but they consult.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.980
A lot of the leaders of these groups are actually in prison.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.820
And so, and they're in the same wings in prison.

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:45.660
Do they have represented?

01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:46.980
Oh, they meet in prison.

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.780
Well, whatever, if I'm on a cell block with you

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:51.300
I'm meeting you anyways, right?

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.940
So actually imprisoning leaders

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.500
and putting them in the same cell block,

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.420
but not putting them in, you know,

01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.860
if you get arrested here in the United States

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.020
and you're a criminal leader

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:01.380
and you get put in a super max prison,

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.820
you cannot run your criminal empire.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:03.660
It's just too difficult.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:04.580
It's impossible.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.060
There, it's possible.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.780
And you might think, and they do,

01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:08.940
they still run their empire.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.260
And you might think that's a bad idea,

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.580
but actually cutting off the head

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.500
of a criminal organization, leading it to a bunch,

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.220
leaving it to a bunch of like hotheaded young guys

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:19.820
that are disorganized is not always the path to peace.

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.300
So having these guys all in the same prison patios

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:28.300
is actually, it reduces imperfect information

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.900
and uncertainty, right?

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.820
It provides a place for them to bargain.

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:32.660
They can talk.

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:35.180
And so La Focina is like a lot of these informal meetings.

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:39.820
And so, you know, and they have these tools

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.460
that they use to control the street gangs.

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.980
So instead of there being like 400 gangs,

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.900
all sort of in this anarchic situation

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:48.660
competing for territory and constantly at war,

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.420
the rizones are keeping them in line

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.820
and they will use sanctions.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.420
They will, where the sanction might be,

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.820
I will put a bullet in your head if you don't.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.740
It's a little more honest than the sanctions between nations.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.300
Exactly, but they will sit them down.

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.900
They'll provide, they'll help them negotiate.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.820
They will provide, I said there are these things

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.860
called commitment problems where like there's some,

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:15.580
I have some incentive to like exterminate you,

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.060
but that's gonna be costly for everybody.

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.460
So I'm gonna, what's the solution?

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.500
Well, I'm gonna provide commitment.

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.580
I'm gonna like enforce this deal.

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.260
And yeah, you don't like this deal now

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.860
because you could take advantage of your situation

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:28.820
and wage war, but I'm gonna give you a counterincentives.

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:31.340
And so they keep the peace.

01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.260
And so, and it's a little bit,

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.700
so they're a little bit like the UN Security Council

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:38.100
and peacekeeping forces and sanctions regimes.

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.380
It's like the same kinds of tools, the same parallels

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.180
and they're imperfect.

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:45.500
They don't always work that well and they're unequal, right?

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.740
Because it's not like they're pursuing this

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:51.180
in the interests of like democratic, blah, blah, blah.

01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:56.140
But it kind of works until it doesn't.

01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.340
And 10 years ago in the mid 1990s,

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.420
there were wars and this breaks down.

01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.340
And it kind of gave me this perspective

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:05.020
on the international institutions

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.540
and all the tools we've built

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.140
that we do the same things, right?

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:13.140
Sanctions are designed to make unchecked leaders

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.060
face the cost of war.

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.500
It's a solution to one of the five problems, right?

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.620
And mediators are a solution to uncertainty

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.300
and international institutions that can enforce a peace

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.460
and agreement are a solution to commitment problems.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.220
And all of these things can be solutions

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.260
to these intangible incentives, like these preferences

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.540
for whatever you value and miscalculations

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.100
because they will punish you for your miscalculation

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.660
or they will get a mediator to sort of help you realize

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.780
why you're miscalculating.

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:43.300
So they're doing all these things

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.860
and it made me realize that the comparison

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:48.980
to the UN Security Council and all our tools

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:49.820
is actually a pretty good one

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.180
because those are pretty unequal too.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.900
And those are pretty imperfect.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.100
Like there's these, we have five nations

01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.980
with a veto on the Security Council

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.860
and a lot of unequal power

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:04.260
and they're manipulating this in their own self-interest

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.860
or their group's interests.

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:11.620
So anyway, so it's actually some of the things

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.460
that work in Medellin and why they work

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.180
help give me a lot of perspective

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.300
on what works in the international arena

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.300
and why we have some of the problems we have is like.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.380
So there's not, in some deep way,

01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.780
there's not a fundamental difference

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:26.860
between those 17 mafia groups and

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:27.700
The UN Security Council.

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.540
The UN Security Council.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.380
Oh, we're such a funny descendant of apes.

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.580
We put on suits, I'm sure they're wearing different,

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:39.140
they have different cultural garbs that they wear.

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.980
Yeah.

01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.820
What are your thoughts?

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:43.340
The one thing I got from Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.340
who founded the Medellin Cartel is like having spoken

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.580
with people on this podcast,

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:53.940
talked to Roger Reeves who was a drug transporter.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:58.940
It seems like it was, I don't know the right term,

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.220
but it was very kind of professional and calm.

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.020
It didn't have a sense of danger to it.

01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.460
Like it's negotiating.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.940
So like the danger is always on the table as a threat

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.220
as part of the calculation,

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:14.100
but you're using that threat in order to deescalate,

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:15.020
in order to have peace.

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.940
Everybody is interested in peace.

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.460
So something that happened last year,

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.340
we were a little bit able to watch in real time

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:22.380
because we had a few contacts.

01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:25.180
We've been meeting and talking to a lot of these leaders

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:27.140
in prison and a bit outside of prison.

01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:29.500
Many of them will talk to us.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:34.420
And so there, the homicide rate,

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:38.300
I mentioned homicide rate in Medellin's maybe two thirds

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.580
or half of the Chicago level.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.340
It had been climbing.

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.660
Some of these street level gangs were starting to fight.

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.340
Maybe at sort of the, on some level,

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.820
it seems that like maybe some of those

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.300
our own leaders were like saying,

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:54.700
well, you know, we're actually not sure

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:55.660
how strong these guys are.

01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.380
Let's let them fight just to test it out.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.620
Let's have these skirmishes, right?

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.020
It wasn't prolonged warfare.

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:01.540
It was like, let's just sort of feel out

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.500
how strong everybody is,

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.060
because then we'll be able to reapportion

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.060
the drug corners and stuff accordingly.

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.660
So they were kind of feeling each other out through fighting

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.380
and the homicide rate doubled

01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:14.300
and then it increased by the same amount again.

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.900
And so it was approaching something

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:18.060
that might get out of control,

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:19.420
which wasn't in anybody's interest.

01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:20.460
It wasn't in the government's interest,

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.380
wasn't in their interest.

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:23.460
And so then magically,

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.900
all these leaders in these patios, right,

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:29.540
different prisons, they're spread out

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.860
around a bunch of prisons.

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.700
Everybody gets transferred to a new prison on the same day,

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:37.780
which means they all get to be in the same holding area

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.260
for three days before they're all moved elsewhere.

01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.740
So the government had a role in this.

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.020
And then somebody who's like a trusted mediator

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.140
on the criminal side gets himself arrested,

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.100
happens to be put in the same spot.

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:57.540
And a week later, the homicide rate is 30% of what it was,

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.620
is back to its normal,

01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:03.700
unfortunately, not zero, right?

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.660
But it's back to where it was

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.540
because it didn't make sense to have a war.

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.540
And everybody, government, mafia leaders,

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.940
everybody sort of like,

01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:18.700
they figured out a way to sort of bargain their way to peace.

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.620
I guess it was almost like a tangent,

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:23.460
but you mentioned you got a chance potentially

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.820
to talk to a few folks,

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.740
some were in prison, some were not.

01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:30.500
Is it productive?

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.740
Is it interesting?

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.380
Maybe by way of advice,

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.260
do you have ideas about talking to people

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:38.340
who are actively criminals?

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.580
Yeah, it really depends on the situation.

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.500
So like the first time I worked in a conflicted place

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.620
was in Northern Uganda

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:49.180
in maybe the last couple of years of a long running war.

01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.540
So this would have been 2004, 2005.

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.900
This is a small East African country.

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.460
And the North of the country had been engulfed

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:02.260
and think of it as like a 20 year low level insurgency

01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:06.140
run by a self-proclaimed Messiah

01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.780
who wasn't that popular and no one joined his movement.

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.260
So he would kidnap kids.

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.900
I could talk to people who'd come back from being there.

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.060
I never once, if I'd wanted to,

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.340
and I was writing about that armed group,

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.300
I never talked to anybody who was an active member

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:26.700
because that armed group was quite rare.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.700
It wouldn't have been easy or safe.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.300
And that's sometimes true.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.580
I'm starting to do some work in Mexico probably,

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.020
and I'm not gonna be talking to any criminal.

01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.020
They'll kill people.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.340
When you say you're not going to talk to them

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:44.980
and they'll kill people, which people?

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.980
So, I mean, journalists are routinely killed

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.940
for knowing too much in Mexico.

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:53.340
There's no compunctions about killing them

01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.260
and there's no consequences.

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.060
Who kills a journalist?

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.100
It's not the main people that you spoke with.

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:06.100
It's their, is it their lackeys or is it rival gangs?

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.260
This is true of a Chicago gang

01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:11.460
and this is true of a Medellin gang.

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.980
It's probably true of a Mexico gang.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:16.020
It's like, you might have your group of 30 people.

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.180
One or two of them might be shooters.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:19.060
Most people don't shoot.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.580
Most people don't like to do that.

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:23.940
Or you don't even have any of those people in your group

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.340
because you're trying to run a business.

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:26.300
You don't need any shooters.

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:30.620
You can just hire a killer when you need them on contract.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:33.540
And so if somebody's asking questions

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.540
and you don't want them to ask questions

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.060
or you think they know too much in a way that threatens you

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:44.660
and it's cheap for you and you have no personal compunctions

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.700
then you can put a contract out on them

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:48.740
and they'll be killed.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.980
That doesn't happen in Colombia.

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.820
It doesn't happen in Chicago.

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.340
I don't know, there's lots of reasons for that.

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.380
I can't say exactly why.

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.420
I think one reason is like, they know what'll happen

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:06.460
is that there'll be consequences.

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.900
That the government will crack down and make them pay

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.860
and so they don't do it.

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:15.380
And that is not what happened in Mexico.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:16.780
They won't kill like a DA agent.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:18.700
They know that the US has made it clear.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.660
You kill one of our agents, we will make you pay.

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:25.940
And so they're very careful to minimize death of American.

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.580
But you kill journalists and nobody comes after them

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.620
or is able to come after them.

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.820
And so they've realized they can get away with this

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:33.180
and that seems to be the equilibrium there.

01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:36.740
That's my initial sense from,

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.580
but we spent a lot of time

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:41.220
before we started talking to criminals.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.660
We spent a year trying to figure out what was safe

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.500
before we actually, and failing.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.020
We kept lots of safe things to do.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.260
It was also really hard to figure out how to talk to people

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.220
in these organizations.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:53.540
We failed 40 times before we figured out a way

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.860
to actually access people.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.580
Is it worth it talking to them if you figure out,

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.100
because it's not never gonna be safe.

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.900
It's going to be when you estimate

01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.780
that there's some low level of risk.

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:07.420
Like what's the benefit as a researcher,

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:10.980
as a scholar of humans?

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:11.860
Yeah.

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.300
So I actually don't think, let's compare it to something.

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:17.740
Okay, I'm in Austin for the first time

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.580
and I'm walking around

01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:20.580
and there's all these people buzzing around

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:23.260
on these scooters without helmets.

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.260
We need to definitely interview them

01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.820
and say what the hell is wrong with you.

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:29.540
So nothing I have ever done in my entire career

01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:31.540
is as risky as that.

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.180
That's a nice way to compare journalism in a war zone

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:38.460
and scooters in Austin.

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.780
Some war zones, I worked in Northern Uganda

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.580
and I worked in Liberia and I work now in Medellin

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.580
and I'm starting to work in Mexico

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:48.100
and both those particular places.

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.820
And then the things I did in those places

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:52.380
where I spent a lot of time making sure

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:55.500
that what I was doing was not unduly risky.

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.140
Todd, could you pull up a picture

01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.700
of a person on a scooter in Austin

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:02.900
so we can just compare this absurd situation

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:05.100
where I doubt it's the riskiest thing

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.460
because now we have to look at the data.

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:09.780
I understand the point you were making, but well.

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.460
So I'm not trying to say there's zero risk.

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.460
I think there's like a calculated risk

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.140
and I think you become good at,

01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:19.660
you work at becoming good at being able

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.780
to assess these risks and know

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.580
who can help you assess these risks.

01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:27.260
Yeah, I think there's another aspect to it too.

01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:28.900
When you're riding a scooter,

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:35.220
once you're done with the scooter, the risk has disappeared.

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:37.140
There's something, the lingering

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.900
where you have to look over your shoulder,

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:40.340
potentially for the rest of your life

01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:42.740
as you accumulate all these conversations.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.780
Yeah, I've chosen, but I've also advised my students

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.180
I wouldn't go and do this with an armed group

01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:52.660
that would think I knew too much and therefore,

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:53.500
some people do that.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.140
Some journalists I think are very brave

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.460
and take risks and do that and good for them

01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:58.740
and I'm happy they do that.

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:02.860
I don't personally do that.

01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:06.300
So these guys are very, I mean in Medellin it's a business.

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:09.500
They're just, they're selling local drugs

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.900
and they are laundering money for the big cartels

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.740
and they are shaking down businesses for money

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.780
or selling services in some cases

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:22.300
and they make a lot of money and it's a business

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.380
and they're in prison.

01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:29.220
So they can talk about most of what they wanna talk about

01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:30.620
because there's no double jeopardy.

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.020
They've been incarcerated for it

01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:36.860
and you're just, they're just, you're just talking shop

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.900
and they're just, so it's worth it I think

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:41.620
because the risk is very low,

01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.260
but if you actually wanna weaken these organizations

01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:45.660
and they're extremely powerful,

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.940
they're extremely big facet of life in a lot of cities

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.380
in the Americas in particular,

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:53.140
including in some of the United, some American cities,

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.380
if you wanna understand how to weaken these groups over time,

01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:00.940
you have to understand how their business works

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.780
and we're like, imagine you were made like the,

01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:08.180
whatever the oils are of the United States

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.980
or maybe you're in charge of the finance industry.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.500
You're the regulator for oil and energy or for finance

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.500
and then you get in the job and someone says,

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.500
and then you're like, well, how many firms are there

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.220
and what do they sell and what are the prices?

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:25.100
And everyone's like, well, we don't really know.

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.620
You would not be a very good regulator.

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:30.180
And if you're a policeman or you're someone

01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.740
who's in charge of counter organized crime,

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:32.620
you're just a regulator.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.460
You're trying to regulate an illicit industry.

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:37.260
You're regulating an industry that happens to be illicit

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.620
and you have no information.

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.140
And so that's kind of what we do.

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:44.460
We figure out how the system works

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.180
and like what are the economic incentives

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:47.580
and what are the political incentives?

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.380
Any interviews and conversations help with that?

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:51.420
They help a lot, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.260
We do that.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.660
So we have, I mean, I don't do, I do some of those,

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:57.660
but I'm on the side, my Spanish is okay.

01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:59.460
It's not great.

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.740
And you have a translator usually,

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.940
if you ever go directly?

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.220
Well, if only because I can't understand

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.940
the street vernacular, like I'm just totally hopeless.

01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:08.900
Nor could many people who speak Spanish

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.020
as a second language.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.980
It's totally, you go to prison, you talk to these guys

01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:16.980
and they're speaking in the local dialect and it's tough.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.340
But more importantly, like I just don't need to be there.

01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.700
And that's not my, I'm a quantitative scholar.

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.580
I'm the guy who collects the data.

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.700
So we have people, we have people on our team

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.660
and colleagues and employees

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.180
who are doing full-time interviews.

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:33.140
So, and then I just sometimes go with them.

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.460
What about if we, you mentioned Uganda.

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.300
Yeah.

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.780
Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord.

01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:42.980
I'm seeing here, he kidnapped 591 children

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:45.180
in three years between 2000.

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:46.980
They must've kidnapped.

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:50.580
I had, they probably kidnapped for at least a short time,

01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:54.340
like a few hours to a day, more than 50,000 kids.

01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.380
As a terror tactic?

01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.220
A little bit.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.220
I mean, you know, most of those people,

01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:00.860
they just let go after they carried goods.

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:03.220
They held on to, they tried to hold on to thousands.

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:06.460
The short story, listen, if you're not popular,

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:09.260
if you're running an armed movement and you need troops,

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:13.340
you can, and nobody wants to fight for you,

01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:16.220
you can either give up or you can have

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.460
a small clandestine terror organization

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:20.340
that tries a different set of tactics.

01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.980
But if you want a conventional army

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.100
and you don't want to give up, then you have to conscript.

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.740
And if you want to conscript and you don't,

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.460
you know, here we conscript and then we say,

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.100
if you run away, we'll shoot you.

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.540
And we control the whole territory.

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.140
So we'll, that's a credible promise.

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.020
If you're a small insurgency organization,

01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:41.140
people can run away and then you can't promise

01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.060
to shoot them very easily

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.940
because you don't control all the territory.

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:47.460
And so what these movements do is they try to brainwash you.

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:48.780
And I think what they figured out

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:50.260
after years of abducting children,

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.820
you know, you talk about evil,

01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.860
they figured out that, you know, we have to,

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.140
maybe like, I don't know what the,

01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:59.260
but say like maybe one in a hundred

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.340
will like buy the rhetoric.

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:04.060
So we just have to conscript or abduct a large number of kids

01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:06.820
and then some small number of them will not run away.

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.020
And those will be our committed cadres.

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.300
And those people can become commanders

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.020
and because they'll buy the propaganda

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.820
and they'll buy the messianic messages.

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:18.220
But because most people wise up,

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.860
we have, especially as they get older,

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:22.540
we just have to abduct vast numbers of kids

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.780
in order to have a committed cadre.

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:27.900
And so it has the other benefit of sort of being terrifying

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:30.620
for the population and being a weapon in itself.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:33.340
But I think for them was just primarily

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.900
a way to solve a recruitment problem

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:41.380
when you're a totally like

01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:46.860
hopeless and ideologically empty rebel movement.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.580
So in some sense, it's, it's, yeah.

01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:52.500
So that's maybe the short story was a real tragedy.

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:55.900
I heard one interview of a dictator

01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:00.820
where the journalist was basically telling them like,

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.620
how could you be doing this?

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.300
Basically calling out all the atrocities

01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:09.060
the person is committing

01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.140
and the dictator was kind of laughing it off

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.980
and walked away and like he cut off the interview.

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.220
That feel like a very unproductive thing to be doing.

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.580
You're basically stating the thing

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:21.060
that everyone knows to his face.

01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:22.780
Maybe that's pleasant to somebody,

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:26.020
but that feels unproductive.

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:28.100
It feels like the goal should be

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:29.740
some level of understanding.

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:30.580
Yeah.

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.500
He's been super elusive.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.820
I mean, why he's fighting this Kony, yeah.

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.020
I mean, why he's fought this, I don't even know.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:42.460
You know, it's not a great example of,

01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.300
that's an, you know what,

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.300
the way I look at that situation is,

01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:52.260
it's a little bit particular to the way Uganda works,

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:55.820
but most of the political leadership

01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:58.020
for most of its post-independence history

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.220
came from the north of the country.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.980
That was like the power base

01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.340
and that was dictatorial and they were,

01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.180
so you've heard of like people like Idi Amin,

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.980
but people have heard of like Milton Abote

01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:11.180
and all these people were all from the north.

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:14.220
And then you get the current president

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:15.940
who came power in 1986.

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.100
So he's been around a long time, this guy in the 70.

01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.740
He was from the south

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:25.220
and he was fighting against these dictators

01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.380
and he was fighting for a freer and better Uganda

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:30.140
and in many ways, I mean, he's still a dictator himself,

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:33.100
but he did create a freer and better Uganda.

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.740
So he's better than these,

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:38.180
he's a thug, but he was better than thugs before him.

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:41.020
And he came to power and he was like,

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.260
and these, some of the northerners were like,

01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.180
we wanna keep up the fight.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.020
And he was like, you know what, you guys,

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.940
I'm strong enough to continue to the north.

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:53.540
You guys go, you wanna have a crazy insurgency up there?

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.540
And some kook believes he's like speaking,

01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.940
you know, through the Holy Spirit's,

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.820
you know, speaking through him

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:05.460
and he's gonna totally disrupt the north.

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.100
I don't care, that's great.

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.420
You guys just fester and fight

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.620
and that's gonna totally destabilize this power,

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:15.300
this traditional power base

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.500
and then that's just gonna help me consolidate control.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.100
So he was an autocrat, he was an unchecked leader

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:25.100
who allowed a lunatic to run around and cause mayhem

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:30.380
because it was in his political interest to do so.

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:35.020
And there's no puzzle.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:40.020
It's, in some ways it's that simple and kind of tragic.

01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:42.180
There's little to understand.

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.020
Yeah, it took me a lot.

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.500
Well, you know what, it's not so easy.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:47.180
In the middle of it, I didn't understand that.

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:49.780
I don't think a lot of people did and I'm not,

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.540
I think I could persuade most people

01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:54.620
who study or work there now to like see it that way.

01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.220
I think people, that would make sense to people,

01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.700
but it didn't make sense in the moment.

01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.180
And you know, in the moment this is happening,

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:02.300
it's terrible and you kind of, you know,

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.860
you don't realize how avoidable it was.

01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:06.940
That basically it was the absence

01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:08.420
of effective police actions

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.980
that kept the lunatic from being contained.

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:14.780
And that lunatic would never, you know,

01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.540
he's not, it's not that skillful of our movement, right?

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.540
They could have, it could have been shut down

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.820
and there was just never any political will

01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:23.780
to shut it down, the opposite.

01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.380
That's what I meant, like that unchecked leader,

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.660
not only do you not bear the cost,

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.940
but you might have a private incentive as an autocrat

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.460
to like see that violence happen.

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.060
And in this case, it was,

01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:35.500
it was just keeping a troublesome part of the country busy.

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.220
If it's okay to look at a few other wars.

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:41.060
So we talked about drug wars in Medellin.

01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:44.340
Are there other wars that stand out to you

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:45.180
as full of lessons?

01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:46.420
We can jump around a little bit.

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.660
Maybe if we can return briefly at World War II,

01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:55.180
from your framework, could World War II have been avoided?

01:52:55.180 --> 01:53:00.180
This is one of the most traumatic wars, global wars.

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:05.700
I mean, one obvious driver of that war was these,

01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:10.060
the things that Hitler valued

01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:15.060
and then was able to use his autocratic power

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:19.980
to either convince other people or to suppress them.

01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:25.060
And so some people stop there and say that.

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.580
And then in the West basically,

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.660
and then of course they were able,

01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:32.580
because they were such an economic and political powerhouse,

01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.060
they were able to sort of make demands

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:39.060
of the rest of Europe that you can kind of see the full,

01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:42.060
letting Nazis march into Denmark without a fight

01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.500
or France folding very quickly,

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.540
you can kind of see as like an appeasement

01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:49.340
or an acknowledgement of their superiority

01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.980
and their ability to bargain without much of a fight.

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:55.540
And then you can see the Western response

01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:56.420
as a principled stand.

01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.340
I think that's, and there's a lot of truth to that.

01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.500
In terms of the strategic forces,

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:04.140
a lot of political scientists see a version

01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:08.020
of a commitment problem, basically where Germany says,

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:11.740
you know what, we're strong now, we're temporarily strong,

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.700
we're not gonna be this strong forever.

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.820
If we can get this terrible bargain

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:22.100
and get everyone to capitulate through violence,

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.740
if we strike now and then solidify our power

01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:28.860
and keep these, in World War I it was,

01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:30.140
prevent the rise of Russia

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:37.380
and prevent the strengthening of Russian alliances as well.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.820
And so we have an incentive to strike now

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:43.100
and there's a window of opportunity that's closing

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.820
and that they thought was closing as soon as 1917

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:46.900
in World War I.

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:49.420
And I don't know that that story is as persuasive

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:50.260
in World War II.

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:52.420
I think there was an element of a closing window.

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.900
They kept talking about a closing window.

01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.860
They really thought there's a closing window.

01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.340
I think it was a nature of that window is different

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:04.220
in that there was kind of pacifism

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:09.780
and it seems like if war broke out,

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:13.140
most nations in the vicinity would not be ready.

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:16.980
By the people, the leaders that are in power,

01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.820
they weren't ready so the timing is really right now.

01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.660
But I wonder how often that is the case

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:24.980
with leaders in war that feels like the timing is now.

01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:26.380
The other commitment problem,

01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.140
the other shift that was happening

01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:29.340
that he wanted to avert

01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.500
that is kind of wrapped up with his ideology

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.020
is this idea of like a cultural

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:37.780
and a demographic window of opportunity.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.260
That if he wanted, conditional on having these views

01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:46.620
of Germanic people and a pure race

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:51.620
and that he had to strike now before any opportunity

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.940
to sort of establish that was possible.

01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:57.220
I think that's one, it's an incentive

01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.780
that requires his ideology as well.

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:03.980
How do you avoid it within this framework?

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:05.420
Would you say is there,

01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:11.620
you kind of provide an explanation

01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:13.180
but is there a way to avoid it?

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.220
Is violence the way to avoid it?

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:17.340
Because people kind of tried rational,

01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:22.180
peaceful kind of usual negotiation

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.780
and that led to this war.

01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:26.540
Is that unique to this particular war?

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.660
Let's say World War I or World War II.

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:31.380
So there's an extra pressure from Germany

01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.380
on both wars to act.

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.620
Okay, so we've highlighted that.

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.780
Is there a way to alleviate that extra pressure to act?

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:40.020
Let me use World War I as an example.

01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:44.380
Suppose as many German generals said at that time,

01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.340
we have a window of opportunity before Russia,

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.860
where we might not win a war with Russia.

01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:52.060
So the probability that we can win a war

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:55.540
is gonna change a lot in the next decade or two,

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.860
maybe even in the next few years.

01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:00.900
And so if we were in a much better bargaining position now,

01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:04.220
both to not use violence, but if necessarily use violence.

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:06.060
Because otherwise,

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.300
Russia is going to be extremely powerful in the future

01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:09.780
and they'll be able to use that power

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:13.140
to change the bargaining with us and to like hold,

01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.060
keep us down.

01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.900
And the thing is, is in principle,

01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:18.740
Russia could say,

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:21.620
look, we don't wanna get invaded right now.

01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:24.300
We know you could invade us.

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.140
We know we're weak.

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:26.740
We know we'll be strong in the future.

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:32.620
We promise to like not wield our and abuse our,

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:35.900
or just nearly just sort of take what we can get

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.220
in the future when we're strong.

01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:39.380
We're gonna restrain ourselves in future,

01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:41.740
or we're gonna hand over something that makes us powerful

01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:43.180
because that's the bargain

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.820
that would make us all better off.

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:47.020
And the reason political economists

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:48.180
call it a commitment problem

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:51.380
is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem.

01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.780
And they can't make that commitment

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:55.140
because there's nobody who will hold them accountable.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:59.340
So anything, any international legal architecture,

01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.260
any set of enforceable agreements,

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:04.580
any UN Security Council, any world government,

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:08.140
any anything that would help you make that commitment

01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:09.420
is a solution.

01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:11.940
All right, if that's the core problem.

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:14.500
And so that's why, you know, in Medellin,

01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:20.140
you know, the La Fucina can do that.

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.020
They can say, listen, yes,

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.860
combo that's strong today is gonna be weak tomorrow.

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.100
You have an incentive to eliminate this combo over here,

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.620
but because they're gonna be strong, but guess what?

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.700
You're not gonna do that.

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:31.860
And we're gonna make sure,

01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.700
we're gonna promise that when these guys do get strong,

01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.820
we're gonna restrain what they can do.

01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:39.940
I mean, most of our constitutions in most stable countries

01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:42.020
have done precisely that, right?

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.180
There's a lot of complaining right now in the United States

01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:46.140
about the way that the constitution

01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:48.100
is a portion power between states.

01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.540
That was a deal.

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.380
That was a commitment.

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.300
The constitution in the United States was a deal

01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.860
made to a bunch of states

01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:59.060
that knew they were going to be weak in future

01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.420
because of economic and demographic trends,

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:02.380
or guess they might be.

01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:07.140
And it said, listen, you cooperate and will commit

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:10.460
not to basically ignore your interests over the long run.

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:14.900
And now, you know, 250 years later,

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:17.580
we're still honoring those commitments.

01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.740
It was part of the deal that meant

01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:23.980
that there actually would be a union.

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.220
And so we do this all the time.

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:27.620
So constitution is a good example of how

01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.260
every country's constitution,

01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.180
especially a country who's writing a constitution

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.860
after a war, that constitution

01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:37.460
and all of the other institutions they're building

01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:40.780
are an attempt to like provide commitment to groups

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:42.700
who are worried about future shifts in power.

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:45.820
And then does that help with avoid civil war?

01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:50.580
So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars,

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:53.260
perhaps the American Civil War and the others?

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:58.260
So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried

01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:03.620
for a long time to preserve the interests of minority groups,

02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:08.180
powerful minority groups who were powerful at the time

02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:10.780
and knew that the demographics were working against them

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.820
was to guarantee, you know,

02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:16.020
this ethnic religious group gets the presidency

02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.140
and this ethnic religious group

02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:19.060
gets the prime ministership in this ethno.

02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:24.180
And a lot of countries will apportion seats in the parliament

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.820
to ethnic religious groups.

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:31.660
And that's an attempt to like give a group

02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:35.940
that's temporarily powerful some assurances

02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:38.180
that when they're weak in the future,

02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:40.300
that they'll still have a say, right?

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.660
Just like we portioned seats in the Senate

02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:45.500
in a way that's not demographically representative,

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:47.340
but is like unequal, quote unquote,

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.500
in a sense to help people be confident

02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:52.140
that there won't be a tyranny of the majority.

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.820
And now that just happens to have been

02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:56.060
like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon

02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:59.700
because eventually like the de facto power on the ground

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:04.220
just gets so out of line with this really rigid system

02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.980
of the presidency goes to this ethnic religious group

02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:08.660
and this prime ministership goes,

02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:10.420
that it didn't last, right?

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.380
But you can think of every post-conflict agreement

02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:16.500
in every constitution is like a little bit

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:21.500
of humans' best effort to find an agreement

02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:27.660
that's going to protect the interests of a group

02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:31.220
that's temporarily has an interest in violence

02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:35.260
in order to not be violent.

02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:36.220
Yeah.

02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:38.380
And so there's a lot of ingenuity

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.940
and it doesn't always work, right?

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:43.860
Which actually from a perspective of the group,

02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:46.540
threatening violence or actually doing violence

02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.620
is one way to make progress for your group.

02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.540
We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?

02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.780
We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.980
or Russians versus in the West,

02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.820
or maybe it's managing gangs versus one another.

02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:01.020
Like a lot of their bargaining power

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:03.860
comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:06.060
And so if I wanna have more bargaining power,

02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:09.020
I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence.

02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:13.260
And so the strategically wise thing to do,

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:14.140
I mean, it's terrible.

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.580
It's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into,

02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:18.020
but the strategically wise thing to do

02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:20.940
is to build up lots of arms, to threaten to use them,

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.140
to credibly threaten to use them,

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:25.100
but then trust or hope that like your enemy

02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:30.100
is gonna see reason and avoid this really terrible,

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.700
inefficient thing which is fighting.

02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.420
But the thing that's going on the whole time

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:38.060
is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP

02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:40.900
or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient.

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:41.820
Yes.

02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:43.700
That's the tragedy.

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:46.500
We don't have war and that's good,

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:48.220
but we have really limited abilities

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:51.140
to like incentivize our enemies not to arm

02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:52.540
and to keep ourselves from arming.

02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:56.380
We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't.

02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:59.620
And so the mess is that we have to arm

02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.620
and then we have to threaten all the time.

02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:04.860
Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless.

02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:07.980
You've actually pulled up that now disappeared a paper

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.580
that said the big title called Civil War

02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:15.180
and your name is on it, what's that about?

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:17.820
Well, that was, I mean, when I finished in graduate school

02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:19.660
and this was a paper with my advisor

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.300
at Ted Nigel at Berkeley.

02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.020
Most nations, the paper opens,

02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:29.300
have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960.

02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.580
Yet, were you still in grad school on this or no?

02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:35.420
Maybe last year or just graduated, I think.

02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:38.620
I wish I was in a discipline that wrote papers like this.

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:40.100
This is pretty bad ass.

02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.100
Yet while civil war is central

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:44.020
to many nations development,

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:49.020
it has stood at the periphery of economic research

02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.020
and teaching so on and so forth.

02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.780
And this is looking at civil war broadly throughout history

02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:55.580
or is it just particular civil wars?

02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:57.820
We were mostly looking at like the late 20th century.

02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.260
I mean, I was trained as a what's called

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.340
development economist, which is somebody who studies

02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:05.340
why some places are poor and why some countries are rich.

02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:10.180
And I, like a number of people around that time

02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:11.780
stumbled into violence.

02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:14.060
I mean, people have been studying the wealth

02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.340
and poverty of nations basically

02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.940
since the invention of economics.

02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:22.980
But there was a big blind spot for violence.

02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.940
Now there isn't any more.

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:28.700
It's like a flourishing area of study, but in economics.

02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:29.980
But at the time it wasn't.

02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:32.140
And so there were people like me and Ted

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.500
who were sort of part political scientists

02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.780
because political scientists obviously

02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.660
had been studying this for a long time

02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:41.820
who started bringing economic tools and expertise

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:44.180
and like partnerships with political scientists

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:45.020
and adding to it.

02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:46.980
And so we wrote this.

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:48.420
So after like people had been doing this

02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.380
for five or 10 years in our field,

02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:52.300
we wrote like a review article

02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:54.420
telling economists like what was going on.

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.100
And so this was like a summary for economists.

02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:57.940
So the book in some ways is a lot

02:04:57.940 --> 02:04:59.940
in the same spirit of this article.

02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:03.620
I mean, it's designed to be not written

02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.420
as like a boring laundry list of studies,

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:08.020
which is what, that's the purpose of this article.

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.700
It was for graduate students and professors

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.220
who wanted to think about what to work on and what we knew.

02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.100
This book is like now trying to like,

02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:16.580
not just say what economists are doing,

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:19.780
but sort of say what economists, political scientists,

02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.740
psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists,

02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.820
like how do we bring some sense to this big project

02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:27.540
and policymakers, like what do we know

02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:30.980
and what do we know about building peace given,

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:33.900
because if you don't know what the reason for wars are,

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.300
you're probably not gonna design the right cure.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:39.900
And so anyway, so that was the,

02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:41.500
but I started off studying civil wars

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:44.420
and I, because I stumbled into this place

02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.060
in Northern Uganda basically by accident.

02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:48.900
It was never no intention of working in civil wars.

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:50.700
I never thought about it.

02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:55.700
And then basically I followed a woman there

02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.060
and-

02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:58.220
Oh, we'll talk about that.

02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:01.260
I gotta ask you first, and for people who are just watching,

02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:04.300
we have an amazing team of folks helping out,

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:07.180
pulling pictures and articles and so on,

02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:09.900
mostly so that I can pull up pictures on Instagram

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:12.380
of animals fighting, which is what I do on my own time.

02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:14.060
And then we'll discuss, analyze,

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.020
maybe with George St. Pierre, that's all he sends me

02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:18.780
for people who are curious.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.740
But let me ask you one of the most difficult things

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:23.260
going on in the world today, Israel-Palestine.

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:26.420
Will we ever see peace in this part of the world?

02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:31.420
And sort of your book title is

02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:33.900
The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace,

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:35.780
or the subtitle, Why We Fight.

02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.460
What's the path for peace?

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:40.780
Will we ever see peace?

02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:45.780
Yeah, if we think about this conflict

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:49.020
in the sense of like this dispute, this sort of contest,

02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.260
this contest that's been going on

02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.580
between Israelis and Palestinians,

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:52.980
it's been going on for a century.

02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:58.980
And there are really just 10 or 15 years

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:03.220
of pretty serious violence in that span of time,

02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:07.860
most of it from 2000 to 2009 and stretching up to like 2014.

02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:10.500
There are like sporadic incidents, which are really terrible.

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.140
I'm not trying to diminish the human cost of these,

02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:13.820
by the way, like I'm just trying to point out

02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:16.820
that whatever's happening as unpleasant

02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:18.460
and challenging and difficult as it is,

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:20.740
it's actually not what we're trying to do.

02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:21.980
It's actually not war.

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.020
And so it is at peace.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.460
There's sort of an uneasy stalemate.

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:26.300
Israelis and Palestinians are actually pretty good

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.300
at just sort of keeping this

02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:29.340
at a relatively low scale of violence.

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:33.380
There's a whole bunch of like low scale sporadic violence

02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:36.740
that can be repression of civilians.

02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.580
It can be terror bombings and terror actions.

02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:42.980
It can be counter terror violence.

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.940
It can be mass arrests.

02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:45.780
It can be repression.

02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:47.180
It can be denying people the vote.

02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:50.300
It can be rattling sabers.

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:52.980
All these things that are happening, right?

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:56.140
And it can be sporadic three week wars

02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:00.260
or sporadic, you know, very brief episodes

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.300
of intense violence before everybody sees sense

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:05.660
and then settles down to this uneasy.

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:08.020
That's not like, we're right not to think of that

02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:09.020
as like a peace and there's certainly

02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:10.780
no stable agreement, right?

02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.100
So a stable agreement and amity

02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:18.740
and any ability to move on from this extreme hostility,

02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:19.580
we're not there yet.

02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:22.700
And that's maybe very far away.

02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:26.820
But this is a good example of two rivals

02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:29.820
who most of the time have avoided really intense violence.

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:34.820
So you talked about this, like most of the time rivals

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:39.900
just like avoiding violence and hating each other in peace.

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:44.420
So is this what peace, so to answer my question.

02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:45.260
Yeah, sometimes, I mean.

02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:46.620
Is this what peace looks like?

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:50.220
Not always, but I mean, it's kind of my worry

02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:53.780
to go back to like the Russia-Ukraine example.

02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:56.060
Like I kind of, it's gonna be really hard

02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:00.660
to find an agreement that both sides can feel

02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:03.060
they can honor, that they can be explicit about,

02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:06.220
that they'll hold to, that will enable them to move on.

02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.180
Yeah, feels like a first step in a long journey

02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:11.580
towards a greatness for both nations

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:15.420
and a peaceful time, flourishing, that kind of thing.

02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:18.380
I mean, you can think of like what's going on

02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:20.700
in Israel-Palestine, there's a stalemate.

02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:26.220
Both of them are exhausted from the violence that has occurred.

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.260
Neither one of them is quite willing to,

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:31.420
for various reasons, to create this sort of stable agreement.

02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:34.380
There's a lot of really difficult issues to resolve.

02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:39.220
And maybe the sad thing, maybe we'll end up

02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.060
in the same situation with Russia-Ukraine.

02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:44.220
This is where, if they stop fighting one another,

02:09:44.220 --> 02:09:46.460
but Russia holds the east of the country

02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.860
and Crimea and nobody really acknowledges

02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:52.180
their right to that, that might within,

02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:53.620
there's just gonna be a lot of tension

02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.340
and skirmishing and violence,

02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:58.300
but that never really progresses to war for 30 years.

02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:02.220
That would be a sad, but maybe possible outcome.

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.180
So that's kind of where Israel-Palestine looks to me.

02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:08.980
And so someone, if we're gonna talk about why we fight,

02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:11.300
then the question we have to ask is like why,

02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:14.260
like the second Intifada,

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:15.660
that was the most violent episode.

02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:19.820
Why did that happen and why did that last several years?

02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:22.340
That would be, we could analyze that and we could say,

02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:24.700
what was it about these periods of violence

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.060
that led there to be prolonged, intense violence?

02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:28.340
Because that was in nobody's interest,

02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:29.620
that didn't need to happen.

02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:32.340
And the part I don't talk about that in the book,

02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:35.260
I wanted to avoid really contemporary conflicts

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:36.780
for two reasons.

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:40.220
One is things could change really quickly.

02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.260
I didn't want the book to be dated.

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.260
I wanted this to be a book that had longevity

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:47.620
and that would be relevant still in 10 years or 20 years,

02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:50.700
maybe before someone writes a better one or an update.

02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:52.420
Or before the human civilization ends.

02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:53.460
Exactly.

02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:55.140
And circumstances can change really quickly.

02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:56.940
So I wanted it to be enduring

02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:59.300
and meant partly just avoiding changing things

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:01.500
and avoiding these controversial ones.

02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:02.940
But of course I think about them.

02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:04.660
And so like a lot of my time,

02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:07.020
I decided actually last year to teach a class

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:09.100
where I take all these contemporary conflicts

02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.460
that I wasn't working on the book

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.620
and where I wasn't really an expert,

02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.740
whether it's India-Pakistan, China-Taiwan,

02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:19.660
Israel-Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars,

02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.620
and a few others.

02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:24.540
And then teach a class on them with students

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:25.380
and we'd work through it.

02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.940
We'd read the book and then we'd say,

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:28.180
all right, none of us are experts,

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:30.220
how do we make sense of these places?

02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.140
And we focused in the Israel-Palestine case

02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.980
of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent

02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:36.420
and then spend a little bit of time

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:39.820
on what the prospects are for something

02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:41.340
that's more enduring.

02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.660
It's hard to know that stuff now.

02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.140
I mean, it's easier to do the full analysis

02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:48.380
when looking back, when it's over.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.380
Well, Israel is in like a tough place.

02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.660
They have this attachment to being part of the West.

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:54.460
They have this attachment to liberal ideals.

02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.660
They have an attachment to democracy

02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:58.900
and they have an attachment to a Jewish state.

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.420
And those things are not so easily compatible

02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:09.380
because to recognize the rights of non-Jewish citizens

02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:16.380
or to have a one state solution to the current conflict

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:21.620
undermines the long-term ability to have a Jewish state.

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:26.740
And to do anything else and to deny that

02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:32.780
denies their liberal democratic ideals

02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:39.220
and that's a really hard contest of priorities to sort out.

02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:43.340
Yeah, it's complicated.

02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.340
Of course, everything you just said

02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:46.380
probably has multiple perspectives on it

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:49.620
from other people that would phrase all the same things

02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.460
but using different words.

02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.460
Well, I try to analyze these things

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.860
in like a dispassionate way.

02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.740
But unfortunately, just having been enough conversations,

02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:02.260
even your dispassionate description would be seen

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:06.300
as one that's already picked aside.

02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.780
And I'll say this because there's holding these ideals.

02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.060
I'll give you another example.

02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.940
United States also has ideals of freedom

02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.060
and other like human rights.

02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:22.220
So it has those ideals

02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:24.740
and it also sees itself as a superpower

02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.420
and as a deployer of those,

02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:30.220
enforcer of those ideas in the world.

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.860
And so the kind of actions,

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.460
from a perspective of a lot of people in that world,

02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:36.780
from children, they get to see drones

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:38.460
drop bombs on their house

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:42.700
where their father is now, mother are dead.

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:45.340
They have a very different view of this.

02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:47.180
Well, you're beginning to see why I didn't.

02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:49.820
I decided I wanted to write about those things

02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:50.780
and think about those things

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:54.340
but I wanted this book to do something different

02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:57.420
and I didn't want it to fall along one of these polarities.

02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:58.300
On a personal level,

02:13:58.300 --> 02:13:59.820
because I think I'm kind of a liberal,

02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:02.860
democratic person at heart,

02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:05.300
my sympathies in that sense lie in many ways

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.500
with the Palestinians despite the way I,

02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:10.660
I mean, just the fact that people are,

02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:15.660
they're not represented and they got a very raw,

02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:17.540
real politic kind of deal.

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.980
Like most people in history have gotten like this raw,

02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:21.900
real politic kind of deal in their past, right?

02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.740
Where somebody took something from you.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:24.980
It's a good summary of history by the way.

02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:27.860
That's it, history is just full of raw deals.

02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:28.860
For regular people.

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:33.860
Right, and both sides are in a principled way

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:37.860
refusing to make the compromise.

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.460
And that's not like a both sides are right kind of argument.

02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:41.940
I'm just sort of saying,

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:44.020
I just think it's a factual statement

02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:46.580
that like neither one wants to compromise

02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:48.420
on certain principles.

02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:51.700
And they're both, they both can construct

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.260
and in some ways have very reasonable,

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.180
I don't want to have self justifications

02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:57.020
for those principles.

02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.740
And that's why I'm not very hopeful

02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:02.820
is I don't see a way and to,

02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.580
for them to resolve those things.

02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:06.700
Speaking of compromise and war,

02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:09.260
let me ask you about one last one,

02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.180
which may be in the future.

02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:13.100
China and the United States.

02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:14.380
Yeah.

02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:18.420
How do we avoid an all out hot war

02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:22.340
with this other superpower in the next decade,

02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.180
50 years, a hundred years,

02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:27.780
because sometimes when it's quiet at night,

02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:29.780
I can hear in the long distance,

02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:31.420
the drums of war beating.

02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:32.260
Yeah.

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.100
You know, in the second part of the book,

02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:36.220
I talk about what I think have been like these persistent,

02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:37.060
like paths to peace.

02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:39.060
And one of them is increasing interdependence

02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:40.260
and interrelationships.

02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.660
And another one is more checks and balances on power.

02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:45.620
I think there's more,

02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.860
but those are two that are really fundamental here

02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:50.300
because I think those two things

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.940
reduce the incentives for war in two ways.

02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:54.300
One is like, remember when we were talking about

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:57.060
this really simple strategic game where,

02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:00.620
whether I'm Russian, Ukraine or whatever, any two rivals,

02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:03.820
I want more of the pie than you get

02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:08.380
and the costs of war are deterrents,

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:11.940
but only the costs of war that I feel, right?

02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:12.780
I don't care.

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:15.780
I do not care about the costs of war to your side,

02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:16.620
my rivals.

02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:17.440
I'm not even thinking of that.

02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.460
That's just worth zero to me.

02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.660
I just don't care in that simple game.

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:25.340
Now, in reality, many groups do care about the wellbeing

02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:27.340
of the other group, at least a little bit, right?

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.140
We're in some sense to the degree we, first of all,

02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:31.980
if our interests are intertwined,

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:33.740
like our economies are intertwined,

02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:39.620
that's not a surefire way for peace.

02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:40.940
And we shouldn't get complacent

02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:42.460
because we have a globally integrated world,

02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:44.300
but that's gonna be a disincentive.

02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:45.540
And if we're socially entwined

02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:47.220
because we have great social relationships

02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.020
and linkages and family or we're intermarriage

02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.900
or whatever, all these things will help.

02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:56.020
And then if we're ideologically intertwined,

02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.460
maybe we share notions of liberty

02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:00.740
or maybe we just share a common notion of humanity.

02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:02.700
So I think the fact that we're more integrated

02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:05.520
than we've ever been on all three fronts in the world,

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.240
but with China is providing some insulation, which is good.

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.100
So I would be more worried

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:14.700
if we started to shed some of that insulation,

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:17.620
which I think has been happening a little bit.

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:19.740
U.S. economic nationalism,

02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:24.380
whatever could be the fallout of these sanctions

02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:26.860
or a closer Chinese alliance with Russia,

02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:28.220
all those things could happen.

02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:29.880
Those would make me more worried

02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:31.540
because I think we've got a lot of cushion

02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.320
that comes from all of this economic,

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.460
social, cultural interdependence.

02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:39.140
Yeah, the social one with the internet is a big one.

02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:41.220
So basically make friends

02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:43.860
with the people from different nations,

02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:46.900
fall in love, or you don't have to fall in love,

02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:50.340
you just have lots of sex with people from different nations,

02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.500
but also fall in love.

02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.740
The thing that also comforts me about China

02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:57.100
is that China's not as centralized

02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:00.700
or as personalized a regime as Russia, for example,

02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:03.020
and neither one of them is as centralized or personalized

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:07.420
as some tin pot, like purely personalized dictatorship,

02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:09.260
like you get in some countries.

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:13.380
The fact that China, the power is much more widely shared,

02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:17.420
is a big insulation, I think, against this war,

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:18.800
well, future war.

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:26.740
The attempts by Xi Jinping to personalize power over time

02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:29.060
and to make China a more centralized

02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:30.800
and personal ruled place,

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:34.420
which he's successfully moved in that direction,

02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:35.780
also worries me.

02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:39.000
So anything that moves China in the other direction,

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.620
not necessarily being democratic,

02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:42.320
but just like a wider and wider group

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.040
of people holding power,

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:46.560
like all of the business leaders

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:47.600
and all the things that have been happening

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:50.160
over the last few centuries have actually widened power.

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:52.120
But anything that's moving in the other direction

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.280
does worry me,

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:56.120
because it's gonna accentuate all these five risks.

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:58.920
I am worried about a little bit of the demonization.

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:03.360
So one of the things I see with China

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.440
as a problem for Americans,

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:08.440
maybe I'm projecting, maybe it's just my own problem,

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.160
but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap

02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:13.640
than there is with other superpowers throughout history,

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.920
where it's almost like this own world happening in China,

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:19.320
it's own world in the United States,

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.280
and there's this gap of total cultural understanding.

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:23.120
It's not that,

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:28.480
we're not competing superpowers.

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:30.600
They're almost like doing their own thing.

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:31.760
There's that feeling,

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.400
and I think that means there's a lack of understanding

02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.480
of culture of people,

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.080
and we need to kind of bridge that understanding.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.920
I mean, the language barrier,

02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:41.120
but also cultural understanding,

02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.680
making movies that use both,

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.360
and explore both cultures and all that kind of stuff,

02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.080
to where it's okay to compete.

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:56.080
Like Rocky, where Rocky Balboa fought the Russian.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.680
In fact, historically inaccurate,

02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:00.280
because obviously the Russian would win,

02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:02.480
but we have to, I'm just kidding,

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.880
as a Philly person, I was of course rooting for Rocky.

02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:07.960
But the thing is, those two superpowers are in the movies.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.600
China is like its own out there thing.

02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.120
We need more Rocky Seven.

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.080
I do think there's a certain inscrutability

02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:17.160
to the politics there,

02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.000
and an insularity to the politics,

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.920
such that it's harder for Westerners,

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.400
even if they know, even just to learn about it

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:24.680
and understand what's going on.

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.120
I think that's a problem, and vice versa.

02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:29.760
So I think that's true.

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:31.680
But at the same time,

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.920
we could point to all sorts of things

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.840
on the other side of the ledger,

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:37.000
like the massive amounts of Chinese immigration

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.160
to the United States,

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.560
and the massive number of people who are now,

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.960
like how many, so many more Americans,

02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:44.600
business people, politicians,

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:47.400
understand so much more about China now

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:50.000
than they did 34 years ago, because we're so intertwined.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.560
So I don't know where it balances out.

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:54.720
I think it balances out on better understanding

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:56.160
than ever before.

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:59.480
But you're right, there was like a big gulf there

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.120
that we haven't totally bridged.

02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:04.240
Yeah, and like I said,

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:08.760
lots of inter-Chinese in the United States,

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.160
sexual intercourse, no, and love and marriage

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:13.760
and all that kind of social cohesion.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:16.720
So once again, returning to love,

02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.040
I read in your acknowledgement,

02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.160
and as you mentioned earlier,

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:23.400
the acknowledgement reads, quote,

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:25.920
I dedicate this book to a slow

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:29.280
and now defunct internet cafe in Nairobi

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:31.920
because it set me on the path to meet

02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:35.760
and work with, and most importantly,

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:38.920
marry Jenny Anon.

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:39.760
Genie Anon.

02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:41.320
Genie, Genie Anon.

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.640
There's a lot of beautiful letters

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:44.960
in this beautiful name.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.120
This book have been impossible without her

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.000
and that chance encounter.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.720
What's, okay, tell me, tell me, Chris,

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:54.840
how you fell in love

02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:57.480
and how that changed the direction of your life.

02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:00.240
I was in that internet cafe, I think it was 2004.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.160
I was, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.160
I thought I might, I thought,

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.560
I was a good development economist

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:09.320
and I cared about growth, economic growth,

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:11.960
and I thought firm, like industrialization

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:14.520
is like the solution to poverty in Africa,

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:17.200
which is I think still true,

02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.280
and therefore I need to go study firms

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:21.200
and industry in Africa.

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:23.520
And so I went and one of the most dynamic place

02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:25.440
for firms and industry at the time,

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.800
still to some extent now is Kenya

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:29.880
and all these firms are in Nairobi.

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:32.800
And so I went and I got a job with the World Bank

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.640
who's running, they were running a firm survey

02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:36.640
and I convinced them to like let me help run

02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.360
the firm survey.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.760
And so now I'm in Nairobi and I'm wearing my suit

02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:43.880
and with the World Bank for the summer

02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:48.720
and my laptop gets stolen by two enterprising con artists,

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.200
very charming.

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.280
And so I find myself in an internet cafe.

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:54.360
With no laptop.

02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:57.160
With no laptop and just, you know,

02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:59.440
Kenya didn't, exactly, Kenya didn't get connected

02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:03.960
to the sort of the big internet cables

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:05.600
until maybe 10 years later.

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.720
And so it was just glacially slow.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:08.840
So it would take 10 minutes for every email to load.

02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:10.720
And so there's this whole customer norm

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:14.400
if you just chat to the next person beside you,

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:17.200
all the time, it was true all over anywhere

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:18.960
I'd worked on the continent.

02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:22.840
And so I strategically sat next to the attractive looking

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:26.440
woman that when I came in and it turned out

02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:29.200
she was a psychologist and a PhD student

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:30.960
but she was a humanitarian worker

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:33.680
and she'd been working in South Sudan and Northern Uganda

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:36.320
and this kids affected by this war.

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:38.480
All these kids who were being conscripted

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:40.320
were coming back because they're all running away

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.360
after a day or 10 years and needed help

02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:45.280
or to get back into school.

02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:47.920
She was working on things like that.

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:50.520
And I think she talked to me in spite of the fact

02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:51.640
that I was wearing a suit,

02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:53.160
maybe because I knew a little bit about the war

02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:55.040
which most people didn't, most people were totally ignorant.

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.640
And then we had a fling for that week.

02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:00.280
And then we didn't really,

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.760
actually then we met up a little short while later

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:04.960
and then it was kind of, then we kind of drifted apart.

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:06.160
She was studying in Indiana

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:09.240
and spending a lot of time in Uganda.

02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:14.560
And then one day I was chatting with someone I knew

02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:17.680
who worked on this young professor who was a friend of mine

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:20.600
but, and I said, oh, you know, you work on similar issues.

02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:22.480
You should meet this woman.

02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:24.520
I talked to the cause she, like you guys would have like,

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.520
you know, professional research interests overlap.

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:29.760
There's so few sort of people looking at armed groups

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.280
in African civil wars, at least at the time.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.720
And he said, wow, that's a fascinating research question.

02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:37.640
And I thought to my, and I walked out of the building

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.800
and I thought, it's a fascinating research question.

02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.240
And I phoned Jeannie and I said, remember me

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:45.760
and, you know, tell me more.

02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:46.880
I was just talking to someone about this.

02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:47.720
Tell me more.

02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:49.600
Like I started asking her more questions

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:52.440
but we ended up talking for two or three hours.

02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:54.520
And over the course of those three hours,

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.520
we hatched a very ambitious kind of crazy like plan.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:06.240
Basically what it was, we were gonna like find the names

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.320
and all the kids were born like 20 or 30 years ago

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:12.720
in the region and we were gonna track a thousand of them.

02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:13.920
We were gonna randomly sample them

02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.800
and then we were gonna find them today

02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:16.680
and we were gonna track them.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:19.200
And then we were gonna use like some variation

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.280
and exposure to violence and where the rebel group was

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:23.680
to actually like show what happens to people

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:25.400
when they're exposed to violence and conscription.

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.720
We were gonna like tell, you know,

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:28.080
psychologically, economically,

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.880
we're gonna like answer questions

02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:31.920
and that which would help you design better programs, right?

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:36.160
And so we hatched this plan, which is totally cockamamie.

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:38.280
So cockamamie that when I pulled

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:41.840
my previous dissertation proposal from my committee

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:44.160
like the next week and gave them a new one,

02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:48.080
they unanimously met without me

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.400
to decide that this was totally bonkers

02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:53.320
and to advise me not to go.

02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:55.200
And they coordinated to read my old proposal

02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.560
so that when I showed up for my defense,

02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:58.040
they said, you're actually think you're defending

02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:00.040
but we're actually, we want you to only talk

02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.360
about this other thing that you were gonna do

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.120
because this is like, you should not go.

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:05.400
Oh, wow.

02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:07.160
And I mean, it is incredibly ambitious.

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:08.280
Super interesting though.

02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:10.320
It actually worked exactly according to plans.

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:12.440
The first and last time in my entire career.

02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.960
You actually pulled off an ambition

02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:15.800
like a gigantically crazy ambition.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:17.760
Well, all of my work, that's my shtick.

02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:20.000
Like my day-to-day research job is not writing books

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:20.840
about why we fight.

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:23.800
My thing is like, I go, I collect data

02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:26.520
on things that nobody else thought you could collect data on.

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.120
And so I always do pull it off,

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:31.280
but it never turns out like I thought it was going to.

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:33.200
Like it's always, there's so many twists and turns

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:36.000
and it always goes sideways in an interesting way

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.160
and it works, but it's all,

02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:39.000
but this one actually we pulled off

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000
in spite of ourselves and as planned.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.040
And so Ted Miguel, who I wrote that paper with

02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.040
was actually the one person of my advisors was like,

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.880
well, you know what, he was sympathetic to this.

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.560
He was like, eh, why don't you just go for a couple months

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.160
and like check it out and then come back

02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:56.360
and work on the other thing.

02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:58.800
And that's, and so I followed Jeannie there and went there.

02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.120
And then, but, and I don't know, what's this?

02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.880
I always remember, you know, this movie Speed,

02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.040
the Keanu Reeves and Sandra, whatever these people are.

02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:10.560
And they have this relationship

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.880
in these intense circumstances.

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:13.920
And they like, well, and I think at the end of the movie,

02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.480
they're sort of like, this will never work

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:16.520
because these relationships

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:18.040
in intense circumstances never matter,

02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:19.320
which is what we assumed.

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.800
And that turned out not to be true.

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.680
So we've been married 15 years and we have two kids and.

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:28.080
Yeah, and that's when you fell in love with psychology

02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.280
and learned to appreciate the power of psychology.

02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.920
Exactly, so that's the psychology in the book as well.

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:34.680
Because I, and so we ended up,

02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:36.560
for most of our work for the first five or 10 years

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:38.080
was together actually.

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:40.920
What's the hardest piece of data

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:45.280
that you've been chasing, that you've chased in your life?

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:47.120
Like, what are some interesting things?

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.680
Because you mentioned like one of the things

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:51.800
you kind of want to go somewhere in the world

02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.680
and find evidence and data for things

02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:57.320
that people just haven't really looked to get,

02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.960
gain an understanding of human nature,

02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.960
maybe from an economics perspective.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.960
What's, what kind of stuff, either in your past

02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.760
or in your future, you've been thinking about?

02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:09.280
Well, I mean, the hardest, there's hard in two cents.

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:12.600
The hardest emotionally was interviewing all those kids

02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:13.440
in Northern Uganda.

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.960
It was just like a gut punch every day

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:19.000
and just hearing the stories.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Like that was the hardest, but it wasn't hard

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.840
because it was, you could, the kids were everywhere

02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.200
and everybody would talk to you about it

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:26.040
and they could talk about it.

02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:30.520
You could, no one had gone and interviewed kids

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:31.680
that had gone through war in the middle

02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.520
of an active war zone.

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.280
Nobody was going to displace, all the things we did,

02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:35.440
no one had done that before.

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.560
So now lots of people do it.

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:40.560
Could you actually speak to their stories?

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.800
What's like the shape of their suffering?

02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:49.640
What were common themes?

02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.560
What, how did those stories change you?

02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:54.880
I remember I said you could,

02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:58.800
like your dispassion itself and your passionate self.

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:01.560
I think I had to learn to create the dispassion itself.

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:02.880
I mean, we all have that capacity

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.400
when we analyze something that's far away

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:07.240
and happens to people different than us, but you have to,

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:12.320
I think I discovered and developed an ability

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:15.480
to like put those aside in order to be able to study this.

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:19.000
So you get maybe harder in a way

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.800
that you have to be guard against.

02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:24.200
So you have to try to remember to put your human head on.

02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:25.040
It's really horrible.

02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:26.480
Like if I want to conscript you

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:29.640
and I don't want you to run away,

02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:30.680
then I want to make you think

02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:32.720
you can never go back to your village.

02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:35.400
And the best way for me to do that

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:37.760
is to make you, force you to do something

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:40.440
really, really, really, really horrible

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.400
that you almost incredibly believe

02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:44.160
you can never really go back.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:46.800
And it might be like killing a loved one.

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.560
And so, and just having,

02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:51.360
hearing people tell you that story

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.400
in all of the different shapes and forms.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.280
To a point, what was horrible about it

02:29:56.280 --> 02:29:57.960
is they did this so routinely

02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:00.680
that you'd be sitting there in an interview with somebody

02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:02.200
and they'd be telling you the story

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:03.720
and it's like the most horrible thing

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:06.200
that could happen to you or anyone else.

02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:08.880
And, but there's some voice in the back of your mind saying,

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:13.640
okay, we really need to get to the other thing.

02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:15.320
We know that, I know how this goes.

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:16.880
Like I've heard, there's this thing like,

02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:19.440
okay, okay, I'm not learning anything new here.

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:22.800
Like there's some part, deep, evil, terrible part of you

02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:24.600
that's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:26.120
But let's get onto the other thing.

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:27.400
But I know I have to go through this.

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:28.880
But every day you have to go through that

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:29.720
to get to the,

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:30.960
because you're trying to actually understand

02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:31.800
how to help people.

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:34.080
You're trying to understand how that trauma has manifested,

02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:34.920
how they either,

02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:36.240
some people get stronger as a result of that.

02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:37.640
Some people get weaker.

02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:39.440
And if you want to know how to help people,

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:41.080
then you need to get to that.

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:42.200
I wasn't trying to get to something

02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:43.400
for my selfish purposes really.

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:44.240
I was trying to figure out,

02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:46.680
okay, we need to know what your symptoms are now.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:49.520
It's such a dark thing about us.

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:51.820
So if you're surrounded by trauma,

02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.600
God, that voice in the back of your head

02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:56.440
that you just go,

02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:58.720
yeah, I know exactly how this conversation goes.

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:02.640
Let's skip ahead to the solutions, to the next.

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:03.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:04.760
So that was, yeah,

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.720
so that was because you then have to deal with yourself.

02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:09.160
So it's very helpful if you like come home every night

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.000
to someone who's A, gone through the same thing,

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.080
and B, is a professional,

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:15.560
and very, very, very, very good counseling psychologist.

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:20.120
The hardest thing,

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:23.360
I mean, the organized crime stuff has been the hardest.

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.160
Just figuring out how to get that information.

02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:27.760
It took us years of just trial and error,

02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:31.520
mostly error of like just how to get people to talk to us,

02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:35.160
or how to collect data in a way that's safe for me,

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.000
and safe for my team,

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.800
and safe for people to answer a survey.

02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:42.200
Like how do you get the information

02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:46.240
on what gangs are doing in the community,

02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:48.120
or how it's hurting or helping people?

02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.280
Like you've got to run surveys,

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.560
and you've got to talk to gang members,

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:53.680
all these things, and nobody knows how to do that.

02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:56.440
And so we had to sort of really slowly, not nobody,

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.280
there's a few other,

02:31:57.280 --> 02:31:59.160
I think there's other academics like me who are doing this,

02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:01.360
but it's a pretty small group

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:04.800
that's trying to collect systematic data.

02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:06.760
And then there's a slightly bigger

02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:08.200
and much more experienced group

02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:10.680
that's been talking to different armed groups.

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:12.440
But every time you go to a new city,

02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:14.120
and there weren't that many people working on this

02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:15.760
in Medellin, there were a few,

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:17.160
you have to like discover a new.

02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:20.560
Like it's really gonna be unique to that city and place.

02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:23.280
So there's not like a website

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.560
for each of the 17 mafia groups.

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:27.640
There's no Facebook group that can do that.

02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:30.680
We've created like our own, we have a private Wiki

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:32.200
where we document everything,

02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:33.480
and it's a collaborative enterprise

02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.800
between lots of researchers and journalists and things.

02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:36.960
So they now have, they can't see,

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:39.040
you can't go online and see this unless you.

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:40.320
That's individual researchers.

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:43.000
So it's not, I mean, they're hiding by design.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.960
Some of them have Facebook pages and things of this nature.

02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.920
So they do have public profiles a little bit,

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:50.400
but not so explicitly.

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:51.640
No, so they're clandestine.

02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:52.480
Here's an example.

02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:54.400
So one of the things that's really endemic in Medellin,

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.000
it's true in a lot of cities,

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.360
it's true in American prisons,

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:00.200
is gangs govern everybody's everyday life.

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:03.240
So if you have a, in an American prison,

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.680
particularly Illinois or California, Texas,

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:09.600
is another big one, but also in a city in Medellin,

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:13.200
if you have a problem, a debt to collect

02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:15.120
or dispute with a neighbor or something,

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.160
you could go to the government, and they do,

02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:18.000
and they can help you solve it.

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:21.160
Or you can go to the police or you can go to the gang.

02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:23.760
And so, and that's like a really everyday phenomenon.

02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:24.840
But then there's a question of like,

02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:28.040
how do you actually figure out how,

02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:29.480
what services they're offering

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:30.840
and how much they pay for them?

02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.360
And do you actually like those services?

02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:34.360
And how do you comparison shop

02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:37.080
between the police and the gang?

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:40.520
And what would get you to go from the gang to the police?

02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.560
And then how's the gang strategically gonna respond to that?

02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:46.040
And what was the impact of previous policies

02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:48.600
to like make state governing better?

02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:49.800
And how did the gangs react?

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:51.760
And so that's, we had to sort of figure that out.

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.760
And that was, so that was just hard in a different way.

02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:55.680
But I don't do the most,

02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:58.240
the mostly punishing stuff I couldn't do any longer.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:00.880
So that's much easier in that sense.

02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:04.720
By the way, on, you know, Jorge Ochoa,

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:06.400
some of these folks are out of prison.

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.240
Yeah.

02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:09.080
Have you gotten a chance to talk to them?

02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:11.000
One of my collaborators on this,

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
a guy named Gustavo Duncan, who's,

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:16.400
who spent a lot of time interviewing paramilitaries

02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:17.240
has written a book.

02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:20.280
He's talked to more of these people than I have.

02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:22.720
I haven't talked to those.

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.520
We haven't been talking to them about this stuff,

02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:27.840
but also they were there in a different era.

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.960
Yeah, so it doesn't.

02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.960
The system was totally different.

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:30.960
That's super interesting.

02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:31.800
Maybe one day we'll do that.

02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:32.920
Almost like history.

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.320
Yeah, that was 30 years ago.

02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:36.160
Yeah.

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:38.800
And the system, I mean, La Oficina,

02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.320
Pablo Escobar created La Oficina.

02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.000
He integrated all these 17 razones

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.080
and all these street gangs are the fragmented former remnants

02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.800
of his more unified empire,

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.600
which he gave the name La Oficina.

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:53.480
I mean, I think, you know, it's a little bit apocryphal,

02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:56.440
but the idea is that, you know, I think he said,

02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:58.640
every doctor has an office, so should we.

02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:01.640
I still can't imagine.

02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:03.760
I still love that there's parallels

02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:06.120
between these mafia groups

02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:09.600
and the United Nations Security Council.

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:10.640
This is just wonderful.

02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:13.400
It's so, so, so deeply human.

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:15.120
Let me ask you about yourself.

02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:17.760
So you've been thinking about war here,

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.480
in part dispassionately, just analyze war

02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.240
and try to understand the path for peace,

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:26.080
but you as a single individual

02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:30.200
that's going to die one day,

02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:33.800
maybe talking to the people

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:35.040
that have gone through suffering,

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.680
what do you think about your immortality?

02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.880
How has your view of your own finiteness changed

02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:45.120
having thought about war?

02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:46.600
Maybe the reason I can do this work

02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.840
is because I don't think about it a lot.

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:51.920
Your own mortality or even like mortality.

02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:55.920
Yeah, I mean, well, I have to think about death a lot, so.

02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:58.600
But there's a way to think about death,

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:01.280
like numbers in a calculation

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.880
when you're doing geopolitical negotiations,

02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:09.040
and then there's like a dying child or a dying mother.

02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:12.560
Yeah, I guess I know I'm in a place where there's risk,

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.560
and so I think a lot about minimizing any risks,

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.480
such that I think about mortality enough

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:26.040
that I just, because I'm kind of an anxious person,

02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:28.440
like I'm kind of a worry ward, like in a way,

02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:34.000
and so I'm really obsessive about making sure

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.880
anything that I do is low risk, you know.

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:39.200
So that gives you something to focus on,

02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.000
a number is the risk, and you're trying to minimize it.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.960
And yet there's still the existential dread.

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:49.320
Your risk minimization doesn't matter.

02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:52.800
Yeah, I've never been in a life-threatening situation.

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:57.440
Yeah, that's somebody who, you know what you sound like?

02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.400
That's Alex Honnold that does the free climbing.

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.160
He doesn't see that as like.

02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.360
Well, that's, but no, but I, well, that sounds

02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:06.080
exactly the same, because you just said

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:08.160
I've never done anything as dangerous

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:10.200
as those people riding a scooter.

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.160
I've actually been a rock climber for like 25 years

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.000
with a long break in the between, but I'm the same way.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.400
Actually, rock climbing is an extremely safe sport

02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.080
if you're very careful.

02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:23.480
But he's, free climbing is the opposite of that.

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:26.960
But I mean, if you've got a rope that's attached to you

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.880
that goes up is like attached to 18 trees

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:32.720
and comes back down, you're fine.

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.880
Like this, you know, and you wear a helmet.

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:35.760
You're good.

02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:36.800
You're totally fine.

02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:38.440
Yeah, but this is super safe too,

02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:39.760
because don't.

02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:40.960
Free climbing, no, no, no.

02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.960
Free climbing is totally.

02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.280
I mean, because you're only gonna put your hands

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:49.400
and feet on sturdy rock and then you know the path and.

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.440
No, no, no, no, no, totally.

02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.240
I know, I have some friends in college,

02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:58.040
I've known people who do some of these totally wacky

02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:00.000
extreme sports and have paid the price.

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:03.840
So I think it's totally, totally different.

02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:04.680
I think.

02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:07.800
So even in that, by the way.

02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:09.200
I can't even watch those movies

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.400
because those freak me out too much

02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:11.560
because it's just too risky.

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:13.640
Like I can't, I don't even, yeah.

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.520
So those things, I've never watched like free solo

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:18.840
or anything, there's just too much.

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:21.080
Still not as dangerous as riding a scooter in Austin.

02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:21.920
Yeah, totally.

02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:23.160
I'm not gonna let that go.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.720
So, but even in that, it's just risk minimization

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:30.840
in the work that you do versus the sort of

02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:35.040
philosophical existentialist view of your mortality.

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.840
You know, this thing just ends.

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.200
Like what the hell is that about?

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:42.400
Yeah, I have this amazing capacity not to think about it,

02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:44.280
which might just be a self-defense mechanism.

02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:45.480
You know, my father-in-law,

02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:48.400
Jeannie's father is a evangelical pastor actually.

02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:49.640
He's now retired, but.

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:53.320
And this he would, we would talk about

02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:54.360
when we were getting married,

02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:55.800
they weren't terribly thrilled

02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.800
that she was marrying a agnostic or atheist or something.

02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.840
We love each other very much, it's fine now,

02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:06.080
but I only started discussing this and some of the,

02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:07.720
because that was one of his questions for me.

02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:09.760
Like, well, how can you possibly believe

02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:11.640
that there's nothing afterwards?

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:14.840
Because that's just like too horrible to imagine.

02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:17.120
And we really never saw eye to eye on this.

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.480
And my view was like, listen, like,

02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.680
I believe what I, like, I can't convince myself otherwise.

02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:25.320
Anything else seems completely implausible to me.

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:27.440
And for some reason, I can't understand.

02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:28.440
I'm at peace with that.

02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:31.680
Like it's never bothered me that one day it's over.

02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:35.720
And the fact that people have angst about that

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:39.520
and that they would seek answers makes total sense to me.

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:43.280
And I can't explain why that doesn't consume me

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.520
or doesn't bother me.

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:49.360
But, and yet you are at peace.

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:52.040
Maybe if I was worried, but if I was more worried about it,

02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:54.040
maybe I wouldn't be able to do, I don't know.

02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:54.880
I don't know.

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:55.800
But then again, I don't take the risk.

02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:57.160
I'm still like, I don't know.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.680
But I minimize all sorts of risks.

02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:03.680
I'm like, I, yeah, I minimize, you know,

02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:06.480
I try to optimize like groceries in the fridge too.

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:07.880
Like, I mean, I put-

02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.320
That's a very economist way to live, I would say.

02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:12.800
That's probably why you're good at it.

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:13.640
That might be true.

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:15.760
That might be, there's some selection in economics

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:17.480
of these cold calculators.

02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:19.240
Chicken or the egg, we'll never know.

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:21.320
Do you have advice for young people

02:40:21.320 --> 02:40:24.720
that want to do as ambitious, as crazy,

02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.400
as amazing of work as you have done in life?

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.600
So somebody who's in high school, in college,

02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:34.680
either career advice on what to choose,

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:38.200
how to execute on it, or just life advice,

02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:40.720
how to meet some random stranger in,

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:42.320
or maybe a dating advice, how to-

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:44.440
Well, that part's easier.

02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.760
You have to fly coach and go to the internet cafes.

02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:49.840
You can't like, all the development workers

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:51.160
that I know that fly business class,

02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:53.320
I'm like, you'll never meet somebody.

02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:56.320
No, the, you know, I actually spend a lot of time

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.760
writing advice on my blog,

02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:59.880
and I've got like pages and pages of advice.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:02.120
And one of the reasons is cause I never got that,

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:04.000
like when I grew up, I went to like a really good

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.040
state school in Canada called Waterloo.

02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:09.480
I loved it, but people didn't go on the trajectory

02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:10.760
that I went on from there.

02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.800
And I had some good advisors there,

02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:15.240
but I never got the kind of advice I needed

02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:16.320
to like pursue this career.

02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:20.880
So I, it's very concentrated in elite colleges,

02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.600
I think sometimes, in elite high schools.

02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:24.440
So I tried to democratize that.

02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:27.160
That's like a, that was one reason I started the blog.

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:28.400
But a lot of that's really particular,

02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:30.080
cause I, every week, like I have students coming

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.680
in my office wanting to know how to do

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:32.680
international development work,

02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:34.400
and I just spend a lot of time giving them advice.

02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.280
And I think that's what a lot of the posts are about.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:37.760
Do you have any very specific questions?

02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:39.720
Like what, is it the country by country

02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:41.360
kind of specific questions, or what?

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:42.440
The thing that they're all trying to do

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:43.880
that I think is the right, I don't have to give them

02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:45.200
a really basic piece of advice,

02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:46.440
cause they're already doing it.

02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:48.480
Like they're trying to find a vocation.

02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:51.280
They're really interested, and what I mean by that

02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:53.600
is it's like a career where they find meaning,

02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.840
where the work is almost like superfluous,

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:59.400
because they just, they would do it for free.

02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.440
And they're passionate about,

02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.880
and they really find meaning in the work.

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:05.120
And then it becomes a little bit all consuming.

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:07.240
So scientists do that in their own way.

02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:09.200
I think international development, humanitarian workers,

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200
people who are doctors and nurses.

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.120
Like we all do our careers for other reasons, right?

02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.000
But they find like meaning in their career.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.720
And so the thing, so I don't have to tell them

02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:21.360
whatever you do, find meaning.

02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:24.400
And try to make it a vocation,

02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:25.720
something that you would do for free

02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:28.080
amongst all of these many, many, many options.

02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:30.800
That's what I would tell,

02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:32.760
but that's what I would tell high school students

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:35.320
and young people in college.

02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:39.960
Sometimes it's hard to find a thing and hold onto it.

02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:42.000
Well, that's the other thing, it took me a long time.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.920
So I actually started off as an accountant.

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:46.640
I was an accountant with Deloitte and Touche for a few years.

02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:47.880
So I did not.

02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:50.480
But that, did you wake up in the morning

02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:52.600
excited to be alive?

02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:53.440
I was miserable.

02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:55.480
I got, I found it by accident,

02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:56.800
which is another different story,

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:59.480
but I landed in this job in a degree

02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:01.560
where I studied accounting and I was miserable.

02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:03.480
I was totally miserable.

02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:06.160
And I hated it and I was becoming a miserable person.

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.640
And so I eventually just quit and I did something new,

02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:11.960
but that was still,

02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:14.000
but then I was working in the private sector

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:15.760
and I actually just needed trial and error.

02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:18.200
I actually had to try on like three or four or five careers

02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:20.320
before I found like this mixture of academia

02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:23.520
and activism and research and international development.

02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:24.360
And so-

02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.600
And what did you know that this was love

02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:29.200
when you found this kind of international development,

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:32.480
like the academic context too?

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.160
The key lesson was just trial and error,

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:36.880
which we all have to engage until it feels right.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:38.600
It's okay, all right, step one is trial and error,

02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:40.520
but until it feels right,

02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:44.280
it often feels right, but not perfect.

02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:46.160
Yeah, that's true.

02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:47.000
Right enough.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.800
I mean, I was really intellectually engaged.

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.120
Like I just loved learning about it.

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:52.680
I wanted to read more like it in some sense,

02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:54.920
like I was doing, I was an accountant,

02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:57.560
but I was reading about like world history

02:43:57.560 --> 02:43:58.400
and international development

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.760
in poor countries in my spare time, right?

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.160
And so it was like this hobby.

02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:04.360
And I was like, wait a second, I could actually do that.

02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:07.000
Like just, I could like research those things

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.320
and even write the next those books.

02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.560
And that's kind of what I did like 25 years later.

02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:12.680
That didn't occur to me right away.

02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:14.240
I didn't even know it was possible.

02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:15.480
This is the other thing people do.

02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:17.360
People do their nine to five job

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.280
and then they find meaning in everything else they do.

02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:20.840
They're volunteering and their family

02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:21.960
and their hobbies and things.

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.360
And that was my social milieu.

02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:25.800
And that's a great path too.

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:26.640
Like, I mean, that's,

02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:28.400
cause not all of us can just have a vocation

02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:29.480
or we don't find it, I think.

02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:31.640
And then you just circumscribe what you do in your work.

02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:35.120
And then you go find, and that's not entirely true

02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:37.560
cause everyone in my family does like their job

02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:39.280
and get a lot of fulfillment out of it.

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:44.280
But I think it's not, that's a different path in some ways.

02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:47.160
So it's good to take the leap and keep trying stuff.

02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:51.080
Even when you found like a little local minimum.

02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:55.360
Yeah, the hardest part was it got easy after a while

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:57.280
it was quitting.

02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:59.000
But now I take this to a lot of,

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.600
and one of the people, I think one of the reasons

02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:04.320
I discovered your podcast or maybe Tyler Cowen.

02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:05.280
Yeah, he's amazing.

02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:07.400
Tyler takes this approach to everything.

02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:09.520
He takes this approach to movie.

02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:12.760
He's like, walk into the movie theater after half an hour

02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:14.400
if you don't like the movie.

02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:15.320
And-

02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:17.320
You know what kind of person he probably is?

02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:19.000
I don't know, but now that you say this,

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.280
he's probably somebody that goes to a restaurant.

02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:24.840
If the meals is not good, I could see him just walking away

02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:26.600
like paying for it and just walking away.

02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:28.760
Yeah, and to go eat something better.

02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:30.040
That's exactly right.

02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:31.520
And I thought that was kind of crazy.

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:32.760
And I never, I was the person,

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:34.920
I would never just put a book down halfway

02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:38.400
and I would never stop watching a movie.

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:39.960
But then I, and I convinced my wife,

02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:43.000
we lived in New York when we were single initially

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.200
and sorry, when we were childless

02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:47.760
and we lived in New York,

02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.960
there's all this culture and theater and stuff.

02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:51.760
And I just said, let's go to more plays,

02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:54.160
but let's just walk out after the first act

02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:55.000
if we don't like it.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:56.360
And she thought that was a bit crazy.

02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:57.720
And I was like, no, no, no, here's the logic.

02:45:57.720 --> 02:45:59.040
Here's what Tyler says.

02:45:59.040 --> 02:45:59.880
And then we started doing it

02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:01.320
and it was so freeing and glorious.

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.280
We just go, we take so many more chances on things

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:05.960
and if we didn't like it,

02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:08.680
and we were walking out of stuff all the time.

02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.840
And so I think I did that without realizing it.

02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:15.320
That's how I like to, I just kept quitting my jobs

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:17.920
and trying to find something else at like some risk.

02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:20.520
Cause that's how wars start without the commitment.

02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:23.000
I go from time back to earlier.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.440
You need the commitment.

02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:26.280
Otherwise, no.

02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:27.840
That's a different kind of commitment problem.

02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:29.800
That's a different commitment problem.

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:31.720
The sum of it, I'm sure there's a balance

02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:33.120
cause I mean, the same thing is happening

02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200
dating and marriage and all those kinds of things.

02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:38.400
And there's some value to sticking it out

02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:41.800
cause some of the like, maybe,

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:43.280
don't leave after the first act

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:45.560
cause the good stuff might be coming.

02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:46.640
Yeah, that's a good point.

02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:47.840
I mean, that's yeah.

02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:50.080
Well, I don't know.

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:51.760
So when I met Jeannie,

02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:53.600
she was very wary of a relationship with me

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.240
because as I explained to her,

02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:57.720
I hadn't had a relationship longer

02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:00.120
than two or three months and 11 years.

02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:01.840
And so she thought this person's not serious.

02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:03.120
And what I said to her,

02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:03.960
and she tells the story.

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:04.800
This is how she tells the story.

02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:07.080
She says, I didn't believe him when he said that I just,

02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:07.920
after two or three months,

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:09.480
you kind of have a good sense

02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:10.760
of whether this is going somewhere.

02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:12.920
And I would just decide if it was over.

02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:13.760
And I walk away.

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:14.600
So I took this approach to dating

02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:17.160
like as soon as I thought it wasn't gonna go somewhere.

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.400
And then I decided with her that this was it.

02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:21.240
This was gonna work.

02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:23.040
And then I like, and then never.

02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:24.040
And she didn't believe.

02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:25.360
Now she believes me.

02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:29.120
I finally got to be right.

02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:31.040
Okay, so this is an incredible conversation.

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:35.920
Your work is so fascinating just in this big picture way,

02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:39.040
looking at human conflict and how we can achieve peace,

02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.480
especially in this time of the Ukraine war.

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:44.040
I really, really, really appreciate

02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:46.440
that you would calmly speak to me

02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:48.840
about some of these difficult ideas and explain them

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.440
and that you've sat down with me

02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:51.800
and have this amazing conversation.

02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:52.640
Thank you so much.

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:53.480
It was an amazing conversation.

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:54.640
Thank you.

02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:56.200
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.400
with Chris Blattman.

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.600

And now let me leave you with some well-known simple words

02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:06.320
from Albert Einstein.

02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:10.760
I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought,

02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:14.600
but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.

02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:18.360
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
