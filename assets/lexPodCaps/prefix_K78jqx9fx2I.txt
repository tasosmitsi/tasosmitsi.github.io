00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
The following is a conversation with Jamie Metzel,

00:02.420 --> 00:05.900
author specializing in topics of genetic engineering,

00:05.900 --> 00:09.220
biotechnology, and geopolitics.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.180
In the past two years, he has been outspoken

00:12.180 --> 00:15.260
about the need to investigate and keep an open mind

00:15.260 --> 00:18.220
about the origins of COVID-19.

00:18.220 --> 00:20.940
In particular, he has been keeping an extensive

00:20.940 --> 00:23.540
up-to-date collection of circumstantial evidence

00:23.540 --> 00:25.780
in support of what is colloquially known

00:25.780 --> 00:27.860
as lab leak hypothesis.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.600
That COVID-19 leaked in 2019

00:30.600 --> 00:33.600
from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.560
In part, I wanted to explore the idea

00:35.560 --> 00:37.920
in response to the thoughtful criticism

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
to parts of the Francis Collins episode.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.800
I will have more and more difficult conversations like this

00:43.800 --> 00:45.840
with people from all walks of life

00:45.840 --> 00:47.820
and with all kinds of ideas.

00:47.820 --> 00:50.200
I promise to do my best to keep an open mind

00:50.200 --> 00:52.300
and yet to ask hard questions

00:52.300 --> 00:54.240
while together searching for the beautiful

00:54.240 --> 00:57.620
and the inspiring in the mind of the other person.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.920
It's a hard line to walk gracefully,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.640
especially for someone like me,

01:01.640 --> 01:03.520
who's a bit of an awkward introvert

01:03.520 --> 01:06.480
with barely the grasp of the English language

01:06.480 --> 01:10.200
or any language, except maybe Python and C++.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.920
But I hope you stick around, be patient and empathetic

01:13.920 --> 01:17.300
and maybe learn something new together with me.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.500
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.640

01:21.640 --> 01:22.840
in the description.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.620
And now here's my conversation with Jamie Metzl.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.600
What is the probability in your mind

01:29.600 --> 01:32.120
that COVID-19 leaked from a lab?

01:32.120 --> 01:36.000
In your write-up, I believe you said 85%.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.760
I know it's just a percentage.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.880
We can't really be exact with these kinds of things,

01:39.880 --> 01:42.400
but it gives us a sense where your mind is,

01:42.400 --> 01:43.360
where your intuition is.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.920
So as it stands today,

01:44.920 --> 01:46.980
what would you say is that probability?

01:46.980 --> 01:49.000
I would stand by what I've been saying

01:49.000 --> 01:51.980
since really the middle of last year.

01:51.980 --> 01:55.640
It's more likely and not, in my opinion,

01:55.640 --> 01:58.820
that the pandemic stems from an accidental lab incident

01:58.820 --> 01:59.660
in Wuhan.

01:59.660 --> 02:04.220
Is it 90%, is it 65%, I mean, that's kind of arbitrary.

02:04.220 --> 02:08.100
But when I stack up all of the available evidence

02:08.100 --> 02:10.980
and all of it on both sides is circumstantial,

02:10.980 --> 02:14.420
it weighs very significantly toward a lab incident origin.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.900
So before we dive into the specifics at a high level,

02:17.900 --> 02:21.500
what types of evidence, what intuition,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.060
what ideas are leading you to have

02:24.080 --> 02:25.840
to that kind of estimate?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.040
Is it possible to kind of condense,

02:28.040 --> 02:32.200
when you look at the wall of evidence before you,

02:32.200 --> 02:33.960
where's your source,

02:33.960 --> 02:36.640
the strongest source of your intuition?

02:36.640 --> 02:39.240
And I would have to say it's just logic

02:39.240 --> 02:40.640
and deductive reasoning.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.480
So before I make the case for why I think

02:42.480 --> 02:45.000
it's most likely a lab incident origin,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.740
let's just say why it could be,

02:46.740 --> 02:49.440
and still could be, natural origin.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.880
All of this is natural origin in the sense

02:51.880 --> 02:56.880
that it's a bat virus backbone, horseshoe bat virus backbone.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.380
Okay, I'm gonna keep pausing you to find stuff.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.140
So maybe it's useful to say, what do we mean by lab leak?

03:04.140 --> 03:05.940
What do we mean by natural origin?

03:05.940 --> 03:07.820
What do we mean by virus backbone?

03:07.820 --> 03:09.820
Okay, great questions.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.440
So viruses come from somewhere.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.940
Viruses have been around for 3.5 billion years,

03:14.940 --> 03:17.840
and they've been around for such a long time

03:17.840 --> 03:20.700
because they are adaptive and they're growing

03:20.700 --> 03:23.620
and they're always changing and they're morphing.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.300
And that's why viruses are,

03:26.300 --> 03:29.500
I mean, they've been very successful and we are victims.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.700
Sometimes we're beneficiaries.

03:30.700 --> 03:34.780
We have viral DNA has morphed into our genomes,

03:34.780 --> 03:37.700
but now it's certainly in the case of COVID-19,

03:37.700 --> 03:42.700
we are victims of the success of viruses.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.800
And so when we talk about a backbone,

03:44.800 --> 03:49.800
so the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it has a history,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.600
and these viruses don't come out of whole cloth.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
There are viruses that morph.

03:54.600 --> 03:59.040
And so we know that at some period,

03:59.040 --> 04:01.960
maybe 20 years ago or whatever,

04:01.960 --> 04:06.960
the virus that is SARS-CoV-2 existed in horseshoe bats.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.100
It was a horseshoe bat virus and it evolved somewhere.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.600
And there are some people who say

04:15.600 --> 04:16.880
there's no evidence of this,

04:16.880 --> 04:18.720
but it's a plausible theory

04:18.720 --> 04:21.000
based on how things have happened in the past.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.020
Maybe that virus jumped from the horseshoe bat

04:25.020 --> 04:27.080
through some intermediate species.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.000
So it's like, let's say there's a bat

04:29.000 --> 04:31.740
and then it infects some other animal.

04:31.740 --> 04:36.160
Let's say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a civet cat,

04:36.160 --> 04:37.080
they're all pangolin,

04:37.080 --> 04:40.240
they're all sorts of animals that have been considered.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.840
And then that virus adapts into that new host

04:43.840 --> 04:45.920
and it changes and grows.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.140
And then according to the quote unquote

04:48.140 --> 04:49.560
natural origins hypothesis,

04:49.560 --> 04:53.200
it jumps from that animal into humans.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.160
And so what you could imagine,

04:55.160 --> 04:57.020
and some of the people who are making the case,

04:57.020 --> 04:57.920
all of the people actually,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.000
who are making the case for a natural origin of the virus,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.480
what they're saying is it went from bat

05:03.480 --> 05:05.800
to some intermediate species,

05:05.800 --> 05:08.440
and then from that intermediate species, most likely,

05:08.440 --> 05:10.960
there's some people who say it went directly bat to human,

05:10.960 --> 05:13.040
but through some intermediate species,

05:13.080 --> 05:16.640
and then humans interacted with that species,

05:16.640 --> 05:20.020
and then it jumped from that, whatever it is, to humans.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.760
And that's a very plausible theory,

05:21.760 --> 05:23.360
it's just that there's no evidence for it.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.760
And the nature of the interaction is,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.720
do most people kind of suggest it's at the wet markets?

05:29.720 --> 05:32.560
So the interaction of the humans with the animal

05:32.560 --> 05:35.340
is in the form of it's either a live animal

05:35.340 --> 05:36.680
that's being sold to be eaten

05:36.680 --> 05:39.680
or a recently live animal,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.960
but newly dead animal being sold to be eaten.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.120
That's certainly one very possible possibility,

05:46.120 --> 05:48.920
a possible possibility, I don't know if that's a word,

05:48.920 --> 05:52.040
but the people who believe in the wet market origin,

05:52.040 --> 05:52.980
that's what they're saying.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.440
So they had one of these animals,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.920
they were cutting it up, let's say, in a market,

05:57.920 --> 06:01.040
and maybe some of the blood got into somebody's,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.600
maybe had a cut on their hand,

06:02.600 --> 06:06.000
or maybe it was aerosolized, and so somebody breathed it,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.120
and then that virus found this new host,

06:09.120 --> 06:11.640
and that was the human host.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.960
But you could also have that happen in, let's say, a farm.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.080
So it's happened in the past,

06:17.080 --> 06:18.960
that let's say that there are farms,

06:18.960 --> 06:23.080
and because of human encroachment into wild spaces,

06:23.080 --> 06:26.160
we're pushing our farms and our animal farms

06:26.160 --> 06:28.760
further and further into what used to be

06:28.760 --> 06:30.920
the just natural habitats.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.020
And so it's happened in the past, for example,

06:33.020 --> 06:35.920
that there were bats roosting over pig pens,

06:35.920 --> 06:38.960
and the bat droppings went into the pig pens,

06:38.960 --> 06:43.360
the viruses in those droppings infected the pigs,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.000
and then the pigs infected the humans,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.560
and that's why it's a plausible theory.

06:48.560 --> 06:52.020
It's just that there's basically no evidence for it.

06:52.020 --> 06:55.220
If it was the case that SARS-CoV-2

06:55.220 --> 06:58.000
comes from this type of interaction,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.860
as in most of the at least recent past outbreaks,

07:01.860 --> 07:03.200
we'd see evidence of that.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.240
Viruses are messy,

07:05.240 --> 07:08.000
they're constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
and they're changing,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.800
and it's not that they're just ready for prime time,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.840
ready to infect humans on day one.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.680
Normally you can trace the viral evolution

07:17.680 --> 07:20.680
prior to the time when it infects humans.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.480
But for SARS-CoV-2,

07:22.480 --> 07:26.780
it just showed up on the scene ready to infect humans,

07:26.780 --> 07:30.620
and there's no history that anybody has found so far

07:30.620 --> 07:33.080
of that kind of a viral evolution.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.520
With the first SARS,

07:34.520 --> 07:38.080
you could track it by the genome sequencing

07:38.080 --> 07:39.920
that it was experimenting,

07:39.920 --> 07:44.160
and SARS-CoV-2 was very, very stable,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.560
and meaning it had already adapted to humans

07:47.560 --> 07:49.760
by the time it interacted with us.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.720
It's fully adapted.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.160
So with SARS, there's a rapid evolution

07:55.160 --> 07:58.520
when it like first kind of hooks onto a human.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.680
Yeah, because it's trying.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.440
Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.280
Yeah, no, it's true.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.400
It's like, oh, we're gonna try this.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.280
Oh, that didn't work.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.280
We'll try it exactly like a startup.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.440
And so we don't see that.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.920
And so there are some people who say,

08:11.920 --> 08:13.920
all right, well, one hypothesis

08:13.920 --> 08:17.360
is you have a totally isolated group of humans,

08:17.360 --> 08:18.920
maybe in southern China,

08:18.920 --> 08:22.920
which is more than 1,000 miles away from Wuhan,

08:22.920 --> 08:26.880
and maybe they're doing their animal farming

08:26.880 --> 08:29.600
right next to these areas

08:29.600 --> 08:31.840
where there are these horseshoe bats,

08:31.960 --> 08:34.600
and maybe in this totally isolated place

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
that no one's ever heard of,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.840
they're not connected to any other place,

08:37.840 --> 08:39.720
one person gets infected.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.400
And it doesn't spread to anybody else

08:42.400 --> 08:44.080
because they're so isolated.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.560
They're like, I don't know.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.120
I mean, I can't even imagine that this is the case.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.360
And then somebody gets in a car

08:50.360 --> 08:53.840
and drives all night more than 1,000 miles

08:53.840 --> 08:56.200
through crappy roads to get to Wuhan.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.560
Doesn't stop for anything.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.120
Doesn't infect anybody on the way.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.880
And no one else in that person's village infects anyone.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.600
And then that person goes straight

09:03.600 --> 09:05.720
to the Huanan seafood market,

09:05.720 --> 09:09.280
according to this, in my mind, not very credible theory,

09:09.280 --> 09:12.640
and then unloads his stuff and everybody gets infected.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.240
And they're only delivering those animals

09:15.240 --> 09:17.040
to the Wuhan market,

09:17.040 --> 09:18.800
which doesn't even sell very many

09:18.800 --> 09:20.240
of these kinds of animals

09:20.240 --> 09:22.000
that are likely intermediate species

09:22.000 --> 09:23.120
and not to anywhere else.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.880
So that's, I mean, it's a little bit of a straw man.

09:26.880 --> 09:27.720
But on top of that,

09:27.720 --> 09:32.400
the Chinese have sequenced more than 80,000 animal samples,

09:32.400 --> 09:36.280
and there's no evidence of this type of viral evolution

09:36.280 --> 09:37.400
that we would otherwise expect.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.400
Let's try to, at this moment,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.920
steel man the argument

09:43.920 --> 09:46.400
for the natural origin of the virus.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.920
So just to clarify,

09:48.920 --> 09:51.680
so Wuhan is actually, despite what it might sound like

09:51.680 --> 09:53.880
to people, is a pretty big city.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.120
There's a lot of people that live in it.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.000
11 million.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.680
So not only is there the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

09:59.680 --> 10:04.000
there's other centers that do work on viruses.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.640
But there's also a giant number of markets.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.040
And everything we're talking about here

10:08.040 --> 10:09.600
is pretty close together.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.680
So when I kind of look at the geography of this,

10:13.680 --> 10:16.040
I think when you zoom out, it's all Wuhan.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.320
But when you zoom in,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.280
there's just a lot of interesting dynamics

10:19.280 --> 10:20.120
that could be happening

10:20.120 --> 10:21.640
and where the cases are popping up

10:21.640 --> 10:24.080
and what's being reported, all that kind of stuff.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.080
So I think the people that argue for the natural origin,

10:29.560 --> 10:32.960
and there's a few recent papers that come out arguing this,

10:33.920 --> 10:35.680
it's kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.960
But I think what they're arguing

10:36.960 --> 10:39.120
is that there's this Hunan market

10:39.120 --> 10:41.640
that's one of the major markets,

10:41.640 --> 10:44.120
the wet markets in Wuhan,

10:45.480 --> 10:49.200
that there's a bunch of cases

10:49.200 --> 10:51.720
that were reported from there.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.200
So if I look at, for example,

10:54.200 --> 10:58.960
the Michael Waraby perspective that he wrote in Science,

10:58.960 --> 11:01.960
he argues, he wrote this a few days ago,

11:01.960 --> 11:05.080
the predominance of early COVID cases

11:05.080 --> 11:06.680
linked to Hunan market,

11:06.680 --> 11:09.800
and this can't be dismissed as ascertainment bias,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.120
which I think is what people argue,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.320
that you're just kind of focusing on this region

11:13.320 --> 11:14.400
because a lot of cases came,

11:14.400 --> 11:18.280
but there could be a huge number of other cases.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.760
So people who argue against this

11:19.760 --> 11:22.680
say that this is a later stage already.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.360
So he says no.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.800
He says this is the epicenter,

11:29.800 --> 11:34.800
and this is a clear evidence that,

11:35.120 --> 11:37.960
circumstantial evidence, but evidence nevertheless

11:37.960 --> 11:42.360
that this is where the jump happened to humans,

11:42.360 --> 11:43.720
the big explosion.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.920
Maybe not case zero, I don't know if he argues that,

11:45.920 --> 11:47.440
but with the early cases.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.200
So what do you make of this whole idea?

11:49.200 --> 11:52.520
Can you steel man it before we talk about the other thing?

11:52.520 --> 11:56.200
And my goal here isn't to attack people on the other side,

11:56.200 --> 12:00.760
and my feeling is if there is evidence that's presented

12:00.760 --> 12:02.840
that should change my view,

12:02.840 --> 12:06.520
I hope that I'll be open-minded enough to change my view.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.400
And certainly Michael Waraby is a thoughtful person,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.200
a respected scientist,

12:11.200 --> 12:14.080
and I think this work is contributive work,

12:14.080 --> 12:19.080
but I just don't think that it's as significant

12:19.680 --> 12:22.600
as has been reported in the press.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.840
And so what his argument is,

12:24.840 --> 12:29.840
is that there's an early cluster in December of 2019

12:30.400 --> 12:33.320
around the Huanan Seafood Market.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.360
And even though he himself argues

12:36.360 --> 12:39.520
that the original breakthrough case,

12:39.520 --> 12:41.480
the original case, the index case

12:41.480 --> 12:46.120
where the first person infected happened earlier,

12:46.120 --> 12:48.240
happened in October or November.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.760
So not in December.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.840
His argument is, well, what are the odds

12:52.840 --> 12:54.480
that you would have this number,

12:54.480 --> 12:58.040
this cluster of cases in the Huanan Seafood Market?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.920
And if the origin had happened someplace else,

13:00.920 --> 13:03.240
wouldn't you expect other clusters?

13:03.240 --> 13:06.120
And it's not an entirely implausible argument,

13:06.120 --> 13:08.040
but there are reasons why I think

13:08.040 --> 13:11.360
that this is not nearly as determinative

13:11.360 --> 13:12.760
as has been reported.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.200
And I certainly had a lot of,

13:14.200 --> 13:17.600
I and others had tweeted a lot about this.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.560
And that is first, the people who were infected

13:21.560 --> 13:26.480
in this cluster, it's not the earliest known virus

13:26.480 --> 13:28.520
of the SARS-CoV-2, it began mutating.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.800
So it's not the original SARS-CoV-2 there.

13:31.800 --> 13:35.480
So it had to have happened someplace else too.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.520
The people who were infected in the market

13:38.520 --> 13:41.480
weren't infected in the part of the market

13:41.480 --> 13:43.680
where they had these kinds of animals

13:43.680 --> 13:46.200
that are considered to be candidates

13:46.200 --> 13:49.440
as an intermediary species.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.760
And third, there was a bias,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.160
and actually I'll have four things.

13:53.160 --> 13:58.160
Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China

13:58.200 --> 13:59.720
of what they were looking for.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.320
But they were asked, did you have exposure to the market?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.360
Because I think in the early days

14:03.360 --> 14:05.120
when people were figuring things out,

14:05.120 --> 14:08.720
that was one of the questions that was asked.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.480
And fourth, and probably most significantly,

14:11.480 --> 14:16.120
we have so little information about those early cases

14:16.920 --> 14:18.640
in China, and that's really unfortunate.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.760
I know we'll talk about this later,

14:19.760 --> 14:23.000
because the Chinese government is preventing access

14:23.000 --> 14:26.080
to all of that information, which they have,

14:26.080 --> 14:28.880
which could easily help us get to the bottom,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.840
at least know a ton more about how this pandemic started.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.840
And so this is, it's like grasping at straws

14:36.960 --> 14:38.440
in the dark with gloves on.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.680
That's right.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.720
But to steel man the argument,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.040
we have this evidence from this market,

14:45.040 --> 14:47.000
and yes, the Chinese government

14:47.000 --> 14:48.960
has turned off the lights, essentially,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.320
so we have very little data to work with,

14:51.320 --> 14:53.440
but this is the data we have.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.560
So who's to say that this data

14:55.560 --> 14:58.880
doesn't represent a much bigger data set

14:58.880 --> 15:01.480
that a lot of people got infected at this market,

15:02.560 --> 15:05.000
even at the parts, or especially at the parts

15:05.000 --> 15:09.200
where the meat, the infected meat was being sold?

15:09.200 --> 15:13.680
So that could be true, and it probably is true.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.880
The question is, is this the source,

15:16.880 --> 15:18.760
is this the place where this began,

15:18.760 --> 15:22.040
or was this just a place where it was amplified?

15:22.040 --> 15:26.680
And I certainly think that it's extremely likely

15:26.680 --> 15:31.280
that the Huanan Seafood Market was a point of amplification,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.040
and it's just answering a different question.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.360
Basically what you're saying is it's very difficult

15:35.360 --> 15:38.240
to use the market as evidence for anything,

15:38.240 --> 15:42.760
because it's probably not even the starting point.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.840
So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.600
That's certainly my view.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.880
What Michael Waraby's argument is that,

15:51.880 --> 15:53.160
well, what are the odds of that,

15:53.160 --> 15:57.040
that we're seeing this amplification in the market?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.280
And if we, let me put it this way,

16:00.280 --> 16:02.560
if we had all of the information,

16:02.560 --> 16:06.040
if the Chinese government hadn't blocked access

16:06.040 --> 16:08.520
to all of this, because there's blood bank information,

16:08.520 --> 16:10.640
there's all sorts of information,

16:10.640 --> 16:15.000
and based on a full and complete understanding,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.400
we came to believe that all of the early cases

16:18.400 --> 16:19.520
were at this market.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.320
I think that would be a stronger argument

16:22.320 --> 16:24.000
than what this is so far.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.920
But everything leads to the fact that,

16:25.920 --> 16:28.680
why is it that the Chinese government,

16:28.680 --> 16:31.280
which was, frankly, after a slow start,

16:31.280 --> 16:36.280
the gold standard of doing viral tracking for SARS-1,

16:36.760 --> 16:39.880
why have they apparently done so little

16:39.880 --> 16:41.160
and shared so little?

16:41.160 --> 16:45.080
I think it asks, it begs a lot of questions.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.040
Okay, so let's then talk about the Chinese government.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.000
There's several governments, right?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.360
So one is the local government of Wuhan.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.760
And not just the Chinese government,

16:56.760 --> 16:58.200
let's talk about government.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.840
No, let's talk about human nature.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.480
This just keeps zooming out.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.960
Let's talk about planet Earth.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.480
No, so there's the Wuhan local government,

17:08.480 --> 17:12.560
there's the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping,

17:13.880 --> 17:16.520
and there's governments in general.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.120
I'm trying to empathize.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.480
So my father was involved with Chernobyl.

17:21.480 --> 17:25.720
I'm trying to put myself into the mind of local officials,

17:25.720 --> 17:28.080
of people who are like, oh shit,

17:28.080 --> 17:33.080
there's a potential catastrophic event happening here,

17:33.600 --> 17:38.600
and it's my ass because there's incompetence

17:38.680 --> 17:39.960
all over the place.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.640
Human nature is such that there's incompetence

17:41.640 --> 17:44.360
all over the place, and you're always trying to cover it up.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.160
And so given that context,

17:48.360 --> 17:52.760
I want to lay out all the possible incompetence,

17:52.760 --> 17:55.000
all the possible malevolence,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.620
all the possible geopolitical tensions here.

17:59.060 --> 18:04.060
All right, where in your sense did the cover-up start?

18:06.420 --> 18:10.940
So there's this suspicious fact,

18:13.300 --> 18:16.740
it seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

18:16.740 --> 18:19.220
had a public database of thousands

18:19.220 --> 18:22.660
of sampled bad coronavirus sequences,

18:22.660 --> 18:26.300
and that went offline in September of 2019.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.220
Well, what's that about?

18:28.220 --> 18:30.540
So let me talk about that specific,

18:30.540 --> 18:33.580
and then I'll also follow your path of zooming out,

18:33.580 --> 18:34.620
and it's a really important-

18:34.620 --> 18:35.460
Is that a good starting point?

18:35.460 --> 18:37.060
It's a great starting point, yeah, yeah.

18:37.060 --> 18:40.460
So, but there's a bigger story,

18:40.460 --> 18:42.540
but let me talk about that.

18:42.540 --> 18:45.340
So the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.060
and we can go into the whole history

18:48.060 --> 18:49.540
of the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

18:49.540 --> 18:50.380
either now or later,

18:50.380 --> 18:52.220
because I think it's very relevant to the story,

18:52.220 --> 18:55.460
but let's focus for now on this database.

18:55.580 --> 19:00.420
They had a database of 22,000 viral samples

19:00.420 --> 19:02.860
and sequence information about viruses

19:02.860 --> 19:05.100
that they had collected,

19:05.100 --> 19:07.660
some of which, the collection of some of which

19:07.660 --> 19:10.420
was supported through funding from the NIH,

19:10.420 --> 19:12.820
not a huge NIH, through EcoHealth Alliance.

19:12.820 --> 19:17.820
It's a relatively small amount, $600,000, but not nothing.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.900
The goal of this database

19:20.900 --> 19:24.380
was so that we could understand viral evolution

19:24.380 --> 19:27.340
so that exactly for this kind of moment

19:27.340 --> 19:29.660
where we had an unknown virus,

19:29.660 --> 19:31.940
we could say, well, is this like anything

19:31.940 --> 19:33.420
that we've seen before?

19:33.420 --> 19:35.860
And that would help us both understand what we're facing

19:35.860 --> 19:39.380
and be better able to respond.

19:39.380 --> 19:44.380
So this was a password-protected public access database.

19:45.020 --> 19:50.020
In 2019, in September 2019, it became inaccessible,

19:51.820 --> 19:53.500
and then the whole, a few months later,

19:53.540 --> 19:55.940
the entire database disappeared.

19:55.940 --> 19:58.700
What the Chinese have said is that

19:58.700 --> 20:01.820
because there were all kinds of computer attacks

20:01.820 --> 20:04.500
on this database, but why would that happen

20:04.500 --> 20:09.500
in September 2019 before the pandemic,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.900
at least as far as we know?

20:11.900 --> 20:13.620
So just to clarify.

20:13.620 --> 20:14.500
Yes.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.500
It went down to September 2019,

20:17.500 --> 20:19.740
just so we get the year straight.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.180
January 2020 is when the virus

20:22.180 --> 20:26.020
really started getting the press.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.060
So we're talking about December 2019,

20:29.060 --> 20:31.020
a lot of early infections happened.

20:31.020 --> 20:34.940
September 2019 is when this database goes down.

20:34.940 --> 20:37.300
Just to clarify, because you said it quickly,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.620
the Chinese government said

20:39.620 --> 20:44.020
that their database was getting hacked.

20:44.940 --> 20:45.780
Therefore-

20:45.780 --> 20:48.700
Xu Zhengli, the director of this part

20:48.740 --> 20:50.820
of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said that.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.220
Oh, really, she was the one that said it?

20:53.220 --> 20:54.060
She was the one who said it.

20:54.060 --> 20:57.220
Oh, boy, I did not even know that part, okay.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.620
Well, she's an interesting character.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.460
We'll talk about her.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.300
Yeah.

21:00.300 --> 21:05.300
So the excuse is that it's getting cyber-attacked a lot,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.020
so we're gonna take it down

21:09.020 --> 21:10.820
without any further explanation,

21:10.820 --> 21:12.140
which seems very suspicious.

21:12.140 --> 21:15.620
And then this virus starts to emerge

21:15.620 --> 21:17.500
in October, November, December.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.540
There's a lot of argument about that, but after.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.460
Sorry to interrupt, but some people are saying

21:21.460 --> 21:23.260
that the first outbreak could have happened

21:23.260 --> 21:25.540
as early as September.

21:25.540 --> 21:27.660
I think it's more likely it's October, November,

21:27.660 --> 21:31.380
but for the people who are saying that the first outbreak,

21:31.380 --> 21:34.980
the first incident of a known outbreak,

21:34.980 --> 21:37.380
at least to somebody, happened in September,

21:37.380 --> 21:38.420
they make the argument,

21:38.420 --> 21:42.500
well, what if that also happened in mid-September of 2019?

21:42.500 --> 21:43.820
I'm not prepared to go there,

21:43.820 --> 21:45.140
but there are some people who make that argument.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.020
What I think, again,

21:47.020 --> 21:50.060
if I were to put myself in the mind of officials,

21:50.060 --> 21:53.740
whether it's officials within the Wuhan Institute of Virology

21:53.740 --> 21:55.860
or Wuhan local officials,

21:58.020 --> 22:02.020
I think if I notice some major problem,

22:02.020 --> 22:03.540
like somebody got sick,

22:04.460 --> 22:09.220
some sign of, oh shit, we screwed up,

22:09.220 --> 22:11.940
that's when you kind of do the slow,

22:11.940 --> 22:13.740
there's like a Homer Simpson meme

22:13.740 --> 22:15.580
where you slowly start backing out

22:15.580 --> 22:20.580
and I would probably start hiding stuff.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.860
CYA, yeah.

22:21.860 --> 22:25.980
Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.900
It's like you're in a relationship

22:27.900 --> 22:30.020
and your girlfriend wants to see your phone

22:30.020 --> 22:31.380
and you're like, I'm sorry,

22:31.380 --> 22:33.540
I'm just getting attacked by the Russians now,

22:33.540 --> 22:35.340
the cybersecurity, I can't.

22:35.340 --> 22:36.820
Yeah, I wish I could.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.780
I wish I could, it's just unsafe right now.

22:39.780 --> 22:42.820
So would it be okay if I give you my kind of macro view

22:42.820 --> 22:44.620
of the whole information space

22:44.620 --> 22:48.380
and why I believe this has been so contentious?

22:48.380 --> 22:52.420
So here's if I had to give my best guess

22:52.420 --> 22:55.980
and I underline the word guess of what happened

22:55.980 --> 22:59.540
and your background, your family background with Chernobyl

22:59.540 --> 23:02.060
I think is highly relevant here.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.740
So after the first SARS,

23:04.740 --> 23:08.100
there was a recognition that we needed to distribute

23:08.100 --> 23:11.660
knowledge about virology and epidemiology around the world,

23:11.660 --> 23:14.900
the people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia,

23:14.900 --> 23:16.700
they were the frontline workers

23:16.700 --> 23:20.620
and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring

23:20.620 --> 23:24.740
and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system.

23:25.660 --> 23:28.260
And that was why there was a lot of investment

23:28.260 --> 23:30.980
in all of those places in building capacity

23:30.980 --> 23:31.980
and training people

23:31.980 --> 23:34.620
and helping to build institutional capacity.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.780
And the Chinese government,

23:36.780 --> 23:40.580
they recognized that they needed to ramp things up.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.260
And then the World Health Organization

23:43.260 --> 23:44.620
and the World Health Assembly,

23:44.620 --> 23:47.580
they had their international health regulations

23:47.580 --> 23:50.100
that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.500
So that was the goal.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.300
There were a lot of investments

23:54.300 --> 23:55.420
and I know we'll talk later

23:55.420 --> 23:56.900
about the Wuhan Institute of Virology

23:56.900 --> 23:59.380
and I won't go into that right now.

23:59.380 --> 24:02.580
So there was all of this distributed capacity.

24:02.580 --> 24:07.300
And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.740
We don't know, is it September, October, November?

24:10.740 --> 24:14.620
Maybe December is when the local authorities

24:14.620 --> 24:16.700
start to recognize that something's happening.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.260
But at some point in late 2019,

24:19.260 --> 24:23.580
local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.060
And exactly like in Chernobyl,

24:26.060 --> 24:29.220
these guys exist within a hierarchical system

24:29.220 --> 24:32.340
and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen

24:32.340 --> 24:33.980
and they're going to be in big trouble

24:33.980 --> 24:36.260
if bad things happen under their watch.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.660
So their initial instinct is to squash it.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.220
My guess is they think,

24:42.220 --> 24:44.340
well, if we squash this information,

24:44.340 --> 24:47.180
we can most likely beat back this outbreak

24:47.180 --> 24:49.380
because lots of outbreaks happen all the time,

24:49.380 --> 24:51.500
including of SARS-1,

24:51.500 --> 24:53.980
where there was multiple lab incidents

24:53.980 --> 24:56.860
out of a lab in Beijing.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.820
And so they start their cover-up on day one.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.620
They start screening social media,

25:02.620 --> 25:06.180
they send nasty letters to different doctors

25:06.180 --> 25:08.620
and others who are starting to speak up.

25:08.620 --> 25:12.100
But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.780
And then the national government of China,

25:14.780 --> 25:17.460
again, this is just a hypothesis.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.660
The national government gets involved.

25:19.660 --> 25:21.900
They say, all right, this is getting much bigger.

25:21.900 --> 25:24.060
They go in and they realize

25:24.060 --> 25:26.180
that we have a big problem on our hands.

25:26.180 --> 25:28.300
They relatively quickly know

25:28.300 --> 25:30.660
that it's spreading human to human.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.860
And so the right thing for them to do then

25:32.860 --> 25:35.340
is what the South African government is doing now

25:35.340 --> 25:37.820
is to say, we have this outbreak.

25:37.820 --> 25:40.780
We don't know everything, but we know it's serious.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.660
We need help.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.740
But that's not the instinct of people in most governments

25:44.740 --> 25:48.300
and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.940
And so the national government,

25:50.940 --> 25:52.780
they have a choice at that point.

25:52.780 --> 25:55.020
They can do option one,

25:55.020 --> 25:57.500
which is what we would hear called the right thing,

25:57.500 --> 25:59.580
which is total transparency.

25:59.580 --> 26:03.420
They criticize the local officials for having this cover-up

26:03.580 --> 26:05.780
and they say, now we're going to be totally transparent.

26:05.780 --> 26:07.900
But what does that do in a system

26:07.900 --> 26:10.660
like the former Soviet Union, like China now?

26:10.660 --> 26:12.420
If local officials say, wait a second,

26:12.420 --> 26:15.900
I thought my job was to cover everything up,

26:15.900 --> 26:18.300
to support this alternative reality

26:18.300 --> 26:22.220
that authoritarian systems need in order to survive.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.820
Well, now I'm gonna be held accountable

26:23.820 --> 26:26.700
for if I'm not totally transparent.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.380
Like your whole system would collapse.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.540
So the national government, they have that choice

26:32.540 --> 26:35.940
and their only choice according to the logic

26:35.940 --> 26:38.980
of their system is to be all in on a cover-up.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.580
And that's why they block the World Health Organization

26:41.580 --> 26:45.500
from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.540
They overtly lie to the World Health Organization

26:48.540 --> 26:51.260
about human to human transmission.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.540
And then they begin their cover-ups.

26:53.540 --> 26:56.860
So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples,

26:56.860 --> 26:59.820
hiding records, they start imprisoning people

26:59.820 --> 27:02.860
for asking basic questions.

27:02.860 --> 27:05.740
Soon after they establish a gag order,

27:05.740 --> 27:08.020
preventing Chinese scientists from writing

27:08.020 --> 27:10.580
or saying anything about pandemic origins

27:10.580 --> 27:12.180
without prior government approval.

27:12.180 --> 27:16.140
And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data,

27:16.140 --> 27:19.260
there's not nearly enough data coming out of China.

27:19.260 --> 27:22.820
And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China

27:22.820 --> 27:26.060
who are data-driven say, well, I don't have

27:26.060 --> 27:29.260
enough information to draw conclusions.

27:29.260 --> 27:34.260
And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number

27:35.140 --> 27:39.180
of largely virologists, but also others,

27:39.180 --> 27:42.220
respected scientists and I know we'll talk about

27:42.220 --> 27:47.020
the I think infamous Peter Daszak who say,

27:47.020 --> 27:52.020
well, without any real foundation in the evidence,

27:52.740 --> 27:56.740
they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature

27:56.740 --> 28:00.260
and anyone who's raising the possibility

28:00.260 --> 28:03.420
of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.

28:03.420 --> 28:07.900
So that message starts to percolate.

28:07.900 --> 28:11.580
And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump

28:11.580 --> 28:15.420
and he's starting to get criticized for America's failure

28:15.420 --> 28:17.660
to respond, prepare for and respond adequately

28:17.660 --> 28:19.020
to the outbreak.

28:19.020 --> 28:22.540
And so he starts saying, well, I know,

28:22.540 --> 28:25.140
first after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying,

28:25.340 --> 28:28.540
I know that China did it and the WHO did it

28:28.540 --> 28:32.940
and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself.

28:32.940 --> 28:36.100
And then we have a media here that had shifted

28:36.100 --> 28:40.700
from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.140
So-and-so said X and so-and-so said Y

28:43.140 --> 28:45.780
and then we'll present both of those views.

28:45.780 --> 28:48.020
With Donald Trump, he would make

28:48.020 --> 28:50.540
outlandish starting positions.

28:50.540 --> 28:53.380
So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.380
And then in the early days, they would say,

28:55.380 --> 28:59.140
Lex is an ax murderer, Lex's friend says

28:59.140 --> 28:59.980
he's not an ax murderer.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.580
And we'd have a four-day debate, is he or isn't he?

29:02.580 --> 29:04.620
And then at day four, someone would say,

29:04.620 --> 29:06.780
why are we having this debate at all?

29:06.780 --> 29:11.780
Because the original point is just baseless.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.820
And so the media just got in the habit.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.620
Here's what Trump said and here's why it's wrong.

29:16.620 --> 29:20.860
It's very complicated to figure out what is the role

29:20.860 --> 29:22.860
of a politician, what is the role of a leader

29:22.860 --> 29:25.580
in this kind of game of politics.

29:25.580 --> 29:29.620
But certainly when there's a tragedy,

29:29.620 --> 29:32.140
when there's a catastrophic event,

29:32.140 --> 29:35.300
what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly

29:35.300 --> 29:38.740
through the fog and to make big, bold decisions

29:38.740 --> 29:41.180
that does speak to the truth of things.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.140
And even if it's unpopular truth,

29:44.300 --> 29:48.100
to listen to the people, to listen to all sides,

29:48.100 --> 29:51.780
to the opinions, to the controversial ideas

29:51.820 --> 29:54.700
and to see past all the bullshit,

29:54.700 --> 29:59.260
all the political bullshit and just speak to the people,

29:59.260 --> 30:02.740
speak to the world and make bold, big decisions.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.900
That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership.

30:04.900 --> 30:09.180
And I'm not so willing to criticize whether it's Joe Biden

30:09.180 --> 30:11.300
or Donald Trump on this.

30:11.300 --> 30:15.820
I think most people cannot be great leaders,

30:15.820 --> 30:18.660
but that's why when great leaders step up,

30:18.660 --> 30:20.020
we write books about them.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.260
And I agree.

30:21.260 --> 30:26.260
And even though I think of myself as a progressive person,

30:26.300 --> 30:31.300
I certainly was a critic of a lot of what President Trump did.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.180
But on this particular case,

30:36.180 --> 30:39.460
even though he may have said it in an uncouth way,

30:39.460 --> 30:43.660
Donald Trump was actually in my view, right.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.660
I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab,

30:46.660 --> 30:48.660
maybe he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you,

30:48.660 --> 30:51.300
I don't think he even had the evidence.

30:51.300 --> 30:55.460
But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab,

30:55.460 --> 30:58.180
in my view was a correct intuition.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.020
And certainly I started speaking up

31:00.020 --> 31:04.460
about pandemic origins early in 2019.

31:04.460 --> 31:08.780
And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me

31:08.780 --> 31:09.780
saying, what are you doing?

31:09.780 --> 31:11.820
You're supporting Trump in an election year.

31:11.820 --> 31:15.500
And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something

31:15.500 --> 31:18.020
doesn't mean that I need to oppose it

31:18.700 --> 31:21.820
if Donald Trump says something that I think is correct.

31:21.820 --> 31:22.940
Well, I wanna say it's correct,

31:22.940 --> 31:25.260
just as if he says something that I don't like,

31:25.260 --> 31:26.900
I'm gonna speak up about that.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.540
Good, you walked through the fire.

31:28.540 --> 31:31.940
So you laid out the story here.

31:31.940 --> 31:36.540
And I think in many ways, it's a human story.

31:36.540 --> 31:40.380
It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature.

31:41.420 --> 31:45.740
But let's talk about the story of the virus.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.340
And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.660
So maybe this is a good time to try to talk

31:51.660 --> 31:53.540
about its history, about its origins,

31:53.540 --> 31:55.900
about what kind of stuff it works on,

31:55.900 --> 32:00.780
about biosafety levels and about Batwoman.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.340
Yeah, Shi Zhengli, yes.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.780
Shi Zhengli.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.540
So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

32:06.540 --> 32:07.540
when did it start?

32:07.540 --> 32:09.060
Yeah, so it's a great question.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.140
So after SARS-1, which was in the early 2000,

32:13.180 --> 32:18.180
2003, 2004, there was this effort to enhance,

32:20.060 --> 32:23.820
as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China.

32:23.820 --> 32:26.620
So the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been around

32:26.620 --> 32:30.700
for decades before then, but there was an agreement

32:30.700 --> 32:33.900
between the French and the Chinese governments

32:33.900 --> 32:38.900
to build the largest BSL-4 labs, so biosafety level four.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.380
So in these, what are called high-containment labs,

32:42.380 --> 32:44.500
there's level four, which is the highest level,

32:44.500 --> 32:47.340
and people have seen that on TV and elsewhere

32:47.340 --> 32:50.780
where you have the people in the different suits

32:50.780 --> 32:51.900
and all of these protections.

32:51.900 --> 32:55.500
And then there's level three, which is still very serious,

32:56.900 --> 32:58.820
but not as much as level four.

32:58.820 --> 33:03.220
And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves

33:03.220 --> 33:05.700
and maybe a face mask, much less.

33:05.700 --> 33:10.300
So the French and the Chinese governments agreed

33:10.300 --> 33:13.460
that France would help build the first

33:13.460 --> 33:18.460
and still the largest BSL-4, plus some mobile BSL-3 labs,

33:20.100 --> 33:22.180
and they were going to do it in Wuhan.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.940
And Wuhan is kind of like China's Chicago.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.700
And I had actually been, it's a different story,

33:26.700 --> 33:30.620
I'd been in Wuhan relatively not that long

33:30.620 --> 33:32.900
before the pandemic broke out,

33:32.900 --> 33:34.860
and that was why I knew that Wuhan is,

33:34.860 --> 33:37.340
it's not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels

33:37.340 --> 33:40.220
eating bats for dinner every night.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.460
This is a really sophisticated, wealthy,

33:43.460 --> 33:46.460
highly educated and cultured city.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.020
And so I knew that it wasn't like,

33:49.020 --> 33:51.020
that even the Wuhan Seafood Market

33:51.020 --> 33:53.500
wasn't like some of these seafood markets

33:53.500 --> 33:55.660
that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia

33:55.660 --> 33:57.820
where I lived for two years.

33:57.820 --> 34:00.020
I mean, it was a totally different thing.

34:00.020 --> 34:02.020
I'm going to have to talk to you about some of the food,

34:02.020 --> 34:03.300
including the Wuhan market,

34:03.300 --> 34:05.340
just some of the wild food going on here

34:05.340 --> 34:07.020
because you've traveled that part of the world.

34:07.020 --> 34:07.860
Yeah.

34:07.860 --> 34:09.580
Well, let's not get distracted.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.060
I was telling you, Lex, before,

34:11.060 --> 34:13.780
and this is maybe an advertisement,

34:13.780 --> 34:17.980
is having now listened to a number of your podcasts

34:17.980 --> 34:20.340
when I'm doing long ultra training runs

34:20.340 --> 34:22.220
or driving in the mountains.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.620
Like the really, because in the beginning,

34:23.620 --> 34:26.060
you have to talk about whatever it is as the topic,

34:26.060 --> 34:28.620
but the really good stuff happens later.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.460
So friends, you should listen to the end.

34:30.460 --> 34:34.860
I have to say, as I was telling you before,

34:34.860 --> 34:37.740
like when I heard your long podcast with Jaron Lanier

34:37.780 --> 34:41.100
and he talked about his mother at the very end,

34:41.100 --> 34:42.700
I mean, just beautiful stuff.

34:42.700 --> 34:45.460
So I don't know whether I can match beautiful stuff,

34:45.460 --> 34:47.900
but I'm going to do my best.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.100
You're going to have to find out.

34:49.100 --> 34:49.940
Exactly.

34:49.940 --> 34:50.780
Stay tuned.

34:52.660 --> 34:54.860
So France had this agreement

34:54.860 --> 34:57.860
that they were going to help design and help build

34:57.860 --> 35:00.980
this BSL-4 lab in Wuhan.

35:00.980 --> 35:04.820
And it was going to be with French standards,

35:04.820 --> 35:07.460
and there were going to be 50 French experts

35:07.540 --> 35:09.420
who were going to work there

35:09.420 --> 35:12.740
and supervise the work that happened

35:12.740 --> 35:15.420
even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology

35:16.460 --> 35:21.460
in the new location started operating.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.460
But then when they started building it,

35:24.460 --> 35:28.540
the French contractors, the French overseers

35:28.540 --> 35:31.540
were increasingly appalled

35:31.540 --> 35:33.460
that they had less and less control,

35:33.460 --> 35:36.940
that the Chinese contractors were swapping out new things.

35:37.180 --> 35:41.060
It wasn't built up to French standards so much

35:41.060 --> 35:44.220
that at the end, when it was finally built,

35:44.220 --> 35:47.900
the person who was the vice chairman of the project

35:47.900 --> 35:51.420
and a leading French industrialist named Marieux

35:51.420 --> 35:53.020
refused to sign off.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.660
And he said, we can't support,

35:55.660 --> 35:58.260
we have no idea what this is,

35:58.260 --> 36:00.260
whether it's safe or not.

36:00.260 --> 36:03.020
And when this lab opened,

36:03.020 --> 36:06.020
remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts,

36:06.020 --> 36:07.900
it had one French expert.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.380
And so the French were really disgusted.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.740
And actually, when the Wuhan Institute of Virology

36:14.740 --> 36:18.660
in its new location opened in 2018,

36:18.660 --> 36:19.500
two things happened.

36:19.500 --> 36:23.460
One, French intelligence privately approached US intelligence

36:23.460 --> 36:25.100
saying, we have a lot of concerns

36:25.100 --> 36:27.300
about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

36:27.300 --> 36:28.460
about its safety,

36:28.460 --> 36:30.420
and we don't even know who's operating there.

36:30.420 --> 36:34.060
Is it being used as a dual use facility?

36:34.060 --> 36:38.580
And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing

36:38.580 --> 36:42.260
sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at,

36:42.260 --> 36:44.540
well, at this laboratory.

36:44.540 --> 36:48.540
And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogan

36:48.540 --> 36:52.580
from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying,

36:52.580 --> 36:54.180
this is really unsafe.

36:54.180 --> 36:58.780
They're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses

36:58.780 --> 37:02.740
in conditions where a leak is possible.

37:02.740 --> 37:05.700
And so then you mentioned Xuejian Li,

37:05.700 --> 37:08.700
and I'll connect that to these virologists

37:08.700 --> 37:11.140
who I was talking about.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.260
So there's a very credible thesis

37:14.260 --> 37:17.340
that because these pathogenic outbreaks

37:17.340 --> 37:19.780
happen in other parts of the world,

37:19.780 --> 37:22.100
having partnerships with experts

37:22.100 --> 37:24.700
in those parts of the world

37:24.700 --> 37:28.060
must be a foundation of our efforts.

37:28.060 --> 37:30.020
We can't just bring everything home

37:30.060 --> 37:31.700
because we know that viruses

37:31.700 --> 37:33.780
don't care about borders and boundaries.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.260
And so if something happens there, it's going to come here.

37:36.260 --> 37:41.260
So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships

37:41.740 --> 37:44.060
with experts in these labs.

37:44.060 --> 37:47.340
And Xuejian Li was one of those partners.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.460
And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak,

37:51.460 --> 37:54.060
who's a British, I think now American,

37:54.060 --> 37:57.660
but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance,

37:57.660 --> 37:59.300
which was getting money from NIH.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.860
And basically, EcoHealth Alliance

38:01.860 --> 38:03.540
was a pass-through organization.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.700
And over the years, it was only about $600,000.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.060
So almost all of her funding

38:08.060 --> 38:09.340
came from the Chinese government,

38:09.340 --> 38:11.900
but there's a little bit that came from the United States.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.220
And so she became their kind of leading expert

38:15.220 --> 38:17.700
and the point of contact

38:17.700 --> 38:20.300
between the Wuhan Institute of Virology

38:20.300 --> 38:25.300
and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.940
And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak,

38:28.940 --> 38:32.940
I did mention that there were these virologists

38:32.940 --> 38:35.020
who had this fake certainty

38:35.020 --> 38:36.700
that they knew it came from nature

38:36.700 --> 38:38.900
and it didn't come from a lab.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.420
And they called people like me conspiracy theorists

38:41.420 --> 38:43.940
just for raising that possibility.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.900
But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort

38:46.900 --> 38:50.100
in February of 2020,

38:50.100 --> 38:53.020
what he said is we need to rally behind

38:53.020 --> 38:54.140
our Chinese colleagues.

38:54.140 --> 38:58.860
And the basic idea was these international collaborations

38:58.860 --> 38:59.740
are under threat.

38:59.740 --> 39:01.340
And I think it was because of that,

39:01.340 --> 39:02.820
because Peter Daszak's,

39:02.820 --> 39:07.700
basically his major contribution as a scientist

39:07.700 --> 39:09.700
was just tacking his name on work

39:09.700 --> 39:13.020
that Xujing Li had largely done.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.500
He was defending a lot,

39:14.500 --> 39:16.900
certainly for himself and his organization.

39:16.900 --> 39:20.700
So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter

39:20.700 --> 39:22.060
is less about money,

39:22.060 --> 39:24.820
it's more about kind of almost like legacy

39:24.820 --> 39:26.700
because you're so attached to this work.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.980
Is it just on a human level?

39:28.380 --> 39:29.220
I think so.

39:29.220 --> 39:31.900
I mean, I've been criticized for being actually,

39:31.900 --> 39:34.820
I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak,

39:34.820 --> 39:38.500
but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.980
I mean, it's so easy to say,

39:39.980 --> 39:43.140
oh, somebody they're like an evil ogre

39:43.140 --> 39:45.500
and just trying to do evil

39:45.500 --> 39:49.740
and cackling in their closet or whatever.

39:49.740 --> 39:51.180
But I think for most of us,

39:51.180 --> 39:55.500
even those of us who do terrible, horrible things,

39:55.500 --> 39:57.660
the story that we tell ourselves,

39:58.340 --> 40:01.100
and we really believe is that we're doing the thing

40:01.100 --> 40:02.580
that we most believe in.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.580
I mean, I did my PhD dissertation

40:04.580 --> 40:06.820
on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

40:06.820 --> 40:09.940
They genuinely saw themselves as idealists.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.900
They thought, well, we need to make radical change

40:13.900 --> 40:15.700
to build a better future.

40:15.700 --> 40:18.340
And what they described is that they felt

40:18.340 --> 40:21.940
was radical change was a monstrous atrocities by us.

40:21.940 --> 40:24.100
So the criticism here of Peter

40:24.100 --> 40:29.100
is that he was part of an organization

40:31.860 --> 40:36.500
that was kind of, well, funding an effort

40:36.500 --> 40:39.020
that was an unsafe implementation

40:39.020 --> 40:42.060
of a biosafety level four laboratory.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.340
Well, a few things.

40:43.340 --> 40:47.980
So what he thought he was doing was,

40:47.980 --> 40:49.580
and then what he thought he was doing

40:49.580 --> 40:51.700
is itself highly controversial

40:51.700 --> 40:55.620
because there's one that in 2011,

40:56.740 --> 40:58.660
I know you've talked about this with other guests,

40:58.660 --> 41:03.660
but in 2011, there were the first published papers

41:04.020 --> 41:07.500
on this now infamous gain of function research.

41:07.500 --> 41:12.500
And basically what they did both in different labs

41:13.220 --> 41:14.620
and certainly in the United States,

41:14.620 --> 41:18.660
in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands,

41:19.540 --> 41:24.540
they had a bird flu virus that was very dangerous

41:24.900 --> 41:28.580
but not massively transmissive.

41:28.580 --> 41:31.660
And they had a gain of function process

41:31.660 --> 41:33.660
through what's called serial passage,

41:33.660 --> 41:37.140
which means basically passing advice like natural selection,

41:37.140 --> 41:39.260
but forcing natural selection

41:39.260 --> 41:42.500
by just passing a virus through a different cell cultures

41:42.500 --> 41:46.340
and then selecting for what it is that you want.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.500
So relatively easily, they took this deadly

41:49.500 --> 41:51.900
but not massively transmissive virus

41:51.900 --> 41:53.940
and turned it into in a lab,

41:53.940 --> 41:57.380
a deadly and transmissive virus.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.580
And that showed that this is really dangerous.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.220
And so there were, at that point,

42:01.220 --> 42:03.060
there was a huge controversy.

42:03.060 --> 42:07.180
There were some people like Richard Ebright

42:07.180 --> 42:09.580
and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard

42:09.580 --> 42:12.540
who were saying that this is really dangerous

42:12.540 --> 42:16.940
were in the idea that we need to create monsters

42:16.940 --> 42:17.940
to study monsters.

42:17.940 --> 42:21.220
I think maybe even you have said that in the past.

42:21.220 --> 42:22.380
It doesn't make sense

42:22.380 --> 42:24.700
because there's an unlimited number of monsters.

42:24.700 --> 42:25.820
And so what are we gonna do?

42:25.820 --> 42:27.500
Create an unlimited number of monsters.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.500
And if we do that,

42:28.500 --> 42:31.460
eventually the monsters are going to get out.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.700
Then there was the Peter Daszak camp

42:33.700 --> 42:35.500
and he got a lot of funding,

42:35.500 --> 42:37.300
particularly from the United States,

42:37.300 --> 42:40.380
who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci

42:40.380 --> 42:42.060
were supportive of this.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.660
And they thought, well, there's a safe way

42:44.660 --> 42:46.380
to go out into the world,

42:46.380 --> 42:49.620
to collect the world's most dangerous viruses

42:49.620 --> 42:52.180
and to poke and prod them

42:52.180 --> 42:54.260
to figure out how they might mutate,

42:54.260 --> 42:56.420
how they might become more dangerous

42:56.420 --> 43:01.420
with the goal of predicting future pandemics.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.660
And that certainly never happened

43:03.660 --> 43:07.980
with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments.

43:07.980 --> 43:11.180
And that largely never happened.

43:11.700 --> 43:16.700
So Peter Daszak kind of epitomized that second approach.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.980
And as you've talked about in the past,

43:20.980 --> 43:24.100
in 2014, there was a funding moratorium

43:24.100 --> 43:25.180
in the United States.

43:25.180 --> 43:27.940
And then in 2017, that was lifted.

43:27.940 --> 43:29.100
It didn't affect the funding

43:29.100 --> 43:33.340
that went to the EcoHealth Alliance.

43:33.340 --> 43:37.020
So when this happened in the beginning,

43:37.020 --> 43:40.060
and again, coming back to Peter's motivations,

43:40.060 --> 43:44.020
I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter.

43:44.020 --> 43:47.100
I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking,

43:47.100 --> 43:49.740
and then I'll tell you what I actually think.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
So I think here's what he's thinking.

43:51.740 --> 43:56.300
This is most likely a natural origin outbreak.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.380
Just like SARS-1, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind,

44:00.380 --> 44:04.500
just like SARS-1, this is most likely a natural outbreak.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.940
We need to have an international coalition

44:06.940 --> 44:08.660
in order to fight it.

44:08.700 --> 44:11.980
If we allow these political attacks

44:11.980 --> 44:14.180
to undermine our Chinese counterparts

44:14.180 --> 44:16.220
and the trust in these relationships

44:16.220 --> 44:18.540
that we've built over many years,

44:18.540 --> 44:20.700
we're really screwed because they have

44:20.700 --> 44:23.820
the most local knowledge of these outbreaks.

44:23.820 --> 44:27.780
And even though, and this gets a lot more complicated,

44:27.780 --> 44:30.780
even though there are basic questions

44:30.780 --> 44:32.580
that anybody would ask,

44:32.580 --> 44:34.780
and that Xu Zhengli herself did ask

44:34.780 --> 44:37.780
about the origins of this pandemic,

44:37.780 --> 44:40.380
even though Peter Daszak, and I'll mention this,

44:40.380 --> 44:42.020
I'll describe this in a moment,

44:42.020 --> 44:45.060
had secret information that we didn't have,

44:45.060 --> 44:48.380
that in my mind massively increases the possibility

44:48.380 --> 44:50.020
of a lab incident origin,

44:50.980 --> 44:55.900
I, Peter Daszak, would like to guide the public conversation

44:55.900 --> 44:58.900
in the direction where I think it should go

44:58.900 --> 45:03.620
and in support of the kind of international collaboration

45:03.620 --> 45:04.460
that I think is necessary.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.260
That's a strong positive description

45:06.260 --> 45:11.260
because it's true that there's a lot of political BS

45:11.940 --> 45:16.940
and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies

45:17.420 --> 45:18.980
as we've talked about.

45:18.980 --> 45:21.140
And so it's very convenient to say, you know what,

45:21.140 --> 45:24.100
let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies

45:24.100 --> 45:26.260
and my favorite word, misinformation.

45:27.180 --> 45:31.820
And then because the way out from this serious pandemic

45:31.820 --> 45:33.460
is for us to work together,

45:33.460 --> 45:36.300
so let's strengthen our partnerships

45:36.300 --> 45:38.500
and everything else is just like noise.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.020
Yeah, so let's, and so then now I wanna do

45:41.020 --> 45:43.500
my personal indictment of Peter Daszak

45:43.500 --> 45:46.860
because that's my view, but I wanted to fairly,

45:46.860 --> 45:51.860
because I think that we all tell ourselves stories

45:51.900 --> 45:56.380
and also when you're a science communicator,

45:56.380 --> 45:59.220
you can't in your public communications

45:59.220 --> 46:03.300
give every doubt that you have or every nuance,

46:03.300 --> 46:05.780
you kind of have to summarize things.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.540
And so I think that he was, again,

46:07.540 --> 46:10.740
in this benign interpretation trying to summarize

46:10.740 --> 46:13.940
in the way that he thought the conversations should go.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.700
Here's my indictment of Peter Daszak.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.940
And I feel like Brutus here,

46:20.940 --> 46:25.940
but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak

46:26.060 --> 46:29.260
because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this

46:29.260 --> 46:31.660
and making all of these statements about,

46:31.660 --> 46:34.420
well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin,

46:34.420 --> 46:38.180
then there was this February 2020 Lancet letter

46:38.180 --> 46:40.980
where it turns out, and we only knew this later,

46:40.980 --> 46:42.860
that he was highly manipulative.

46:42.860 --> 46:45.300
So he was recruiting all of these people.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.540
He drafted the infamous letter

46:47.540 --> 46:50.700
calling people like me conspiracy theorists.

46:50.700 --> 46:54.540
He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang,

46:54.540 --> 46:57.220
who are also very high profile virologists saying,

46:57.220 --> 46:59.100
well, let's not put our names on it

46:59.100 --> 47:01.940
so it doesn't look like we're doing it,

47:01.940 --> 47:04.540
even though they were doing it.

47:04.540 --> 47:09.420
He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had.

47:09.420 --> 47:10.860
It was a strategic move.

47:10.860 --> 47:13.700
So just in case people are not familiar,

47:13.700 --> 47:18.700
February 2020 Lancet letter was TLDR,

47:20.140 --> 47:24.900
is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory.

47:24.900 --> 47:26.620
Essentially, yes.

47:26.620 --> 47:29.660
So with the authority of science,

47:29.660 --> 47:34.660
not saying it's highly likely, saying it's obvious, duh,

47:35.340 --> 47:40.340
it's natural origin, everybody else is just,

47:40.860 --> 47:42.820
everything else is just misinformation,

47:42.820 --> 47:44.940
and look, there's a bunch of really smart people

47:44.940 --> 47:46.420
that sign this, therefore it's true.

47:46.420 --> 47:50.020
Yeah, not only that, so there were the people who,

47:50.020 --> 47:51.780
27 people signed that letter,

47:51.780 --> 47:54.420
and then after President Trump cut funding

47:54.420 --> 47:59.020
to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates

47:59.020 --> 48:01.740
to have a public letter criticizing that.

48:01.740 --> 48:06.460
But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know

48:06.460 --> 48:10.980
is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance,

48:10.980 --> 48:13.700
in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology

48:13.700 --> 48:18.700
and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA,

48:19.380 --> 48:22.140
which is kind of like the VC side

48:22.140 --> 48:25.540
of the venture capital side of the Defense Department,

48:25.540 --> 48:29.380
they're kind of, where they do kind of big ideas.

48:29.380 --> 48:31.180
By the way, as a tiny tangent,

48:31.180 --> 48:33.940
I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA,

48:33.940 --> 48:36.340
they fund a lot of excellent robotics research.

48:36.340 --> 48:39.220
And DARPA's incredible, and among the things

48:39.220 --> 48:41.100
that they applied for is that WE,

48:41.100 --> 48:42.460
meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology,

48:42.460 --> 48:45.020
is gonna go and it's gonna collect

48:45.020 --> 48:49.460
the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in southern China,

48:49.460 --> 48:52.380
and then we, as this group,

48:52.380 --> 48:56.660
are going to genetically engineer these viruses

48:56.660 --> 48:59.820
to insert a furan cleavage site.

48:59.820 --> 49:02.660
So I think when everyone's now seen the image

49:02.660 --> 49:06.380
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it has these little spike proteins,

49:06.380 --> 49:07.980
these little things that stick out,

49:07.980 --> 49:09.940
which is why they call it a coronavirus.

49:09.940 --> 49:12.420
Within that spike protein are these furan cleavage sites

49:12.420 --> 49:15.780
which basically help with the virus getting access

49:15.780 --> 49:18.660
into our cells, and they're going

49:18.660 --> 49:21.740
to genetically engineer these furan cleavage sites

49:21.740 --> 49:26.420
into these bat coronaviruses, the Cervicoviruses.

49:26.420 --> 49:30.740
And then, and so then, a year and a half later,

49:30.740 --> 49:31.780
what do we see?

49:31.780 --> 49:36.780
We see a bat coronavirus with a furan cleavage site

49:36.780 --> 49:39.900
unlike anything that we've ever seen before

49:39.900 --> 49:44.260
in that category of SARS-like coronaviruses.

49:44.460 --> 49:49.060
Well, yes, I mean, DARPA very correctly

49:49.060 --> 49:50.900
didn't support that application.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.100
Well, let's actually, let's pause on that.

49:53.100 --> 49:56.100
So for a lot of people, that's like the smoking gun.

49:56.100 --> 50:01.100
Okay, let's talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.180
So I guess who's drafted the proposal?

50:04.180 --> 50:05.020
Is it?

50:05.020 --> 50:05.860
It's EcoHealth.

50:05.860 --> 50:09.260
EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do research.

50:09.260 --> 50:14.260
EcoHealth is technically a U.S.-funded organization.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.500
Primarily.

50:15.500 --> 50:18.500
And then the idea was to do work

50:18.500 --> 50:20.860
at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.300
With, yeah, so it was.

50:22.300 --> 50:23.140
With EcoHealth.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.980
Yeah, so EcoHealth, basically,

50:24.980 --> 50:27.620
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was gonna go

50:27.620 --> 50:29.860
and they were gonna collect these viruses

50:29.860 --> 50:31.820
and store them at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.660
But they're also gonna do the actual.

50:33.660 --> 50:35.460
According, it's a really important point.

50:35.460 --> 50:38.540
According to their proposal, the actual work

50:38.540 --> 50:41.740
was going to be done at the lab of Ralph Baric

50:41.740 --> 50:43.380
at the University of North Carolina,

50:43.380 --> 50:46.140
who's probably the world's leading expert

50:46.140 --> 50:49.420
on coronaviruses.

50:49.420 --> 50:54.420
And so we know that DARPA didn't fund that work.

50:55.500 --> 51:00.340
We know, I think quite well, that Ralph Baric's lab,

51:00.340 --> 51:05.260
in part, because it was not funded by DARPA,

51:05.260 --> 51:07.500
they didn't do that specific work.

51:07.500 --> 51:11.660
What we don't know is, well, what work was done

51:11.660 --> 51:13.700
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

51:13.700 --> 51:16.940
because WIV was part of this proposal.

51:16.940 --> 51:19.700
They had access to all of the plans.

51:19.700 --> 51:22.420
They had done, they had their own capacity,

51:22.420 --> 51:24.980
and they had already done a lot of work

51:24.980 --> 51:29.980
in genetically altering this exact category of viruses.

51:30.140 --> 51:34.420
They had created chimeric mixed viruses.

51:34.420 --> 51:39.100
They had mastered pretty much all of the steps

51:39.100 --> 51:40.660
in order to achieve this thing

51:40.660 --> 51:44.220
that they applied for funding with EcoHealth to do.

51:44.220 --> 51:49.220
And so the question is, did the Wuhan Institute of Virology

51:49.220 --> 51:51.860
go through with that research anyway?

51:51.860 --> 51:55.340
And in my mind, that's a very, very real possibility.

51:55.340 --> 51:56.180
It would certainly explain

51:56.180 --> 51:58.540
why they're giving no information.

51:58.540 --> 52:01.500
And as you know, I've been a member

52:01.500 --> 52:04.100
of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee

52:04.100 --> 52:07.540
on Human Genome Editing, which Dr. Tedros created

52:07.540 --> 52:09.220
in the aftermath of the announcement

52:09.220 --> 52:11.660
of the world's first CRISPR babies.

52:11.660 --> 52:14.260
And it was just basically the exact same story.

52:14.260 --> 52:16.660
So Ho-Jong Kuei, a Chinese scientist,

52:16.660 --> 52:18.100
it was not a first-tier scientist,

52:18.100 --> 52:21.180
but a perfectly adequate second-tier scientist,

52:21.180 --> 52:23.780
came to the United States, learned all of these capacities,

52:23.780 --> 52:25.060
went back to China and said,

52:25.060 --> 52:28.100
well, there's a much more permissive environment.

52:28.100 --> 52:30.500
I'm gonna be a world leader.

52:30.500 --> 52:33.220
I'm gonna establish both myself and China.

52:33.260 --> 52:35.340
So in every scientific field,

52:35.340 --> 52:38.140
we're seeing this same thing where you kind of

52:38.140 --> 52:41.500
learn a model and then you do it in China.

52:41.500 --> 52:45.620
So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

52:45.620 --> 52:49.900
with this exact game plan, was doing it anyway?

52:49.900 --> 52:51.740
Do we, possible?

52:51.740 --> 52:55.060
We have no clue what work was being done

52:55.060 --> 52:56.860
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

52:56.860 --> 52:59.780
It seems extremely likely

52:59.780 --> 53:02.020
that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

53:02.060 --> 53:04.500
and this is certainly the U.S. government position,

53:04.500 --> 53:08.260
there was the work that was being done in Dr. Xu's lab,

53:08.260 --> 53:10.300
but that wasn't the whole WIV.

53:10.300 --> 53:12.580
We know, at least according to the United States government,

53:12.580 --> 53:14.140
that there was the Chinese military,

53:14.140 --> 53:17.540
the PLA was doing work there.

53:17.540 --> 53:19.780
Were they doing this kind of work,

53:19.780 --> 53:22.100
not to create a bio-weapon,

53:22.100 --> 53:25.060
but in order to understand these viruses,

53:25.060 --> 53:28.220
maybe to develop vaccines and treatments?

53:28.220 --> 53:33.140
It seems like a very, very logical possibility.

53:33.140 --> 53:36.260
And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

53:36.260 --> 53:37.580
had all of the skills.

53:37.580 --> 53:40.660
We know that they were part of this proposal.

53:40.660 --> 53:43.780
And then you have Peter Daszak, who knows all of this,

53:43.780 --> 53:47.340
that at that time, in February of 2020, we didn't know.

53:47.340 --> 53:49.540
But then he comes swinging out of the gate,

53:49.540 --> 53:52.580
saying anybody who's raising this possibility

53:52.580 --> 53:57.020
of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.

53:57.020 --> 54:00.500
I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind,

54:00.500 --> 54:01.740
very, very bad.

54:01.740 --> 54:04.500
Not to at least be somewhat open-minded on this,

54:04.500 --> 54:06.100
because he knows all the details.

54:06.100 --> 54:09.020
He knows that it's not 0%.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.820
I mean, there's no way in his mind

54:10.820 --> 54:12.100
could you even argue that.

54:12.100 --> 54:14.220
So it's potential because of the bias,

54:14.220 --> 54:16.180
because of your focus.

54:16.180 --> 54:20.300
I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci masks thing,

54:20.300 --> 54:23.340
whereas he knows there's some significant probability

54:23.340 --> 54:24.260
that this is happening.

54:24.260 --> 54:28.700
But in order to preserve good relations

54:28.700 --> 54:30.140
with our Chinese colleagues,

54:30.140 --> 54:33.020
we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative.

54:33.020 --> 54:34.740
So it's not really lying.

54:34.740 --> 54:39.220
It's doing the best possible action at this time

54:39.220 --> 54:40.420
to help the world.

54:40.420 --> 54:42.180
Not that this already happened.

54:42.180 --> 54:44.020
But that's how like...

54:44.020 --> 54:47.460
I think it's quite likely that that was the story

54:47.460 --> 54:49.460
that he was telling himself.

54:49.460 --> 54:54.460
But that lack of transparency in my mind is fraudulent,

54:57.660 --> 55:00.380
that we were struggling to understand something

55:00.380 --> 55:02.500
that we didn't understand,

55:02.500 --> 55:04.380
and that I just think that people

55:04.380 --> 55:07.020
who possess that kind of information,

55:07.020 --> 55:10.020
especially when the existence,

55:10.020 --> 55:12.300
like the entire career of Peter Daszak

55:12.300 --> 55:14.300
is based on US taxpayers,

55:14.300 --> 55:16.740
there's a debt that comes with that.

55:16.740 --> 55:19.020
And that debt is honesty and transparency.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.820
You talked about your girlfriend checking your phone.

55:22.820 --> 55:26.260
For all of us, being honest and transparent

55:26.260 --> 55:29.180
in the most difficult times is really difficult.

55:29.180 --> 55:31.300
If it were easy, everybody would do it.

55:31.300 --> 55:36.300
And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent

55:37.260 --> 55:39.660
and then went on the offensive,

55:39.660 --> 55:44.260
and then had the gall of joining,

55:44.260 --> 55:45.940
I know we can talk about this,

55:45.980 --> 55:50.980
this highly compromised joint study process

55:51.500 --> 55:54.300
with the international experts

55:54.300 --> 55:56.540
and their Chinese government counterparts,

55:56.540 --> 56:00.500
and used that as a way of furthering this,

56:01.540 --> 56:05.020
in my mind, fraudulent narrative

56:05.020 --> 56:09.020
that it almost certainly came from natural origins

56:09.020 --> 56:12.740
and a lab origin was extremely unlikely.

56:12.740 --> 56:15.900
Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up,

56:15.900 --> 56:20.900
because I do think in a kind of John Stewart way,

56:21.940 --> 56:24.340
if you heard that a bit,

56:24.340 --> 56:29.340
he had sort of kind of like common sense way,

56:30.420 --> 56:35.340
the 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance

56:35.340 --> 56:38.220
and Wuhan Institute of Virology,

56:38.220 --> 56:40.980
just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me.

56:41.020 --> 56:41.860
Like that.

56:43.660 --> 56:46.780
So there's this excellent book that people should read

56:46.780 --> 56:50.300
called Viro, The Search for the Origin of COVID-19,

56:50.300 --> 56:54.460
Matt Ridley and Alina Chan, I think Alina is in MIT,

56:54.460 --> 56:57.780
probably at Broad Institute, yeah, yeah.

56:57.780 --> 57:00.820
So she, I heard her in an interview

57:00.820 --> 57:04.020
give this analogy of unicorns

57:04.020 --> 57:09.020
and where basically somebody writes a proposal

57:09.180 --> 57:14.180
to add horns to horses, the proposal is rejected.

57:14.500 --> 57:16.580
And then a couple of years later,

57:16.580 --> 57:19.900
a year later, a unicorn shows up.

57:19.900 --> 57:23.220
In the place where they're proposing to do it.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.060
I mean, that's how I had.

57:24.060 --> 57:26.820
And then everyone was like, is natural origin?

57:26.820 --> 57:28.980
It's like, it's possible it's natural origin.

57:28.980 --> 57:31.020
Like we haven't detected a unicorn yet,

57:31.020 --> 57:33.700
and this is the first time we've detected a unicorn.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.820
Or it could be this massive organization

57:36.820 --> 57:39.500
that was planning is fully equipped,

57:39.500 --> 57:42.860
has like a history of being able to do this stuff,

57:42.860 --> 57:45.100
has the world experts to do it, has the funding,

57:45.100 --> 57:48.620
has the motivation to add horns to horses.

57:48.620 --> 57:51.060
And now unicorn shows up and they're saying,

57:51.060 --> 57:54.420
nope, definitely natural origin.

57:54.420 --> 57:56.860
That connects to your first question

57:56.860 --> 57:59.220
of how do I get to my 85%?

57:59.220 --> 58:03.140
And here's a summary of that answer.

58:03.140 --> 58:06.340
And so it's what I said in my 60 minutes interview

58:06.340 --> 58:08.020
a long time ago of all the gin joints

58:08.020 --> 58:09.260
in all the towns in all the world,

58:09.260 --> 58:11.820
the quote from Casablanca.

58:11.820 --> 58:14.660
And so of all the places in the world

58:14.660 --> 58:19.660
where we have an outbreak of a SARS-like bat coronavirus,

58:19.860 --> 58:23.620
it's not in the area of the natural habitat

58:23.620 --> 58:25.700
of the horseshoe bats.

58:25.700 --> 58:29.220
It's the one city in China

58:29.220 --> 58:33.380
with the first and largest level four virology lab,

58:33.380 --> 58:34.980
which actually wasn't even using it.

58:34.980 --> 58:38.460
They were doing level three and level two for this work

58:38.460 --> 58:40.180
where they had the world's largest collection

58:40.180 --> 58:42.300
of bat coronaviruses,

58:42.300 --> 58:45.540
where they were doing aggressive experiments

58:45.540 --> 58:50.100
designed to make these scary viruses scarier,

58:50.100 --> 58:53.300
where they had been part of an application

58:53.300 --> 58:58.300
to insert a furin cleavage site able to infect human cells

59:00.260 --> 59:03.300
and where when the outbreak happened,

59:03.300 --> 59:07.500
we had a virus that was ready for action to infect humans

59:07.500 --> 59:10.140
and to this day, better able to infect humans

59:10.140 --> 59:13.780
than any other species, including bats.

59:13.780 --> 59:17.740
And then from day one, there's this massive coverup.

59:17.740 --> 59:19.380
And then on top of that,

59:19.380 --> 59:22.220
in spite of lots of efforts by lots of people,

59:22.220 --> 59:24.980
there's basically no evidence

59:24.980 --> 59:27.580
for the natural origin hypothesis.

59:27.580 --> 59:30.260
Everything that I've described just now is circumstantial,

59:30.260 --> 59:32.100
but there's a certain point

59:32.100 --> 59:34.540
of where you add up the circumstances

59:34.540 --> 59:37.820
and you see this seems pretty, pretty likely.

59:37.820 --> 59:39.860
I mean, if we're getting to 100%,

59:39.860 --> 59:42.460
we are not at 100% by any means.

59:42.460 --> 59:45.620
There still is a possibility of a natural origin

59:45.620 --> 59:47.140
and if we find that, great.

59:47.140 --> 59:50.900
But from everything that I know, that's how I get to my 85.

59:50.900 --> 59:54.260
And we'll talk about why this matters

59:54.260 --> 59:56.620
in a political sense, in a human sense,

59:56.620 --> 59:59.380
in the science, in the realm of science,

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.460
all of those factors.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.380
But first, as Nietzsche said, let us look into the abyss

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.380
and the games we'll play with monsters

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.620
that is colloquially called gain of function research.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.700
Let me ask the kind of political sounding question,

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.860
which is how people usually phrase it.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:21.860
Did Anthony Fauci fund gain of function research

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.820
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.820
So it depends.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.580
I mean, I've obviously been very closely monitoring this.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.820
I've spoken a lot about it.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.700
I've written about it.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.860
And it depends on, I mean, not to quote Bill Clinton,

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.220
but to quote Bill Clinton,

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.780
it depends on what the definition of is is.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.780
And so if you use a common sense definition

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.940
of gain of function, and by gain of function,

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.460
there are lots of things like gene therapies

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.300
that are gain of function,

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.700
but here what we mean is gain of function

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
for pathogens able, potentially able to create

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.220
human pandemics.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.940
But if you use the kind of common sense language,

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.580
well, then he probably did.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.940
If you use the technical language

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.940
from a 2017 NIH document,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.860
and you read that language very narrowly,

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.380
I think you can make a credible argument that he did not.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.980
There's a question though,

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.540
and Francis Collins talked about that

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.620
in his interview with you.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.540
But then there's a question that we know

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.060
from now that we have the information of the reports

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.460
submitted by EcoHealth Alliance to the NIH,

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.860
and some of which were late or not even delivered,

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.180
that some of this research was done on MERS,

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.900
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.220
And if that was the case,

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.020
there is I think a colorable argument

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.900
that that would be considered gain of function research,

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.660
even by the narrow language of that 2017 document.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.540
But I definitely think,

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.980
and I've said this repeatedly,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.140
that Rand Paul can be right,

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.100
and Tony Fauci can be right.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.380
And the question is how are we defining gain of function?

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.540
And that's why I've always said the question in my mind

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.700
isn't was it or wasn't it gain of function

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.940
as if that's like a binary thing,

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.980
if not, great, and if yes, guilty.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.700
The question is just what work was being done

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.780
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.580
What role, if any, did US government funding

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.820
play in supporting that work?

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.340
And what rights do we all have as human beings

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.780
and as American citizens and taxpayers

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:47.100
to get all of the relevant information about them?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.220
So let's try to kind of dissect this.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.780
So who frustrates you more?

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.380
Rand Paul or Anthony Fauci's discussion

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.660
or the discussion itself?

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.900
So for example, gain of function is a term

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.900
that's kind of more used just to mean

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.660
playing with viruses in the lab

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.980
to try to develop more dangerous viruses.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:21.060
Is this kind of research a good idea?

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.740
Is it also a good idea for us to talk about it in public

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.860
in the political way that it's been talked about?

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.860
Is it okay that US may have funded

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.980
gain of function research elsewhere?

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:43.540
I mean, it's kind of assumed, just like with Bill Clinton,

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.660
there was very little discussion of, I think,

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.580
correct me if I'm wrong, but whether it's okay

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.100
for a president, male or female,

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.540
to have extramarital sex, okay?

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.540
Or is it okay for a president to have extramarital sex

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:07.980
with people on his staff or her staff?

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.260
It was more the discussion of lying, I think.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.020
It was, did you lie about having sex or not?

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.340
And in this gain of function discussion,

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.580
what frustrates me personally

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.180
is there's not a deep philosophical discussion

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.740
about whether we should be doing this kind of research

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.620
and what kinds, what are the ethical lines?

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.340
Research on animals at all.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.660
Those are fascinating questions.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.460
Instead, it's a gotcha thing.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.420
Did you or did you not fund research on gain of function?

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.740
And did you fund, it's almost like a bioweapon.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.780
Did you give money to China to develop this bioweapon

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.740
that now attacked the rest of the world?

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.780
So, I mean, all those things are pretty frustrating,

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.340
but is there, I think the thing you can untangle

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.660
about Anthony Fauci and gain of function research

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.740
in the United States and Equal Health Alliance

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.100
and Wuhan Institute of Virology,

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.340
that's kind of, that's clarifying.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.820
What were the mistakes made?

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.060
Sure, so on gain of function,

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.380
there actually has been a lot of debate.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:18.020
I mentioned before in 2011, these first papers,

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:21.020
there was a big debate, Mark Lipsitch,

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:25.340
who's formerly at Harvard now with the US government

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.980
working in the president's office.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.660
He led a thing called the Cambridge Group

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.460
that was highly critical of this work,

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.660
but basically saying we're creating monsters.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.180
They had the funding pause in 2014.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.740
They spent three years putting together a framework

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.300
and then they lifted it in 2017.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.180
So we had a thoughtful conversation.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.620
Unfortunately, it didn't work.

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.900
And I think that's where we are now.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.940
So I absolutely think that there are real issues

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.660
with the relationship between the United States government

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.660
and Equal Health Alliance and through that,

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.380
Equal Health Alliance with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.260
And one issue is just essential transparency,

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.020
because as I see it, it's most likely the case

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.900
that we transferred a lot of our knowledge and plans

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.700
and things to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.700
And again, I'm sure that Xuejian Li

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.140
is not herself a monster.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.260
I'm sure of that, even though I've never met her.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.140
But there are just a different set of pressures

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.460
on people working in an authoritarian system

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.380
than people who are working in other systems.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.500
That doesn't mean it's entirely different.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:40.740
And so I absolutely think that we shouldn't give $1

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.060
to an organization and certainly a Virology Institute

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.820
where you don't have full access to their records,

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.020
to their databases.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.460
We don't know what work is happening there.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.140
And I think that we need to have

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.860
that kind of full examination.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.860
And that's why, so I understand what Dr. Fauci is doing

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.140
is saying, hey, what I hear, Dr. Fauci is saying,

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.900
what I hear from you, Rand Paul,

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.780
is you're accusing me of starting this pandemic

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.420
and you're using gain of function as a proxy for that.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.340
And we have in, when there are Senate hearings,

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.300
every Senator gets five minutes.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.540
And the name of the game is to translate your five minutes

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.060
into a clip that's going to run on the news.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.940
And so I get that there is that kind of gotcha.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.220
But I also think that the Dr. Fauci

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.780
and the National Institute of Allergy

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.220
and Infectious Diseases and the NIH

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.140
should have been more transparent.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:41.140
Because I think that in this day and age

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.940
where there are a lot of people poking around

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.420
in this whole story of COVID origins,

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.500
we would not be where we are

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.140
if it wasn't for a relatively small number of people.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.780
And I'm part of, there are two, as I know, two groups.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:58.100
One is these internet sleuths known as drastic.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.620
And a number of them are part of a group

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.340
that I'm part of called, it's not our official name,

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.300
but called the Paris Group.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:08.460
It's about two dozen experts around the world,

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:13.380
but centered around some very high level French academics.

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.500
So we've all been digging

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.620
and meeting with each other regularly since last year.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.500
And our governments across the board, certainly China,

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.460
but including the United States,

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.340
haven't been as transparent as they need to be.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.460
So there's definitely mistakes were made on all sides.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.740
And that's why for me from day one,

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:37.180
I've been calling for a comprehensive investigation

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.900
into this issue that certainly obviously looks at China,

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.060
but we have to look at ourselves.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.580
We did not get this right.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.580
So to you, I'm just gonna put Rand Paul aside here.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.460
Politician playing political games, it's very frustrating,

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.580
but it is what it is on all sides.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.140
Anthony Fauci, you think should have been more transparent

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:06.140
and maybe more eloquent in expressing the complexity

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.780
of all of this, the uncertainty in all of this.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.540
Yeah, and I get that it's really hard to do that

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.180
because let's say you have one, you speak a paragraph

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.140
and it's got four sentences.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.740
And one of those sentences is the thing

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.180
that's going to be turned into Twitter and-

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.300
All right, Jamie, let me put it back.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.500
I get really, so I'll try not to be emotional about this,

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:37.500
but I've heard Anthony Fauci a couple of times now

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.740
say that he represents science.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.580
I know what he means by that.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.940
He means in this political bickering,

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.140
all that kind of stuff that for a lot of people,

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.460
he represents science, but words matter.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.620
And this isn't just clips.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.420
I mean, maybe I'm distinctly aware of that

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.340
during this podcast.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.140
Like, yeah, I talk for like hundreds of hours now,

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.220
maybe over a thousand hours,

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.220
but like I'm still careful with the words.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.180
Like I'm trying not to be an asshole

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.860
and I'm aware when I'm an asshole

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.300
and I'll apologize for it.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.380
Like if the words I represent science left my mouth,

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.740
which they very well could,

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.060
I would sure as hell be apologizing for it.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.140
And not enough because I got in trouble,

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.500
I would just feel bad about saying something like that.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.660
And even that little phrase, I represent science.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.140
No, Dr. Fauci, you do not represent science.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.500
I love science, the millions of scientists

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.180
that inspired me to get into it,

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:48.100
to fall in love with the scientific method

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.140
in the exploration of ideas through the rigor of science

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.180
that Anthony Fauci does not represent.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.500
He's one, I believe, great scientist of millions.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.300
He does not represent anybody.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.780
He's just one scientist.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.860
And I think the greatness of a scientist

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.980
is best exemplified in humility

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.660
because the scientific method basically says,

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.900
you're standing before the fog, the mystery of it all,

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.260
and slowly chipping away at the mystery.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.500
And it's embarrassing, it's humiliating

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500
how little you know.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.860
That's the experience.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.540
So the great scientists have to have humility to me.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.380
And especially in their communication,

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.780
they have to have humility.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.060
And I don't know, and some of it is also words matter

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:44.580
because great leaders have to have

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.180
the poetry of action.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:50.180
They have to be bold and inspire action

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.740
across millions of people.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:57.740
But you also have to, through that poetry of words,

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.780
express the complexity of the uncertainty

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.300
you're operating under.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.700
Be humble in the face of not being able

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.620
to predict the future or understand the past

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620
or really know what's the right thing to do,

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.180
but we have to do something.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.700
And through that, you have to be a great leader

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.980
that inspires action.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.980
And some of that is just words, and he chose words poorly.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:25.420
I mean, so I'm all torn about this.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:28.180
And then there's politicians that are taking those words

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.620
and magnifying them and playing games with them.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.340
And of course, that's a decent incentive

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.740
for the people who do, the scientific leaders

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.620
that step into the limelight to say any more words.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.500
So they kind of become more conservative

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.380
with the words they use.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.100
I mean, it just becomes a giant mess,

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:52.100
but I think the solution is to ignore all of that

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.820
and to be transparent, to be honest, to be vulnerable,

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.620
and to express the full uncertainty

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.620
of what you're operating under,

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.940
to present all the possible actions,

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.380
and to be honest about the mistakes they made in the past.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.380
I mean, there's something, even if you're not

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.020
directly responsible for those mistakes,

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:18.020
taking responsibility for them is a way to win people over.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.380
I don't think leaders realize this often

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.260
in the modern age, in the internet age.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.980
They can see through your bullshit.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:29.180
And it's really inspiring when you take ownership.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.740
So to do the thought experiment in public,

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.340
do a thought experiment, if there was a lab leak,

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.980
and then lay out all the funding, the EcoHealth Alliance,

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.900
all the incredible science going on

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.420
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the NIH.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.500
Lay out all the possible ethical problems,

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:53.500
lay out all the possible mistakes that could have been made

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.220
and say, like, this could have happened,

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.540
and if this happened, here's the best way to respond to it

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.900
and to prevent it in the future,

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.900
and just lay all that complexity out.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.060
And I wish we would have seen that,

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.420
and I have hope that this conversation,

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.820
conversations like it, your work,

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:15.860
and books on this topic will inspire young people today

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.620
when they become in the Anthony Fauci's role

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.180
to be much more transparent and much more humble

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.620
and all of those kinds of things,

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.100
that this is just a relic of the past.

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.020
When there's a person, no offense to me,

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.580
in a suit that has to stand up

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.980
and speak with clarity and certainty,

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.780
I mean, that's just a relic of the past.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.780
And that is my hope, but.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.540
Do you mind if I, Matt,

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:46.260
because I agree with a great deal of what you said,

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.780
and it's really unfortunate that our,

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.900
certainly the Chinese government, as I said before,

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.580
our government wasn't as transparent

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.980
as I feel they should have been,

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.660
particularly in the early days of the pandemic,

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.460
and particularly with regard

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.420
to the issue of pandemic origins.

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.780
I mean, we know that Dr. Fauci was on calls

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.700
with people like Christian Anderson at Scripps and others

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.460
in those early days, raising questions,

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.700
is this an engineered virus?

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.580
There were a lot of questions, and it's kind of sad.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:23.540
I mean, as I mentioned before, I've been one,

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.660
I mean, and certainly there were others,

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.780
but there weren't a lot of us,

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.820
of the people who from the earliest days of the pandemic

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:34.700
were raising questions about, hey, not so fast.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:38.580
Here, and I launched my website on pandemic origins

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.220
in April of last year, April, 2020.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.620
It got a huge amount of attention,

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.980
and actually my friend, Matt Pottinger,

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.940
who is the Deputy National Security Advisor,

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:50.500
when he was reaching out to people in the US government

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.860
and in allied governments saying,

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.380
hey, we should look into this,

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.780
what he was sending them was my website.

01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:00.180
It wasn't some US government information.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.260
And by the way, people should still go to the website.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.100
I hope so.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:07.340
You keep updating it, and it's an incredible resource.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.180
Well, thank you, thank you.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.020
JamieMetzel.com.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:13.420
And it's really unfortunate that our governments

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.180
and international institutions,

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.300
for pretty much all of 2020,

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.500
weren't doing their jobs of really probing this issue.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.460
People were hiding behind this kind of false consensus.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.460
And I'm critical of many people,

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.420
even when I heard Francis Collins' interview with you,

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.220
I just felt, well, he wasn't as balanced

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.380
on the issue of COVID origins.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.420
Certainly Dr. Fauci could have,

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.220
in his conversation with Rand Paul,

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.340
it wasn't even a conversation,

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:46.540
but in some process in the aftermath,

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.260
could have laid things out a bit better.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.860
He did say, and Francis Collins did say,

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:54.260
that we don't know the origins, and that was a shift,

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.100
and we need to have an investigation.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.580
So now, but having said all of that,

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.900
I do kind of, one, I have tremendous respect for Dr. Fauci

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.820
for the work that he's done on HIV AIDS.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.860
I mean, I have been vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.980
Dr. Fauci was a big part of the story

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.620
of getting us these vaccines

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.420
that have saved millions and millions of lives.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.180
And so I don't think, I mean, there's a lot to this story.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.740
And then the second thing is,

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.380
it's really hard to be a public health expert

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.100
because you have, your mission is public health.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.740
And so, and you have to,

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:37.780
if you are leading with all of your uncertainty,

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.460
it's a really hard way to do things.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.620
And so, like even now, like if I go to CVS

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.940
and I get a Tylenol, somebody has done a calculation

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.500
of how many people will die from taking Tylenol,

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.020
and they say, well, we can live with that.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.940
And that's why we have regulation.

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.100
And so all of us are doing kind of summaries.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.900
And then we have people in public health who are saying,

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.860
well, we've summed it all up and you should do X.

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.460
You should get your kids vaccinated for measles.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.900
You should not drive your car at a hundred miles an hour.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.220
You should, don't drink lighter fluid,

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.340
whatever these things are.

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:20.940
And we want them to kind of give us broad guidelines.

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:25.220
And yet now our information world is so fragmented

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:29.780
that if you're not being honest about something,

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:33.220
something material, someone's going to find out

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.980
and it's going to undermine your credibility.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.420
And so I agree with you

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:42.420
that there's a greater requirement for transparency now.

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.460
Maybe there always has been,

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.500
but there's an even greater requirement for it now

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:53.500
because people want to trust that you're speaking honestly

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.060
and that you're saying, well, here's what I know.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.100
And this is based on what I know.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.500
Here are the conclusions that I draw.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.460
But if it's just, and again, I don't think the words,

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.940
I'm science or whatever it was are the right words,

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.820
but if it's just, trust me because of who I am,

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.540
I don't think that flies anywhere anymore.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:18.020
Can I just ask you about the Francis Collins interview

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.980
that I did if you got a chance to hear that part?

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.660
I think in the beginning we talked about the loud leak.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.860
What are your thoughts about his response?

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.780
Basically saying it's worthy of an investigation,

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.460
but I mean, I don't know how you would interpret it.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:38.460
I see it's funny because I heard it in the moment

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:44.620
as it's great for the head of NIH to be open-minded on this.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:49.460
But then the internet and Mr. Joe Rogan,

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.460
a bunch of friends and colleagues told me that,

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.060
yeah, well, that's too late and too little.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.460
Yeah, so first let me say,

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.380
I've been on Joe's podcast twice and I love the guy,

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.780
which doesn't mean that I agree

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.820
with everything he does or says.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.020
And on this issue, and I'm normally a pretty calm

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.340
and measured guy, and when you're just out running

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:19.140
with your AirPods on and you start yelling

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.060
into the wind in Central Park,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.300
nobody else knows why you're yelling.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.980
So you had such a moment?

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:28.620
I had a moment with Collins.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.060
And again, Francis Collins is someone

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.100
I respect enormously.

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.700
I mean, I live a big chunk of my life

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.180
living in the world of genetics and biotech

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.100
and my book, Hacking Darwin,

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.620
is about the future of human genetic engineering

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.820
and his work on the Human Genome Project

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.900
and so many other things have been fantastic.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.860
And I'm a huge fan of the work of NIH.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:54.540
And he was right to say that the Chinese government

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.340
hasn't been forthcoming and we need to look into it.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.580
But then you asked him, well, how will we know?

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.340
And then his answer was,

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.780
we need to find the intermediate host.

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.060
Remember I said before, and so that's the answer.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.500
That made it clear that he thought,

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.060
well, we should have an investigation,

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:16.460
but it comes from nature and we just need to find

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:20.220
that whatever it is, that intermediate animal host

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.460
in the wild and that'll tell us the story.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:25.620
So he already had the conclusion in mind

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.300
and they're just waiting for the evidence

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.380
to support the conclusion.

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.660
That was my feeling.

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.980
I felt like he was open in general,

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.180
but he was tilting.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.500
And again, your first question was, where do I fall?

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:41.540
He was like, I'm 85% or whatever it is, 80, 75, 90,

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.020
whatever it is in the direction of a lab incident.

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:49.780
It made it feel that he was 90, 10 in the other direction,

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.340
which is still means that he's open-minded

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.020
about the possibility.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.020
And that's why in my view, every single person

01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.540
who talks about this issue,

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.580
I think the right answer in my view is,

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.100
we don't know conclusively.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.740
In my, then this is my personal view,

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.500
the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.820
of a lab incident origin,

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.620
but that could immediately shift with additional information.

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:19.420
We need transparency, but we should come together

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.020
in absolutely condemning the outrageous coverup

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.020
carried out by the Chinese government,

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:31.020
which to this day is preventing any meaningful investigation

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.420
into pandemic origins.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.980
We have, if you use the economist numbers,

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.500
15 million people who are dead as a result of this pandemic.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.140
And I believe that the actions of the Chinese government

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:50.180
are disgracing the memory of these 15 million dead.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.180
They're insulting the families

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.340
and the billions of people around the world

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.580
who have suffered from this totally avoidable pandemic.

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:04.380
And whatever the origin, the fact the criminal coverup

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.060
carried out by the Chinese government,

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.460
which continues to this day,

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.660
but most intensely in the first months

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.180
following the outbreak,

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:16.860
that's the reason why we have so many dead.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.180
And certainly, as I was saying before,

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.380
I and a small number of others

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:25.020
have been carrying this flame since early last year,

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.140
but it's kind of crazy

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:29.860
that our governments haven't been demanding it.

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:30.740
And we can talk about

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.620
the World Health Organization process,

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.060
which was deeply compromised in the beginning.

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.940
Now it's become much, much better.

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.020
But again, it was the pressure of outsiders

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.740
that played such an important role

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.380
in shifting our national and international institutions.

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:50.900
And while that's better than nothing,

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.820
it would have been far better

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.480
if our governments and international organizations

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.860
had done the right thing from this point.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.980
If I could just make a couple of comments

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:03.340
about Joe Rogan.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:08.660
So there's a bunch of people in my life

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.780
who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot,

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.140
who I even look up to.

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.060
Many of them are alive, most of them are dead.

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.700
I wanna say that Joe said a few critical words

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.740
about the conversation with Francis Collins,

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.340
most of it offline,

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:30.140
with a lot of great conversations about it,

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.740
some he said publicly.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:37.740
And he was also critical to say that

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.980
me asking hard questions in an interview

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.380
is not my strong suit.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:53.300
And I really want to kind of respond to that,

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.660
which I did privately as well,

01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.540
publicly to say that Joe is 100% right on that.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.580
But that doesn't mean that always has to be the case.

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.700
And that is definitely something I wanna work on

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.820
because most of the conversations I have,

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:12.320
I wanna see the beautiful ideas in people's minds.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.940
But there's some times where you have to ask

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.720
the hard questions to bring out the beautiful ideas.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:24.100
And it's hard to do, it's a skill.

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.540
And Joe is very good at this.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.940
He says the way he put it in his criticisms,

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:31.700
and he does this in his conversations,

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.780
which is whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:36.580
There's a kind of sense like,

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.740
did you just say what you said?

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.580
Let's make sure we get to the bottom,

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.380
we'll clarify what you mean.

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:52.660
Because sometimes really big negative

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.580
or difficult ideas can be said

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:59.060
as a quick aside in a sentence.

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:02.700
Like it's nothing, but it could be everything.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.620
And you wanna make sure you catch that

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.340
and you talk about it.

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.780
And not as a gotcha, not as a kind of way

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.420
to destroy another human being,

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.840
but to reveal something profound.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.980
And that's definitely something I wanna work on.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:21.980
I also want to say that, as you said,

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.460
you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things.

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.460
So for a long time, Joe was somebody

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.100
that I was just a fan of, a listen to.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.900
He's now a good friend.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:34.540
And I would say we disagree more than we agree.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.760
And I love doing that.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:41.680
And, but at the same time, I learned from that.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.540
So it's like a dual, like nobody in this world

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.700
can tell me what to think.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:53.740
But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me.

01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.140
I think that's a good way to approach it.

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.340
Like I, whenever somebody has words of criticism,

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:05.260
I assume they're right and walk around with that idea.

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:07.400
To really sort of empathize with that idea

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.140
because there's a lesson there.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:14.140
And oftentimes my understanding of a topic becomes,

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:18.180
is altered completely, or it becomes much more nuanced,

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:23.180
or much richer for that kind of empathetic process.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.180
But definitely I do not allow anybody

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.740
to tell me what to think, whether it's Joe Rogan,

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.740
or Fyodor Dostoevsky, or Nietzsche, or my parents,

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.740
or the proverbial words of criticism,

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.740
the proverbial girlfriend, which I don't actually have.

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.740
But she's still busting my balls.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:52.740
Exactly, exactly, in my imagination.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:57.500
I have a girlfriend in Canada that I have imagined,

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.700
exactly, imagined conversations.

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.380
I so want to mention that.

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.940
But also, I don't know if you've gotten a chance

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.340
to see this, I'd love to also mention

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:11.340
this Twitter feud between two other interesting people,

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:15.780
which is Bret Weinstein and Sam Harris,

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:18.460
or Sam Harris and others in general.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:22.100
And it kind of breaks my heart that these two people

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.860
I listen to that are very thoughtful

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.820
about a bunch of issues, let's put COVID aside,

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.460
because people are very emotional about this topic.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.340
I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:39.100
and intelligent, whether you agree with them or not.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:42.100
And I always learn something from their conversations.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.940
And they are legitimately,

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.580
or have been for a long time friends.

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.420
And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.340
to see that they basically don't talk in private anymore.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:57.100
And there's occasional jabs on Twitter.

01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.140
And I hope that changes.

01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.260
I hope that changes in general for COVID,

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.140
that COVID brought out the, I would say,

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:10.100
the most emotional sides of people, the worst in people.

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.620
And I think there hasn't been enough

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.620
love and empathy and compassion.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.740
And to see two people from whom I've learned a lot,

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.740
whether it's Eric Weinstein, Bret Weinstein, Sam Harris,

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.500
you can criticize them as much as you want,

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.380
their ideas as much as you want.

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:30.260
But if you're not sufficiently open-minded

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.100
to admit that you have a lot to learn

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:37.780
from their conversations, I think you're not being honest.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.420
And so I do hope they have those conversations.

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.100
And I hope we can kind of,

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.980
I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post-COVID

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.660
of relationships, of conversations.

01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:53.900
And I think empathy and love can help a lot there.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:58.500
This is also just, I talked to Sam privately,

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.300
but this is also a public call-out

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.300
to put a little bit more love in the world.

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:13.060
And for these difficult conversations to happen.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.220
Because Bret Weinstein could be very wrong

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.500
about a bunch of topics here around COVID,

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500
but he could also be right.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.260
And the only way to find out is to have those conversations

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:32.820
because there's a lot of people listening

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.540
to both Sam Harris and Bret Weinstein.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.540
And if you go into these silos

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.180
where you just keep telling each other

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.700
that you are the possessors of truth

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.860
and nobody else is the possessor of truth,

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:53.540
what starts happening is you both lose track

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:56.140
or the capability of arriving at the truth

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.460
because nobody's in the possession of the truth.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.980
So anyway, it's just a call-out

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.580
that we should have a little bit more conversation,

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.420
a little bit more love.

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:04.260
I totally agree.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.020
And both of those guys are guys who I respect.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:11.620
And as you know, Bret, and again, as I mentioned,

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.780
there are just a handful of us

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:16.340
who were the early people raising questions

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.620
about the origins of this pandemic.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.220
He was there also talking.

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.100
So people have heard him speak quite a bit

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.020
about antiviral drugs and all that kind of stuff,

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.700
but he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.540
Yeah, exactly.

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.780
And so, but I completely agree with you

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.540
that we don't have to agree with everybody,

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:40.820
but it's great to have healthy conversations.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.220
That's how we grow.

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:46.780
And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of,

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:47.820
if we're not careful,

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.980
pushed into these little information pockets.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.860
And certainly on social media,

01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:54.060
I have different parts of my life.

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.700
One is focusing on issues of COVID origins,

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.020
and then I have genetics and biotechnology,

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:03.060
and then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later,

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:03.900
one shared world,

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.780
which is about how do we build a safer future?

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:10.460
And when I say critical things like the Chinese government,

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.020
we'd have to demand a full investigation

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.180
into pandemic origins, this is an outrage,

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.780
then it's really popular.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.740
When I say, let's build a better future for everyone

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.660
in peace and love,

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.020
it's like, wow, three people liked it,

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.060
and one was my mother.

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:28.060
And so I just feel like we need to build,

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:32.140
we used to have that connectivity just built in

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:34.100
because we had these town squares

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.100
and you couldn't get away from them.

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.780
Now we can get away from them.

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:41.260
So engaging with people who have a different background

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:42.500
is really essential.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.500
I mean, I'm on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week,

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:49.820
and I wouldn't, in my normal life,

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.620
I'm not watching that much of Fox News

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.300
or even television more generally,

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:59.020
but I just feel like if I just speak to people

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.740
who are very similar to me,

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.820
maybe it'll be comfortable, but what have I contributed?

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.780
And so I think we really have to have

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.820
those kinds of conversations and recognize

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.140
that at the end of the day,

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.820
most people wanna be happy,

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.340
they wanna live in a better world,

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.220
they maybe have different paths to get there,

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.660
but if we just break into camps

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.740
that don't even connect with each other,

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.620
that's a much more dangerous world.

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.460
Let's dive back into the difficult pool.

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.780
Yes.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:36.860
Just like you said, in the English speaking world,

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:41.860
it seems popular, almost easy to demonize China,

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.780
the Chinese government, I should say.

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:50.180
But even China, there's this kind of gray area

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.340
that people just fall into,

01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.940
and I'm really uncomfortable with that,

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:58.460
perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.140
are echoes of the Cold War and that kind of tension.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.900
It feels like we almost desire conflict,

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:12.060
so we see demons when there is none.

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:15.660
So I'm a little cautious to demonize,

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.140
but at the same time, you have to be honest.

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.340
So it's like honest with the demons that are there

01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.780
and honest when they're not.

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:29.300
This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session of sorts.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.780
So let's keep talking about China

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.020
a little bit from different angles.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:37.860
So let's return to the director of the Center

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.260
of Emerging Infectious Disease

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.420
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli,

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:45.980
colloquially referred to as Batwoman.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.460
So do you think she's lying?

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:52.300
Yes.

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.700
Do you think she's being forced to lie?

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.540
Yes.

01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.220
I've known a bunch of virologists

01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.220
in private and public conversation

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:03.540
that respect her as a human being, as a scientist.

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.100
I respect her as a human being.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.060
Sorry, as a scientist, not a human being,

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:08.620
because I think they don't know the human,

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.540
they know the scientist,

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.380
and they respect her a lot as a scientist.

01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.740
Yeah, I respect her.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:15.100
I've never met her, and we had one exchange,

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.660
which I'll mention in a second in a virtual forum,

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.820
but I do respect her.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.580
I actually think that she is somebody

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:23.140
who has tried to do the right thing.

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.980
She was one of the heroes of tracking down the origins

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.940
of SARS-1, and that was a major contribution.

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.660
But as we talked about earlier,

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.540
it's a different thing living, being a scientist,

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:40.700
or really kind of anything.

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.980
It's different being one of those people

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.300
in an authoritarian society

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.580
than it is being in a different type of society.

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.260
And so when Xujing Li said that the reason

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:59.260
the WIV database was taken offline in September 19

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.300
was because of computer hacks,

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.980
I don't think that's the story.

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.860
I don't think she thinks that's the story.

01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:12.700
When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year,

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.540
in a Rutgers online forum,

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.340
when I asked her whether the Chinese military

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:22.260
had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:26.540
in any way, and she said, absolutely not, paraphrasing,

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.780
I think she was lying.

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.820
Do I think that she had the ability to say,

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.540
well, either one, yes, but I can't talk about it,

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.660
or I know there are a lot of things

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.180
that are happening at this institute

01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:42.140
that I don't know about, and that could be one.

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:46.500
Could she have said that the personnel

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.220
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:52.060
have all had to go through classification training

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.620
so that they can know about what can and can't be said?

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.580
Like, she could have said all those things,

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.980
but she couldn't say all of those things.

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.220
And so, and I think that's why so many,

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.940
at least in my view, so many people in the,

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:11.140
certainly in the Western world,

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.660
got this story wrong from the beginning,

01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.660
because if your only prism was the science,

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.720
and you just assumed this is a science question

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.740
to be left to the scientists,

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:26.020
Xu Zhengli is just like any scientist

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.320
working in Switzerland or Norway,

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.380
the Chinese government isn't interfering in any way,

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.820
and we can trust them.

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:37.300
That would lead you down one path.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.700
In my view, the reason why I progressed as I did

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.300
is I felt like I had two keys,

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:45.980
and I had one key as I live in the science world

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.140
through my work with WHO and my books and things like that,

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.340
but I also have another part of my life

01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.720
in the world of geopolitics,

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.700
as an Asia quote unquote expert

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.460
and former National Security Council official

01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.160
and other things, and I felt, for me,

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.400
I needed both keys to open that door,

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.000
but if I only had the science key,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I wouldn't have had the level of doubt and suspicion

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.360
that I have, but if my starting point

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.040
was only doubt and suspicion,

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.580
well, it's coming from China,

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.640
it must be that the government is guilty,

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.240
like that wouldn't help either.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.640
I wonder what's in her mind,

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.860
whether it's fear or habit,

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:34.100
because I think a lot of people

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.300
in the former Soviet Union, it's like Chernobyl,

01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:40.300
it's not really fear, it's almost like a momentum.

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.200
It's like the reason I showed up to this interview

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.020
wearing clothes as opposed to being naked.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:52.940
It's like, all right, it's like it's just,

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.780
all of us are doing the clothes thing.

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:59.580
Although there was a startup years ago called Naked News,

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.060
did you ever hear about that?

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.540
They just would read the exact news.

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:03.380
But naked.

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.820
No, they would, after each story,

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.460
they'd take something off until the end they were,

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.300
I don't think it's.

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.580
It's a good idea for a podcast.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.420
They have an IPO.

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:13.980
Stay tuned, next time I'm with Michael Maus.

01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:14.820
Okay.

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.060
So what do you think,

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.220
because the reason I asked that question is,

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:25.700
how do we kind of take steps to improve

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.980
without any kind of revolutionary action?

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:32.780
You could say we need to inspire the Chinese people

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:37.780
to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system from within.

01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:43.500
But like, who are we to suggest that?

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.540
Because we have our flaws too.

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:48.020
We should be working on our flaws as well.

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.420
And so, but at the individual scientist level,

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:56.420
what are the small acts of rebellion that can be done?

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.660
How can we improve this?

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.460
Well, so I don't know about small acts of rebellion,

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.660
but I'll try to answer your question

01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.980
from a few different perspectives.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:11.060
So right now, actually, as we speak,

01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.980
there is a special session

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.740
of the World Health Assembly going on.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:17.580
And the World Health Assembly is the governing authority

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.380
over the World Health Organization,

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.580
where it's represented by states and territories,

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.940
194 of them tragically not including Taiwan

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.300
because of the Chinese government's assistance,

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.500
but they're now beginning a process

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:35.460
of trying to negotiate a global pandemic treaty

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.620
to try to have a better process

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:42.180
for responding to crises exactly like we're in.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:45.620
But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:48.860
that we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:51.060
after the first SARS, we set up what we thought

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.620
was the best available system,

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.420
and it has totally failed here.

01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.420
And it's failed here because of the inherent pathologies

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.980
of the Chinese government system.

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.820
We are suffering from a pandemic that exists

01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.340
because of the internal pathologies of the Chinese state.

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:14.940
And that's why on one hand, I totally get this impulse.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:17.980
Well, we do it our way, they do it their way.

01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:21.140
Who's to say that one way is better?

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.540
And certainly right now in the United States,

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.260
we're at each other's throats,

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:29.460
we have a hard time getting anything meaningful done.

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:31.260
And I'm sure there are people who are saying,

01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.620
well, that model looks appealing.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:37.460
But just as people could look to the United States

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.180
and say, well, because the United States

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.660
has such a massive reach,

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.140
what we do domestically has huge implications

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.740
for the rest of the world,

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:48.140
they become stakeholders in our politics.

01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.900
And that's why I think for a lot of years,

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.220
people have just been looking at US politics,

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.220
not because it's interesting,

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.340
but because the decisions that we make

01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:58.100
have big implications for their lives.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.740
The same is true for ours.

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:04.180
You could say that the lack of civil and political rights

01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:08.660
in China is, I mean, it's up to the Chinese,

01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.340
not even people, because they have no say,

01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:12.620
but to their government.

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.260
And they weren't democratically elected

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.660
that they are recognized as the government.

01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:21.900
But some significant percentage

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:24.980
of the 15 million people now dead from COVID

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:28.780
are dead because in the earliest days

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.580
following the outbreak, whatever the origin,

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:35.260
the voices of people sounding the alarm were suppressed,

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.220
that the Chinese government had an,

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:39.540
just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:42.540
had a greater incentive to lie

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.020
to the international community

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:46.620
than to tell the truth.

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.260
And everybody was incentivized

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.900
to pretty much do the wrong thing.

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:55.180
And so that's why I think one of the big messages

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.620
of this pandemic is that all of our fates

01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:00.260
are tied to everybody else's fates.

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:02.740
And so while we can say and should say,

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:06.460
well, let's focus on our own communities and our countries,

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:09.940
we're all stakeholders in what happens elsewhere.

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:14.940
Can I ask you a weird question?

01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.980
So I'm gonna do a few podcasts, interviews

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.340
with interesting people in Russia, in the Russian language,

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:25.780
because I could speak Russian.

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:29.180
And a lot of those people have,

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.100
are not usually speaking in these kinds of formats.

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:39.980
Do you think it's possible to interview Xi Zhenli?

01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:44.500
Do you think it's possible to interview somebody like her

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.300
or anyone in the Chinese government?

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.660
I think not.

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.660
And I think the reason is because I think they would one,

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:57.620
be uncomfortable being in any environment

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:02.060
where really unknown questions will be asked.

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.060
And I actually, I was, so as you know, on this topic,

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:07.380
the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier,

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:10.820
the Chinese government has a gag order on Chinese scientists.

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:13.020
They can't speak without prior government approval.

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:15.580
Xi Zhenli has been able to speak.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.180
And she's spoken at a number of forums.

01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.940
I mentioned this Rutgers event.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:23.100
What was the nature of that forum, the Rutgers event?

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.340
All of them were kind of science conversations

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:31.340
about the pandemic, including the origins of it.

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:37.060
And I think that Xi, in her response to my question,

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:38.660
it was kind of this funny thing.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.660
So they had this event for, organized by Rutgers.

01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:45.660
And I went on, there was an online event on Zoom,

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.900
but I got on there and I just realized

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.460
it was very poorly organized.

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.740
Like normally the controls that you would have

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.300
about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions,

01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.740
none of them were set.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.380
And so I kind of couldn't believe it.

01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:02.220
I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:06.580
and I just started sending chat messages to Xi Zhenli.

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.020
So you could, anybody could send-

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.260
Anybody could, it was insane.

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.700
And so I, but I thought, wow, this is incredible.

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.060
And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions.

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.260
And so I was like posting questions

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.700
and then I was sending chats to the organizers

01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.500
of the event saying, I really have a question.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.380
And first they said, well, you can submit your questions

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:29.260
and we'll have submitted questions.

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.180
And then if we have time, we'll open up.

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.060
So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.740
I just sent messages to everybody.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:37.140
And then the event was already done.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:39.460
They were 15 minutes over time.

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.460
And then they said, all right,

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.460
we have time just for one question.

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.900
And it's Jamie Metzl.

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.220
And like I said, I'm sitting there in my running clothes.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.220
Like I wasn't, I was like multitasking

01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:50.460
and I heard my name.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:55.460
And so I went diving back and I asked this question

01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.220
about, did you know all of the work that was happening

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:05.220
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not just your work?

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:10.540
And can you confirm that US intelligence has said

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:14.140
that the military played a role,

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:16.740
it was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:19.140
Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.700
in any way with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:24.780
And as I said before, she said, this is crazy.

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:26.260
Absolutely not.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:29.020
It actually got, that one question got covered in the media

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.300
because it was like, I think an essential question.

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:35.260
But I just think that since then, to my knowledge,

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.300
she's not been in any public forums,

01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.180
but that's why most people would be shocked

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.660
that to date there has been no comprehensive

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:46.620
international investigation into pandemic origins.

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.980
There is no whistleblower provision.

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.740
So if you're, my guess is there are at least tens,

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.180
maybe hundreds of people in China

01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:57.700
who have relevant information about the origins

01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:01.820
of the pandemic who are terrified and don't dare share it.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:05.620
And let's just say somebody wanted to get that information

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:08.460
out to send it somewhere.

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:10.420
There's no official address.

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:12.900
The WHO doesn't have that.

01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.900
Nobody has that.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.660
And so I would love, I mean, you may as well ask.

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:21.100
I don't think it's likely that there'll be a yes,

01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:23.700
but it could well be that there are defectors

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.420
who will want to speak.

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.340
So let me also push back as I just,

01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:33.460
so one, I want to ask if the language barrier is a thing

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:37.780
because I've talked to, so I understand Russian culture,

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.260
I think, or not understand, this is this.

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:45.260
I don't understand basically anything in this world,

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:50.460
but I mean, I hear the music that is Russian culture

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.820
and I enjoy it.

01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:55.380
I don't hear that music for Chinese culture.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:57.020
It's just not something I've experienced.

01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.140
So it's a beautiful, rich, complex culture.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:04.940
And from my sense, it seems distant to me.

01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:08.580
Like I, like whenever I look,

01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.220
even like we mentioned offline Japan and so on,

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.380
I probably don't even understand Japanese culture.

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.740
I believe I kind of do

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.300
because I did martial arts my whole life,

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.180
but even that is just so distant.

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:22.100
People who've lived in Japan, foreigners,

01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:25.300
for like 20 years say the exact same thing.

01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:26.260
It makes me sad.

01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:27.900
It makes me sad because I can't,

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.980
I will never be able to fully appreciate the literature,

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.180
the conversations, the people,

01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:38.220
the little humor and the subtleties.

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.060
And those are all essential to understand

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.860
even this cold topics of science

01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:46.260
because all of that is important to understand.

01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.500
So that's a question for me

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.860
if you think language barrier is a thing.

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.140
The other thing I just want to kind of comment on

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:57.140
is the criticism of journalism

01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:02.860
that somebody like Xi Jinping or even Xi Jinping,

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:06.900
just anybody in China is very skeptical

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.820
to have really conversations

01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.460
with anybody in the Western media.

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:14.420
Because it's like, what are the odds

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.540
that they will try to bring out

01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:19.620
the beautiful ideas in the person?

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.500
Honestly, this is a harsh criticism.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:26.100
I apologize, but I kind of mean it,

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:31.260
is the journalists that have some

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.060
of these high profile conversations

01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:36.860
often don't do the work.

01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:39.540
They come off as not very intelligent

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:41.380
and I know they're intelligent people.

01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:43.500
They have not done the research.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.580
They have not come up and read a bunch of books.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.900
They have not even read the Wikipedia article,

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.100
meaning put in the minimal effort

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.420
to empathize, to try to understand

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.340
the culture of the people, all the complexities,

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:58.780
all the different ideas in the spaces.

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.980
Do all the incredible, not all,

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:02.620
but some of the incredible work

01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:04.300
that you've done initially.

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.340
Like that, you have to do that work

01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.860
to earn the right to have a deep, real conversation

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.300
with some of these folks.

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.420
And it's just disappointing to me

01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.340
that journalists often don't do that work.

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:19.700
Yeah, so on that, just first, I completely agree with you.

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.660
I mean, there is just an incredible beauty

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:25.300
in Chinese culture and I think all cultures,

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:29.180
but certainly China has such a deep and rich history,

01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:34.180
amazing literature and art and just human beings.

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:38.060
I mean, I'm a massive critic of the Chinese government.

01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.780
I'm very vociferous about the really genocide in Xinjiang,

01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:46.580
the absolute effort to destroy Tibetan culture,

01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:51.020
the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong,

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:54.740
incredibly illegal efforts to seize basically

01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:59.620
the entire South China Sea and I could go on and on and on.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:02.660
But Chinese culture is fantastic.

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:05.700
And I mean, I can't speak to every technical field,

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.980
but just in terms of having journalists,

01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:10.540
and I'll speak to American journalists,

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:14.860
people like Peter Hessler who have really invested the time

01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:19.460
to live in China, to learn the language, learn the culture.

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:22.940
Peter himself, who is maybe one of our best journalists

01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:26.100
covering China from a soul level,

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.900
he was kicked out of China.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:30.700
So it's very, very difficult.

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:31.540
His stuff.

01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.300
Yeah, it's really, and so for me,

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:36.660
you talked about my website on pandemic origins.

01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:38.900
So when I launched it, I had it,

01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:40.540
I'm not a Chinese speaker,

01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.100
but I had the entire site translated into Chinese.

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:48.020
And I have it up on my website just because I felt like,

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:51.420
well, if somebody, I mean, the great firewall

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.740
makes it very, very difficult for people in China

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.300
to access that kind of information.

01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:58.500
But I figured if somebody gets there

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.980
and they want to have it in their own language,

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.300
but it's hard because the Chinese government

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:08.540
is represented by these quote unquote wolf warriors,

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:11.820
it's like these basic ruffians.

01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:15.420
And I personally was condemned by name

01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.540
by the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.420
from the podium in Beijing.

01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:24.140
And so it's really hard because I absolutely think

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.780
the American people and the Chinese people,

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:31.260
I mean, maybe all people, we have so much in common.

01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.220
I mean, yes, China is an ancient civilization,

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.900
but they kind of wiped out their own civilization

01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:41.220
in the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution,

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.540
they burned their scrolls, they smashed their artworks.

01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:47.420
And so it's a very young society,

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:50.540
kind of like America is a young society.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.740
So we have a lot in common.

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:57.020
And if we just kind of got out of our own ways,

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.580
we could have a beautiful relationship,

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:01.940
but there's a lot of things that are happening.

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.060
Certainly the United States feels responsible

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:07.260
to defend the post-war international order

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:09.700
that past generations helped build.

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.780
And I'm a certain believer in that

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.460
and China is challenging that.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.580
And the Chinese government,

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.380
and they've shared that view with the Chinese people,

01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.740
feel that they haven't been adequately respected

01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.980
and now they're building a massive nuclear arsenal

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:27.260
and all these other things

01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.780
to try to position themselves in the world

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.300
with an articulated goal of being the lead country

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.060
in the world and that puts them at odds

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:34.900
with the United States.

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.580
So there are a lot of real reasons

01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:39.980
that we need to be honest about for division.

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:42.500
But if that's all we focus on,

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:45.700
if we don't say that there's another side of the story

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.700
that brings us together,

01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:51.340
we'll put ourselves on an inevitable glide path

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.460
to a terrible outcome.

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.380
What do you make of Xi Jinping?

01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.900
What, so two questions.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.260
So one in general and two more on lab leak

01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:05.580
and is meeting with our President Biden

01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.500
in discussion of lab leak.

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:12.500
Yeah, so I feel that Xi Jinping has a very narrow goal

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:17.700
of articulated, of establishing China

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:20.180
as the lead country in the world

01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.900
by the 100th anniversary of the founding

01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:26.420
of the modern Chinese state.

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.740
And it's ruthless and it's strategic.

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:32.740
There's a great book called The Long Game

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.900
by Rush Doshi, who's actually now working

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.020
in the White House about this goal

01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:41.380
and our pretty clearly articulated goal

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:45.060
to subvert the post-war international order

01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.180
and in China's interest.

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:50.580
And maybe every leader wants to organize the world

01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.460
around their interests,

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.340
but I feel that his vision of what that entails

01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:59.100
is not one that I think is shareable

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.020
for the rest of the world.

01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.620
I mean, the strength of the United States

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:04.460
with all of our flaws is particularly

01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.820
in that post-war period,

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:10.300
we put forward a model that was desirable

01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.140
to a lot of people.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.660
Certainly it was desirable to people in Western Europe

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.780
and then Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea.

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.820
Doesn't mean it's perfect.

01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.500
The United States is deeply flawed.

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:26.020
As articulated to date, I don't think most people

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:30.340
in countries would like to live in a sinocentric world.

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.460
And so I certainly, as I mentioned before,

01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.020
I'm a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing,

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:39.300
the incredible brutality in Xinjiang,

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.620
in Tibet and elsewhere.

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:47.620
Yeah, the censorship one, it gives me a lot of trouble.

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:51.180
On the science realm and just in journalism

01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:53.500
and just the world, it prevents us

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.220
from having conversations with each other.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.700
Do you know about the Winnie the Pooh thing?

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:00.620
Yes, I mean, it's ridiculous.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.740
So to me, that's such a good illustration

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:07.460
of censorship being petty.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.780
Well, censorship has to be petty

01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.220
because the goal of censorship,

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.780
maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union,

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.620
is to get into your head.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.900
Like if it's just censorship,

01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.780
like you say down with the state

01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:22.780
and like you can't say that,

01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:26.260
but you can say all the other things up to that point,

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:28.540
eventually people will feel empowered

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.660
to say down with the state.

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:31.860
And so I think the goal of this kind

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.260
of authoritarian censorship is to turn you into the censor.

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:38.140
And so the-

01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:39.500
Like self-censorship.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
Because they almost have to have you think,

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.620
well, if I'm gonna make any criticism,

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.900
maybe they're gonna come and get me.

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.580
So it's safer to not do it.

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.420
I mean, I've traveled through North Korea pretty extensively

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.540
and I've seen that in its ultimate form,

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.820
but that's what they're trying to do in China too.

01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.860
Yeah.

01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:00.180
So for people who are not familiar,

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.740
it's such a clear illustration

01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.220
of just the pettiness of censorship and leaders,

01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:07.260
the corrupting nature of power.

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:10.940
But there's a meme of Xi Jinping

01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.940
with, I guess, Barack Obama.

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.460
And the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh

01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:20.860
in that picture.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:25.260
And that was the President Xi Jinping

01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.380
looks like Winnie the Pooh.

01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:30.100
And I guess that became, because that got censored,

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:32.300
or like mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:33.820
all across China.

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:38.260
Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero

01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:41.620
that represents freedom of speech and so on.

01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:44.540
But it's just such an absurd,

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:47.860
because we spent so much time in this conversation

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.780
talking about the censorship,

01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:52.460
that's a little bit more understandable to me,

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.020
which is like, we messed up and it wasn't,

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:01.140
maybe it's almost understandable errors that happen

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.740
in the progress of science.

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.780
I mean, you can always argue that

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.220
there's a lot of mistakes along the way

01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:11.980
and the censorship along the way caused the big mistake.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:14.380
You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl,

01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:18.340
but those are sort of understandable and difficult topics.

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.780
Like Winnie the Pooh.

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:22.140
But in your message, it shows both sides of the story.

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:26.260
I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be.

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:29.140
And that's why the messaging from the Chinese government

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.620
is so consistent.

01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:33.940
No matter who you are, you have to be careful what you say.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.180
And that's why it's the story of Peng Shui,

01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:41.260
the tennis player, she dared raise her voice

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.340
in an individual way.

01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.820
Jack Ma, the richest man in China,

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:50.460
had a minor criticism of the Chinese government.

01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.580
He had basically disappeared from the public eye.

01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:57.540
Fan Bingbing, who's like one of the leading

01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:02.180
Chinese movie stars, she was seen as not loyal enough

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:03.340
and she just vanished.

01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:06.260
And so the message is no matter who you are,

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:11.260
no matter what level, if you don't mind everything you say,

01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:12.700
you could lose everything.

01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:15.180
I'm pretty hopeful, optimistic about a lot of things.

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:18.940
And so for me, if the Chinese government stays

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.180
with its current structure,

01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:24.620
I think what I hope they start fixing

01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.620
is the freedom of speech.

01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:27.460
But they can't.

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:32.220
I mean, the thing is if they open up freedom of speech,

01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:34.340
really in a meaningful way,

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:38.380
they can't maintain their current form of government.

01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:40.340
And it's connected, as I was saying before,

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:42.540
to the origins of the pandemic.

01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:45.100
And if my hypothesis was right,

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:48.900
that was the big choice that the national government had.

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.820
Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:55.660
Do we deliver a message that transparency is required,

01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:58.940
public transparency is required from local officials?

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:02.100
If they do that, the entire system collapsed.

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:06.660
Pretty much everybody in China has a relative

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:09.900
who has died as a result of the actions

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:10.820
of the Communist Party,

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:12.700
particularly in the Great Leap Forward.

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:15.180
Nearly 50 million people died

02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:18.620
as a result of Mao's disastrous policies.

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:21.820
And yet why is Mao's picture still on Tiananmen Square

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:23.580
and it's on the money?

02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.460
Because maintaining that fiction is the foundation

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.940
of the legitimacy of the Chinese state.

02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:32.340
If people were allowed, just say what you want.

02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:35.180
Do you really think Mao was such a great guy,

02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:39.300
even though your own relatives are dead as a result?

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:43.860
Do you really buy even on this story

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.300
that China did nothing wrong,

02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.260
even though in the earliest days of the pandemic,

02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.180
these two, at least, Chinese scientists themselves

02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:55.020
courageously issued a pre-print paper

02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:58.980
that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted saying,

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:02.260
well, this looks like this comes from one of the Wuhan labs

02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:03.380
that we're studying.

02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:06.940
Like if you opened up that window,

02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:09.700
I think that the Chinese government

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:12.460
would not be able to continue in its current form.

02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:15.020
And that's why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square.

02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:17.900
That's why with Peng Shui, the tennis player,

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:21.100
if they had let her accuse somebody

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:24.740
from the Communist Party of sexual assault,

02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:28.620
and they said, okay, now people, you can use social media

02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:30.660
and you can have your me too moment

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:34.660
and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party

02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:37.500
or your boss in a business has assaulted you.

02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:40.060
Just like in every society, I'm sure there's tons of women

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:45.060
who've been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men.

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.460
And so I certainly hope

02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:51.220
that there can be that kind of opening.

02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:54.300
But if I were an authoritarian dictator,

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.620
that's the thing I would be most afraid of.

02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:58.020
Yeah, dictator perhaps,

02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:01.220
but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech.

02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:04.140
So I think you can maintain control

02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:06.140
over the freedom of press first.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:08.260
So control the press more,

02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:13.260
but let the lower levels sort of open up YouTube, right?

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:16.940
Open up like where individual citizens can make content.

02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:19.060
I mean, there's a lot of benefits to that.

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:22.740
And then from an authoritarian perspective,

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:25.540
you can just say that's misinformation,

02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:28.380
that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things.

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:32.540
But at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech

02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:34.540
at the level of the individual citizen,

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.940
that's good for entrepreneurship,

02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.500
for the development of ideas, of exchange of ideas,

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:41.420
all that kind of stuff.

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.100
I just think that increases the GDP of the country.

02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:46.060
So I think there's a lot of benefits.

02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:48.340
I feel like you can still play,

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:50.740
we're playing some like dark thoughts here,

02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:54.580
but I feel like you can still play the game of Thrones,

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.580
still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry.

02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:04.220
Like I think just like with North Korea is a good example

02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.340
of where cracking down too much

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:10.380
can completely destroy your country.

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:14.540
Like there's some balance you can strike in your evil mind

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:17.380
and still maintain authoritarian control over the country.

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.980
Obviously, it's not obvious,

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:24.100
but I'm a big supporter of freedom of speech.

02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.580
I mean, it seems to work really well.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.980
I don't know what the failure cases

02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:29.220
of freedom of speech are.

02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.740
Probably we're experiencing them with Twitter

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.300
and like where the nature of truth

02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:38.940
is being completely kind of flipped upside down,

02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:43.940
but it seems like on the whole ability to defeat lies

02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:48.340
with more, not through censorship,

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:50.740
but through more conversations,

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:53.100
more information is the right way to go.

02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.180
Can I tell you a little story,

02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:55.980
two stories about North Korea?

02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:57.060
So a number of years ago,

02:03:57.060 --> 02:04:01.660
I was invited to be part of a small six-person delegation

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:04.780
advising the government of North Korea

02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:07.300
on how to establish special economic zones

02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:10.540
because other countries have used these SEZs

02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.940
as a way of building their economies.

02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.580
And when I was invited, I thought,

02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:17.860
well, maybe there's an opening.

02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:19.940
And I certainly believe in that.

02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.500
So we flew to China, crossed the border into North Korea,

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:27.340
and then we were met by our partners

02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.020
from the North Korean development organization.

02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:33.940
And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks,

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:35.540
visiting all these sites

02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:38.020
for where they were intended

02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:39.820
to create these special economic zones.

02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:42.660
And in each site, they had their local officials

02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.780
and they had a map and they showed us

02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.020
where everything that was going to be built.

02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:50.300
And the other people who were like really technical experts

02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.100
on how to set up a special economic zone,

02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.100
they were asking questions,

02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:55.780
well, like, should you put the entrance over here

02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:56.940
or shouldn't you put it over there

02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.460
and what if there's flooding?

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.500
And I kept asking just these basic questions,

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.980
like, what do you think you're gonna do here?

02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:05.260
Why do you think you can be competitive?

02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:07.860
Do you know anything about who you're competing against?

02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:10.580
Are you empowering your workers to innovate

02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:12.620
because everybody else is innovating?

02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:14.860
So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:15.820
and they put us in this,

02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:17.420
it looked kind of like the United Nations.

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:20.180
They probably had 500 people there.

02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.900
And I gave a speech to them.

02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:26.500
I obviously was in English and it was translated.

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:29.900
And I figure, you know, I've come all this way.

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:30.900
I'm just gonna be honest.

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:34.700
If they arrest me for being honest, that's on them.

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:37.980
And I said, I'm here because I believe

02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:39.660
we can never give up hope

02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.420
that we always have to try to connect.

02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:45.380
I'm also here because I think that North Korea

02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:46.980
connecting to the world economy

02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:50.220
is an important first step.

02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.660
But having visited all of your special economic zone sites

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:56.060
and having met with all of your or many of your officials,

02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:59.380
I don't think your plan has any chance of succeeding

02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:03.620
because you're trying to sell into a global market,

02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:07.540
but you need to have market information that,

02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:10.900
and I gave examples of GE and others,

02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:14.620
that the innovation can't only happen at one place.

02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.780
And if you want innovation to happen

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:19.340
from the people who are doing this,

02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:20.540
you have to empower them.

02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:22.380
They have to have access.

02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:23.500
They have to have voice.

02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:28.580
I mean, nobody, I mean, the people after,

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.100
they kind of had to condemn me

02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.540
because what I was saying was challenging.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:33.820
So I certainly agree with you.

02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.740
And then just one side story of then that night.

02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:38.980
And it was just kind of bizarre

02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:42.380
because North Korea is so desperately poor,

02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:44.380
but they were trying to impress us.

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:49.260
And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets.

02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.540
And so for our final dinner that night,

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:55.380
really it looked like something from Beauty and the Beast.

02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:59.500
I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos,

02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.060
and they had this beautiful dinner.

02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:04.260
And then afterwards,

02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:05.540
because we'd now spent two weeks

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.020
with our North Korean partners,

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.940
they brought out this karaoke machine

02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:11.020
and our North Korean counterparts,

02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:15.220
they sang songs to us in Korean.

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:18.100
And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate.

02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:21.220
Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?

02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:23.340
It's North Korea, obviously, they didn't.

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.500
But there was, and I said, well, I have an idea.

02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:27.140
And so there was one of the women

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:30.220
who'd been part of the North Korean delegation.

02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:32.660
She was able just to play the piano,

02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:34.420
just like you could hum a tune

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:36.180
and she could play it on the piano.

02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:39.500
And so I said, all right, here's this tune,

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:41.020
which I whispered in her ear.

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.460
When I give you the signal,

02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:45.460
just play this tune over and over.

02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.220
And so I got these, I mean, there were the six of us

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.660
and maybe 20 North Koreans,

02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:52.900
and we are all in a circle, Sarah, everybody hold hands.

02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:54.940
And then put your right,

02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.620
just try to put your right foot in front of your left

02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:00.540
and then left foot in front of the right going sideways.

02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.460
And I said, all right, hit it.

02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:06.820
And she played a North Korean version of Hava Nagila.

02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:09.420
And I think it was the first and only horror

02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:11.740
that they've ever done in North Korea.

02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.580
That's hilarious.

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.400
I survived it.

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.240
Was this recorded or no?

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:15.080
It was not.

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:15.900
Oh no.

02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:18.140
Yeah, if they had free YouTube,

02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:19.540
this would have been a big one.

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:23.980
Let's return to the beginning and it just,

02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.020
patient zero.

02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:30.780
It's kind of always incredible to think

02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:33.860
that there's one human at which it all started.

02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:38.800
Who do you think was patient zero?

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.700
Do you think it was somebody that worked

02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:46.620
at Wuhan Institute of Virology?

02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:48.580
Do you think it was,

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:52.500
there was a leak of some other kind

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:55.100
that led to the infection?

02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:55.940
What do we know?

02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:59.860
Because there's this December 8th slash December 16th case

02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:04.420
of, maybe you can describe what that is.

02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:09.420
And then there's like, what's his name?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.980
Michael Worobi has a nice timeline.

02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.540
I'm sure you have a timeline.

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.900
But he has a nice timeline that puts the average

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:22.300
at like November something, like 18th and November 16th.

02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:27.220
That's the average estimate for when the patient zero

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:30.380
got infected, when the first human infection happened.

02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:32.100
Yeah, so just two points.

02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:36.560
One is, it may be that there's infectee zero

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.740
and patient zero.

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:41.260
It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic

02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:44.260
because we know there's a lot of people who are asymptomatic.

02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:47.620
And then there's the question of, well, who is patient zero,

02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:51.060
meaning the first person to present themselves

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:53.580
in some kind of health facility

02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:56.420
where that diagnosis could be made.

02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:59.300
So can we actually linger on that definition?

02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:02.620
So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?

02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:04.580
Okay, there's a bunch of stuff here

02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.700
because this virus is weird.

02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:11.140
So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious,

02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:14.420
or the first person to infect others.

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.260
Yeah, so-

02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:17.380
And who shows up to a hospital, like you said.

02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.500
Yeah, so I think that's why I'm calling the first person

02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:22.620
to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed with COVID-19.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:24.420
I'm calling that person patient zero.

02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:27.820
There's also, there is somewhere

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.620
the first person to be infected.

02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.700
And that person maybe never showed up in a hospital

02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:37.260
because maybe they were asymptomatic and never got sick.

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:38.080
So it got sick.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:41.400
Let me start with what I'm calling infectee zero.

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.600
Here are some options.

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.240
I talked before about some person who was a villager

02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.640
in some remote village.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:51.040
It's almost impossible to imagine,

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.120
but possible to imagine because strange things happen.

02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.200
And that person somehow gets to Wuhan.

02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.440
By the way, just to still man that argument,

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.920
there's not an argument, it's a statement,

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:06.480
but strange things happen all the time.

02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.680
No, I agree.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.120
It doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.520
and probabilities don't apply,

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.040
but we all, I mean, in general principle,

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.400
everyone, if we were honest,

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.000
should be agnostic about everything.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.480
Like I think I'm Jamie, but is there a 0.01% chance

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.200
or 0.01% chance that I'm not?

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.520
But it could be, I mean, how would I know?

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:29.960
But there's a large number of people

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.920
arguing about the meaning of the word I

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.120
in that I'm Jamie.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:33.960
So exactly.

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:34.780
What does consciousness mean?

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:35.620
Exactly, exactly.

02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:37.980
I mean, we could spend another three hours

02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.140
going into that one.

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:42.140
So one possibility is there's some remote villager.

02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:47.140
Another possibility is there's somehow, bizarrely,

02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.060
there are these infected animals

02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:51.900
that come from Southern China, most likely.

02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:55.820
Maybe there's only one of them that's infected,

02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:58.100
which how could that possibly be?

02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.860
And it's only sent to Wuhan.

02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:02.820
It's not sent anywhere else,

02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.180
to any of the markets there or whatever.

02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.780
And then maybe somebody in a market is infected.

02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:10.460
That's one remote possibility, but a possibility.

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:13.260
Another is that researchers

02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:15.660
from the Wuhan Institute of Virology

02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.940
go down to Southern China.

02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.060
We haven't talked about it yet,

02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:23.020
but in 2012, there were six miners were sent

02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:26.420
into a copper mine in Southern China in Yunnan province.

02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:29.780
All of them got very sick with what now appear

02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:31.860
like COVID-19 like symptoms.

02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:34.340
Half of them died.

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.660
Blood samples from them were taken

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:40.820
to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere.

02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.820
And then after that, there were multiple site visits

02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:50.540
to that mine, collecting viral samples

02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:53.700
that were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:56.420
Included among those samples

02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:00.260
was this now infamous RETG-13 virus,

02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:03.420
which is among the genetically closest viruses

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.020
to SARS-CoV-2.

02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:08.540
There were nine other or eight other viruses

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:10.140
that were collected from that mine

02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:12.940
that were presumably very similar to that.

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:16.100
And again, we have no access to the information

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:19.460
about those and many of the other,

02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:20.900
almost all of the other viruses.

02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:25.180
So could it be that one of the people

02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:27.420
who was sent from the Wuhan Institute of Virology

02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:30.740
to the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control,

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.260
they went down there to collect

02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:35.580
and they got infected asymptomatically and brought it back?

02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:37.100
Could it be that they were working

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.740
on these viruses in the laboratory

02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:42.860
and there was an issue with waste disposal?

02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:46.140
We know that the Wuhan CDC had a major problem

02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:47.660
with waste disposal.

02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:52.340
And just before the pandemic, one, they put out an RFP

02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:54.740
to fix their waste disposal.

02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:59.740
And in early 2019, they moved to their new site,

02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:01.700
which was basically across the street

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.820
from the Huanan Seafood Market.

02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.220
So could there have been issue of somebody infected

02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:09.500
in the lab of waste disposal?

02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:12.180
Could a laboratory animal, their experiences in China,

02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:14.060
actually China just recently passed a law saying

02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:18.460
it's illegal to sell laboratory animals in the market

02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.140
because there were scientists or one scientist

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:24.740
who was selling laboratory animals in the market

02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:27.820
and people would just come and buy.

02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:28.740
It's insane.

02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:31.780
So there are so many scenarios,

02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:35.620
but if I, again, connect it to my 85% number,

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:37.540
I think in the whole category

02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:40.500
of laboratory-related incidents,

02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:42.700
whether it's collection, waste,

02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.460
something connected to the lab,

02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:47.420
I think that's the most likely.

02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:49.900
But there are other credible people

02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.660
who would say they think it's not the most likely

02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:54.740
and I welcome their views

02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:56.260
and we need to have this conversation.

02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:57.700
So in your write-up,

02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.180
but what's the URL?

02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:04.300
Cause I always find it by doing Jamie Metzl lab leak.

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:06.260
That's probably the easiest, just Google that.

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:08.780
No, no, but if you just go to jamymetzl.com,

02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:11.940
J-A-M-I-E-M-E-T-Z-L.com,

02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:14.780
then there's just a thing, it's COVID origins.

02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.020
COVID origins.

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:19.580
Or you could just Google Jamie Metzl lab leak.

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:22.980
Google's search engine says a powerful thing.

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:27.180
You mentioned in that write-up that you don't think,

02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:28.900
this could be just me misreading it

02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:31.020
or it's just slightly miswritten,

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:36.020
but you don't think that the viruses from that 2012 mine,

02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:37.900
which is fascinating,

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:40.580
could be the backbone for SARS-CoV-2.

02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:43.580
So what I mean, just the specific virus,

02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:45.700
which I mentioned, RATG13,

02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.860
and there's a whole history of that

02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:51.340
because it had a different name and it looked,

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.900
and Xu Zhengli provided wrong information

02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:57.180
about when it had been sequenced.

02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:00.260
I mean, there was a whole issue connected to that,

02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:02.900
but the genetic difference,

02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:07.900
even though it's 96.2% similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus,

02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:12.420
that's actually a significant difference,

02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:17.580
even though that and a virus called Banal-52

02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:20.180
that was collected in Laos are the two most similar,

02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:22.340
there still are differences.

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:25.700
So I'm not saying RATG13 is the backbone,

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:28.780
but I believe there is a possibility

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:32.380
that other viruses that were collected

02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:36.900
either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China

02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:39.380
or in Laos or Cambodia,

02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:44.260
because that was with the EcoHealth Alliance proposals

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.100
and documents,

02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:49.460
their plan was to collect viruses in Laos

02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.220
and Cambodia and elsewhere

02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:54.300
and bring them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.700
so that there are people.

02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:56.540
As a matter of fact,

02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:58.740
just when I was sitting here before this message,

02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:01.060
I got, before this interview,

02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:03.620
I got a message from somebody who was saying,

02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:06.100
well, Peter Daszak is telling everybody

02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:10.140
that the viral sample, the Banal-52 from Laos,

02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:13.740
proves that there's not a lab incident origin

02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:14.580
of the pandemic.

02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:17.100
It actually doesn't prove that at all

02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:21.420
because these viruses were being collected in places

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:25.660
like Laos and Cambodia and being brought

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:28.420
to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:32.820
Those are like early, early, like the prequel.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.780
So these are, they're not sufficiently similar

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.420
to serve as a backbone,

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:38.700
but they kind of tell a story

02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:40.660
that they could have been brought to the lab

02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:43.380
through several processes,

02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:45.020
including genetic modification

02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:47.620
or through the natural evolution processes,

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:48.580
accelerated evolution,

02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:50.180
they could have arrived at something

02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:53.980
that has the spike protein and the cleavage,

02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:56.980
the foreign cleavage site and all that kind of stuff.

02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:00.260
So what I'm saying is the essential point

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:02.220
is if we had access,

02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:04.140
if we knew everything that was being,

02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:06.020
every virus that was being held

02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:09.300
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan CDC,

02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:10.700
we had full access.

02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:13.860
We had full access to everybody's lab notes

02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:16.740
and we did just the kind of forensic investigation

02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:21.380
that has been so desperately required since day one.

02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:24.380
We'd be able to say, well, what did you have?

02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:26.980
Because if we knew, if it should come out

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:30.780
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository,

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:34.100
prior to the outbreak, either SARS-CoV-2

02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:36.660
or a reasonable precursor to it,

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.500
that would prove the lab incident hypothesis.

02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:42.940
In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing

02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:46.180
any kind of meaningful investigation.

02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:51.180
So my hypothesis is not that what RATG13 says

02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:54.540
is because, as I mentioned earlier,

02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:58.780
the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating.

02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:01.900
So that what that means is if you have,

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:06.140
you don't have very many total outlier viruses

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.700
in a bat community because these viruses

02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:11.260
are always mixing and matching with each other.

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:13.740
And so if you have RATG13,

02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:17.580
which is relatively similar to SARS-CoV-2,

02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:20.540
there's a pretty decent likelihood there was other stuff

02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:25.540
that was collected at this mine called Mojang Mine

02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:30.940
in Yunnan province, maybe in Laos and Cambodia.

02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:34.060
And that's why we need to have that information.

02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:38.060
Do you think somebody knows who patient zero is

02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:38.900
within China?

02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:40.300
So do you think that's information?

02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.140
Well, there's two things.

02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:44.580
One is I think somebody and people probably know.

02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:46.740
And then two, it's been incredibly curious

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:51.380
that the best virus chasers in the world are in China

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:53.420
and they are in Wuhan.

02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:57.460
And when, I mean, we can talk about this deeply compromised

02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:01.860
now vastly improved World Health Organization process.

02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:05.420
But when they went there, the Chinese,

02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.380
the local and national Chinese authorities say,

02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:10.580
oh, we haven't done, we haven't tested the samples

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.860
in our blood center.

02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:13.580
We haven't done any of this tracing.

02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:17.620
And these deeply compromised people who were part

02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:22.620
of the international part of the joint study tour

02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:25.060
when they came out with their,

02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:26.420
they had their visit early this year

02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:28.060
and came out with their report,

02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:32.860
they had in my mind, just an absurd letter to the editor

02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:35.740
in nature saying, well, if we don't hurry back,

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:37.460
we're not gonna know what happened.

02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:41.420
Assuming that the people in China are like bumpkins

02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:44.060
who on their own don't know how to trace the origin

02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:47.420
of a virus and the opposite is the case.

02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:49.940
So I think there are people in China

02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:51.900
who at least know a lot.

02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:55.140
They know a lot more than they're saying.

02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:58.980
And at the best case scenario is the Chinese government

02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:03.220
wants to prevent any investigation, including by them.

02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:06.500
The worst case scenario is that there are people

02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:07.340
who already know.

02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:10.300
And that's why, again, my point from day one has been,

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:14.780
we need a comprehensive international investigation

02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:18.260
in Wuhan with full access to all relevant records,

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:19.380
samples and personnel.

02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:22.180
When this again, deeply flood,

02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:27.180
can I give you a little history of this WHO process?

02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.300
Okay.

02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:30.620
Who are the, that's funny.

02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:33.580
Who's on first?

02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:34.460
Who's on first?

02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:36.340
I'm so funny with the jokes.

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.180
Look at me go.

02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:39.780
Who are the WHO?

02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:41.500
So what is this organization?

02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.140
What is its purpose?

02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:45.980
What role did it play in the pandemic?

02:21:45.980 --> 02:21:49.220
It certainly was demonized in the realm of politics.

02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:53.420
And this is an institution

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:57.100
that was supposed to save us from this pandemic.

02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:58.980
A lot of people believe it failed.

02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:00.300
Has it failed?

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.700
Why did it fail?

02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:02.940
And you said it's improving.

02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:04.300
How is it improving?

02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:05.900
Great, all right.

02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:06.740
I hope you don't mind.

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.940
I'm gonna have to talk for a little bit of extra time.

02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:09.780
I love this.

02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:10.620
I love this.

02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:12.100
Good, good, good, good.

02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:16.180
So the WHO is an absolutely essential organization

02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:20.580
created in 1948 in that wonderful period

02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:22.220
after the Second World War,

02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:24.540
when the United States and allied countries

02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:27.180
asked the big bold questions,

02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:30.620
how do we build a safer world for everyone?

02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:33.340
And so that's the WHO.

02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:36.780
If we, although there are many critics of the WHO,

02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:39.100
if we didn't have it, we would need to invent it,

02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:44.100
because the whole nature of these big public health issues

02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:48.300
and certainly for pandemics, but all sorts of things

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.900
is that they are transnational in nature.

02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:54.140
And so we cannot just build moats.

02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:55.700
We cannot build walls.

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:56.940
We are all connected to it.

02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:59.540
So that's the idea.

02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:02.740
There's a political process because the United Nations

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:04.500
and the WHO as part of it,

02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:08.860
it exists within a political context.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:11.620
And so the current director general

02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:13.140
of the World Health Organization,

02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:16.900
who was just re-elected for his second five-year term,

02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:20.220
is Dr. Tedros Adhanom-Gabrielsus,

02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:25.220
who is from Ethiopia, Tigrayan from Ethiopia.

02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:27.780
And in full disclosure,

02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:31.100
I have a lot of respect for Tedros.

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.260
Tedros got his job.

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:35.380
He was not America's candidate.

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:37.180
He was not Britain's candidate.

02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:39.900
Our candidate was a guy named David Nabarro,

02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:42.700
who I also know and have tremendous respect for.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:48.700
China led the process of putting Tedros in this position.

02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:54.500
And in the earliest days of the pandemic,

02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:55.900
Tedros, in my view,

02:23:55.900 --> 02:23:57.740
even though I have tremendous respect for him,

02:23:57.740 --> 02:23:59.300
I think he made a mistake.

02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:02.260
The WHO doesn't have its own

02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:04.260
independent surveillance network.

02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.780
It's not organized to have it

02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:07.220
and the states have not allowed it.

02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:10.260
So it's dependent on member states

02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:13.140
for providing it information.

02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:17.100
And because it's a poorly funded organization,

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:20.100
dependent on its bosses who are these governments,

02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:24.740
its natural instinct isn't to condemn its bosses.

02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:28.260
It's to say, well, let's quietly work with everybody.

02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:30.580
Having said that, the Chinese government

02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:33.300
knowingly lied to Tedros.

02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:36.380
And Tedros, in repeating the position

02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:38.060
of the Chinese government, which incidentally,

02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:41.140
I would say Donald Trump also did the exact same thing.

02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:43.940
Donald Trump had a private conversation with Xi Jinping

02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:48.500
and then repeated what Xi had told him.

02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.420
Both of them were wrong.

02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:54.460
Dr. Tedros, I think when it took,

02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:56.900
when Chinese government was lying, knowingly lying,

02:24:56.900 --> 02:24:59.980
saying there's no human to human transmission,

02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:01.100
Dr. Tedros said that.

02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:04.820
And even though within the World Health Organization,

02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:08.460
there were private critiques saying China is now doing

02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:10.500
exactly what it did in SARS-1.

02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.900
It's not providing access.

02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:13.900
It's not providing information.

02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:16.660
Tedros' instinct because of his background,

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.020
because of his role and wrongly

02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:25.540
was to have a more collaborative relationship with China,

02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:28.380
particularly by making assertions

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:30.340
based on the information that was wrong.

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.100
Don't call people liars.

02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:33.820
They're not gonna be happy with you.

02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:34.660
They're not gonna be happy.

02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:38.860
And the job of the WHO isn't to condemn states.

02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:41.900
It's to do the best possible job of addressing problems.

02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:43.700
And I think that the culture was,

02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:45.820
well, let's do the most that we can

02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:49.260
if we totally alienate China on day one.

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:52.580
We're in even worse shape than if we call them out for-

02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:54.260
Not exactly sure, by the way,

02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:58.180
that maybe you can also steel man that argument.

02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:00.140
Like, it's not completely obvious

02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:02.860
that that's a terrible decision.

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:05.460
If you or I were in that role,

02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:06.900
we would make that decision.

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:10.700
It's complicated because you want China on your side

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:11.780
to help solve this.

02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:14.500
So I would have made a different decision,

02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:17.540
which is why I never would have been selected

02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:18.660
as the director general.

02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:20.620
There's a selection criteria

02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:24.380
that everybody kind of needs to support you.

02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:27.140
And so, but let me just, this is just the beginning.

02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:30.900
Can you also just elaborate or kind of restate

02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:34.300
what were the inaccuracies that you quickly mentioned?

02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:36.780
So human to human transmission, what were the things-

02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:40.540
So the most important, there were a few things.

02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:46.420
One, China didn't report the outbreak.

02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:51.420
Two, they had the sequenced genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:55.900
and they didn't share it for two critical weeks.

02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:59.300
And when they did share it, it was inadvertent.

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.820
I mean, there was a very, very courageous scientist

02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:03.580
who essentially leaked it

02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:05.580
and was later punished for leaking it,

02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:07.420
even though the Chinese government is now saying

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.020
we were so great by releasing the sequenced genome.

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:10.860
Wait, I was really confused.

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:11.700
Really?

02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:15.140
So I'm so clueless about this as most things.

02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:19.380
Because I thought, because there was a celebration of,

02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:23.580
isn't this amazing that we got the sequence,

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:27.220
like this amazing, and then the scientific community

02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:29.460
across the world stepped up

02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:31.380
and were able to do a lot of stuff really quickly

02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:32.300
with that sharing,

02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:34.540
because I thought the Chinese government shared it.

02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:37.060
No, no, so they sat on it for two weeks.

02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:40.700
When they shared it against their will, it was incredible.

02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:45.460
Moderna, 48 hours later, after getting the information,

02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:46.700
getting the sequenced genome,

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:48.220
they had the formulation

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:52.020
for what's now the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:55.300
But that's two critical weeks.

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:57.660
In those early days,

02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:00.460
they blocked the World Health Organization

02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:04.980
from sending its experts to Wuhan for more than three weeks.

02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.180
I said they lied about human-to-human transmission.

02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.220
During that time,

02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:12.140
they were aggressively enacting their cover-up,

02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:15.940
destroying records, hiding samples,

02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:19.700
imprisoning people who were asking tough questions.

02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:24.140
They soon after established their gag order.

02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:27.940
They fought internally in the World Health Organization

02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:32.140
to prevent the declaration of a global emergency.

02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:34.100
So China, definitely, I mean,

02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:38.380
I couldn't be stronger in my critique of China,

02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:40.820
particularly what it did in those early days,

02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:44.540
but really what it's doing even to today is outrageous.

02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:48.100
So then there was the question of,

02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:51.300
well, how do we examine what actually happened?

02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:54.300
And the Prime Minister of Australia then and now,

02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:57.020
Scott Morrison, was incredibly courageous.

02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:59.660
And he said, we need a full investigation.

02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:00.820
And because of that,

02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:03.700
the Chinese government attacked him personally

02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:07.300
and imposed trade sanctions on Australia

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.700
to try to, not just to punish Australia,

02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:12.180
but to deliver a message to every other country,

02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:15.900
if you ask questions, we're going to punish you ruthlessly.

02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:19.700
And that certainly was the message that was delivered.

02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:24.820
The Australians brought that idea of a full investigation

02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:28.380
to the World Health Assembly in May of 2020.

02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:29.220
As I mentioned before,

02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:33.300
the WHA is the governing authority of states

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:36.540
above the World Health Organization.

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:40.260
And so, but instead of passing a resolution

02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:42.820
calling for a full investigation,

02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:45.820
what ended up ironically and tragically passing

02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:49.340
with Chinese support was a mandate

02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:53.980
to have essentially a Chinese controlled joint study

02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:55.500
where half of the team,

02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:57.660
a little more than half of the team was Chinese experts,

02:29:57.660 --> 02:29:59.460
government affiliated Chinese experts,

02:29:59.460 --> 02:30:04.140
and half were independent international experts

02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:08.340
but organized by the WHO.

02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:10.060
And then it took six months

02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:12.380
to negotiate the terms of reference.

02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:14.900
And again, while China was doing all this coverup,

02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:16.660
they delayed and delayed and delayed.

02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:19.420
And by the terms of reference that were negotiated,

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:22.860
China had veto power over who got to be a member

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:25.780
of the international group.

02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:30.780
And that group was not entitled to access to raw data.

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:34.700
The Chinese side would give them conclusions

02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:37.580
based on their own analysis of the raw data,

02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:39.820
which was totally outrageous.

02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:43.300
So then, and I was a big eye and others,

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:46.020
now friend of mine, although we've never met in person,

02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:48.020
Gilles de Manouf in New Zealand,

02:30:48.020 --> 02:30:51.500
he did a great job of chronicling just the letter by letter

02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:53.500
of the terms of reference.

02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:59.100
So then it took, now it's January of this year,

02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:02.420
January 2021, this deeply flawed,

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.420
deeply compromised international group is sent to Wuhan.

02:31:07.860 --> 02:31:09.460
So what's the connection between this group

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.340
and the joint study?

02:31:10.340 --> 02:31:11.180
So the joint study,

02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:13.500
it had the Chinese side and the international side.

02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:15.460
So these international experts,

02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:18.180
then part of their examination was going

02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:19.860
for one month to Wuhan.

02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:23.260
And the nature of the flaws of this international group.

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:24.900
It's okay, really important point.

02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:26.820
And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear on that.

02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:30.980
Rather the mandate of what they were doing

02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:34.900
was not to investigate the origins of the pandemic.

02:31:34.900 --> 02:31:37.620
It was to have a joint study

02:31:37.620 --> 02:31:40.340
into the zoonotic origins of the virus,

02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:43.660
which was interpreted to mean

02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:45.540
the natural origins hypothesis.

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:48.700
They weren't empowered for a single hypothesis,

02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:51.180
not, so that they weren't empowered

02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:54.020
to examine the lab incident origin.

02:31:54.020 --> 02:31:56.940
They were there to look at the natural origin hypothesis.

02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:58.780
To shop for some meat at some markets.

02:31:58.780 --> 02:32:03.500
Yeah, so that was, so then they were there for a month.

02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:04.340
Yeah.

02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:09.340
Of the makeup of the team, guess who was,

02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:11.060
so the United States government

02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:13.620
proposed three experts for this team.

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:15.260
People who had a lot of background.

02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:17.220
This was the Trump administration,

02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:19.980
people who had a lot of background,

02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:22.980
including in investigating lab incidents.

02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:24.860
None of those people were accepted.

02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:27.180
The one American who was accepted-

02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:28.140
Don't tell me it's Peter Daszak.

02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:29.100
Peter Daszak.

02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:33.220
Peter Daszak, who had this funding relationship

02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.660
for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:39.460
whose entire, basically, professional reputation

02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:43.300
was based on his collaboration with Xu Zhengli,

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:47.740
who had written the February 2020 Lancet letter

02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:49.620
saying it comes from natural origin,

02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:51.780
and anybody who's suggesting otherwise

02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:53.420
is a conspiracy theorist,

02:32:53.420 --> 02:32:55.380
and who, at least according to me,

02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:58.020
had been, at very, very least,

02:32:58.020 --> 02:33:00.260
the opposite of transparent,

02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:03.420
and at most engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.

02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:07.820
He is the one American who's on this.

02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:10.900
So they go there, they have one month in Wuhan.

02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:14.300
Two weeks of it are spent in quarantine,

02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:15.980
just in their hotel rooms.

02:33:15.980 --> 02:33:17.580
So then they have two weeks,

02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:20.100
but really it's just 10 working days.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:22.660
One of the earliest, and so then they're kind of,

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:23.620
we've all seen the pictures.

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:27.500
They're traveling around Wuhan in little buses.

02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:30.460
One of the first visits they have

02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:33.860
is to this museum exhibition on the,

02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:36.140
it's basically a propaganda exhibition

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:40.340
on the success, Xi Jinping and the success in fighting COVID.

02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:41.980
And they say, well, we had to show respect

02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:42.820
to our Chinese hosts,

02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:44.660
but I think what the Chinese hosts were saying is,

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:47.220
let's just, we're just gonna rub your noses in this.

02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:48.860
You're gonna go where we tell you.

02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:53.180
You're gonna hear what we want you to hear.

02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:54.380
So they have that little short time.

02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:56.260
They spend a few hours.

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:59.420
So they weren't in control of where the bus goes.

02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:02.020
No, I mean, they made recommendations.

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:05.300
Many of their recommendations were accepted,

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:07.540
but they, like when they went

02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:08.860
to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:10.500
and some of them did,

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:13.100
they had a, they weren't able to do any kind of audit

02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:15.660
when they asked for access to raw data.

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.740
They weren't provided that.

02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:22.660
They were, it was, as I said in my 60 minutes interview,

02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:25.020
it was a chaperoned study tour.

02:34:25.020 --> 02:34:27.900
It was not even remotely close to an investigation.

02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:29.380
And the thing they were looking at

02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:32.220
wasn't the origins of the pandemic.

02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:34.740
It was the single hypothesis

02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:39.060
of a quote unquote natural origins.

02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:43.260
Then, I mean, it was really so shocking for me.

02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:46.780
On February 9 of this year in Wuhan,

02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:51.060
the Chinese government sets up a joint press event

02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:55.060
where it's the Chinese side and the international side.

02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:58.020
And during that press event,

02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:00.860
a guy named Peter Ben Imbarik, and it's a little confusing,

02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:04.180
he was basically the head of this delegation,

02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:06.180
and he works for the WHO,

02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:09.500
even though this was an independent committee,

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:11.740
it was organized by the WHO.

02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:16.180
So Peter Ben Imbarik gets up there and says,

02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:19.340
we think it's most likely it comes from nature.

02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:22.100
Then he says, we think it's possible

02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:23.740
it comes through frozen food,

02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:25.940
which is absolutely outrageous.

02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:27.820
I mean, it's basically preposterous.

02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:32.220
Alina Chan calls this popsicle origins,

02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:34.380
but it's really, really unlikely.

02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:36.780
But then most significantly,

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:39.980
he says that we've all agreed

02:35:40.980 --> 02:35:43.420
that a lab incident origin is quote unquote

02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:47.860
extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.

02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.780
We later learned that the way they came up

02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:53.660
with that determination was by a show of hands

02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:57.940
vote of the international experts and the Chinese experts.

02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:00.660
And the Chinese experts had to do their vote

02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:03.340
in front of the Chinese government officials

02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:05.540
who were constantly there.

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.420
So even if whatever they thought,

02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:09.900
there was no possibility that someone raises their hand

02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:12.380
as oh yeah, I think it's a lab origin.

02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:15.300
So that was outrageous thing number one.

02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:16.580
Outrageous thing number two,

02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:21.140
which I'll come back to my response in February.

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:24.420
Outrageous thing number two is months later,

02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:28.180
Peter Benimbarek does an interview on Danish television.

02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:31.220
And he says, actually, I was lying

02:36:31.220 --> 02:36:34.420
about extremely unlikely because the Chinese side,

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:38.220
they didn't want any mention of a lab incident origin

02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:42.700
anywhere including in the report that later came out.

02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:46.300
And so the deal we made, even though he himself thought

02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:47.900
that at least some manifestation

02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:50.260
of a lab incident origin was likely

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:53.260
and that there should be an investigation,

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.860
particularly he said, well, that's kind of weird

02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:57.300
that the Wuhan CDC moved just across

02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:59.380
from the Huanan Seafood Market

02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:03.940
just before the beginning of the pandemic.

02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:06.700
But he said, as a horse trading deal

02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:08.300
with the Chinese authorities,

02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:13.300
that he agreed to say it was extremely unlikely

02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:15.340
and shouldn't be investigated.

02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:18.900
So I was in actually in Colorado staying with my parents

02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:23.300
and I stayed up late watching this press event.

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:26.020
And I was appalled because I knew after two weeks,

02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:27.940
there was no way they could possibly

02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:29.740
come to that conclusion.

02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:33.580
So I immediately sent a private message to Tedros,

02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:37.460
the WHO director general essentially saying,

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:40.260
there's no way they had enough access

02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:42.500
to come to this conclusion.

02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:47.300
If the WHO doesn't distance itself from this,

02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:49.940
the WHO itself is going to be in danger

02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:53.260
because it's going to be basically institutional capture

02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:54.100
by the Chinese.

02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:57.700
This was repeating the Chinese government's propaganda points

02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:00.500
and Tedros sent me a really,

02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:02.140
again, why I have so much respect for Tedros,

02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:04.420
sent me a private note saying,

02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:08.500
don't worry, we are determined to do the right thing.

02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:10.020
And so I got that private message.

02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.940
And again, I really like Tedros,

02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:14.820
but I thought, well, what are you gonna do?

02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:19.180
Three days later, Tedros makes a public statement

02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:23.060
and he says, I've heard this thing.

02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:25.460
I don't think that this is a final answer.

02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:29.380
We need to have a full investigation into this process.

02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:33.460
He then released two more statements saying,

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:37.340
we need to have a full investigation

02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:38.580
with access to raw data

02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:42.860
and we need a full audit of the Wuhan labs.

02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:46.420
So then that part was really, really great.

02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:49.260
But then this saga continues because,

02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:51.780
so I was part of a group, as I mentioned before,

02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:55.620
this Paris group, it was about two dozen or so experts

02:38:55.620 --> 02:39:00.060
and we'd been meeting since 2020 and having regular meetings

02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:02.820
and we just present papers, present data, debate

02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:04.500
to try to really get to the bottom of things.

02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:06.380
And it was all private.

02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:08.300
So I went to this group and I said,

02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:12.900
look, this playing field is now skewed.

02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:14.980
These guys, they've put out this thing,

02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:16.860
lab incident origin extremely unlikely.

02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:19.580
It's in every newspaper in the world.

02:39:19.580 --> 02:39:21.900
We can't just be our own little private group

02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:23.420
talking to each other.

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:26.060
So I led the political process

02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:29.100
of drafting what became four open letters

02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:32.460
that many of us signed, most of us signed,

02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:37.780
that saying, all right, here's why this investigation,

02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.100
the study group and the report are not credible.

02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:42.460
Here's what's wrong.

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:45.780
Here's what a full investigation would look like.

02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:48.420
Here's a treasure map of all the resources

02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:50.580
where people can look

02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:52.740
and we demand a comprehensive investigation.

02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:55.140
So those four open letters

02:39:55.140 --> 02:39:58.540
were in pretty much every newspaper in the world.

02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:01.020
And it played a really significant role

02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:02.700
along with some other things.

02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:05.020
There was later, there was a letter,

02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:10.020
a short letter in science making basically similar points

02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:11.780
in a much more condensed way.

02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.620
There were some higher profile articles

02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:19.620
by Nicholas Wade and Nick Baker and others.

02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:24.540
And those collectively shifted the conversation.

02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:28.060
And then really impressively,

02:40:28.060 --> 02:40:30.700
the WHO and with Tedros's leadership

02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:33.620
did something that was really incredible.

02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:36.380
And that is earlier this year,

02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.380
they, meaning the leadership of the WHO,

02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:40.220
not the World Health Assembly,

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:43.500
but the leadership of the WHO

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:46.460
announced the establishment of what's called SAGO,

02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:48.540
the Scientific Advisory Group

02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:51.460
on the Origins of Novel Pathogens.

02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:53.300
And basically what they did

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:55.900
was overrule their own governing board

02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:59.140
and say, we're gonna create our own entity.

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.180
And so it basically dissolved

02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:04.500
that deeply flawed international joint study group.

02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:05.740
And a lot of those people,

02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:10.740
they have become very critical like the Chinese of Tedros.

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:15.340
So then they had an open call for nominations

02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:17.620
to be part of SAGO.

02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:22.620
And so a lot of people put in their nominations,

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:25.540
they selected 26 people.

02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:26.940
But our group, we had a meeting

02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:30.860
and we were unhappy with that list of 26.

02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:33.020
It still felt skewed

02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:35.140
toward the natural origin hypothesis.

02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:38.460
So again, I drafted and we worked on together

02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:42.100
an open letter which we submitted to the WHO

02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:44.020
saying, we think this list,

02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:45.220
it's a step in the right direction,

02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:46.780
but it's not good enough.

02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:50.740
And we call on these three people to be removed

02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:52.180
and we have these three people

02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:53.980
who we think should be added.

02:41:53.980 --> 02:41:58.140
Incredibly, and I was in private touch with the WHO,

02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:00.300
after announcing the 26 people,

02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:03.860
the WHO said, we're reopening the process.

02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:04.860
So send in more.

02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:07.740
And so then they added two more people,

02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:12.740
one of whom is an expert in the auditing of lab incidents.

02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:17.060
And then one of the, so they added those two.

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:19.820
And then when they just released the list

02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:22.140
of people who are part of SAGO,

02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:25.900
this one woman, a highly respected Dutch virologist

02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:26.820
named Marion Koopmans,

02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:29.500
who had been part of that deeply flawed

02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:33.180
and compromised international study group,

02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:35.300
who had called, who has consistently called

02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:37.100
a lab incident origin, quote unquote,

02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:39.380
a debunked conspiracy theory.

02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:42.820
As of now, her name is not on the list.

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:44.860
We haven't seen any announcements.

02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:48.140
So I summary, and I'm sorry to go on for so long

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:49.620
and to be so animated about this.

02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:54.220
I genuinely feel that the WHO is trying

02:42:54.220 --> 02:42:55.780
to do the right thing,

02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:59.540
but they exist within a political context.

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:01.420
And they're kind of, it's like,

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:03.820
they're pushing at the edges,

02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:07.660
but there's only so far that they can go.

02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:10.180
And that's why we definitely need

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:12.540
to have full accountability for the WHO.

02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:14.860
We need to expand the mandate to WHO,

02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:18.220
but we need to recognize that states have a big role.

02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:21.540
And China is an incredibly influential state

02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:23.420
that's doing everything possible

02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:26.180
to prevent the kind of full investigation

02:43:26.180 --> 02:43:28.900
into pandemic origins that's so desperately required.

02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:31.180
Well, it sounds like the leadership

02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:34.220
made all the difference in the WHO.

02:43:34.220 --> 02:43:36.020
So like the way to change the momentum

02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:38.860
of large institutions is through the leadership.

02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:41.900
Leadership and empowerment.

02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:45.140
As I mentioned, the World Health Assembly is meeting now.

02:43:45.140 --> 02:43:48.140
And I think that it shouldn't be

02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:50.740
that we require super humans.

02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:53.740
And there are some people who are big critics of WHO.

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:58.500
The leader of the WHO in SARS-1

02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:00.420
was definitely more aggressive.

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:04.140
She had a different set of powers at that time.

02:44:05.540 --> 02:44:08.020
But it can't be entirely,

02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:10.540
I mean, we definitely need strong-willed,

02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:14.540
aggressive, independent people in these kinds of roles.

02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:17.820
We also need a more empowered WHO,

02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.100
like when the Chinese government,

02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:22.180
in the earliest days of the pandemic,

02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:24.660
said, we're just not going to allow you

02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:27.020
to send a team to collect your own information.

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:29.540
And we're not gonna allow you

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:34.180
to have any kind of independent surveillance.

02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:37.620
There was very little that the WHO could do

02:44:37.620 --> 02:44:40.580
because of the limitations of its mandate.

02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:43.020
And we can't just say we're gonna have a WHO

02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:46.220
that only compromises Chinese sovereignty.

02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:48.540
If we wanna have a powerful WHO,

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:52.220
we should say you have emergency teams.

02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:55.180
When the director general says

02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:57.780
an emergency team needs to go somewhere,

02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:00.500
if they aren't allowed to go there that day,

02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:02.500
you could say there's an immediate referral

02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:03.620
to the Security Council.

02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:05.780
There needs to be something.

02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:09.140
But we have all these demands, rightfully,

02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:13.260
so of the WHO, which doesn't have the authorities.

02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:16.620
The WHO itself only controls 20% of its own budget.

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:17.580
So the governments are saying,

02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:21.660
we're gonna give you money to do this or that.

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:26.660
So we need a stronger WHO to protect us,

02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:28.940
but we also have to build that.

02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:31.220
So looking a little bit into the future,

02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:34.980
let's first step into the past,

02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:39.620
sort of the philosophical question about China.

02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:42.100
If you were to put yourself

02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:44.180
in the shoes of the Chinese government,

02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:49.420
if they were to be more transparent,

02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:51.540
how should they be more transparent?

02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:56.540
Because it's easier to say we want to see this,

02:45:57.900 --> 02:45:59.340
but from a perspective of government,

02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:00.780
and not just the Chinese government,

02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:05.780
but a government on whose geographic territory,

02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:11.300
say it's a lab leak, a lab leak occurred

02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:16.300
that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss,

02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:20.980
countless of lives, just all kinds of damage to the world.

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:27.860
If they were to admit or show data

02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:31.220
that could serve as evidence for a lab leak,

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:34.620
that's something that people could,

02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:38.180
like in the worst case, start wars over,

02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:41.260
or in the most likely case,

02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:45.980
just constantly bring that up at every turn,

02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:50.020
making you powerless in negotiations.

02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:51.940
It's like whenever you want to do something

02:46:51.940 --> 02:46:54.220
in a geopolitical sense,

02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:55.940
the United States will bring up,

02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:59.540
oh, remember that time you cost us trillions of dollars

02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:01.500
because of your fuck up?

02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:05.540
So what is the incentive for the Chinese government

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:07.380
to be transparent?

02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:11.540
And if it is to be transparent, how should it do it?

02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:14.180
So there's a bunch of people,

02:47:14.180 --> 02:47:15.700
the reason I'm talking to you,

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:19.300
as opposed to a bunch of other folks,

02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:21.940
because you are kind, hearted, and thoughtful,

02:47:21.940 --> 02:47:24.500
and open-minded, and really respected,

02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:27.540
there's a bunch of people that are talking about a lab leak

02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:30.380
that are a little bit less interested

02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:33.020
in building a better world,

02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:34.860
and more interested in pointing out

02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:36.180
that the amplifier has no clothes.

02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:38.580
They want step one, which is saying,

02:47:38.580 --> 02:47:43.580
like basically tearing down the bullshitters.

02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:48.380
They don't want to do the further steps of building.

02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:50.540
And so as a Chinese government,

02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:53.820
I would be nervous about being transparent with anybody

02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:57.860
that just wants to tear our power centers,

02:47:57.860 --> 02:47:59.100
our power structures down.

02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:00.660
Anyway, that's a long way to ask,

02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:05.740
how should the Chinese government be transparent

02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:07.380
now and in the future?

02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:12.100
So maybe I'll break that down into a few sub-questions.

02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:15.780
The first is what should, in an ideal world,

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:17.580
what should the Chinese government do?

02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:20.180
And that's pretty straightforward.

02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:22.660
They should be totally transparent.

02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:24.580
The South African government now,

02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:27.900
there's an outbreak of this Omicron variant,

02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:30.020
and the South African government has done

02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:32.100
what we would want a government to do,

02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:33.220
is say, hey, there's an outbreak.

02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:35.620
We don't have all of the information.

02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:36.540
We need help.

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:38.540
We want to alert the world,

02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:41.060
and in some ways they're being punished for it

02:48:41.060 --> 02:48:42.060
through these travel bans,

02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:43.700
but it's a separate topic,

02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:46.140
but I actually think short-term travel bans

02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:48.020
actually are not a terrible idea.

02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:50.940
They should have, on day one,

02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:55.060
if they should have allowed WHO experts in,

02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:57.260
they should have shared information.

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.100
They should have allowed a full

02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:02.140
and comprehensive investigation

02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:04.260
with international partnerships

02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:07.940
to understand what went wrong.

02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:10.620
They should have shared their raw data.

02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:12.900
They should have allowed their scientists

02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:14.740
to speak and write publicly,

02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:17.060
because nobody knows more about this stuff,

02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:18.260
certainly in the early days,

02:49:18.260 --> 02:49:20.620
than their scientists do.

02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:25.620
So it's relatively easy to say what they should do.

02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:29.380
It's a hard question to say, well, what would happen?

02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:32.980
Let's just say tomorrow.

02:49:32.980 --> 02:49:36.620
We prove for certain that this pandemic stems

02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:39.420
both from an accidental lab incident

02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:41.260
and then from what I've consistently called

02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:42.820
a criminal cover-up,

02:49:42.820 --> 02:49:46.220
because the cover-up has done, in many ways,

02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:49.860
as much or more damage than the incident.

02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:50.820
Well, what happens?

02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:54.100
You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms

02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:57.740
as the leader of China.

02:49:57.740 --> 02:49:59.900
And he can now have unlimited terms.

02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.900
Well, they've changed the rules for that,

02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:03.540
but he's got a lot of enemies.

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:04.500
I mean, there are a lot of people

02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:07.620
who are waiting in line to step up.

02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:11.180
So is there a chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed

02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:13.380
if it was proven that this comes from a lab?

02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:15.460
I think there's a real possibility.

02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:19.380
Would people in the United States Congress, for example,

02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:21.900
demand reparations from China?

02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:26.220
So we've had $4.5 trillion of stimulus,

02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.100
all of the economic losses,

02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:32.900
and we owe a lot of money to China from our debt.

02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:36.420
I'm quite certain that members of Congress would say,

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:37.620
we're just gonna wipe that out.

02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:39.860
It would destroy the global financial system,

02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:42.300
but I think they would be extremely likely.

02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:44.340
Would other countries like India

02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:47.740
that have lost millions of people

02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:50.620
and had terrible economic damages,

02:50:50.660 --> 02:50:53.260
would they demand reparations?

02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:55.740
So I think from a Chinese perspective,

02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.380
starting from now,

02:50:57.380 --> 02:51:00.580
it would have major geopolitical implications.

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:03.220
And go back to Chernobyl,

02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:05.660
like there was a reason why the Soviet Union

02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:08.260
went to such length to cover things up.

02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:09.940
And when it came out,

02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:11.540
I mean, there are different theories,

02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:15.820
but certainly Chernobyl played some role

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:19.500
in the end of communist power

02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:21.260
in the Soviet Union.

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:25.540
So the Chinese are very, very aware of that.

02:51:25.540 --> 02:51:27.340
But the difference, of course, with Chernobyl,

02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:28.660
the damage to the rest of the world

02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:32.020
was not nearly as significant as with COVID.

02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:34.500
So you say that the cover-up is a crime,

02:51:34.500 --> 02:51:37.700
but everything you just described,

02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:40.780
the response of the rest of the world,

02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:44.020
is, I could say, unfair.

02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:49.420
So, okay, if we say the best possible version

02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:53.980
of the story, you know, lab leaks happen.

02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:57.780
They shouldn't happen, but they happen.

02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:01.100
And how is that on the Chinese government?

02:52:02.300 --> 02:52:04.020
I mean, what's a good example?

02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:06.020
Well, the Union Carbide, Union Carbide.

02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:09.140
There was this American company operating in India.

02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:10.300
They had this leak.

02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:12.620
All these people were killed.

02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:15.100
The company admitted responsibility.

02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:17.500
I was working in the White House

02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:19.500
when the United States government, in my view,

02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:20.980
which I know to be the case,

02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:23.420
but other people in China think differently,

02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:25.500
bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.740
And so the United States government

02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:29.580
allowed a full investigation.

02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:34.260
Then we paid reparations to the family, the families.

02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:36.860
And so to your question, if I were,

02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:39.620
let's just say I were the Chinese government,

02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:42.100
not, I mean, kind of an idealized version

02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:43.740
of the Chinese government.

02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:46.980
And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion

02:52:46.980 --> 02:52:48.980
that it was a lab incident.

02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:51.100
And let's just say they knew

02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:55.060
that even if they continued to cover it up,

02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:58.620
eventually this information would come out.

02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:00.140
I mean, maybe there was a whistleblower.

02:53:00.140 --> 02:53:01.940
Maybe they knew of some evidence

02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:05.220
that we didn't know about or something.

02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:07.620
What would I do starting right now?

02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:12.540
What I would do is I would hold a press conference

02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:16.820
and I would say, we had this terrible accident.

02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:19.540
The reason why we were doing this research

02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:23.300
in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS-1

02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:26.420
and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible

02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:29.380
to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again

02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:31.460
for our country and for the world.

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:34.460
That was why we collaborated with France,

02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:38.420
with the United States in building up those capacities.

02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:40.460
We know that nothing is perfect,

02:53:40.460 --> 02:53:42.820
but we're a sovereign country and we have our own system.

02:53:42.820 --> 02:53:45.700
And so we had to adapt our systems

02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:49.420
so that they made sense internally.

02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:53.980
When this outbreak began, we didn't know how it started.

02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:57.700
And that was why we wanted to look into things.

02:53:57.700 --> 02:54:01.460
When the process of investigating became so political,

02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:03.780
it gave us pause and we were worried

02:54:03.780 --> 02:54:07.460
that our enemies were trying to use this investigation

02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:09.540
in order to undermine us.

02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:13.740
Having said that, now that we've dug deeper,

02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:16.700
we have recognized because we have access

02:54:16.700 --> 02:54:19.500
to additional information that we didn't have then,

02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:23.580
that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident

02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:25.860
and we feel really terribly about that.

02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:28.500
And we know that we were very aggressive

02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:31.060
in covering up information in the beginning,

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:34.340
but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly,

02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:37.620
we fully believe that it came from a natural origin.

02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:41.300
Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly.

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:44.900
Therefore, we're doing a few different things.

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:48.180
One is we are committing ourselves

02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:53.180
to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty

02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:57.820
that addresses the major challenges that we face

02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:00.980
and allows the World Health Organization

02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:03.700
to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty

02:55:03.700 --> 02:55:06.900
because we know that when these pandemics happen,

02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:08.740
they affect everybody.

02:55:08.780 --> 02:55:11.980
We are also putting, and you can pick your number,

02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:15.340
but let's start with 5 trillion US dollars,

02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:19.620
some massive amount into a fund

02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:24.540
that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID-19

02:55:24.540 --> 02:55:26.140
and their-

02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:27.660
China would do that?

02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:29.540
This is a fantasy speech.

02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:31.900
But I disagree with your, I mean, okay.

02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:36.940
So you think China has responsibility.

02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:40.620
So it's not just a lab leak.

02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:45.100
If China on day one had said, we have this outbreak,

02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:47.060
we don't know where it came from,

02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:50.100
we want to have a full investigation,

02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:53.820
we call on responsible international partners

02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:55.620
to join us in that process,

02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:57.980
and we're going to do everything in our power

02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:00.340
to share the relevant information

02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:03.180
because however this started, we're all victims.

02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:05.140
That's a totally different story

02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:08.820
than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO,

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.660
blocking any investigation,

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.740
condemning people who are trying to look.

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:13.900
And so-

02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:16.900
So cover up for a couple of weeks,

02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:18.620
you can understand maybe

02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:20.500
because there's so much uncertainty.

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:24.620
You're like, oh, let's hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures

02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:26.060
while we figure this out.

02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:28.820
But the moment you really figure out what happened,

02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:31.780
you always, as a joke,

02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:35.300
always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation,

02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:36.620
a little bit, just a little bit.

02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:38.460
Be like, all right, it's not us.

02:56:40.220 --> 02:56:41.060
I'm just kidding.

02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:44.700
But be proactive in saying-

02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:45.540
Just to start it up,

02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:48.980
but the joke about that is there's a big problem

02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:50.860
because a lot of people have to leave

02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:52.980
the Jewish socialist conspiracy

02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:56.100
to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting.

02:56:56.100 --> 02:56:56.940
I love it.

02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:01.700
So I would say not five trillion,

02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:03.460
but some large amount.

02:57:03.460 --> 02:57:05.180
And I would really focus on the future,

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:08.020
which is every time we talk about the lab leak,

02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:11.780
the unfortunate thing is I feel like people

02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:13.340
don't focus enough about the future.

02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:15.100
To me, the lab leak is important

02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:20.180
because we want to construct a kind of framework

02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:23.700
of thinking and a global conversation

02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:28.420
that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks,

02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:30.820
which will almost certainly happen.

02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:35.860
So to me, any lab leak is about the future.

02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:40.020
I would launch a giant investment in saying,

02:57:40.020 --> 02:57:43.420
we're going to create a testing infrastructure,

02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:46.740
like all of this kind of infrastructure investments

02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:49.500
that help minimize the damage of a lab leak

02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:51.300
here and the rest of the world.

02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:54.420
So the challenge with that is one,

02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:58.420
it's hard to imagine a fully accountable future system

02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:01.940
to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics

02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:05.980
that's built upon obfuscation and coverup

02:58:05.980 --> 02:58:09.580
regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century.

02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:14.340
So it's just like that foundation isn't strong enough.

02:58:14.340 --> 02:58:17.820
Second, China across the fields of science

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:20.740
is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world.

02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:25.140
So China has current plans to build BSL-4 labs

02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:27.100
in every of its province.

02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:28.620
Yeah, they're scaling up the-

02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:30.460
They're scaling up everything,

02:58:30.460 --> 02:58:32.420
ends it with the plan on leading.

02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:33.740
And that's why, again, I was saying before,

02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:36.700
I think there's a lot of similarity between this story,

02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:40.260
at least as I see it, at least the most probable case,

02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:42.700
and these other areas where China gets knowledge

02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:44.140
and then tries to leapfrog.

02:58:44.140 --> 02:58:48.380
It's the same with AI and autonomous killer robots.

02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:50.340
It's the same with human genome editing,

02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:51.580
with animal experimentation,

02:58:51.580 --> 02:58:56.580
with so many, basically all areas of advanced science.

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:01.780
So the question is, would China stop in that process?

02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:05.580
And then third, and it's a little bit

02:59:05.580 --> 02:59:07.060
of a historical background,

02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:10.620
but defending national sovereignty

02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:13.500
is one of the core principles of,

02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:16.060
certainly of the Chinese state.

02:59:16.060 --> 02:59:18.500
And the historical issue is,

02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:21.180
for those of us who come from the West,

02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:24.020
I mean, one of the lessons of the post-war planners

02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:26.940
was that absolute national sovereignty

02:59:26.940 --> 02:59:29.700
was actually a major feeder

02:59:29.700 --> 02:59:31.420
into the First and Second World Wars,

02:59:31.420 --> 02:59:34.300
that we had all these conflicting states.

02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:37.420
And therefore, the logic of the post-war system

02:59:37.420 --> 02:59:39.620
is we need to, in some ways, pool sovereignty

02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:44.420
that's like the EU and have transnational organizations

02:59:44.420 --> 02:59:45.980
like the UN organizations

02:59:45.980 --> 02:59:47.820
and the Bretton Woods organizations.

02:59:47.820 --> 02:59:52.100
For most Asian states, and also even for some African,

02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:55.540
the people who are kind of on the colonized side of history,

02:59:55.540 --> 02:59:58.740
sovereignty was the thing that was denied them.

02:59:58.740 --> 03:00:00.060
That was the thing that they want,

03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:01.900
that the European power is denied.

03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:04.740
And so the idea of giving up sovereignty

03:00:04.740 --> 03:00:07.060
was the absolute opposite.

03:00:07.060 --> 03:00:10.140
And so that's why China is,

03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:12.420
and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book.

03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:15.140
It's not that China is trying to strengthen

03:00:15.140 --> 03:00:17.220
this rules-based international order,

03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:19.220
which is based on the principle that,

03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:21.260
well, there are certain things that we share,

03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:23.860
and how do we build a governance system

03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:25.700
to protect those things?

03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:27.020
What it seems to be doing

03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:31.300
is trying to advance its own sovereignty.

03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:33.020
And so I think I agree with you,

03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:37.060
but I don't think that we can just go forward

03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:39.620
without some accountability for the...

03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:41.460
So cover-up was a big problem.

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:44.060
It's like, I often,

03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:46.580
I find myself playing devil's advocate

03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:49.540
because I'm trying to sort of empathize,

03:00:49.540 --> 03:00:54.300
and then I forget that two or three people

03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:55.140
listen to this thing,

03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:55.980
and then they're like,

03:00:55.980 --> 03:00:58.940
look, Lex is defending the Chinese government

03:00:58.940 --> 03:00:59.760
with their cover-up.

03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:04.760
No, I'm just trying to understand.

03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:08.100
I mean, it's the same reason I'm reading Mein Kampf now,

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:13.100
is you have to really understand the minds of people

03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:18.380
as if I too could have done that.

03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:21.140
You have to understand that we're all the same

03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:22.860
to some degree,

03:01:22.860 --> 03:01:25.340
and that kind of empathy is required

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.680
to figure out solutions for the future.

03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:32.660
It's just in empathizing with the Chinese government

03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:34.180
in this whole situation,

03:01:35.180 --> 03:01:38.260
I'm still not sure I understand

03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:41.980
how to minimize the chance of a cover-up in the future,

03:01:41.980 --> 03:01:44.080
whether for China or for the United States.

03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:45.740
If the virus started in the United States,

03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:48.160
I'm not exactly sure we would be,

03:01:49.420 --> 03:01:52.500
with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech,

03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:57.500
with all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press

03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:00.500
and access to the press,

03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:02.720
the sort of all aspects of government,

03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:04.140
I'm not sure the US government

03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:06.060
wouldn't do this similar kind of cover-up.

03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:07.340
Let me put it this way.

03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:09.940
So we're in Texas now doing this interview.

03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:13.580
Imagine there's a kind of horseshoe bat

03:02:13.580 --> 03:02:17.100
that we'll call the Texas Horseshoe Bat,

03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:18.620
and the Texas-

03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:19.860
There's a lot of bats in Austin,

03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:21.980
but it's a whole thing. It's true, it's true.

03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:25.580
And so let's just say that the Texas Horseshoe Bats

03:02:25.580 --> 03:02:28.460
only exist in Texas.

03:02:28.460 --> 03:02:32.140
But in Montana, we have a thing,

03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:36.260
it's called the Montana Institute of Virology.

03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:38.900
And at the Montana Institute of Virology,

03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:41.460
they have the world's largest collection

03:02:41.460 --> 03:02:43.740
of Texas Horseshoe Bats,

03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:47.340
including horseshoe bats that are associated

03:02:47.340 --> 03:02:51.420
with a previous global pandemic

03:02:51.420 --> 03:02:55.020
called the Texas Horseshoe Bat Pandemic.

03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:58.900
And let's just say that people in Montana,

03:02:58.900 --> 03:03:03.340
in the same town where this Montana Institute of Virology is,

03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:06.020
start getting a version

03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:10.000
of this Texas Horseshoe Bat Syndrome

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:13.640
that is genetically relatively similar

03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:15.280
to the outbreak in Texas.

03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:18.080
There are no horseshoe bats there.

03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:21.400
And the government says, it's your same point,

03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:23.320
Alina's point about the unicorns,

03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:26.520
like, nothing to see here, just move along.

03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:28.360
You know, I would-

03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:29.200
No, but what's the-

03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:33.160
Would Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan,

03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:36.760
and would they say, oh, I guess, I mean, I just think that-

03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:40.600
No, no, but the point is the government going to say it.

03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:45.080
So, Joe Rogan is a comedian.

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:48.960
Brett Weinstein is a podcaster.

03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:53.520
The point is, what we want is not just those folks

03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:56.260
to have the freedom to speak, that's important.

03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:58.400
But you want the government to have the transparent,

03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:02.400
like, I don't think Joe Rogan is enough

03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:04.400
to hold the government accountable.

03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:06.760
I think they're gonna do their thing anyway.

03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:09.100
But I think that's our system,

03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:12.320
and that was the genius of the Founding Fathers.

03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:13.240
Was that enough?

03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:16.060
That the government probably is going to have

03:04:16.060 --> 03:04:18.240
a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing.

03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.360
That was the experience in England before.

03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:25.800
And so that's why we have free speech,

03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:27.120
to hold the government accountable.

03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:30.160
I mean, I'm kind of broadly a gun control person,

03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:31.520
but the people who say, well,

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:34.160
we need to have broad gun rights.

03:04:35.220 --> 03:04:39.040
As somebody who's now in Texas, I am offended.

03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:40.880
But their argument is, look,

03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:42.920
we don't fully trust the government.

03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:47.680
If the government, just like we fought against the British,

03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:48.520
if the government's wrong,

03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:51.040
we want to at least have some authority.

03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:53.640
So that's our system, is to have that kind of voice,

03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:57.600
and that is the public voice actually balances.

03:04:57.600 --> 03:05:00.080
Because every government, as you correctly said,

03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:02.880
every government has the same instincts,

03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:06.480
and that's why we have, and it's imperfect here,

03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:08.640
but kind of these ideas of separation of powers,

03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:11.280
of inalienable rights, so that we can have,

03:05:11.280 --> 03:05:14.600
it's almost like a vast market where we can have balance.

03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:17.940
So you think if a lab leak occurred in the United States,

03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:23.920
what probability would you put some kind of public report,

03:05:24.120 --> 03:05:29.120
led by Rand Paul, would come out saying this was a lab leak?

03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:31.640
You have good confidence that that would happen?

03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:32.480
I have pretty decent confidence,

03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:35.160
and the reason I say, I mentioned that I'm a,

03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:37.240
I might think of myself, I'm sure I'm not anymore,

03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:39.840
because as I get older, but as a progressive person,

03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:44.280
I'm a Democrat, and I worked in Democratic administrations,

03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:45.280
worked for President Clinton

03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:47.780
on the National Security Council.

03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:52.520
But my kind of best friend in the United States Senate,

03:05:52.520 --> 03:05:55.560
who I talk to all the time,

03:05:55.560 --> 03:05:59.400
is a Senator from Kansas named Roger Marshall.

03:05:59.400 --> 03:06:03.320
And Roger, I mean, if you just lined up our positions

03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:07.340
on all sorts of things, we're radically different.

03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:13.200
But we have a great relationship, we talk all the time,

03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:16.080
and we share a commitment to saying,

03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:20.120
well, let's ask the tough questions about how this started.

03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:22.880
And again, if we had, like,

03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:24.280
what is the United States government?

03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:27.320
Yeah, it's the executive branch, but there's also Congress.

03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:29.920
And Congress, you talk about Rand Paul,

03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:33.520
and as a former executive branch worker,

03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:35.640
when I was on the National Security Council,

03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:38.920
and I guess technically when I was at the State Department,

03:06:38.920 --> 03:06:40.840
all of this stuff, all of this process,

03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:42.640
it just seems like a pain in the ass.

03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:46.720
It's like these F-ers, they're just attacking us.

03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:48.400
We tried to do this thing with,

03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:49.880
we had all the best intentions,

03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:51.000
and now they're holding hearings,

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.720
and they're trying to box us in, and whatever.

03:06:53.720 --> 03:06:55.080
But that's our process,

03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:58.280
and there's a form of accountability as chaotic,

03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:03.280
as crazy as it is, and so it makes it really difficult.

03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:05.680
I mean, we have other problems of just chaos

03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:07.600
and everybody doing their own thing,

03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:10.200
but it makes it difficult to have

03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:11.640
a kind of systematic cover-up.

03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:15.920
And again, all of that is predicated on my hypothesis,

03:07:15.920 --> 03:07:18.640
not fully proven, although I think likely,

03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:23.000
that there is a lab incident origin of this pandemic.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:26.640
Well, I mean, we're having several layers of conversation,

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:31.640
but I think whether a lab leak hypothesis is true or not,

03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:38.600
it does seem that the likelihood of a cover-up,

03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:41.920
if it leaked from a lab, is high.

03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:45.400
That's the more important conversation to be having.

03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:48.040
Well, you could argue a lot of things,

03:07:48.040 --> 03:07:51.520
but to me, arguably, that's the more important conversation,

03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:53.720
is about what is the likelihood of a cover-up.

03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:54.800
100%.

03:07:54.800 --> 03:07:59.400
Like, in my mind, there is a legitimate debate

03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:01.920
about the origins of the pandemic.

03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:04.080
There are people who I respect,

03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:06.360
who I don't necessarily agree with,

03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:10.040
people like Stuart Neal, who's a virologist in the UK,

03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:11.640
who's been very open-minded,

03:08:11.640 --> 03:08:16.160
engaged in productive debate about the origin,

03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:18.200
and you know where I stand.

03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:22.440
There is, is, and can be no debate

03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:25.280
about whether or not there has been a cover-up.

03:08:25.280 --> 03:08:26.440
There has been a cover-up.

03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:29.640
There is, in my mind, no credible argument

03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:31.360
that there hasn't been a cover-up,

03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:35.480
and we can just see it in the regulations,

03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:37.160
in the lack of access.

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:40.520
There's an incredible woman named Zhang Zhan,

03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:44.280
who is a Chinese, we have to call her a citizen journalist,

03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.120
because everything is controlled by the state,

03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:47.760
but in the early days of the pandemic,

03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:52.080
she went to Wuhan, started taking videos and posting them.

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:54.960
She was imprisoned for picking quarrels,

03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:57.480
which is kind of a catch-all,

03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:00.280
and now she's engaged in a hunger strike,

03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:02.040
and she's near death.

03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:06.720
And so there's no question that there has been a cover-up,

03:09:06.720 --> 03:09:08.320
and there's no question in my mind

03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:10.440
that that cover-up is responsible

03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:13.960
for a significant percentage of the total deaths

03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:15.080
due to COVID-19.

03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:21.080
In a pivot, can I talk to you about sex?

03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:23.360
Let's roll.

03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:26.480
Okay, so you're the author of a book, Hacking Darwin.

03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:34.080
So humans have used sex, allegedly, as I've read about,

03:09:36.160 --> 03:09:41.160
to make genetic information to produce offspring,

03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:44.680
to produce offspring, and sort of,

03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.480
through that kind of process,

03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:49.880
adapted their environment.

03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:51.840
Lex, you mentioned earlier about

03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:53.640
you're asking tough questions

03:09:53.640 --> 03:09:56.080
and people pushing you to ask tough questions.

03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:56.920
This is...

03:09:56.920 --> 03:09:57.760
Is it okay if I...

03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:01.200
So you said you have done this as I've read about.

03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:03.360
As I've read about on the internet, yeah.

03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:06.240
All I'm saying, as a person sitting with you,

03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:11.280
to people who would be open-minded in experimenting

03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:13.720
of, as I've read about, to reality,

03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:18.720
what I would say is Lex Fridman is handsome, charming.

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:24.000
He's really a great guy.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:24.840
I'm sorry to interrupt.

03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:26.760
Thank you, I appreciate that.

03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:28.720
So I was reading about this last night.

03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:30.080
I was gonna tweet it, but then I'm like,

03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:31.880
this is going to be misinterpreted.

03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:36.080
This is why I like podcasts,

03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:38.360
I could say stuff like this.

03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:42.600
It's kind of incredible to me

03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:46.760
that the average human male produces

03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:51.120
500 billion plus sperm cells in their lifetime.

03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:55.240
Each one of those are genetically unique.

03:10:57.360 --> 03:10:59.880
They can produce unique humans.

03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:01.800
Each one, 500 billion.

03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:05.480
There's 100 billion people who's ever lived.

03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:09.400
Maybe like 110, whatever, whatever the number is.

03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:11.160
So it's like five times the number of people

03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:15.720
who ever lived is produced by each male

03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:18.400
of genetic information.

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:20.160
So those are all possible trajectories

03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:22.400
of lives that could have lived.

03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:25.520
Those are all little people that could have been,

03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:28.160
and all the possible stories,

03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:32.200
all the Hitlers and Einsteins that could have been created,

03:11:32.200 --> 03:11:34.120
and all that, I don't know,

03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:38.280
this kind of, you're painting this possible future,

03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:40.680
and we get to see only one little string of that.

03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:44.320
I mean, I suppose the magic of that is also captured

03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:47.280
by the, in the space of physics,

03:11:47.280 --> 03:11:51.800
having multiple dimensions in the many worlds,

03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:53.360
hypothesis of quantum mechanics,

03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:58.360
the interpretation that we're basically just at every point

03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:03.120
there's an infinite offspring of universes

03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:04.680
that are created.

03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:06.640
But I don't know, that's just like a magic

03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:10.800
of this game of genetics that we're playing.

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:15.160
And the winning sperm is not the fastest.

03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:19.360
The winning sperm is basically the luckiest,

03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:21.000
has the right timing.

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:24.800
So it's not, I also got into this whole,

03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:29.320
I started reading papers about like,

03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:32.680
is there something to be said about who wins the race?

03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:35.240
Genetically, so it's fascinating,

03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:37.280
because there's studies in animals and so on

03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:39.560
to answer that question, because it's interesting,

03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:41.680
because I'm a winner, right?

03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:43.680
I won, I won a race.

03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:46.520
And so you wanna know what does that say about me

03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:50.720
in this fascinating genetic race against,

03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:54.280
I think, what is it, 200 million others, I think.

03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:59.280
So one pool of sperm cells is about,

03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:02.240
so something like 200 million.

03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:06.280
It could be, yes, but that, millions.

03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:08.040
I thought it was much, much lower than that.

03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:13.040
So like that, those are all brothers and sisters of mine,

03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:16.600
and I beat them all out, I won.

03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:19.280
And so it's interesting to know,

03:13:21.280 --> 03:13:24.120
there's a temptation to say I'm somehow better than them,

03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:28.360
right, and now that goes into the next stage

03:13:28.360 --> 03:13:31.760
of something you're, or deeply thinking about,

03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:38.160
which is if we have more control now

03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.840
over the winning genetic code that becomes offspring,

03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:48.320
if we have first not even control, just information,

03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:53.160
and then control, what do you think that world looks like

03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:56.520
from a biological perspective and from an ethical perspective

03:13:56.520 --> 03:14:00.720
when we start getting more information and more control?

03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:02.280
Yeah, great question.

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:05.840
So first, on the sperm, there can be up to

03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:10.560
about 1.2 billion sperm cells in a male ejaculation.

03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:13.160
So as I mentioned in Hacking Darwin,

03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:15.360
male sperm, it's kind of a dime a dozen

03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:18.400
with all the guys in all the world

03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:20.280
just doing whatever they do with it.

03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:26.160
And it's an open question how competitive,

03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:28.480
I mean, there is an element of luck

03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:31.760
and there is an element of competition,

03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:36.680
and it's an open question how much that competition

03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:40.200
impacts the outcome or whether it's just luck,

03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:45.200
but my guess is there's some combination of fitness and luck.

03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:49.480
But you're absolutely right that all of those other sperm cells

03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:52.720
in the ejaculation, if that's how the union

03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:55.800
of sperm and egg is happening,

03:14:55.840 --> 03:14:59.400
all of them represent a different future.

03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:03.840
And there's a wonderful book called Invisible Cities

03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:08.120
by Italo Calvino, and he even talks about a city

03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:10.320
as something like this where everybody,

03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:12.800
you have your life, but then you have

03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:14.720
all these alternate lives, and every time

03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:17.000
you make any decision, you're kind of,

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.320
and so, but in this Invisible Cities,

03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:23.320
there's a little string that goes toward that alternate life

03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:25.520
and then the city becomes this weaving

03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:29.000
of all the strings of people's real lives

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.720
and the alternate lives that they could have taken

03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:34.040
had they made any other different steps.

03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:37.640
So that part, it's like a deep philosophical question.

03:15:37.640 --> 03:15:39.840
It's not just for us, it's for all of us.

03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:43.320
It's baked into evolutionary biology.

03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:45.320
It's just what are the different strategies

03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:48.440
for different species to achieve fitness,

03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:52.040
and there's some of the different corals or other fish

03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:55.320
where they just kind of release the eggs into the water,

03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:58.920
and there's all different kinds of ways.

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:03.160
And then, you're right, in my book, Hacking Darwin,

03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:04.840
and it's the full title is Hacking Darwin,

03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:07.440
Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity,

03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.600
I kind of go deep into exploring the big picture

03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:17.960
implications of the future of human reproduction.

03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:20.920
We are already participating

03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:23.440
in a revolutionary transformation,

03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:26.400
not just because of the diagnostics that we have,

03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:28.400
things like ultrasound,

03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:31.160
but because now an increasing number of us

03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:33.880
are being born through in vitro fertilization,

03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:36.560
which means the eggs are extracted from the mother,

03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:41.240
they're fertilized by the father's sperm in vitro in a lab,

03:16:41.240 --> 03:16:45.160
and then re-implanted in the mother.

03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:48.880
On top of that, there's a somewhat newer

03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:52.800
but still now older technology

03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:55.560
called pre-implantation genetic testing.

03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:58.640
And so, as everyone knows from high school biology,

03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:01.360
you have the fertilized egg,

03:17:01.360 --> 03:17:03.960
and then it goes one cell to two cells

03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:05.280
to four to eight and whatever.

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:09.600
And after around five days, in this PGT process,

03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:12.200
a few cells are extracted.

03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:15.440
So let's say you have 10 fertilized eggs,

03:17:15.440 --> 03:17:18.520
early stage embryos, a few cells are extracted from each,

03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:22.160
and those cells, the ones that are extracted,

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:25.080
would end up becoming the placenta.

03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:28.640
But every one of our cells has, other than a few,

03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:31.040
has our full genome.

03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:33.080
And so then you sequence those cells,

03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:36.440
and with pre-implantation genetic testing now,

03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:38.720
what you can do is you can screen out

03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:43.720
deadly single gene mutation disorders,

03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:47.160
things that could be deadly or life-ruining.

03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:49.440
And so people use it to determine

03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:53.280
which of those 10 early stage embryos

03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:55.720
to implant in a mother.

03:17:55.720 --> 03:18:00.040
As we shift towards a much greater understanding of genetics,

03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:04.200
and that is part of just the broader genetics revolution,

03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:07.800
but within that, in our transition from personalized

03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:10.440
to precision healthcare, more and more of us

03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:12.440
are going to have our whole genome sequenced

03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:13.960
because it's going to be the foundation

03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:16.040
of getting personalized healthcare.

03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:19.400
We're going to have already millions, but very soon,

03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:23.040
billions of people who've had their whole genome sequenced,

03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:24.920
and then we'll have big databases

03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:28.280
of people's genetic genotypic information and life,

03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:30.880
or phenotypic information, and using,

03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:33.840
coming into your area, our tools of machine learning

03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:35.880
and data analytics, we're going to be able

03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:40.320
to increasingly understand patterns of genetic expression,

03:18:40.320 --> 03:18:41.160
even though we're all different.

03:18:41.160 --> 03:18:44.280
So predict how that genetic information will get expressed.

03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:45.920
Correct, correct.

03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:48.880
Never perfectly, perhaps, but more and more,

03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:50.360
always more and more.

03:18:50.360 --> 03:18:54.520
And so with that information, we aren't going to just be,

03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:58.480
even now, we aren't going to just be selecting

03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:02.280
based on which of these 10 early stage embryos

03:19:02.280 --> 03:19:04.800
is carrying a deadly genetic disorder,

03:19:04.800 --> 03:19:09.240
but we'll be able to know everything that can be partly

03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:12.400
or entirely predicted by genetics.

03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:14.760
And there's a lot of our humanity

03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:17.400
that fits into that category.

03:19:17.400 --> 03:19:22.400
And certainly, simple traits like height and eye color

03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:23.960
and things like that.

03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:25.600
I mean, height is not at all simple,

03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:28.920
but if you have good nutrition,

03:19:28.920 --> 03:19:31.520
it's entirely or mostly genetic.

03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:34.480
But even personality traits and personality styles,

03:19:34.480 --> 03:19:37.520
there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience,

03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:40.960
the beauty of life, that are partly

03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:42.200
have a genetic foundation.

03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:47.200
And so whatever part of these traits are definable

03:19:47.400 --> 03:19:50.040
and influenced by genetics,

03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:53.280
we're going to have greater and greater predictability

03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:54.680
within a range.

03:19:54.680 --> 03:19:59.680
And so selecting those embryos will be informed

03:20:00.040 --> 03:20:02.600
by that kind of knowledge.

03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:04.680
And that's why in Hacking Darwin,

03:20:04.680 --> 03:20:07.320
I talk about embryo selection

03:20:07.320 --> 03:20:11.720
as being a key driver of the future of human evolution.

03:20:11.720 --> 03:20:15.440
But then on top of that, there is, in 2012,

03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:19.960
Yoshichinya Yamanaka, an amazing Japanese scientist,

03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:23.160
won the Nobel Prize for developing a process

03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:24.320
for creating what are called

03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:27.680
induced pluripotent stem cells, IPS cells.

03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:31.960
And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell

03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:35.400
to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell.

03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:39.800
And a stem cell is like when we're a fertilized egg,

03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:42.840
like our entire blueprint is in that one cell,

03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:44.360
and that cell can be anything.

03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:48.320
But then our cells start to specialize,

03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:50.640
and that's why we have skin cells and blood cells

03:20:50.640 --> 03:20:51.760
and all the different types of things.

03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:54.880
So with the Yamanaka process,

03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:59.880
we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell.

03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:03.160
So the relevance to this story is what you can do,

03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:05.320
and it works now in animal models.

03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:08.440
And as far as I know, it hasn't yet been done in humans,

03:21:08.440 --> 03:21:11.280
but it works pretty well in animal models.

03:21:11.280 --> 03:21:12.480
You take any adult cell,

03:21:12.480 --> 03:21:15.200
but skin cells are probably the easiest.

03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:19.960
You induce this skin cell into a stem cell.

03:21:19.960 --> 03:21:21.960
And if you just take a little skin graft,

03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:23.920
we'd have millions of cells.

03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:26.960
So you induce those skin cells into stem cells.

03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:31.680
Then you induce those stem cells into egg precursor cells.

03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:36.080
Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs,

03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:37.280
egg cells.

03:21:37.280 --> 03:21:41.280
Then, because we have this massive overabundance

03:21:41.280 --> 03:21:45.440
of male sperm, then you could fertilize,

03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:49.760
let's call it 10,000 of the mother's eggs.

03:21:49.760 --> 03:21:52.880
So you have 10,000 eggs which are fertilized.

03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:53.880
Sounds like a party.

03:21:53.880 --> 03:21:54.720
Yeah.

03:21:54.720 --> 03:21:58.320
Then you have an automated process

03:21:58.320 --> 03:22:00.760
for what I mentioned before

03:22:00.760 --> 03:22:02.480
in pre-implantation genetic testing.

03:22:02.480 --> 03:22:04.280
You grow them all for five days.

03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:06.240
You extract a few cells from each.

03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:07.280
You test them.

03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:09.200
And I had a piece in the New York Times

03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:10.080
a couple of years ago,

03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:13.080
imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic

03:22:13.080 --> 03:22:14.720
in the year 2050.

03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:15.560
And the choice is not-

03:22:15.560 --> 03:22:16.600
No humans involved.

03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:17.440
Yeah.

03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:19.560
Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not,

03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:22.920
do you want a kid who does or doesn't have,

03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:25.600
let's call it Tay-Sachs.

03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:28.800
It's a whole range of possibilities,

03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:33.560
including very intimate traits

03:22:33.560 --> 03:22:36.040
like height, IQ, personality style.

03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:38.040
It doesn't mean you can predict everything,

03:22:38.040 --> 03:22:41.480
but it means there will be increasing predictability.

03:22:41.480 --> 03:22:45.360
So if you're choosing from 10,000 eggs,

03:22:45.360 --> 03:22:47.720
fertilized eggs, early stage embryos,

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.720
that's a lot of choice.

03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:52.240
And on top of that,

03:22:52.240 --> 03:22:57.240
then we have the new technology of human genome editing.

03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:00.240
Many people have heard of CRISPR,

03:23:00.240 --> 03:23:02.800
but what I say is if you think of human genome editing

03:23:02.800 --> 03:23:06.360
as a pie, sorry, human genome engineering

03:23:06.360 --> 03:23:09.120
as a pie, genome editing is a slice

03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:11.600
and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice.

03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:14.080
It's just one of our tools for genome editing

03:23:14.080 --> 03:23:16.680
and then things are getting better and better.

03:23:16.680 --> 03:23:20.560
Then you can go in and change,

03:23:20.560 --> 03:23:23.240
let's say, I mean, again, it starts simple.

03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:24.880
A small number of genes,

03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:27.920
let's say you've selected from among the one of 10

03:23:27.920 --> 03:23:30.040
or the one of 10,000,

03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:31.400
but there are a number of changes

03:23:31.400 --> 03:23:34.000
that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome.

03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:36.320
And biology is incredibly complex

03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:38.680
and it's not that one gene does one thing,

03:23:38.680 --> 03:23:42.640
one gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously,

03:23:42.640 --> 03:23:45.480
which is why the decision about changing one gene,

03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:47.560
if it's causing deathly harm,

03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:52.080
is easier than when we think about the complexity of biology.

03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:52.920
But then the machine learning

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:54.760
gets better and better at predicting

03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:56.840
the full complexity of biology.

03:23:56.840 --> 03:23:57.680
Exactly.

03:23:57.680 --> 03:23:59.880
As one gets better, then you're editing

03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:03.200
your ability to reliably edit

03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:05.080
such that the conclusions are predictable,

03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:05.920
it gets better and better.

03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:07.440
So those are two are coupled together.

03:24:07.440 --> 03:24:08.280
You got it.

03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:09.120
That's exactly right.

03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:10.480
And then, so that's why,

03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:11.760
and people would say, well, that,

03:24:11.760 --> 03:24:15.720
I mean, I wrote about that in my two science fiction novels,

03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:18.440
Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata, years ago,

03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:21.000
especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that.

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.120
And as a sci-fi,

03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:26.000
and I had actually testified before Congress,

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:27.600
but now 15 years ago saying,

03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:30.720
here's what the future looks like.

03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:35.720
But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin,

03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:39.440
when it was already in production,

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:42.640
and then in November 2018,

03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:47.640
this scientist, Ho-Jiong Kuei, announced in Hong Kong,

03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:51.040
that the world's first two, and later three,

03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:52.480
CRISPR babies had been born,

03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:55.440
which he had genetically altered in a misguided,

03:24:55.440 --> 03:24:58.560
in my view, and dangerous view,

03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:03.560
a dangerous goal of making it so they would have

03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:07.600
increased resistance to HIV.

03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:09.760
And so I called my publisher,

03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:12.320
and I said, I've got good news and bad news.

03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:13.560
I'll start with the bad news,

03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:17.640
is that the world's first CRISPR babies have been born,

03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:21.560
and so we need to pull my book out of production,

03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:23.360
because you can't have a book on the future

03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:25.400
of human genetic engineering,

03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:27.960
and have it not mention the first CRISPR babies

03:25:27.960 --> 03:25:29.240
that had been born.

03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:32.040
But the good news is, in the book,

03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:34.480
I had predicted that it's going to happen,

03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:37.800
and it's going to happen in China, and here's why.

03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:42.240
And all we need to do is add a few more sentences,

03:25:42.240 --> 03:25:43.400
and that was the hardback,

03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:45.280
and then I updated it more in the paperback,

03:25:45.280 --> 03:25:48.800
saying, and it happened, and it was announced on this day.

03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:50.120
Yeah.

03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:53.000
Well then, let's fast forward.

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.360
Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality,

03:25:59.760 --> 03:26:01.840
let's talk about some philosophy and ethics,

03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:05.440
and I suppose, so I can,

03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:08.280
I'm not being too self-deprecating here,

03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:12.680
and saying if my parents had the choice,

03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:18.840
I would be probably less likely to come out the winner.

03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:22.840
We're all weird, and I'm certainly a very,

03:26:22.840 --> 03:26:27.480
distinctly weird specimen of the human species.

03:26:27.480 --> 03:26:30.320
I can give the full long list of flaws,

03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:33.400
I can be very poetic of saying those are features,

03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:36.360
and so on, but they're not.

03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:39.080
If you look at the menu.

03:26:40.240 --> 03:26:42.720
Again, for these women who are listening,

03:26:42.720 --> 03:26:43.840
apropos of your thing,

03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:47.360
they're all kind of charming individualities,

03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:48.200
is how you should call it.

03:26:48.200 --> 03:26:50.320
Yeah, so that's beautiful, that's one, yes, thank you.

03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:53.040
But anyway, but on the full sort of individual,

03:26:53.040 --> 03:26:55.240
let's say IQ alone, right?

03:26:58.000 --> 03:26:59.760
What do we do

03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:03.360
about a world where

03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:10.480
IQ could be selected in a menu when you're having children?

03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:15.680
What concerns you about that world?

03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:17.880
What excites you about that world?

03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:24.720
Are there certain metrics that excite you more than others?

03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:28.400
IQ has been a source of

03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:32.600
I don't know.

03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:37.600
I'm not sure IQ as a measure, flawed as it is,

03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:40.880
has been used to celebrate

03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:43.720
the successes of the human species

03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:47.120
nearly as much as has been used to divide people,

03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:49.560
to say negative things about people,

03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:54.080
to make negative claims about people.

03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:57.040
And in that same way, it seems like

03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:01.480
when there's a selection, a genetic selection based on IQ,

03:28:01.480 --> 03:28:05.160
you can start now having classes of citizenry,

03:28:05.160 --> 03:28:10.160
like further divide, the rich get richer.

03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:12.120
It'll be very rich people,

03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:16.440
they'll be able to do kind of fine selection of IQ

03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:21.440
and then they will start forming these classes

03:28:22.040 --> 03:28:23.840
of super intelligent people.

03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:26.320
And those super intelligent people in their minds

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:27.760
would of course be the right people

03:28:27.760 --> 03:28:30.600
to be making global authoritarian decisions

03:28:30.600 --> 03:28:34.000
about everybody else, all the usual aspects of human nature,

03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:38.320
but now magnified with the new tools of technology.

03:28:38.320 --> 03:28:42.480
Anyway, all that to say is what's exciting to you

03:28:42.480 --> 03:28:44.600
or what's concerning to you?

03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:45.440
It's a great question.

03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:48.920
And just stepping into the IQ,

03:28:48.920 --> 03:28:51.920
we'll call it a quagmire for now,

03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:56.920
it raises a lot of big issues which are complicated.

03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:02.200
Maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's interview

03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:05.000
with Charles Murray, and then that spawned

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:10.000
kind of a whole industry of debate.

03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:13.320
So first, just the background of IQ,

03:29:13.320 --> 03:29:16.400
and it's from the early 20th century,

03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:19.080
and there was the idea that we can measure

03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:21.200
people's general intelligence,

03:29:21.360 --> 03:29:23.680
and there are so many different kinds of intelligence.

03:29:23.680 --> 03:29:25.600
This was measuring a specific thing.

03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:30.400
So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure

03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:33.360
of intelligence, but it's a perfect measure of IQ.

03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:35.400
Like it's measuring what it's measuring,

03:29:35.400 --> 03:29:39.960
but that thing correlates to a lot of things

03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:43.400
which are rewarded in our society.

03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:48.400
So every study of IQ has shown that people with higher IQs,

03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:52.120
they make more money, they live longer,

03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:53.920
they have more stable relationships.

03:29:53.920 --> 03:29:56.600
I mean, that could be something in the testing,

03:29:56.600 --> 03:30:00.560
but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot,

03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:03.840
you could line up all of these kind of IQ

03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:07.120
and IQ-like tests correlate with each other.

03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:09.760
So the people who score high on one score high

03:30:09.760 --> 03:30:12.360
on all of them, and people think that IQ tests

03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:17.480
are like a thing, like the Earl of Dorchester

03:30:17.480 --> 03:30:21.320
is coming for dinner, does he have two forks or three forks

03:30:21.320 --> 03:30:23.280
or something like that, it's not that.

03:30:23.280 --> 03:30:26.520
A lot of them are things that I think a lot of us

03:30:26.520 --> 03:30:29.240
would recognize are relevant, just like how much stuff

03:30:29.240 --> 03:30:32.080
can you memorize if you see some shapes,

03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:36.000
how can you position them and things like that.

03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:38.760
And so IQ, I mean, it really hit its stride

03:30:38.760 --> 03:30:40.760
in certainly in the Second World War

03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:43.600
when our governments were processing a lot of people

03:30:43.600 --> 03:30:47.080
and trying to figure out who to put in what job.

03:30:47.080 --> 03:30:48.840
So that's the starting point.

03:30:48.840 --> 03:30:53.040
Let me start first with the negatives.

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:56.720
That our societies, when we talk about diversity

03:30:56.720 --> 03:31:00.440
in Darwinian terms, it's not like diversity

03:31:00.440 --> 03:31:02.480
is from Darwinian terms, oh, wouldn't it

03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:07.160
be nice if we have some moths of different colors

03:31:07.160 --> 03:31:10.240
because it'll be really fun to have different colored moths.

03:31:10.240 --> 03:31:14.720
Diversity is the sole survival strategy of our species

03:31:14.720 --> 03:31:15.960
and of every species.

03:31:16.600 --> 03:31:20.080
And it's impossible to predict which,

03:31:20.080 --> 03:31:22.920
what diversity is going to be rewarded.

03:31:22.920 --> 03:31:25.400
And I've said this before, if you went down

03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:28.560
and you had, if you spoke T. rex and you spoke

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:31.880
to the dinosaurs and said, hey, you can select your kids,

03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:33.400
what criteria do you want?

03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:37.600
And they'd say, oh yeah, sharp teeth, cruel fangs,

03:31:37.600 --> 03:31:41.240
roar, whatever it is that makes you a great T. rex.

03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:46.280
But the answer from an evolutionary perspective,

03:31:46.280 --> 03:31:48.240
from an Earth perspective was, oh, it's much better

03:31:48.240 --> 03:31:50.800
to be like a cockroach or an alligator

03:31:50.800 --> 03:31:54.680
or some little nothing or a little shrew

03:31:54.680 --> 03:31:57.440
because the dinosaurs are going to get wiped out

03:31:57.440 --> 03:31:58.880
when the asteroid hits.

03:31:58.880 --> 03:32:01.920
And so there's no better or worse in evolution.

03:32:01.920 --> 03:32:05.800
There's just better or worse suited for a given environment.

03:32:05.800 --> 03:32:07.680
And when that environment changes,

03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:11.640
the best suited person from the old system

03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:14.080
could be the worst suited person for the new one.

03:32:14.080 --> 03:32:17.080
So if we start selecting for the things

03:32:17.080 --> 03:32:21.760
that we value the most, including things like IQ,

03:32:21.760 --> 03:32:26.360
but even disease resistance, I mean, this is well known,

03:32:26.360 --> 03:32:29.640
but if you, people who are recessive carrier

03:32:29.640 --> 03:32:33.480
of sickle cell disease have increased resistance

03:32:33.480 --> 03:32:36.600
to malaria, which is the biggest reason why

03:32:36.920 --> 03:32:40.080
that trait hasn't just disappeared,

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:43.880
given how deadly sickle cell disease is,

03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:46.120
biology is incredibly complex.

03:32:46.120 --> 03:32:49.400
We understand such a tiny percentage of it

03:32:49.400 --> 03:32:51.000
that we need to have, in your words,

03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:53.920
just a level of humility.

03:32:53.920 --> 03:32:56.560
There are huge equity issues as you've articulated.

03:32:56.560 --> 03:32:59.760
Let's just say that it is the case that in our society,

03:32:59.760 --> 03:33:04.760
IQ and IQ-like traits are highly rewarded.

03:33:05.120 --> 03:33:08.160
There is an equity issue, but it works in both ways.

03:33:08.160 --> 03:33:11.120
Because my guess is, let's just say that we had a society

03:33:11.120 --> 03:33:13.400
where we were doing genome sequencing

03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:15.360
of everybody who was born,

03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:18.760
and we had some predictive model to predict IQ,

03:33:18.760 --> 03:33:22.360
and we had decided as a society that IQ

03:33:22.360 --> 03:33:24.320
was going to be what we were going to select for.

03:33:24.320 --> 03:33:26.240
We were gonna put the highest IQ people

03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:28.640
in these different roles.

03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:31.520
I guarantee you the people in those roles

03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:34.880
would not be the people who are legacy admissions

03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:36.040
to Harvard.

03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:40.840
They would very likely be people who are born in slums,

03:33:40.840 --> 03:33:42.760
people who are born with no opportunity

03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:46.560
or in refugee camps who are just wasting away

03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:49.920
because we've thrown them away.

03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:52.640
And so it's an easy,

03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:56.440
like it's the idea of just being able to look

03:33:56.440 --> 03:34:00.320
under the hood of our humanity is really scary

03:34:00.320 --> 03:34:02.960
for everybody, and it should be.

03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:06.160
I mean, I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew.

03:34:06.160 --> 03:34:08.080
My father was born in Austria.

03:34:08.080 --> 03:34:11.160
My father and grandparents came here as refugees

03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:12.560
after the war.

03:34:12.560 --> 03:34:14.880
Most of that side of the family was killed.

03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:19.320
So I get what it means to be on the other,

03:34:19.320 --> 03:34:20.560
I mean, you said you're reading Mein Kampf,

03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:22.240
on the other side of the story,

03:34:22.240 --> 03:34:24.680
when someone said, well, here's what's good,

03:34:24.680 --> 03:34:26.000
and you're not good.

03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:29.840
And therefore you're, so I totally get that.

03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:31.160
Having said that,

03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:35.800
I do believe that we're moving toward

03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:38.400
a new way of procreating.

03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:41.400
And we're going to have to decide what are the values

03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:45.160
that we would like to realize through that process.

03:34:45.160 --> 03:34:48.280
Is it randomness, which is what we currently have now,

03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:50.960
which is not totally random because we have a sort of

03:34:50.960 --> 03:34:54.160
mating through colleges and other things.

03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:54.980
But if it's-

03:34:54.980 --> 03:34:55.820
We're mating through what?

03:34:55.820 --> 03:34:56.640
Colleges?

03:34:56.720 --> 03:35:01.320
If you go to Harvard or wherever,

03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:04.160
and your wife also goes to Harvard, it's like-

03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:07.880
So it's location-based mating.

03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:09.800
Well, it's not location, it's selection.

03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:11.760
It's like there are selections that are made

03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:14.400
about who gets to a certain place.

03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:17.360
And it's like Harvard admissions is a filter.

03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:19.600
So we're going to have to decide what are the values

03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:21.400
that we want to realize through this process,

03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:24.880
because diversity, it's just baked into our biology.

03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:28.360
We're the first species ever that has the opportunity

03:35:28.360 --> 03:35:32.360
to make choices about things that were otherwise baked

03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:33.720
into our biology.

03:35:33.720 --> 03:35:37.520
And there's a real danger that if we make bad choices,

03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:39.560
even with good intentions,

03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:42.440
it could even drive us toward extinction

03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:45.120
and certainly undermine our humanity.

03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:47.200
And that's why I always say, and like I said,

03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:50.160
I'm deeply involved with WHO and other things,

03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:53.040
that these aren't conversations about science.

03:35:54.040 --> 03:35:56.160
Science brings us to the conversation,

03:35:56.160 --> 03:35:58.280
but the conversation is about values and ethics.

03:35:58.280 --> 03:36:00.480
As you described, that world is wide open.

03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:04.920
It's not even a subtly different world.

03:36:04.920 --> 03:36:06.640
That world is fundamentally different

03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:09.720
from anything we understand about life on earth,

03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:14.720
because natural selection, this random process,

03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:17.800
is so fundamental how we think about life.

03:36:18.920 --> 03:36:21.800
Being able to program, I mean, it has a chance

03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:25.840
to, I mean, it'll probably make my question

03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:29.880
about the ethical concerns around IQ-based selection

03:36:31.320 --> 03:36:35.040
just meaningless, because it'll change

03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:36.760
the nature of identity.

03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:40.880
Like it's possible it will dissolve identity,

03:36:41.800 --> 03:36:44.840
because we take so much pride

03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:46.480
in all the different characteristics

03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:47.760
that make us who we are.

03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:50.200
Whenever you have some control

03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:52.000
over those characteristics,

03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.200
those characteristics start losing meaning.

03:36:55.240 --> 03:36:57.760
And what may start gaining meaning

03:36:57.760 --> 03:37:00.640
is the ideas inside our heads, for example,

03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:05.640
versus like the details of like,

03:37:05.800 --> 03:37:07.760
is it a Commodore 64?

03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:09.480
Is it a PC?

03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:10.720
Is it a Mac?

03:37:10.720 --> 03:37:12.000
It's gonna be less important

03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:14.320
than the software that runs on it.

03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:16.080
So we can more and more be operating

03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:17.840
in the digital space and the identity

03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:20.360
could be something that borrows multiple bodies.

03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:24.760
Like the legacy of our ideas may become more important

03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:28.480
than the details of our physical embodiment.

03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:30.440
Like it, I mean, I'm saying perhaps

03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:33.720
ridiculous sounding things, but the point is

03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:38.040
it will bring up so many new ethical concerns

03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:39.880
that our narrow-minded thinking

03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:43.720
about the current ethical concerns will not apply.

03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:46.200
So it's, but it's important to think about

03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:49.160
all this kind of stuff, like actively.

03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:51.560
What are the right conversations to be having now?

03:37:51.560 --> 03:37:56.200
Cause it feels like it's an ongoing conversation

03:37:56.200 --> 03:37:59.680
that then continually evolves, like with an NIH involved.

03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:03.400
Like, do you do experiments with animals?

03:38:03.400 --> 03:38:06.200
Do you build these brain organoids?

03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:07.600
Do you still, like through that process

03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:09.120
you described with the stem cells,

03:38:09.120 --> 03:38:11.760
like do you experiment with a bunch of organisms

03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:16.040
to see how genetic material,

03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:18.080
what form that actually takes,

03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:19.480
how to minimize the chance of cancer

03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:20.480
and all those kinds of things.

03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:22.640
What are the negative consequences of that?

03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:24.840
What are the positive consequences?

03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:26.920
Yeah, it's a fascinating world.

03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:28.240
It's a really fascinating world.

03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:29.720
Yeah, and then, but those conversations

03:38:29.720 --> 03:38:32.200
are just so essential.

03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:34.280
Like we have to be talking about ethics

03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:37.400
and then that raises the question of who is the we?

03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:39.800
And coming back to your conversation

03:38:39.800 --> 03:38:41.960
about science communication,

03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:44.160
maybe there was a time earlier

03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:47.440
when these conversations were held

03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:49.360
among a small number of experts

03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:53.160
who made decisions on behalf of everybody else.

03:38:53.160 --> 03:38:54.800
But what we're talking about here

03:38:54.800 --> 03:38:57.080
is really the future of our species.

03:38:57.080 --> 03:39:01.160
And I think that conversation is too important

03:39:01.160 --> 03:39:04.960
to be left just to experts and government officials.

03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:06.880
So I mentioned that I'm a member.

03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:09.040
We just ended our work after two years

03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:11.560
of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee

03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:13.200
on Human Genome Editing.

03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:16.440
And my big push in that process

03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:19.720
was to have education, engagement,

03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:22.200
and empowerment of the broad public,

03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:25.920
to bring, not just bring people into the conversation

03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:29.280
with the tools to be able to engage,

03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:31.920
but also into the decision-making process.

03:39:31.920 --> 03:39:33.720
And that's, it's a real shift.

03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:37.160
And there are countries that are doing it better than others.

03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:39.640
Denmark is obviously a much smaller country

03:39:39.640 --> 03:39:40.880
than the United States,

03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:44.360
but they have a really well-developed infrastructure

03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:46.400
for public engagement

03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:49.080
around really complicated scientific issues.

03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:51.000
And I just think that we have to,

03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.440
like it's great that we have Twitter

03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:55.160
and all these other things,

03:39:55.160 --> 03:39:58.440
but we need structured conversations

03:39:58.440 --> 03:40:00.520
where we can really bring people together

03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:02.360
and listen to each other,

03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:05.240
which feels like it's harder than ever.

03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:08.200
But even now in this process

03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:11.160
where all these people are shouting at each other,

03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:12.640
at least there are a bunch of people

03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:14.360
who are in the conversation.

03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:16.360
So it's, we have a foundation,

03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:20.240
but we just really need to do more work.

03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:21.600
And again, and again, and again,

03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:26.600
it's about ethics and values because we're at an age,

03:40:27.040 --> 03:40:28.600
and this has become a cliche

03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:31.200
of exponential technological change.

03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:35.480
And so the rate of change is faster going forward

03:40:35.480 --> 03:40:36.680
than it has been in the past.

03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:39.000
So in our minds, we under-appreciate

03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:43.520
how quickly things are changing and will change.

03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:44.640
And if we're not careful,

03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:48.680
if we don't know who we are and what our values are,

03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:49.800
we're going to get lost.

03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:52.240
And we don't have to know technology.

03:40:52.240 --> 03:40:53.760
We have to know who we are.

03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:58.760
I mean, our values are hard won over thousands of years.

03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:01.080
No matter how new the technology is,

03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:04.480
we shouldn't and can't jettison our values

03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:07.600
because that is our primary navigational tool.

03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:12.240
Absurd question, because we were saying

03:41:12.240 --> 03:41:16.400
that sexual reproduction is not the best way

03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:17.840
to define the offspring.

03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:21.480
You think there'll be a day when humans stop having sex?

03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:23.280
I don't think we'll stop having sex

03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:25.520
because it's so enjoyable,

03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:30.920
but we may significantly stop having sex for reproduction,

03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:35.120
even today, most human sex is not for making babies.

03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:37.920
It's for other things, whether it's pleasure or love

03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:40.840
or pair bonding or whatever.

03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:41.680
Intimacy.

03:41:41.680 --> 03:41:42.520
Intimacy.

03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:44.520
I mean, some people do it for intimacy.

03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:47.040
Some people do it for pleasure with strangers.

03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:48.920
I feel like the people that do it for pleasure,

03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:50.960
I feel like there will be better ways

03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:54.680
to achieve that same chemical pleasure, right?

03:41:54.680 --> 03:41:57.600
You know, there's just so many different kinds of people.

03:41:57.600 --> 03:42:00.080
I just saw this on television,

03:42:00.080 --> 03:42:02.680
but there are people who put on those big bunny outfits

03:42:02.680 --> 03:42:04.400
and go and have sex with other people.

03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:06.720
I mean, there's just like an unlimited number

03:42:06.720 --> 03:42:08.040
of different kinds of people.

03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:11.040
I think they're called, so I remember hearing about this,

03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:14.160
I think Dan Savage is a podcast.

03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:17.640
I think they're called furries.

03:42:17.640 --> 03:42:18.480
Furries.

03:42:18.480 --> 03:42:19.600
Like furry parties.

03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:21.720
Yeah, exactly, so they're just-

03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:22.840
I love people.

03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:25.280
Yeah, well, you know, that's like the thing.

03:42:25.280 --> 03:42:26.560
It's like, whenever you hear these words,

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:30.120
it's like, humans, what will they think of next?

03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:33.000
But I do think that, and I write about this

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:38.000
in Hacking Darwin, that as people come to believe

03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:43.840
that making children through the application of science

03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:46.120
is safer and more beneficial

03:42:46.120 --> 03:42:48.800
than having children through sex,

03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:52.160
we'll start to see a shift over time

03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:54.440
toward reproduction through science.

03:42:54.440 --> 03:42:58.800
We'll still have sex for all the same great reasons

03:42:58.800 --> 03:43:00.440
that we do it now.

03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:02.320
It's just reproduction less and less

03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:03.480
through the act of sex.

03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:07.080
Man, it's such a fascinating future.

03:43:08.400 --> 03:43:11.200
Because as somebody, I value flaws.

03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:17.200
I think it's the goodwill hunting.

03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:18.600
That's the good stuff.

03:43:18.600 --> 03:43:21.960
The flaws, the weird quirks of humans,

03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:23.800
that's what makes us who we are.

03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:25.400
The weird.

03:43:25.400 --> 03:43:26.720
The weird is the beautiful.

03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:31.720
And there's a fear of optimization that I-

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:33.840
You should have it.

03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:35.480
I mean, it's very healthy.

03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:39.920
And I think that's the danger of all of this selection

03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:44.360
is that we make selections just based on social norms

03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:47.480
that are so deeply internal

03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:51.160
that they feel like they're eternal truths.

03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:54.720
And so we talked about selecting for IQ.

03:43:54.720 --> 03:43:56.760
What about selecting for a kind heart?

03:43:56.760 --> 03:43:57.600
Like there are lots of you.

03:43:57.600 --> 03:43:59.480
You talked about Hitler and Mein Kampf.

03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:03.040
Hitler certainly had a high IQ,

03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:05.080
I guess is higher than average IQ.

03:44:06.120 --> 03:44:08.240
If we just select,

03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:11.040
that's why I was saying before,

03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:13.480
diversity is baked into our biology.

03:44:13.480 --> 03:44:16.120
But the key lesson, and I've said this many times before,

03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:19.000
the key lesson of this moment in our history

03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.720
is that after nearly four billion years of evolution,

03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:26.320
our one species suddenly has the unique

03:44:26.320 --> 03:44:28.080
and increasing ability to read, write,

03:44:28.080 --> 03:44:30.240
and hack the code of life.

03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:34.120
And so as we apply these godlike powers

03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:37.920
that we've now assumed for ourselves,

03:44:37.920 --> 03:44:39.840
we better be pretty careful

03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:44.120
because it's so easy to make mistakes,

03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:47.080
particularly mistakes that are guided

03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:48.440
by our best intentions.

03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:52.200
To jump briefly back onto Lab Lake,

03:44:52.200 --> 03:44:54.160
and I swear there's a reason for that.

03:44:55.680 --> 03:44:58.240
What did you think about the John Stewart,

03:44:59.240 --> 03:45:00.880
this moment, I forget when it was,

03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:02.480
maybe a few months ago,

03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:05.240
in the summer, I think, of 2021,

03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:07.920
where he went on Colbert Report,

03:45:07.920 --> 03:45:09.360
or not the Colbert Report, sorry,

03:45:09.360 --> 03:45:13.360
the Stephen Colbert's, whatever his show is.

03:45:13.360 --> 03:45:15.720
But again, John Stewart reminded us

03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:18.880
how valuable his wit and brilliance

03:45:18.880 --> 03:45:22.240
within the humor was for our culture.

03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:24.520
And so he did this whole bit

03:45:24.520 --> 03:45:27.480
that highlighted the commonsense nature

03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:30.040
about what was the metaphor he used

03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:33.160
about the Hershey factory in Pennsylvania.

03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:34.880
So what'd you think about that whole bit?

03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:36.600
I loved it.

03:45:36.600 --> 03:45:41.000
And so not to be overly self-referential,

03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.240
but it's hard not to be overly self-referential

03:45:43.240 --> 03:45:44.360
when you're doing a whatever,

03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:47.600
however long we are, five-hour interview about yourself.

03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:50.640
Which reminds me, when you had Bret Weinstein on,

03:45:50.640 --> 03:45:52.560
he said, I have no ego,

03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:55.080
but these 57 people have screwed me over,

03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:56.800
and I deserve credit.

03:45:56.800 --> 03:45:58.600
It's hard, it's hard to talk about.

03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:02.880
I am a person I will confess it's enjoyable.

03:46:02.880 --> 03:46:03.720
Some people feel different.

03:46:03.720 --> 03:46:06.320
I kind of like talking about all this stuff,

03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:08.080
and talking, period.

03:46:09.120 --> 03:46:10.680
So for me, in the earliest,

03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:13.920
I remember those early days when the pandemic started,

03:46:14.440 --> 03:46:15.280
and I was just sitting down.

03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:17.320
It was late January, early February, 2020,

03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:20.240
and I just was laying out all of the evidence

03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:22.520
just that I could collect,

03:46:22.520 --> 03:46:26.440
trying to say, make sense of where does this come from?

03:46:26.440 --> 03:46:29.080
And it was just logic.

03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:33.120
I mean, it was all of the things that Jon Stewart said,

03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:36.400
which in some overly wordy form

03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:38.640
were all at that time on my website.

03:46:38.640 --> 03:46:42.840
Like, what are the odds of having this outbreak

03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:45.920
of a bat coronavirus more than 1,000 miles away

03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:49.160
from where these bats have their natural habitat,

03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:52.520
where they have the largest collection

03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:55.120
of these bat coronaviruses in the world,

03:46:55.120 --> 03:46:57.280
and they're doing all these very aggressive

03:46:58.520 --> 03:47:02.120
research projects to make them more aggressive,

03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:04.320
and then you have the outbreak of a virus

03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:07.920
that's primed for human-to-human transmission?

03:47:09.600 --> 03:47:12.560
It was just logic was my first step,

03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:17.520
and I kept gathering the information.

03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:20.080
But Jon Stewart distilled that

03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:23.320
in a way that just everybody got,

03:47:23.320 --> 03:47:26.320
and I think that I loved it,

03:47:26.320 --> 03:47:29.040
and I just think that there's a way of reaching people.

03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:31.520
It's the reason why I write science fiction

03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:34.240
in addition to thinking and writing about the science

03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:37.680
is that we kind of have to reach people where they are,

03:47:37.680 --> 03:47:40.360
and I just thought it was just,

03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:42.760
there was a lot of depth, I thought,

03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:46.680
and maybe that's too self-serving,

03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:48.840
but like in the analysis,

03:47:48.840 --> 03:47:53.840
but he captured that into those things about,

03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:59.040
it's like the, whatever, the outbreak of chewy goodness

03:47:59.040 --> 03:48:00.520
near the Hershey factory.

03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:02.000
I wonder where that came from.

03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:05.280
Yeah, there's the humor, there's metaphor,

03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:08.040
also the like sticking with the joke

03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:09.360
and the audience is,

03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:14.040
the audience is Stephen Colbert.

03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:16.400
He was like resisting it.

03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:17.880
He was very uncomfortable with it.

03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:20.280
Maybe that was part of the bit, I'm not sure,

03:48:20.280 --> 03:48:22.040
but it didn't look like it.

03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:23.480
So Stephen, in that moment,

03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:24.960
kind of represented the discomfort

03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:26.840
of the scientific community, I think.

03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:28.920
It's kind of interesting, that whole dynamic,

03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:31.560
and I think that was a pivotal moment.

03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:35.840
That just highlights the value of comedy,

03:48:35.880 --> 03:48:40.160
the value of, like when Joe Rogan says,

03:48:40.160 --> 03:48:41.600
I'm just a comedian,

03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:46.280
I mean, that's such a funny thing to say.

03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:48.120
It's like saying, I'm just a podcaster,

03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:51.800
or I'm just a writer, I'm just a, you know.

03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:55.960
That ability in so few words

03:48:55.960 --> 03:48:59.240
to express what everybody else is thinking,

03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:02.520
it's so refreshing,

03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:04.720
and I wish the scientific communicators

03:49:04.800 --> 03:49:06.320
would do that, too.

03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:08.280
A little humor, a little humor.

03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:10.520
I mean, that's why I love Elon Musk very much,

03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:13.320
so the way he communicates is like,

03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:18.960
it's so refreshing for a CEO of a major company,

03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:20.560
several major companies,

03:49:20.560 --> 03:49:22.520
to just have a sense of humor

03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:24.840
and say ridiculous shit every once in a while.

03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:27.240
That's so, there's something to that.

03:49:27.240 --> 03:49:29.560
It shakes up the whole conversation

03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:33.760
to where it gives you freedom to think publicly.

03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:36.960
If you're always trying to say the proper thing,

03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:38.800
you lose the freedom to think,

03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:42.760
to reason out, to be authentic and genuine.

03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:44.960
When you allow yourself the freedom

03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:48.040
to regularly say stupid shit,

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:51.720
have fun, make fun of yourself,

03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:53.160
I think you give yourself freedom

03:49:53.160 --> 03:49:54.760
to really be a great scientist.

03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:58.720
Honestly, I think scientists have a lot

03:49:58.720 --> 03:50:00.120
to learn from comedians.

03:50:00.280 --> 03:50:01.840
For sure, I think we all do,

03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:05.320
about just distilling and communicating

03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:07.440
in ways that people can hear.

03:50:07.440 --> 03:50:10.400
A lot of us say things and people just can't hear them,

03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:12.040
either because of the way we're saying them

03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:14.400
or where they are, but,

03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:16.560
and like I said before,

03:50:16.560 --> 03:50:19.320
I'm a big fan of Joe Rogan.

03:50:19.320 --> 03:50:20.840
I've been on his show twice,

03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:22.880
and whatever Francis Collins was,

03:50:22.880 --> 03:50:26.920
in his conversation with you, he said,

03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:27.800
which I think makes sense,

03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:31.000
is that when somebody has that kind of platform,

03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.120
and people, rightly or wrongly,

03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:36.960
who follow them and look to them for guidance,

03:50:36.960 --> 03:50:40.760
I do think that there is some responsibility

03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:42.840
for people in those roles

03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:46.240
to make whatever judgment that they make

03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:48.880
and to share that, and as I mentioned to you

03:50:48.880 --> 03:50:50.640
when we were off mic,

03:50:50.640 --> 03:50:53.200
Sanjay Gupta is a very close friend of mine.

03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:54.840
We've been friends for many years,

03:50:54.840 --> 03:50:58.400
and I fully supported Sanjay's instinct

03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:02.160
to go on the Joe Rogan show.

03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:05.200
I thought it was, yeah, it was great.

03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:08.040
At the end of that whole conversation,

03:51:08.040 --> 03:51:12.240
Joe said, well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?

03:51:12.240 --> 03:51:16.440
And I just felt that, yes, Joe Rogan is a comedian.

03:51:16.440 --> 03:51:20.440
I wouldn't say just a comedian, among other things,

03:51:20.440 --> 03:51:23.720
but I also felt that he had a responsibility

03:51:23.760 --> 03:51:25.320
for just saying whatever he believed,

03:51:25.320 --> 03:51:30.040
even if he believed, or believes, as I think is the case,

03:51:30.040 --> 03:51:32.960
that ivermectin should be studied more,

03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:34.880
which I certainly agree,

03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:40.840
and that healthy people shouldn't get vaccinated,

03:51:40.840 --> 03:51:43.360
healthy young people, which I don't agree.

03:51:43.360 --> 03:51:45.640
I just felt at the end of that conversation to say,

03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:48.280
well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?

03:51:48.280 --> 03:51:52.680
I feel like it didn't fully integrate the power

03:51:52.680 --> 03:51:55.920
that a person like Joe Rogan has to set the agenda.

03:51:55.920 --> 03:51:59.000
So I think the reason he says I'm just a comedian

03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:01.200
is the same reason I say I'm an idiot,

03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:02.800
which I truly believe.

03:52:02.800 --> 03:52:04.520
I can explain exactly what I mean by that,

03:52:04.520 --> 03:52:09.520
but it's more for him, or in this case, for me,

03:52:10.320 --> 03:52:12.640
to just keep yourself humble,

03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:15.360
because I think it's a slippery slope

03:52:15.360 --> 03:52:17.040
when you think you have a responsibility

03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:20.320
to then think you actually have an authority,

03:52:21.280 --> 03:52:23.360
because a lot of people listen to you,

03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:24.640
you think you have an authority

03:52:24.640 --> 03:52:27.240
to actually speak to those people,

03:52:27.240 --> 03:52:28.480
and you have enough authority

03:52:28.480 --> 03:52:30.520
to know what the hell you're talking about.

03:52:30.520 --> 03:52:32.480
And I think there's just the humility

03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:34.640
to just kind of make it fun of yourself

03:52:34.640 --> 03:52:36.320
that's extremely valuable,

03:52:36.320 --> 03:52:38.080
and saying I'm just a comedian,

03:52:39.640 --> 03:52:42.360
I think is a reminder to himself that

03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:48.520
he's often full of shit, so are all of us.

03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:51.760
And so that's a really powerful way for himself

03:52:51.760 --> 03:52:53.040
to keep himself humble.

03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:56.160
I mean, I think that's really useful

03:52:56.160 --> 03:52:58.440
in some kind of way for people in general

03:52:58.440 --> 03:53:01.320
to make fun of themselves a little bit,

03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:02.680
or whatever way that means,

03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:05.520
and saying I'm just a comedian is just one way to do that.

03:53:05.520 --> 03:53:07.940
Now, that coupled that with the responsibility

03:53:07.940 --> 03:53:11.520
of doing the research and really having an open mind

03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:12.920
and all those kinds of stuff,

03:53:13.960 --> 03:53:15.880
I think that's something Joe does really well

03:53:15.880 --> 03:53:17.360
on a lot of topics,

03:53:17.400 --> 03:53:18.840
but he can't do that in everything.

03:53:18.840 --> 03:53:22.760
And so it's up to the people to decide

03:53:22.760 --> 03:53:26.920
how well he does it on certain topics and not others.

03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:29.640
But how do you think Sanjay did in that conversation?

03:53:29.640 --> 03:53:32.480
So I know I'm gonna get myself into trouble here,

03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:35.720
because Sanjay's a very close friend.

03:53:35.720 --> 03:53:38.560
Joe, my personal interaction with him

03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:40.000
has been our two interviews,

03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:41.480
but it's like my interview with now,

03:53:41.480 --> 03:53:43.600
sit down with somebody for four hours,

03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:46.280
it's a lot and great,

03:53:46.680 --> 03:53:49.240
and then private communication.

03:53:49.240 --> 03:53:54.240
So I am personally more sympathetic to the arguments

03:53:54.360 --> 03:53:58.560
that Sanjay was making or trying to make.

03:53:58.560 --> 03:54:01.400
I believe that the threat of the virus

03:54:01.400 --> 03:54:04.320
is greater than the threat of the vaccine.

03:54:04.320 --> 03:54:08.960
That doesn't mean that we can guarantee 100% safety

03:54:08.960 --> 03:54:09.920
for the vaccine,

03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:13.760
but these are really well tolerated vaccines.

03:54:13.760 --> 03:54:15.720
And we know for all the reasons we've been talking about

03:54:15.720 --> 03:54:18.520
that this is a really scary virus,

03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:20.960
and particularly the mRNA vaccines,

03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:23.440
what they're basically doing is getting your body

03:54:23.440 --> 03:54:26.200
to replicate a tiny little piece of the virus,

03:54:26.200 --> 03:54:30.040
the spike protein, and then your body responds to that.

03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:34.960
And so that's a much less of an insult to your body

03:54:34.960 --> 03:54:37.400
than being infected by the virus.

03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:41.440
So I'm more sympathetic to the people who say,

03:54:41.440 --> 03:54:45.120
well, everybody should get vaccinated,

03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:48.040
but people who've already been infected,

03:54:48.040 --> 03:54:52.920
we should study whether they need to be vaccinated or not.

03:54:52.920 --> 03:54:54.960
Having said all of that,

03:54:54.960 --> 03:54:59.960
I felt that Joe Rogan won the debate.

03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:03.720
And the reason that I felt that he won the debate

03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:08.560
was they had two different categories of arguments.

03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:11.840
So Sanjay, what he was trying to do,

03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:13.120
which I totally respect,

03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:14.920
was saying there's so much animosity,

03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:17.960
on these different sides, let's lower the temperature.

03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:22.880
Let's model that we can have a respectful dialogue

03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:24.960
with each other where we can actually listen.

03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:27.440
And Sanjay, again, I've known him for many years.

03:55:27.440 --> 03:55:30.720
He's a very empathic, humble,

03:55:30.720 --> 03:55:34.000
just a all around wonderful human being,

03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:36.080
and I really love him.

03:55:36.080 --> 03:55:39.080
And so he was making cases that were based on kind of

03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:41.480
averages, studies, and things like that.

03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:43.800
And Joe was saying, well,

03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:48.400
I know a guy whose sister's cousin had this experience.

03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:50.760
And I'm sure that it's all true,

03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:53.040
in the sense that we have millions of people

03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:56.560
who are getting vaccinated and different things.

03:55:56.560 --> 03:55:59.440
And what Sanjay should have said was,

03:55:59.440 --> 03:56:01.720
I know that's an anecdote.

03:56:01.720 --> 03:56:03.400
Here's another anecdote of,

03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:05.400
like when Francis Collins was with you,

03:56:05.400 --> 03:56:08.160
and he talked about the world wrestling guy

03:56:08.160 --> 03:56:10.640
who was like 6'6 and a big muscly guy,

03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:13.160
and then he got COVID, and he was anti-vaxxer,

03:56:13.160 --> 03:56:14.800
and then he got COVID and almost died,

03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:15.640
and he said, I'm gonna-

03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:17.960
By the way, I don't know if you know this part.

03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:18.800
No.

03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:19.620
Oh, this is funny.

03:56:19.620 --> 03:56:20.720
Joe's gonna listen to this.

03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:22.040
He's gonna be laughing.

03:56:22.040 --> 03:56:24.680
Does Joe listen to the four hours of this

03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:28.360
in addition to the three hours of his interviews every day?

03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:30.840
No, not every day, but he listens to a lot of these.

03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:31.660
I love it.

03:56:31.660 --> 03:56:33.120
And we talk about it, we argue about it.

03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:33.960
Hi, Joe.

03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:35.520
Hey, Joe.

03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:36.640
We love you, Joe.

03:56:37.600 --> 03:56:40.280
So that particular case,

03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:43.280
I don't know why Francis said what he said there,

03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:45.160
but that's not accurate.

03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:46.000
Oh, really?

03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:50.840
So the wrestler never, he didn't almost die.

03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:54.540
He was no big deal at all for him, and he said that to him.

03:56:54.540 --> 03:56:56.920
I think, I'm not sure,

03:56:56.920 --> 03:57:00.240
I think something got mixed up in Francis' memory.

03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:02.400
There was another case, he must've been like,

03:57:02.400 --> 03:57:05.400
because I don't imagine he would bring that case up

03:57:05.400 --> 03:57:09.440
and just like make it up, you know, because of like why,

03:57:09.480 --> 03:57:11.600
but he, that was not at all,

03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:13.200
like that was a pretty public case.

03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:15.400
He had an interview with him.

03:57:15.400 --> 03:57:17.520
That wrestler, he was just fine.

03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:19.480
So that anecdotal case,

03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:21.080
I mean, Francis should not have done that.

03:57:21.080 --> 03:57:24.360
So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism

03:57:24.360 --> 03:57:26.240
of how that went.

03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:28.720
People who criticize that interview,

03:57:28.720 --> 03:57:32.360
I feel like don't give enough respect

03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:33.880
to the full range of things

03:57:33.880 --> 03:57:35.800
that Francis Collins has done in his career.

03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:37.480
He's an incredible scientist.

03:57:37.480 --> 03:57:40.160
And I also think a really good human being.

03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:44.680
But yes, that conversation was flawed in many ways.

03:57:44.680 --> 03:57:47.880
And one of them was why,

03:57:47.880 --> 03:57:52.060
when you're trying to present some kind of critical,

03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:56.520
like criticize Joe Rogan,

03:57:56.520 --> 03:57:58.760
why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?

03:57:58.760 --> 03:58:01.240
And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence,

03:58:02.080 --> 03:58:03.320
which is not scientific,

03:58:03.320 --> 03:58:04.160
if you're a scientist,

03:58:04.160 --> 03:58:06.200
you should not be using anecdotal evidence.

03:58:06.200 --> 03:58:08.000
If you do bring it up,

03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:12.400
why bring up one that's first not true

03:58:12.400 --> 03:58:13.760
and you know it's not true?

03:58:15.400 --> 03:58:18.560
So I know, pretend, so you don't know it's not true.

03:58:18.560 --> 03:58:23.200
So yes, that would be, find another case where, exactly.

03:58:23.200 --> 03:58:25.840
So the basic thing, coming back to Sanjay

03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:28.080
and Joe's conversation,

03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:31.640
was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence

03:58:31.640 --> 03:58:33.600
and Joe was using anecdotal evidence.

03:58:33.600 --> 03:58:36.040
And so I think that for Sanjay,

03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:39.960
and there are all kinds of things where there are debates,

03:58:39.960 --> 03:58:43.360
where often the person who's better at debating

03:58:43.360 --> 03:58:47.440
wins the debate regardless of the topic.

03:58:47.440 --> 03:58:50.080
So I think what Sanjay could have done,

03:58:50.080 --> 03:58:53.480
and Sanjay's such a smart guy,

03:58:53.480 --> 03:58:56.440
is to say, well, that's an anecdote,

03:58:56.440 --> 03:58:58.040
here's another anecdote,

03:58:58.040 --> 03:59:00.560
and there are lots of different anecdotes.

03:59:00.560 --> 03:59:04.160
And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine

03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:08.240
problems that could reasonably be traced to the vaccines.

03:59:08.240 --> 03:59:10.600
And there are certainly are lots of people,

03:59:10.600 --> 03:59:14.120
I would argue more people who've not had the vaccine,

03:59:14.120 --> 03:59:16.360
but who've gotten COVID and have either died

03:59:16.360 --> 03:59:19.160
or our hospitals are now full of people

03:59:19.160 --> 03:59:20.400
who weren't vaccinated.

03:59:20.400 --> 03:59:23.000
And in many ways, our emergency rooms

03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:26.160
are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States.

03:59:26.160 --> 03:59:28.680
So I think what Sanjay could have done,

03:59:28.680 --> 03:59:32.880
but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of

03:59:33.280 --> 03:59:36.840
win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down.

03:59:36.840 --> 03:59:39.480
And what he could have done is to say,

03:59:39.480 --> 03:59:42.280
well, here's an anecdote, I have a counter anecdote,

03:59:42.280 --> 03:59:43.680
and we can go on all day,

03:59:43.680 --> 03:59:46.320
but here's what the statistics show.

03:59:46.320 --> 03:59:48.480
And I think that was the thing.

03:59:48.480 --> 03:59:50.360
So I think it's a healthy conversation.

03:59:50.360 --> 03:59:52.640
We can't, I mean, there are a lot of people

03:59:52.640 --> 03:59:55.240
who are afraid of the vaccine.

03:59:55.240 --> 03:59:56.680
There are a lot of people who don't trust

03:59:56.680 --> 03:59:58.280
the scientific establishment,

03:59:58.280 --> 04:00:00.000
and lots of them have good reason.

04:00:00.040 --> 04:00:04.480
It's not just people think of like Trump Republicans,

04:00:04.480 --> 04:00:08.560
there are lots of people in the African-American community

04:00:08.560 --> 04:00:11.880
who've had a historical terrible experience

04:00:11.880 --> 04:00:14.360
with the Tuskegee and all sorts of things.

04:00:14.360 --> 04:00:18.080
So they don't trust the messages that were being delivered.

04:00:18.080 --> 04:00:20.200
I live in New York City,

04:00:20.200 --> 04:00:22.120
and we had a piece in the New York Times

04:00:22.120 --> 04:00:24.680
where in the earliest days of the vaccines,

04:00:24.680 --> 04:00:25.880
there was this big movement,

04:00:25.880 --> 04:00:28.920
let's make sure that the poorest people in the city

04:00:28.920 --> 04:00:31.840
have first access to the vaccines

04:00:31.840 --> 04:00:33.600
because they're the ones,

04:00:33.600 --> 04:00:36.160
they have higher density in their homes,

04:00:36.160 --> 04:00:37.840
they're relying on public transport.

04:00:37.840 --> 04:00:39.320
So there was this whole liberal effort.

04:00:39.320 --> 04:00:42.360
And then in the black community in New York,

04:00:42.360 --> 04:00:43.440
according to the New York Times,

04:00:43.440 --> 04:00:46.240
there was very low acceptance of the vaccines,

04:00:46.240 --> 04:00:47.960
and they interviewed people in that article,

04:00:47.960 --> 04:00:50.800
and they said, well, if the white people

04:00:50.800 --> 04:00:52.760
want us to have it first,

04:00:52.760 --> 04:00:54.560
there must be something wrong with it.

04:00:54.560 --> 04:00:56.640
They must be doing some,

04:00:56.720 --> 04:00:59.800
and so we have to listen to each other.

04:00:59.800 --> 04:01:01.160
Like I would never,

04:01:02.560 --> 04:01:04.720
I have a disrespect for everybody.

04:01:04.720 --> 04:01:07.880
And if somebody is cautious about the vaccine

04:01:07.880 --> 04:01:10.280
for themselves or for their children,

04:01:10.280 --> 04:01:12.280
we have to listen to them.

04:01:12.280 --> 04:01:13.360
At the same time,

04:01:14.880 --> 04:01:19.120
public health is about creating public health.

04:01:19.120 --> 04:01:23.120
And there's no doubt, I think Joe was absolutely right,

04:01:23.120 --> 04:01:28.120
that older people, obese people are at greater risk

04:01:28.200 --> 04:01:32.800
for being harmed or killed by COVID-19

04:01:32.800 --> 04:01:34.520
than young, healthy people.

04:01:34.520 --> 04:01:38.120
But by everybody getting vaccinated,

04:01:38.120 --> 04:01:41.200
we reduce the risk to everybody else.

04:01:41.200 --> 04:01:43.680
And so I feel like with everything,

04:01:43.680 --> 04:01:46.640
there's the individual benefit argument,

04:01:46.640 --> 04:01:49.320
and then there's the community argument.

04:01:49.320 --> 04:01:50.400
And I absolutely think-

04:01:50.400 --> 04:01:51.680
But expressing that clearly,

04:01:51.680 --> 04:01:55.000
that there's a difference between the individual health

04:01:55.000 --> 04:01:59.160
and freedoms and the community health and freedoms,

04:01:59.160 --> 04:02:01.920
and steel manning each side of this.

04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:05.160
One of the problems that people don't do enough of

04:02:05.160 --> 04:02:08.720
is be able to, so how do you just steel man an argument?

04:02:08.720 --> 04:02:11.520
You describe that argument in the best possible way.

04:02:12.640 --> 04:02:14.560
You have to first understand that argument.

04:02:14.560 --> 04:02:17.880
Let's go to the non-controversial thing like Flat Earth.

04:02:18.560 --> 04:02:22.560
Like most people, most colleagues of mine at MIT,

04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:27.560
don't even read about the full argument

04:02:27.640 --> 04:02:29.840
that the Flat Earthers make.

04:02:29.840 --> 04:02:34.840
I feel it's disingenuous for people in the physics community

04:02:35.920 --> 04:02:38.560
to roll their eyes at Flat Earthers

04:02:38.560 --> 04:02:41.080
if they haven't read their arguments.

04:02:41.080 --> 04:02:45.080
You should feel bad that you didn't read their arguments.

04:02:46.080 --> 04:02:50.680
And it's the rolling of the eyes that's a big problem.

04:02:50.680 --> 04:02:51.960
You haven't read it.

04:02:51.960 --> 04:02:55.280
Your intuition says that these are a bunch of crazy people,

04:02:55.280 --> 04:02:59.480
okay, but you haven't earned the right to roll your eyes.

04:02:59.480 --> 04:03:03.640
You've earned your right to maybe not read it,

04:03:03.640 --> 04:03:05.000
but then don't have an opinion.

04:03:05.000 --> 04:03:05.960
Don't roll your eyes,

04:03:05.960 --> 04:03:07.840
don't do any of that dismissive stuff.

04:03:07.840 --> 04:03:11.200
And the same thing in the scientific community

04:03:11.200 --> 04:03:14.360
around COVID and so on, there's often this kind of saying,

04:03:14.400 --> 04:03:16.320
oh, God, that's conspiracy theories,

04:03:16.320 --> 04:03:17.760
that's misinformation,

04:03:17.760 --> 04:03:20.360
without actually looking into what they're saying.

04:03:20.360 --> 04:03:22.440
If you haven't looked into what they're saying,

04:03:22.440 --> 04:03:23.920
then don't talk about it.

04:03:23.920 --> 04:03:26.320
Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator,

04:03:26.320 --> 04:03:27.600
you need to look into it.

04:03:27.600 --> 04:03:28.680
It's not that much effort.

04:03:28.680 --> 04:03:29.800
I totally agree.

04:03:29.800 --> 04:03:31.080
And I think that humility,

04:03:31.080 --> 04:03:35.200
it's a constant theme of your podcast and I love that.

04:03:35.200 --> 04:03:39.080
And so after the conversation debate,

04:03:39.080 --> 04:03:43.040
whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe,

04:03:43.040 --> 04:03:45.080
I reached out on Twitter to someone

04:03:45.080 --> 04:03:46.520
I've never met in person,

04:03:46.520 --> 04:03:48.040
but I'm in touch privately,

04:03:48.040 --> 04:03:49.800
to a guy named Daniel Griffin,

04:03:49.800 --> 04:03:54.800
who's a professor at Columbia Medical School

04:03:54.840 --> 04:03:56.200
and just so smart.

04:03:56.200 --> 04:04:01.000
He gives regular updates on COVID-19

04:04:01.000 --> 04:04:03.800
on a thing called TWIV this week in virology.

04:04:03.800 --> 04:04:08.800
I'm a critic of TWIV for its coverage of pandemic origins.

04:04:09.760 --> 04:04:12.320
But on this issue, on just having regular updates,

04:04:12.320 --> 04:04:13.680
Daniel is great.

04:04:13.680 --> 04:04:15.560
And so I said to him,

04:04:15.560 --> 04:04:20.560
I said, why don't we have an honest process

04:04:20.720 --> 04:04:23.000
to get the people who are raising concerns

04:04:23.000 --> 04:04:25.760
about the vaccines in their own words,

04:04:25.760 --> 04:04:28.440
to raise what are their concerns?

04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:32.160
And then let's do our best job of saying,

04:04:32.160 --> 04:04:34.080
well, here are these concerns.

04:04:34.080 --> 04:04:38.480
And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim

04:04:38.480 --> 04:04:41.840
and here are links to if you want to look at the studies

04:04:41.840 --> 04:04:45.360
upon which these claims are made, here they are.

04:04:45.360 --> 04:04:47.600
And Daniel, who's incredibly busy,

04:04:47.600 --> 04:04:50.120
I mean, he reads every,

04:04:50.120 --> 04:04:53.200
I mean, it seems every paper that comes out every week

04:04:53.200 --> 04:04:54.560
and it's unbelievable.

04:04:55.640 --> 04:05:00.560
But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page

04:05:00.560 --> 04:05:02.920
on the CDC website.

04:05:02.920 --> 04:05:05.800
And it wasn't that, it was people who were,

04:05:05.800 --> 04:05:07.800
I mean, it was written by people like me

04:05:07.800 --> 04:05:11.120
who were convinced in the benefit

04:05:11.160 --> 04:05:13.440
of these vaccines.

04:05:13.440 --> 04:05:15.800
So the questions were framed,

04:05:15.800 --> 04:05:17.000
they were kind of like,

04:05:17.000 --> 04:05:19.800
they weren't really the framing

04:05:19.800 --> 04:05:21.720
of the people with the concerns.

04:05:21.720 --> 04:05:22.640
They were framing of people

04:05:22.640 --> 04:05:25.240
who were just kind of imagining something else.

04:05:25.240 --> 04:05:27.480
I mean, you always talk about kind of humility

04:05:27.480 --> 04:05:29.320
and active listening.

04:05:29.320 --> 04:05:30.440
I know you don't mean,

04:05:30.440 --> 04:05:33.440
and it doesn't mean that we don't stand for something.

04:05:33.440 --> 04:05:36.720
Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines

04:05:36.720 --> 04:05:38.780
and masks and all of those things.

04:05:39.780 --> 04:05:42.180
But if we don't hear the other people,

04:05:42.180 --> 04:05:47.100
if we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation,

04:05:47.100 --> 04:05:49.060
if it's just saying, well, you may think this

04:05:49.060 --> 04:05:51.060
and here's why it's wrong,

04:05:51.060 --> 04:05:53.820
the argument may be right, it'll just never break through.

04:05:53.820 --> 04:05:56.220
By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay,

04:05:56.220 --> 04:05:57.380
I listened to that conversation

04:05:57.380 --> 04:06:00.140
without looking at Twitter or the internet.

04:06:00.140 --> 04:06:02.020
And I thought that was a great conversation.

04:06:02.020 --> 04:06:04.740
And I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded

04:06:04.740 --> 04:06:05.860
at bringing the temperature down.

04:06:05.860 --> 04:06:08.620
To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down.

04:06:09.460 --> 04:06:10.300
I didn't even think of it as a debate.

04:06:10.300 --> 04:06:13.020
I was like, oh, cool, this isn't gonna be some weird,

04:06:13.020 --> 04:06:15.220
it's like two friendly people talking.

04:06:15.220 --> 04:06:16.860
And then I look at the internet

04:06:16.860 --> 04:06:19.860
and then the internet says, Joe Rogan's slam,

04:06:19.860 --> 04:06:24.540
Sanjay, like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won.

04:06:24.540 --> 04:06:26.060
And it's like, all right,

04:06:26.060 --> 04:06:30.100
it's really the temperature being brought down,

04:06:30.100 --> 04:06:32.100
real conversation between two humans

04:06:32.100 --> 04:06:34.220
that wasn't really a debate.

04:06:34.220 --> 04:06:38.020
It was just a conversation and that was a success.

04:06:38.020 --> 04:06:40.980
Yeah, and I definitely think it was a success,

04:06:40.980 --> 04:06:43.980
but I also felt that a takeaway,

04:06:47.980 --> 04:06:49.740
and again, because this is something

04:06:49.740 --> 04:06:51.420
that I don't agree with,

04:06:51.420 --> 04:06:54.340
even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe,

04:06:54.340 --> 04:06:58.300
I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation

04:06:58.300 --> 04:07:00.700
would come away with the conclusion

04:07:00.700 --> 04:07:05.140
that all in all, these vaccines are a good thing.

04:07:05.140 --> 04:07:10.140
But if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it.

04:07:10.980 --> 04:07:15.980
And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made,

04:07:16.220 --> 04:07:17.420
even though Sanjay made it.

04:07:17.420 --> 04:07:19.380
It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it.

04:07:19.380 --> 04:07:22.140
It was just that in the flow of that conversation,

04:07:22.140 --> 04:07:26.100
I felt that the case for the vaccines,

04:07:26.100 --> 04:07:28.940
and the vaccines both as an individual choice,

04:07:28.940 --> 04:07:31.020
and then certainly again, as I said before,

04:07:31.020 --> 04:07:34.980
I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines,

04:07:34.980 --> 04:07:37.540
the virus itself is much scarier.

04:07:37.540 --> 04:07:40.780
And we're seeing it now in real time

04:07:40.780 --> 04:07:43.820
with these variations and variants.

04:07:43.820 --> 04:07:47.660
I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway

04:07:47.660 --> 04:07:49.460
from that conversation.

04:07:50.740 --> 04:07:54.140
And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love,

04:07:54.140 --> 04:07:56.780
I felt could have made his case a little bit stronger.

04:07:56.780 --> 04:08:00.220
So the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off

04:08:00.220 --> 04:08:05.220
as like a science expert looking down at everybody,

04:08:07.140 --> 04:08:09.140
talking down to everybody.

04:08:09.140 --> 04:08:12.020
So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful.

04:08:12.020 --> 04:08:15.260
But I also think sort of making the case

04:08:15.260 --> 04:08:19.260
for taking the vaccine when you're a young, healthy person,

04:08:19.260 --> 04:08:22.060
when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan,

04:08:22.060 --> 04:08:26.100
is like a high difficulty on the video game level.

04:08:26.780 --> 04:08:31.780
So it's difficult to do, and also it's difficult to do

04:08:32.860 --> 04:08:37.860
because it's not as simple as like, look at the data.

04:08:38.980 --> 04:08:42.780
There's a lot of data to go through here.

04:08:42.780 --> 04:08:45.780
And there's also a lot of non-data stuff,

04:08:45.780 --> 04:08:48.620
like the fact that, first of all,

04:08:48.620 --> 04:08:50.140
questioning the sources of the data,

04:08:50.140 --> 04:08:51.740
the quality of the data,

04:08:51.740 --> 04:08:54.100
because it's also disappointing about COVID

04:08:54.140 --> 04:08:56.420
because the quality of the data is not great,

04:08:56.420 --> 04:09:00.620
but also questioning all the motivations

04:09:00.620 --> 04:09:02.460
of the different parties involved,

04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:05.380
whether it's major organizations that develop the vaccine,

04:09:05.380 --> 04:09:09.900
whether it's major institutions like NIH or NIAD

04:09:09.900 --> 04:09:12.500
that are sort of communicating to us about the vaccine,

04:09:12.500 --> 04:09:15.620
whether it's the CDC and the WHO,

04:09:15.620 --> 04:09:18.140
whether it's the Biden or the Trump administration,

04:09:18.140 --> 04:09:21.380
whether it's China and all those kinds of things.

04:09:21.420 --> 04:09:24.140
That's part of the conversation here.

04:09:24.140 --> 04:09:28.740
I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool,

04:09:28.740 --> 04:09:30.460
it's also a tool for a government

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:33.500
to gain more control over the populace.

04:09:33.500 --> 04:09:36.300
Like, there's a lot of truth to that too.

04:09:36.300 --> 04:09:38.220
Things that have a lot of benefit

04:09:40.060 --> 04:09:44.300
can also be used as a Trojan horse

04:09:44.300 --> 04:09:47.340
to increase bureaucracy and control,

04:09:47.340 --> 04:09:50.140
but that has to be on the table for a conversation.

04:09:50.340 --> 04:09:52.060
I think it has to be on the conversation,

04:09:52.060 --> 04:09:56.580
but I mean, your parents when they were in the Soviet Union

04:09:56.580 --> 04:09:57.900
and here in the United States,

04:09:57.900 --> 04:09:59.540
and actually it was a big collaboration

04:09:59.540 --> 04:10:02.140
between US and Soviet Union,

04:10:02.140 --> 04:10:04.060
when the polio vaccine came out,

04:10:04.060 --> 04:10:06.140
but there were people all around the world

04:10:06.140 --> 04:10:08.380
who had a different life trajectory,

04:10:08.380 --> 04:10:09.860
no longer living in fear.

04:10:09.860 --> 04:10:11.860
And all of these people who were paralyzed

04:10:11.860 --> 04:10:15.900
or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated.

04:10:15.900 --> 04:10:20.260
It was one of the great successes in human history.

04:10:20.260 --> 04:10:23.260
And while it for sure is true that you could imagine

04:10:23.260 --> 04:10:27.740
some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort,

04:10:27.740 --> 04:10:31.220
but here I genuinely think, I mean, whatever the number,

04:10:31.220 --> 04:10:35.020
15 million, 16 million is the economist number of dead

04:10:35.020 --> 04:10:39.740
from COVID-19, many, many, many more people would be dead,

04:10:39.740 --> 04:10:41.740
but for these vaccines.

04:10:41.740 --> 04:10:44.340
And so I get that any activity

04:10:44.340 --> 04:10:47.660
that needs to be coordinated by a central government

04:10:47.660 --> 04:10:50.660
has the potential to increase bureaucracy

04:10:50.660 --> 04:10:53.620
and increase control.

04:10:53.620 --> 04:10:57.860
But there are certain things that central governments do

04:10:57.860 --> 04:11:00.860
like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines,

04:11:00.860 --> 04:11:05.060
which it's purely a US government victory.

04:11:05.060 --> 04:11:07.980
I mean, there was huge DARPA funding

04:11:07.980 --> 04:11:10.500
and then the National Institute

04:11:10.500 --> 04:11:13.500
for Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH funding.

04:11:13.540 --> 04:11:17.100
I mean, this was a public-private partnership throughout

04:11:17.100 --> 04:11:20.580
and that we got a working vaccine in 11 months

04:11:20.580 --> 04:11:21.620
was a miracle, so I-

04:11:21.620 --> 04:11:23.300
It's not purely a victory.

04:11:24.340 --> 04:11:26.220
Again, you have to be open-minded.

04:11:27.260 --> 04:11:30.460
I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate,

04:11:30.460 --> 04:11:32.660
but the people who discuss any viral drugs

04:11:32.660 --> 04:11:34.860
like ivermectin and other alternatives

04:11:34.860 --> 04:11:38.140
would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine

04:11:39.060 --> 04:11:42.140
distracted us from considering other possibilities

04:11:42.140 --> 04:11:46.100
and saying that this is purely a success

04:11:46.100 --> 04:11:48.060
is distracting from the story

04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:50.660
that there could have been other solutions.

04:11:50.660 --> 04:11:52.420
So yes, it's a huge success

04:11:52.420 --> 04:11:55.060
that the vaccine was developed so quickly

04:11:55.980 --> 04:12:00.620
and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for,

04:12:02.220 --> 04:12:04.540
but there could have been other solutions

04:12:04.540 --> 04:12:08.060
and they completely distract it from that.

04:12:08.060 --> 04:12:10.700
In fact, it distracted us from looking

04:12:10.700 --> 04:12:13.340
into a bunch of things like the lab leak.

04:12:13.340 --> 04:12:15.740
So it's not a pure victory.

04:12:15.740 --> 04:12:18.180
And there's a lot of people that criticize

04:12:18.180 --> 04:12:20.860
the overreach of government and all of this.

04:12:20.860 --> 04:12:23.500
One of the things that makes the United States great

04:12:24.500 --> 04:12:29.500
is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates.

04:12:31.580 --> 04:12:35.180
Even if the mandates en masse will have a positive,

04:12:35.180 --> 04:12:37.340
even strongly positive result,

04:12:37.740 --> 04:12:42.740
the Americans, many Americans will still say no

04:12:42.980 --> 04:12:46.820
because in the long arc of history,

04:12:46.820 --> 04:12:49.700
saying no in that moment will actually lead

04:12:49.700 --> 04:12:53.620
to a better country and a better world.

04:12:53.620 --> 04:12:57.340
So that's a messed up aspect of America,

04:12:57.340 --> 04:12:59.940
but it's also a beautiful part.

04:12:59.940 --> 04:13:03.860
We're skeptical even about good things.

04:13:03.860 --> 04:13:08.260
I agree and certainly we should all be cautious

04:13:08.260 --> 04:13:11.540
about government overreach, absolutely.

04:13:11.540 --> 04:13:14.540
And it happens in all kinds of scenarios

04:13:14.540 --> 04:13:17.340
with incarceration with a thousand things.

04:13:17.340 --> 04:13:20.940
And we also should be afraid of government underreach

04:13:20.940 --> 04:13:24.020
that if there is a problem that could be solved

04:13:24.020 --> 04:13:26.100
by governments and that's why we have governments

04:13:26.100 --> 04:13:28.180
in the first place is that there's just certain things

04:13:28.180 --> 04:13:31.060
that individuals can't do on their own

04:13:31.060 --> 04:13:33.980
and that's why we pool our resources

04:13:33.980 --> 04:13:38.180
and we in some ways sacrifice our rights

04:13:38.180 --> 04:13:39.140
for this common thing.

04:13:39.140 --> 04:13:42.340
And that's why we don't have hopefully people murderers

04:13:42.340 --> 04:13:45.420
marauding or people driving 200 miles down the street,

04:13:45.420 --> 04:13:48.140
that we have a process for arriving

04:13:48.140 --> 04:13:49.820
at a set of common rules.

04:13:49.820 --> 04:13:52.660
And so while I fully agree that we need to respect

04:13:52.660 --> 04:13:56.420
and we need to listen, we need to find that right balance.

04:13:56.420 --> 04:13:59.980
And you've raised the magic I word, ivermectin.

04:14:00.980 --> 04:14:05.420
And so an ivermectin, like my view has always been

04:14:06.300 --> 04:14:09.580
ivermectin could be effective, it could not be effective.

04:14:09.580 --> 04:14:12.060
Let's study it through a full process.

04:14:12.060 --> 04:14:14.420
And when you had Francis Collins with you,

04:14:14.420 --> 04:14:19.420
even while he was making up stories about this wrestler,

04:14:19.860 --> 04:14:22.100
he was saying, yeah, exactly.

04:14:22.100 --> 04:14:25.140
But he was saying that they're going to do

04:14:25.140 --> 04:14:28.500
a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin.

04:14:28.500 --> 04:14:30.180
And if ivermectin works,

04:14:30.180 --> 04:14:32.820
then that's another tool in our toolbox.

04:14:32.820 --> 04:14:34.060
And I think we should.

04:14:34.060 --> 04:14:37.780
And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct

04:14:37.780 --> 04:14:40.740
to concede the point to Joe,

04:14:40.740 --> 04:14:43.220
that it was disingenuous for people,

04:14:43.220 --> 04:14:45.260
including people on CNN,

04:14:45.260 --> 04:14:49.020
to say that ivermectin is for livestock.

04:14:49.020 --> 04:14:52.420
And so like, I definitely think that we have to,

04:14:53.300 --> 04:14:55.540
like we have to have some kind of process

04:14:55.540 --> 04:14:57.580
that allows us to come together.

04:14:57.580 --> 04:15:01.900
And I totally agree that the great strength of America

04:15:01.900 --> 04:15:03.500
is that we empower individuals.

04:15:03.500 --> 04:15:06.940
It's the history of our frontier mentality in our country.

04:15:06.940 --> 04:15:11.500
So we, I 100% agree that we have to allow that,

04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:15.620
even if sometimes it creates messy processes

04:15:15.620 --> 04:15:18.420
and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things.

04:15:19.980 --> 04:15:22.700
You are an ultra marathon runner.

04:15:22.700 --> 04:15:23.940
Yes.

04:15:23.940 --> 04:15:27.220
What, what, what are you running from?

04:15:27.220 --> 04:15:28.700
No.

04:15:28.700 --> 04:15:30.700
It's the funny thing is,

04:15:30.700 --> 04:15:34.220
so I'm an ultra marathoner and I've done 13 Ironmans.

04:15:34.220 --> 04:15:36.340
And people say, oh my God, that's amazing.

04:15:36.340 --> 04:15:37.180
13 Ironmans.

04:15:37.180 --> 04:15:41.100
And what I always say, no, one Ironman is impressive.

04:15:41.100 --> 04:15:44.380
13 Ironmans, there's something effing wrong with you.

04:15:44.380 --> 04:15:45.780
We just need to figure out what it is.

04:15:45.780 --> 04:15:48.540
Yeah, there's some demons you're trying to work through.

04:15:48.540 --> 04:15:50.020
I mean, while you're doing the work though,

04:15:50.020 --> 04:15:53.580
most people just kind of let the demons sit in the attic.

04:15:53.940 --> 04:15:55.460
No.

04:15:55.460 --> 04:15:57.220
What have you learned about yourself,

04:15:57.220 --> 04:16:00.220
about your mind, about your body, about life,

04:16:00.220 --> 04:16:05.220
from taking your body to the limit in that kind of way

04:16:05.340 --> 04:16:06.980
to running those kinds of distances?

04:16:06.980 --> 04:16:08.180
Well, it's a great question.

04:16:08.180 --> 04:16:10.100
And I know that you are also kind of exploring

04:16:10.100 --> 04:16:12.500
the limits of the physical.

04:16:12.500 --> 04:16:17.220
And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultra marathons,

04:16:17.220 --> 04:16:20.420
it's always the same kind of lesson,

04:16:20.420 --> 04:16:25.420
which is just when you think you have nothing left,

04:16:25.540 --> 04:16:27.900
you actually have a ton left.

04:16:27.900 --> 04:16:31.180
There are a lot of resources that are there

04:16:31.180 --> 04:16:32.860
if you call on them.

04:16:32.860 --> 04:16:37.860
And the ability to call on them has to be cultivated.

04:16:38.580 --> 04:16:42.420
And so for me, especially in the Ironman,

04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:45.900
and Ironman in many ways is harder than the ultra marathons

04:16:46.100 --> 04:16:48.140
because I'll be at, I mean, it's 140 miles,

04:16:48.140 --> 04:16:53.140
I'll be at mile 120 having done the swim and then the bike

04:16:53.700 --> 04:16:58.380
and I'll be whatever, six miles into the run.

04:16:58.380 --> 04:17:01.420
And I'll think, I feel like shit.

04:17:01.420 --> 04:17:02.900
I have nothing left.

04:17:02.900 --> 04:17:07.700
How am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more?

04:17:07.700 --> 04:17:10.540
But there's always more.

04:17:10.540 --> 04:17:15.460
And I think that for me, these extreme sports

04:17:15.460 --> 04:17:20.460
are my process of exploring what's possible.

04:17:21.060 --> 04:17:25.220
And I feel like it applies in so many different areas

04:17:25.220 --> 04:17:28.140
of life where you're kind of pushing

04:17:28.140 --> 04:17:30.940
and it feels like the limit.

04:17:30.940 --> 04:17:33.140
And one of my, a friend of mine,

04:17:33.140 --> 04:17:35.820
who I just have so much respect for,

04:17:35.820 --> 04:17:37.300
who actually would be a great guest

04:17:37.300 --> 04:17:41.300
if you haven't already interviewed him is Charlie Angle.

04:17:41.300 --> 04:17:45.300
And Charlie, he was a drug addict, he was in prison,

04:17:45.300 --> 04:17:47.220
his life was total shit.

04:17:48.140 --> 04:17:50.940
And somehow, and I can't remember the full story,

04:17:50.940 --> 04:17:55.660
he just started running around the prison yard.

04:17:55.660 --> 04:17:56.820
And it was just like Forrest Gump,

04:17:56.820 --> 04:17:59.220
and he just kept running and running.

04:17:59.220 --> 04:18:02.380
And then he got out of prison and he kept running

04:18:02.380 --> 04:18:04.820
and he started doing ultra marathons,

04:18:04.820 --> 04:18:07.660
started inspiring all these other people.

04:18:07.660 --> 04:18:09.060
Now he's written all these books.

04:18:09.060 --> 04:18:12.500
As a matter of fact, we just spoke a few months ago

04:18:12.500 --> 04:18:17.500
that he's planning on running from the Dead Sea

04:18:18.100 --> 04:18:20.340
to somehow to the top of Mount Everest,

04:18:20.340 --> 04:18:23.420
from the lowest point to the highest point on Earth.

04:18:23.420 --> 04:18:25.900
And I said, well, why are you stopping there?

04:18:25.900 --> 04:18:29.340
Why don't you get whatever camera in

04:18:29.340 --> 04:18:32.140
and go down to the lowest part of the ocean,

04:18:32.140 --> 04:18:33.940
go to the lowest part of the ocean,

04:18:33.940 --> 04:18:38.180
and then talk to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos

04:18:38.180 --> 04:18:40.180
and go to kind of the highest place

04:18:40.180 --> 04:18:42.100
in the stratosphere you can get.

04:18:42.180 --> 04:18:44.700
But it's this thing of possibility.

04:18:44.700 --> 04:18:49.140
And I just feel like so many of us, and myself included,

04:18:49.140 --> 04:18:54.140
we get stuck in a sense of what we think is our range.

04:18:54.620 --> 04:18:57.820
And if we're not careful, that can become our range.

04:18:57.820 --> 04:19:00.900
And that's why for me in all of life,

04:19:00.900 --> 04:19:02.500
it's all about, like we've been talking about,

04:19:02.500 --> 04:19:06.260
challenging the limits, challenging assumptions,

04:19:06.260 --> 04:19:08.100
challenging ourselves.

04:19:08.100 --> 04:19:10.540
And hopefully, we do it in a way

04:19:10.540 --> 04:19:12.940
that kind of doesn't hurt anybody.

04:19:12.940 --> 04:19:15.860
When I'm at the Ironman, they have all these little kids

04:19:15.860 --> 04:19:17.020
and they'll have these little shirts,

04:19:17.020 --> 04:19:19.180
and it'll say, like, my dad is a hero

04:19:19.180 --> 04:19:21.020
and have the little Ironman logo.

04:19:21.020 --> 04:19:22.820
And I wanna say, it's like, no,

04:19:22.820 --> 04:19:25.260
your dad is actually a narcissistic dick

04:19:25.260 --> 04:19:29.500
who goes on eight-mile bike rides every Sunday

04:19:29.500 --> 04:19:31.500
rather than spend time with you.

04:19:31.500 --> 04:19:33.980
And so we shouldn't hurt anybody.

04:19:33.980 --> 04:19:38.660
But for me, and also I just find it very enjoyable,

04:19:38.700 --> 04:19:41.380
and I hope I'm not disclosing too much

04:19:41.380 --> 04:19:44.100
about our conversation before we went live,

04:19:44.100 --> 04:19:46.060
where you're doing so many different things

04:19:46.060 --> 04:19:48.780
with running and your martial arts.

04:19:48.780 --> 04:19:53.660
And I encouraged you to do ultra marathons

04:19:53.660 --> 04:19:55.260
because there's so many great ones in Texas.

04:19:55.260 --> 04:19:57.340
It's actually, surprisingly,

04:19:57.340 --> 04:19:59.580
a very enjoyable way to spend a day.

04:19:59.580 --> 04:20:01.100
Like how would you recommend?

04:20:01.100 --> 04:20:03.460
So yeah, for people who might not know,

04:20:03.460 --> 04:20:05.100
I've never actually even run a marathon.

04:20:05.100 --> 04:20:08.420
I run 22 miles in one time at most.

04:20:08.420 --> 04:20:13.420
I did a four by four by 48 challenge with David Goggins

04:20:13.900 --> 04:20:16.340
where you run four miles every four hours.

04:20:16.340 --> 04:20:17.180
Is it different?

04:20:17.180 --> 04:20:19.340
It has less to do with the distance

04:20:19.340 --> 04:20:21.620
and more to do with the sleep deprivation.

04:20:21.620 --> 04:20:24.980
What advice would you give to a first-time ultra marathoner

04:20:24.980 --> 04:20:27.180
like me trying to run 50 or more miles

04:20:27.180 --> 04:20:30.260
or for anybody else interested

04:20:30.260 --> 04:20:32.340
in this kind of exploration of their range?

04:20:32.340 --> 04:20:36.940
What I always tell is the same advice is register.

04:20:36.940 --> 04:20:39.540
Pick your timeline of when you think you can be ready.

04:20:39.540 --> 04:20:41.140
Make it, depending on where you are now,

04:20:41.140 --> 04:20:43.100
make it six months, make a year,

04:20:43.100 --> 04:20:45.300
and then register for the race.

04:20:45.300 --> 04:20:47.060
And then once you're registered,

04:20:47.060 --> 04:20:49.820
just work back from there, what's it going to take?

04:20:49.820 --> 04:20:52.740
But one of the things for people who are just getting going,

04:20:52.740 --> 04:20:53.980
you really do need to make sure

04:20:53.980 --> 04:20:55.940
that your body is ready for it.

04:20:55.940 --> 04:20:59.100
And so particularly, and particularly as we get older,

04:20:59.100 --> 04:21:02.660
strengthening is really important.

04:21:02.660 --> 04:21:06.260
So I'll do a plug for my brother, Jordan Metzel.

04:21:06.260 --> 04:21:08.380
He's a doctor at Hospital for Special Surgery,

04:21:08.380 --> 04:21:10.740
but his whole thing is functional strength.

04:21:10.740 --> 04:21:12.740
And so, and people know about,

04:21:12.740 --> 04:21:15.140
and you can actually even go to his website,

04:21:15.140 --> 04:21:17.420
you can just Google Jordan Metzel Iron Strength,

04:21:17.420 --> 04:21:19.180
but it's all about burpees

04:21:19.180 --> 04:21:21.380
and just building your muscular strength

04:21:21.380 --> 04:21:25.060
so that you don't get injured as you increase.

04:21:25.060 --> 04:21:27.740
And then just increase your mileage with,

04:21:27.740 --> 04:21:31.340
in some steady way, make sure that you take rest days

04:21:31.340 --> 04:21:34.540
and listen to your body, because people like you

04:21:34.540 --> 04:21:37.140
who are just very kind of mind over matter,

04:21:37.140 --> 04:21:39.460
like you were telling me before about you have an injury,

04:21:39.460 --> 04:21:41.780
but you kind of run a little bit differently.

04:21:41.780 --> 04:21:44.460
And we need to listen to our bodies

04:21:44.460 --> 04:21:47.660
because our bodies are communicating.

04:21:48.980 --> 04:21:51.260
But I think if it's kind of little by little,

04:21:51.260 --> 04:21:53.460
magic is possible.

04:21:53.460 --> 04:21:55.900
And what I will say is, and I also do,

04:21:55.900 --> 04:21:58.300
I've done lots and lots of marathons,

04:21:58.300 --> 04:22:01.620
and I always tell people that the ultra marathons,

04:22:01.620 --> 04:22:02.580
at least the ones that I do,

04:22:02.580 --> 04:22:04.100
and I shouldn't misrepresent myself,

04:22:04.260 --> 04:22:07.460
there are people who do 500 mile races.

04:22:07.460 --> 04:22:11.140
The ones that I do are 50K mountain trail runs,

04:22:11.140 --> 04:22:12.540
which is 32 miles.

04:22:12.540 --> 04:22:17.540
So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras.

04:22:17.820 --> 04:22:19.780
But it's actually much easier than a marathon

04:22:19.780 --> 04:22:24.140
because the mountain ones, sometimes it's so steep

04:22:24.140 --> 04:22:26.820
that you can't, you have to walk it

04:22:26.820 --> 04:22:29.100
because walking is faster than running.

04:22:29.100 --> 04:22:32.060
And every four or five miles in the supported races,

04:22:32.060 --> 04:22:35.420
you stop and eat blintzes and boiled potatoes.

04:22:35.420 --> 04:22:36.740
It's actually quite enjoyable.

04:22:36.740 --> 04:22:41.100
But as I started to tell you before we went live,

04:22:42.020 --> 04:22:43.780
so I've done for lots of years,

04:22:43.780 --> 04:22:45.460
these 50K mountain trail runs,

04:22:45.460 --> 04:22:48.140
and I was going to Taiwan a number of years ago

04:22:48.140 --> 04:22:49.220
for something else.

04:22:49.220 --> 04:22:50.740
And I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun

04:22:50.740 --> 04:22:52.940
to do an ultra marathon in Taiwan?

04:22:52.940 --> 04:22:56.860
I looked and the weekend after my visit,

04:22:56.860 --> 04:22:59.260
there was a marathon, it was called the,

04:22:59.260 --> 04:23:01.740
ultra marathon, it was called the Taiwan Beast.

04:23:01.820 --> 04:23:03.980
And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?

04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:06.580
It's 50K mountain trail, and I've done a million of them.

04:23:06.580 --> 04:23:07.820
And then I went to register.

04:23:07.820 --> 04:23:09.300
And then as part of registration,

04:23:09.300 --> 04:23:11.660
they said, you need to have all of this equipment.

04:23:11.660 --> 04:23:15.100
And it was all this like wilderness survival equipment.

04:23:15.100 --> 04:23:17.940
And I was thinking, God, these Taiwanese,

04:23:17.940 --> 04:23:18.780
what a bunch of wimps.

04:23:18.780 --> 04:23:19.620
Way too dramatic.

04:23:19.620 --> 04:23:22.340
You have to carry, give me a break, 50K mountain trail.

04:23:22.340 --> 04:23:25.700
So I get there and the race starts at like 4.30

04:23:25.700 --> 04:23:27.540
in the morning in the middle of nowhere.

04:23:27.540 --> 04:23:28.620
And you have to wear headlamps

04:23:28.620 --> 04:23:29.820
and everyone's carrying all this stuff.

04:23:29.820 --> 04:23:34.820
And you kind of go running out into the rainforest.

04:23:34.820 --> 04:23:36.740
It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my,

04:23:36.740 --> 04:23:38.180
it took 19 hours.

04:23:38.180 --> 04:23:41.580
There were maybe 15 cliff faces, like a real cliff.

04:23:41.580 --> 04:23:44.500
And somebody had dangled like a little piece of string.

04:23:44.500 --> 04:23:46.900
And so you had to hold onto the string with one hand

04:23:46.900 --> 04:23:49.380
while it was in the pouring rain, climb up these cliffs.

04:23:49.380 --> 04:23:52.740
There were maybe 20 river crossings,

04:23:52.740 --> 04:23:57.100
but not just like a little stream, like a torrential river.

04:23:57.100 --> 04:24:00.140
There were some things where it was so steep

04:24:00.140 --> 04:24:02.060
that everyone was just climbing up

04:24:02.060 --> 04:24:03.980
and then you'd slide all the way down and climb up.

04:24:03.980 --> 04:24:07.060
And there were people who I met on the way out there

04:24:07.060 --> 04:24:11.540
who were saying, oh yeah, I did the Sahara 500 kilometer race.

04:24:11.540 --> 04:24:15.220
And those people were just sprawled out.

04:24:15.220 --> 04:24:17.460
A lot of them didn't finish.

04:24:17.460 --> 04:24:19.780
So that was the hardest thing I've ever.

04:24:19.780 --> 04:24:22.060
So how do you get through something like that?

04:24:22.060 --> 04:24:24.220
You just, one step at a time, was there,

04:24:24.220 --> 04:24:26.380
do you remember, is there a?

04:24:26.380 --> 04:24:27.220
Yeah.

04:24:27.220 --> 04:24:28.500
Is there a dark moments

04:24:28.500 --> 04:24:31.140
or is it kind of all spread out thinly?

04:24:31.140 --> 04:24:34.100
It wasn't really dark moments.

04:24:34.100 --> 04:24:36.620
I mean, there was one thing where I'd been running so long.

04:24:36.620 --> 04:24:39.020
I thought, well, I must almost be done.

04:24:39.020 --> 04:24:43.060
And then I found out I am like 15 miles more.

04:24:44.700 --> 04:24:48.420
But I guess with all of these things,

04:24:48.420 --> 04:24:51.700
it's the messages that we tell ourselves.

04:24:51.700 --> 04:24:55.500
And so for me, it's like the message I always tell myself

04:24:55.500 --> 04:24:58.780
is quitting isn't an option.

04:24:58.780 --> 04:25:00.740
I mean, once in a while, you kind of have to quit

04:25:00.740 --> 04:25:02.460
if like listen to the universe,

04:25:02.460 --> 04:25:04.860
if whatever, you're gonna kill yourself or something.

04:25:04.860 --> 04:25:08.540
But for me, it was just, whatever it takes,

04:25:08.540 --> 04:25:10.180
there's no way I'm stopping.

04:25:10.180 --> 04:25:14.260
And if I have to go up this muddy hill 20 times

04:25:14.260 --> 04:25:17.780
because I keep sliding, I'm sure there's a way.

04:25:17.780 --> 04:25:19.660
It's probably a personality flaw.

04:25:21.580 --> 04:25:23.900
Where does your love for chocolate come from?

04:25:23.900 --> 04:25:24.980
Oh, it's a great question.

04:25:24.980 --> 04:25:27.460
And in both of my Joe Rogan interviews,

04:25:27.460 --> 04:25:29.020
that's the first question that he asked.

04:25:29.020 --> 04:25:30.980
So I'm glad that we've gotten to that.

04:25:30.980 --> 04:25:33.940
So one, I've always loved chocolate.

04:25:33.940 --> 04:25:36.660
And I call it like a secret,

04:25:36.660 --> 04:25:37.940
but now that I keep telling,

04:25:37.940 --> 04:25:39.580
if you keep telling the same secret,

04:25:39.580 --> 04:25:42.100
it's actually no longer a secret,

04:25:42.100 --> 04:25:45.220
that I have a secret, which is not secret

04:25:45.220 --> 04:25:47.780
because I'm telling you on a podcast,

04:25:47.780 --> 04:25:50.180
life as a chocolate shaman.

04:25:50.180 --> 04:25:53.580
And so when I give keynotes at tech conference,

04:25:53.580 --> 04:25:55.540
I say, I'm happy to give a keynote,

04:25:55.540 --> 04:25:59.020
but I want to lead a sacred cacao ceremony in the night.

04:25:59.020 --> 04:26:00.540
I'm actually, believe it or not,

04:26:00.540 --> 04:26:02.540
the official chocolate shaman

04:26:02.540 --> 04:26:05.180
of what used to be called exponential medicine,

04:26:05.180 --> 04:26:06.660
which is part of Singularity University.

04:26:06.660 --> 04:26:09.580
Now, my friend Daniel Kraft who runs it,

04:26:09.580 --> 04:26:12.580
it's going to be called NextMed.

04:26:12.580 --> 04:26:14.780
And so, but I'll have to go back

04:26:14.780 --> 04:26:19.460
as I was going to Berlin a lot of years ago,

04:26:19.460 --> 04:26:20.540
and I've always loved chocolate,

04:26:20.580 --> 04:26:23.780
I was going to Berlin to give a keynote

04:26:23.780 --> 04:26:28.420
at a big conference called TOA, Tech Open Air.

04:26:28.420 --> 04:26:31.820
And so when I got there, the first night,

04:26:31.820 --> 04:26:33.020
I was supposed to give a talk,

04:26:33.020 --> 04:26:34.540
but there had been some mix up,

04:26:34.540 --> 04:26:36.700
they'd forgotten to reserve the room,

04:26:36.700 --> 04:26:38.340
and so the talk got canceled.

04:26:38.340 --> 04:26:40.020
And in the brochure,

04:26:40.020 --> 04:26:43.260
they had all these different events around Berlin

04:26:43.260 --> 04:26:44.100
that you could go to.

04:26:44.100 --> 04:26:46.260
And one of them was a cacao ceremony.

04:26:46.260 --> 04:26:49.660
And so I went there and actually met somebody,

04:26:49.700 --> 04:26:52.100
Viviana, who is still a friend,

04:26:52.100 --> 04:26:53.460
but I met, going in there,

04:26:53.460 --> 04:26:54.740
and there was this cacao ceremony,

04:26:54.740 --> 04:26:56.620
these kind of hippie dudes,

04:26:56.620 --> 04:26:59.700
and then everybody got the cacao.

04:26:59.700 --> 04:27:01.060
And then they said, all right,

04:27:01.060 --> 04:27:03.180
as they talked a little bit about the process,

04:27:03.180 --> 04:27:05.820
and then they said, all right, everyone just stand

04:27:05.820 --> 04:27:07.620
and kind of, we're going to spin around

04:27:07.620 --> 04:27:09.580
in a circle for 45 minutes.

04:27:09.580 --> 04:27:12.900
And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes,

04:27:12.900 --> 04:27:14.140
but then I had to leave

04:27:14.140 --> 04:27:15.900
because I had to go to something else.

04:27:15.900 --> 04:27:18.500
And so I thought that was that.

04:27:18.540 --> 04:27:21.220
But then I saw Viviana the next day,

04:27:21.220 --> 04:27:23.300
and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony go?

04:27:23.300 --> 04:27:25.380
And she showed me these pictures

04:27:25.380 --> 04:27:28.460
of all of these people, mostly naked.

04:27:28.460 --> 04:27:31.100
Like, it turned into chaos.

04:27:31.100 --> 04:27:33.740
And it was like, oh, and so let me get this straight.

04:27:33.740 --> 04:27:35.660
People drank chocolate,

04:27:35.660 --> 04:27:37.740
then they spun around in a circle,

04:27:37.740 --> 04:27:39.260
and something else happened.

04:27:39.260 --> 04:27:41.460
And anyway, so then two days later,

04:27:41.460 --> 04:27:43.860
I was invited to another cacao ceremony,

04:27:43.860 --> 04:27:46.580
which was also actually part of this toa.

04:27:46.580 --> 04:27:48.660
And that was kind of more structured,

04:27:48.660 --> 04:27:51.220
and it was more sane because it was part of this thing.

04:27:51.220 --> 04:27:53.700
And at the end of that, I had this,

04:27:53.700 --> 04:27:56.940
I thought, one, the greatest thing ever,

04:27:56.940 --> 04:27:59.740
a sacred cacao ceremony, like you drink chocolate milk

04:27:59.740 --> 04:28:01.500
and everybody's free.

04:28:01.500 --> 04:28:05.700
And I love that idea because I've never done drugs,

04:28:05.700 --> 04:28:07.180
I don't drink.

04:28:07.180 --> 04:28:09.420
But just part of it is because I think whatever,

04:28:09.420 --> 04:28:12.060
like I was saying with the ultra running,

04:28:12.060 --> 04:28:14.100
all of the possibilities are within us

04:28:14.140 --> 04:28:16.860
if we can get out of our own way.

04:28:16.860 --> 04:28:20.220
And then I thought, well, I think I can do a better job

04:28:20.220 --> 04:28:22.340
than what I experienced in Berlin.

04:28:22.340 --> 04:28:23.540
So I came back and I thought, all right,

04:28:23.540 --> 04:28:26.180
I'm gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman,

04:28:26.180 --> 04:28:27.580
and this will shock you.

04:28:27.580 --> 04:28:30.220
Because I know if you're gonna be like a rabbi

04:28:30.220 --> 04:28:32.060
or a priest or something, there's some process.

04:28:32.060 --> 04:28:35.140
But shockingly, there's no official process

04:28:35.140 --> 04:28:37.940
to become a chocolate shaman.

04:28:37.940 --> 04:28:40.580
And so I thought, all right, well,

04:28:40.580 --> 04:28:42.220
I'm just gonna train myself,

04:28:42.220 --> 04:28:44.060
and when I'm ready, I'm gonna declare

04:28:44.060 --> 04:28:45.220
my chocolate shamanism.

04:28:45.220 --> 04:28:47.420
So I started studying different things,

04:28:47.420 --> 04:28:50.380
and when I was ready, I just said,

04:28:50.380 --> 04:28:52.860
now I'm a chocolate shaman, self-declared.

04:28:52.860 --> 04:28:53.940
Self-declared.

04:28:53.940 --> 04:28:55.540
But I do these ceremonies,

04:28:55.540 --> 04:28:58.380
and I've done them at tech conferences,

04:28:58.380 --> 04:29:01.100
I did one in Soho House in New York,

04:29:01.100 --> 04:29:04.420
I've done it at a place Rancho La Puerta in Mexico.

04:29:04.420 --> 04:29:06.020
And every time, it's the same thing.

04:29:06.020 --> 04:29:10.260
Because if people are given a license to be free,

04:29:10.740 --> 04:29:11.940
it doesn't matter.

04:29:11.940 --> 04:29:13.420
And what I always say is,

04:29:13.420 --> 04:29:15.260
you're here for a sacred cacao ceremony,

04:29:15.260 --> 04:29:18.340
but the truth is there's no such thing as sacred cacao,

04:29:18.340 --> 04:29:19.700
and there's no sacred mountains,

04:29:19.700 --> 04:29:21.100
and there's no sacred people,

04:29:21.100 --> 04:29:22.420
and there's no sacred plants.

04:29:22.420 --> 04:29:25.780
Because nothing is sacred if we don't attribute,

04:29:25.780 --> 04:29:28.820
ascribe sacredness to it.

04:29:28.820 --> 04:29:32.420
But if we recognize that everything is sacred,

04:29:32.420 --> 04:29:33.700
then we'll live different lives.

04:29:33.700 --> 04:29:36.180
And for the purpose of this ceremony,

04:29:36.180 --> 04:29:37.620
we're just gonna say, all right,

04:29:37.620 --> 04:29:39.940
we're gonna focus on this cacao,

04:29:40.620 --> 04:29:43.380
which actually has been used ceremonially for 5,000 years.

04:29:43.380 --> 04:29:46.100
It has all these wonderful properties.

04:29:46.980 --> 04:29:49.460
But it's just people who get that license,

04:29:49.460 --> 04:29:51.020
and then they're just free,

04:29:51.020 --> 04:29:52.740
and people are dancing and all sorts of things.

04:29:52.740 --> 04:29:57.100
Is the goal to celebrate life in general?

04:29:57.100 --> 04:30:00.620
Is it to celebrate the senses, like taste?

04:30:00.620 --> 04:30:02.980
Is it to celebrate yourself, each other?

04:30:02.980 --> 04:30:04.060
What is their...

04:30:04.060 --> 04:30:07.060
I think the core is gratitude,

04:30:07.060 --> 04:30:09.100
and just appreciation.

04:30:09.100 --> 04:30:10.460
All the experiences in life.

04:30:10.460 --> 04:30:12.460
Yeah, just of being alive,

04:30:12.460 --> 04:30:15.100
of just living in this sacred world

04:30:15.100 --> 04:30:16.340
where we have all these things

04:30:16.340 --> 04:30:19.540
that we don't even pay any attention to.

04:30:19.540 --> 04:30:23.100
My friend, A.J. Jacobs, he had a wonderful book

04:30:23.100 --> 04:30:27.020
that I used the spirit of it in the ceremonies,

04:30:27.020 --> 04:30:31.060
not exactly, but he was in a restaurant in New York,

04:30:31.060 --> 04:30:33.260
a coffee shop, and his child said,

04:30:33.260 --> 04:30:35.020
hey, where does the coffee come from?

04:30:35.020 --> 04:30:38.820
And he's like a wonderful big thinker.

04:30:38.820 --> 04:30:41.060
And he started really answering that question.

04:30:41.060 --> 04:30:42.660
Well, here's where the beans come from,

04:30:42.660 --> 04:30:44.300
but how did the beans get here,

04:30:44.300 --> 04:30:46.260
and who painted the yellow line on the street

04:30:46.260 --> 04:30:50.100
so the truck didn't crash, and who made the cup?

04:30:50.100 --> 04:30:53.100
And he spent a year making a full spreadsheet

04:30:53.100 --> 04:30:56.420
of all of the people who in one way or another

04:30:56.420 --> 04:31:00.260
played some role in that one cup of coffee.

04:31:00.260 --> 04:31:03.460
And he traveled all around the world thanking them.

04:31:03.460 --> 04:31:06.860
Like, thank you for painting the yellow line on the road.

04:31:06.900 --> 04:31:08.780
And so for me with the cacao,

04:31:08.780 --> 04:31:11.500
part of when I do these ceremonies is just to say,

04:31:11.500 --> 04:31:14.220
like, you're drinking this cacao,

04:31:14.220 --> 04:31:16.340
but there's a person who planted the seed,

04:31:16.340 --> 04:31:19.020
there's a person who watered the plant, there's a person.

04:31:19.020 --> 04:31:22.420
And I just think that level of awareness,

04:31:22.420 --> 04:31:24.260
and it's true with anything,

04:31:24.260 --> 04:31:27.940
like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog.

04:31:27.940 --> 04:31:28.860
Somebody made that.

04:31:28.860 --> 04:31:30.220
I love it, it's great.

04:31:30.220 --> 04:31:32.140
But if we just said, all right,

04:31:32.140 --> 04:31:35.180
where does this stuffed hedgehog come from?

04:31:35.180 --> 04:31:38.940
We would have a full story of globalization,

04:31:38.940 --> 04:31:42.060
of the interconnection of people all around the world

04:31:42.060 --> 04:31:45.100
doing all sorts of things of human imagination.

04:31:45.100 --> 04:31:47.340
It's beyond our capacity in our daily,

04:31:47.340 --> 04:31:49.540
we'd go insane if every day,

04:31:49.540 --> 04:31:51.220
like we're speaking into a microphone,

04:31:51.220 --> 04:31:54.500
well, what are the hundreds of years of technology

04:31:54.500 --> 04:31:56.020
that make this possible?

04:31:56.020 --> 04:31:59.100
But if just once in a while we just focus on one thing

04:31:59.100 --> 04:32:01.900
and say, this thing is sacred.

04:32:01.900 --> 04:32:04.060
And because I'm recognizing that

04:32:04.100 --> 04:32:07.020
and I'm having an appreciation for the world around me,

04:32:07.020 --> 04:32:10.420
it just kind of makes my life feel more sacred.

04:32:10.420 --> 04:32:12.460
It makes me recognize my connection to others.

04:32:12.460 --> 04:32:14.700
So that's the gist of it.

04:32:14.700 --> 04:32:16.900
Yeah, it's funny, I often look at

04:32:19.660 --> 04:32:22.740
things in this world in moments and just, I mean,

04:32:22.740 --> 04:32:27.660
awe of the full

04:32:29.980 --> 04:32:32.660
universe that brought that to be.

04:32:33.500 --> 04:32:35.660
In a similar way as you're saying,

04:32:35.660 --> 04:32:38.980
but I don't as often think about exactly what you're saying,

04:32:38.980 --> 04:32:40.700
which is the number of people behind

04:32:40.700 --> 04:32:43.100
every little thing we get to enjoy.

04:32:43.100 --> 04:32:45.700
I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone,

04:32:46.820 --> 04:32:49.660
directly thousands of people involved.

04:32:49.660 --> 04:32:50.500
Millions.

04:32:50.500 --> 04:32:52.140
And then indirectly it's millions.

04:32:55.900 --> 04:32:59.300
And they're all, like this microphone,

04:32:59.300 --> 04:33:02.020
that there's artists essentially,

04:33:02.020 --> 04:33:04.140
people who made it, their life's work,

04:33:04.140 --> 04:33:07.460
all the cross, like from the factories to the manufacturer,

04:33:07.460 --> 04:33:11.660
there's families that the production of this microphone

04:33:11.660 --> 04:33:14.900
and this hedgehog are fed because of the skill

04:33:14.900 --> 04:33:18.820
of this human that helped contribute to that development.

04:33:18.820 --> 04:33:20.100
Yeah, it's...

04:33:20.100 --> 04:33:22.460
And like Isaac Newton and John von Neumann

04:33:22.460 --> 04:33:24.460
are in this microphone.

04:33:24.460 --> 04:33:26.220
They're standing on the shoulders of giants

04:33:26.220 --> 04:33:28.620
and we're standing on their shoulders.

04:33:28.620 --> 04:33:31.420
And somebody will be standing on ours.

04:33:32.020 --> 04:33:37.020
You mentioned one shared world.

04:33:38.700 --> 04:33:39.980
What is it?

04:33:39.980 --> 04:33:41.020
Well, thanks for asking.

04:33:41.020 --> 04:33:42.980
And by the way, what I will say is the people

04:33:42.980 --> 04:33:46.220
who are listening, this is so incredible.

04:33:46.220 --> 04:33:49.500
And I'm so thrilled to have this kind of long conversation.

04:33:49.500 --> 04:33:54.260
A little person who's listening past the five hour mark.

04:33:54.260 --> 04:33:55.180
Thanks, mom.

04:33:56.820 --> 04:33:58.180
I salute you.

04:33:58.180 --> 04:34:00.780
Somebody was like sleeping for the first four hours

04:34:00.780 --> 04:34:01.740
and just woke up.

04:34:02.460 --> 04:34:03.300
And now's the good stuff.

04:34:03.300 --> 04:34:04.140
I've been saving it.

04:34:05.220 --> 04:34:09.620
And I have to say that so much of our lives

04:34:09.620 --> 04:34:11.260
is forced into these short bursts

04:34:11.260 --> 04:34:14.180
that I'm just so appreciative to have the chance

04:34:14.180 --> 04:34:15.740
to have this conversation.

04:34:15.740 --> 04:34:16.580
So thank you for that.

04:34:16.580 --> 04:34:18.700
Some people would say five hours is short, so.

04:34:18.700 --> 04:34:20.740
You know, let's go.

04:34:20.740 --> 04:34:25.740
And yeah, that's what my girlfriend says.

04:34:26.220 --> 04:34:29.260
If I was like captured and tortured

04:34:29.260 --> 04:34:30.820
and they were gonna interrogate me,

04:34:30.820 --> 04:34:32.740
it's like at the end, they'd say, all right.

04:34:32.740 --> 04:34:35.500
No, we're sick of this guy, we quit.

04:34:35.500 --> 04:34:36.340
Let him go.

04:34:36.340 --> 04:34:37.300
I love it.

04:34:37.300 --> 04:34:39.940
So background on one shared world.

04:34:39.940 --> 04:34:43.140
I mentioned I'm on faculty for Singularity University.

04:34:43.140 --> 04:34:45.300
In the earliest days of the pandemic,

04:34:45.300 --> 04:34:48.580
I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools

04:34:48.580 --> 04:34:50.340
of the genetics and biotech revolutions

04:34:50.340 --> 04:34:52.820
were a match for the outbreak.

04:34:52.820 --> 04:34:55.100
And my view was then as now

04:34:55.100 --> 04:34:57.460
that the answer to that question is yes.

04:34:57.460 --> 04:34:58.940
But I woke up that morning

04:34:58.980 --> 04:35:02.740
and I felt that that wasn't the most important talk

04:35:02.740 --> 04:35:03.580
that I could give.

04:35:03.580 --> 04:35:06.100
There was something else that was more pressing for me.

04:35:06.100 --> 04:35:08.260
And that was the realization,

04:35:08.260 --> 04:35:09.100
they were asking the question,

04:35:09.100 --> 04:35:12.060
well, why weren't we prepared for this pandemic?

04:35:12.060 --> 04:35:14.900
Because we could have been, we weren't.

04:35:14.900 --> 04:35:16.940
And why can't, and because of that,

04:35:16.940 --> 04:35:21.780
why can't we respond adequately to this outbreak?

04:35:22.980 --> 04:35:25.020
And then there was the thing, well, if we,

04:35:25.020 --> 04:35:27.700
even if we respond somehow miraculously,

04:35:27.740 --> 04:35:29.860
to overcome this pandemic,

04:35:29.860 --> 04:35:34.580
it's a pure victory if we don't prepare ourselves

04:35:34.580 --> 04:35:37.500
to respond to the broader category of pandemics,

04:35:37.500 --> 04:35:40.620
particularly as we enter the age of synthetic biology.

04:35:40.620 --> 04:35:44.820
But if somehow miraculously we solve that problem,

04:35:44.820 --> 04:35:47.300
but we don't solve the problem of climate change,

04:35:47.300 --> 04:35:48.140
well, kind of who cares?

04:35:48.140 --> 04:35:49.140
We didn't have a pandemic,

04:35:49.140 --> 04:35:51.420
but we wiped everybody out from climate change.

04:35:51.420 --> 04:35:54.940
And let's just say, you get where this is going,

04:35:54.980 --> 04:35:58.620
that we organize ourselves and we solve climate change.

04:35:58.620 --> 04:36:00.580
And then we have a nuclear war

04:36:00.580 --> 04:36:03.020
because everybody's, particularly China now,

04:36:03.020 --> 04:36:05.140
but US, former Soviet Union,

04:36:05.140 --> 04:36:07.060
are building all these nuclear weapons.

04:36:07.060 --> 04:36:09.020
Who cares that we solve climate change

04:36:09.020 --> 04:36:10.420
because we're all gone anyway?

04:36:10.420 --> 04:36:14.900
And the meta category bringing all of those things together

04:36:14.900 --> 04:36:19.700
was this mismatch between the increasingly global

04:36:19.700 --> 04:36:24.020
and shared nature of the biggest challenges that we face

04:36:24.020 --> 04:36:29.020
and our inability to solve that entire category of problems.

04:36:29.420 --> 04:36:32.220
And there's a historical issue,

04:36:32.220 --> 04:36:36.500
which is that prior to the 30 years war in the 17th century,

04:36:36.500 --> 04:36:38.940
we had all these different kinds of sovereignty

04:36:38.940 --> 04:36:41.700
and religious and different kinds of

04:36:41.700 --> 04:36:44.100
organizational principles and everybody got in this war.

04:36:44.100 --> 04:36:48.060
And in the series of treaties that together

04:36:48.060 --> 04:36:50.460
are called the Peace of Westphalia,

04:36:50.460 --> 04:36:53.020
the framework for the modern,

04:36:53.020 --> 04:36:55.820
what we now understand is the modern nation state was laid.

04:36:55.820 --> 04:36:58.580
And then through colonialism and other means,

04:36:58.580 --> 04:37:03.220
that idea of a state is what it is today,

04:37:03.220 --> 04:37:06.020
spread throughout the world.

04:37:06.020 --> 04:37:09.620
Then through particularly the late 19th

04:37:09.620 --> 04:37:11.020
and early 20th century,

04:37:11.020 --> 04:37:14.180
we realized how unstable that system was

04:37:14.180 --> 04:37:16.020
because you always had these jockeying,

04:37:16.020 --> 04:37:17.580
jockeying between sovereign states

04:37:17.580 --> 04:37:19.140
and some were rising and some were falling

04:37:19.140 --> 04:37:21.060
and you ended up in war.

04:37:21.060 --> 04:37:23.420
And that was the genius of the generations

04:37:23.420 --> 04:37:25.940
who came together in 1945 in San Francisco

04:37:25.940 --> 04:37:28.260
and the planning had even started before then,

04:37:28.260 --> 04:37:30.940
who said, well, we can't just have that world.

04:37:30.940 --> 04:37:32.620
We need to have an overlay.

04:37:32.620 --> 04:37:34.940
And we talked about the UN and the WHO

04:37:34.940 --> 04:37:39.820
of systems which transcend our national sovereignty.

04:37:39.820 --> 04:37:41.380
They don't get rid of them,

04:37:41.380 --> 04:37:42.980
but they transcend them so we can solve

04:37:42.980 --> 04:37:44.660
this category of problems.

04:37:44.660 --> 04:37:47.740
But we're now reaching a point where our reach as humans,

04:37:47.740 --> 04:37:51.020
even individually, but collectively is so great

04:37:51.020 --> 04:37:52.540
that there's a mismatch between, as I said,

04:37:52.540 --> 04:37:55.580
the nature of the problems and the ability

04:37:55.580 --> 04:37:58.100
to solve those problems.

04:37:58.100 --> 04:38:01.420
And unless we can address that broader

04:38:01.420 --> 04:38:03.820
global collective action problem,

04:38:03.820 --> 04:38:05.340
we're going to extinct ourselves.

04:38:05.340 --> 04:38:08.180
And we see these different, what I call, verticals,

04:38:08.180 --> 04:38:11.580
whether it's climate change or trying to prevent

04:38:11.580 --> 04:38:14.540
nuclear weapons proliferation or anything else,

04:38:14.540 --> 04:38:16.260
but none of those can succeed.

04:38:16.260 --> 04:38:18.940
And frankly, it doesn't even matter if one succeeds

04:38:18.940 --> 04:38:21.660
because all of them have the potential

04:38:21.660 --> 04:38:24.420
to lead to extinction level events.

04:38:25.340 --> 04:38:30.020
So anyways, I gave that talk and that talk went viral.

04:38:30.020 --> 04:38:32.940
I stayed up all night the next night and I drafted,

04:38:32.940 --> 04:38:35.140
I think it was like an insanity,

04:38:35.140 --> 04:38:36.860
but I think a lot of us were manic

04:38:36.860 --> 04:38:38.900
in those early days of the pandemics

04:38:38.900 --> 04:38:40.180
and wanting to do something.

04:38:40.180 --> 04:38:42.260
And so I stayed up all night and I drafted

04:38:42.260 --> 04:38:45.460
what I called a declaration of global interdependence.

04:38:45.460 --> 04:38:48.620
And I posted that on my website, my JamieMetzel.com.

04:38:48.620 --> 04:38:49.580
It's still there.

04:38:49.580 --> 04:38:51.740
And that went viral.

04:38:51.740 --> 04:38:54.100
And so then I called a meeting just on the people

04:38:54.100 --> 04:38:56.260
on my personal email list.

04:38:56.260 --> 04:38:59.580
And so we had people from 25 countries.

04:38:59.580 --> 04:39:00.860
There were all of these people

04:39:00.860 --> 04:39:02.460
who were having the same thing.

04:39:02.460 --> 04:39:03.780
There's something wrong in the world

04:39:03.780 --> 04:39:07.660
and they wanted to be part of a process of fixing it.

04:39:07.660 --> 04:39:10.460
And so it was a crazy 35 days

04:39:10.460 --> 04:39:12.900
where we broke into eight different working groups.

04:39:12.900 --> 04:39:16.020
We had an amazing team that helped redraft

04:39:16.060 --> 04:39:18.740
what became the declaration of interdependence,

04:39:18.740 --> 04:39:21.460
which is now in 20 languages.

04:39:21.460 --> 04:39:23.380
We laid out a work plan.

04:39:23.380 --> 04:39:27.020
We founded this organization called One Shared World.

04:39:27.020 --> 04:39:28.940
The URL is oneshared.world.

04:39:28.940 --> 04:39:31.500
And it's just been this incredible journey.

04:39:31.500 --> 04:39:33.620
We now have people who are participating in one way

04:39:33.620 --> 04:39:36.940
or another from 120 different countries.

04:39:36.940 --> 04:39:40.340
We have our public events exploring these issues,

04:39:40.340 --> 04:39:43.020
get millions of viewers.

04:39:43.020 --> 04:39:46.660
We have world leaders who are participating.

04:39:46.660 --> 04:39:51.260
So the vision is to work on some of these big problems,

04:39:51.260 --> 04:39:53.500
arbitrary number of problems that present themselves

04:39:53.500 --> 04:39:56.420
in the world that face all of human civilization

04:39:56.420 --> 04:39:58.100
and to be able to work together.

04:39:58.100 --> 04:40:02.180
Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem,

04:40:02.180 --> 04:40:04.580
which is the global collective action problem.

04:40:04.580 --> 04:40:09.580
And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals,

04:40:10.020 --> 04:40:11.260
on the manifestations

04:40:11.260 --> 04:40:13.660
of the global collective action problem,

04:40:13.660 --> 04:40:16.460
there'll be an infinite number of those things.

04:40:16.460 --> 04:40:18.860
So while we work on those things

04:40:18.860 --> 04:40:22.700
like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things,

04:40:22.700 --> 04:40:25.220
we also have to ask the bigger questions

04:40:25.220 --> 04:40:27.380
of why can't we solve this category of problems.

04:40:27.380 --> 04:40:30.140
And the idea is, at least from my observation,

04:40:30.140 --> 04:40:35.020
is that whenever big decisions are being made,

04:40:35.020 --> 04:40:37.660
our national leaders and corporate leaders

04:40:37.660 --> 04:40:40.500
are doing exactly what we've hired them to do.

04:40:40.500 --> 04:40:43.620
They're maximizing for national interest,

04:40:43.620 --> 04:40:45.060
even, or corporate interests,

04:40:45.060 --> 04:40:48.500
even at the expense of everybody.

04:40:48.500 --> 04:40:50.460
And so it's not that we wanna get rid of states.

04:40:50.460 --> 04:40:52.660
States are essential in our world system.

04:40:52.660 --> 04:40:54.340
It's not we wanna undermine the UN,

04:40:54.340 --> 04:40:57.900
which is also essential, but massively underperforming.

04:40:57.900 --> 04:40:59.300
What we wanna do is to create

04:40:59.300 --> 04:41:01.900
an empowered global constituency

04:41:01.900 --> 04:41:04.860
of people who are demanding that their leaders

04:41:04.860 --> 04:41:08.060
at all levels just do a better job

04:41:08.060 --> 04:41:10.580
of balancing broader and narrower interests.

04:41:10.580 --> 04:41:11.420
I see.

04:41:11.420 --> 04:41:13.500
So this is more like a,

04:41:14.780 --> 04:41:17.820
make it more symmetric in terms of power.

04:41:17.820 --> 04:41:22.820
It's holding accountable the nations, the leaders.

04:41:23.980 --> 04:41:26.940
The problem is nations are powerful.

04:41:26.940 --> 04:41:29.260
We talked about China quite a bit.

04:41:29.260 --> 04:41:33.980
How do you have an organizations of citizens of earth

04:41:33.980 --> 04:41:36.900
that can solve this collective problem

04:41:36.900 --> 04:41:39.180
that holds China accountable?

04:41:39.180 --> 04:41:42.740
It's difficult, because UN, you could say a lot of things,

04:41:42.740 --> 04:41:45.540
but to call it effective is hard.

04:41:45.540 --> 04:41:50.300
You know, the internet almost is a kind of representation

04:41:50.300 --> 04:41:55.300
of a collective force that holds nations accountable.

04:41:57.260 --> 04:41:58.820
Not to give Twitter too much credit,

04:41:58.820 --> 04:42:01.420
but social networks, broadly speaking.

04:42:03.380 --> 04:42:05.260
So you have hope that this is possible

04:42:05.300 --> 04:42:10.300
to build such collections of humans that resist China.

04:42:10.740 --> 04:42:12.780
Not necessarily resist China,

04:42:12.780 --> 04:42:16.940
but human, I mean, our cultures change over time.

04:42:16.940 --> 04:42:20.100
I mean, the idea of the modern nation state

04:42:20.100 --> 04:42:22.540
would not have made sense to people

04:42:22.540 --> 04:42:24.580
in the 13th or 14th century.

04:42:24.580 --> 04:42:28.300
The idea that became the United Nations,

04:42:28.300 --> 04:42:30.220
I mean, it had its earliest days

04:42:30.220 --> 04:42:33.620
in the philosophies of Kant.

04:42:33.620 --> 04:42:38.620
It took a long time for these ideas to be realized.

04:42:39.900 --> 04:42:44.540
And so the idea, and we're far from successful.

04:42:44.540 --> 04:42:47.020
We've had little minor successes,

04:42:47.020 --> 04:42:47.900
which we're very proud of.

04:42:47.900 --> 04:42:51.260
We got the G20 leaders to incorporate the language

04:42:51.260 --> 04:42:53.620
that we provided on addressing the needs

04:42:53.620 --> 04:42:56.220
of the world's most vulnerable populations

04:42:56.220 --> 04:43:01.220
into the final summit communique from the G20 summit in Riyadh.

04:43:01.740 --> 04:43:03.700
This year, we're just on the verge

04:43:03.700 --> 04:43:07.220
of having our language pat on the same issue,

04:43:07.220 --> 04:43:10.100
ensuring everyone on earth has access to safe water,

04:43:10.100 --> 04:43:11.500
basic sanitation and hygiene,

04:43:11.500 --> 04:43:14.580
and essential pandemic protection by 2030,

04:43:14.580 --> 04:43:17.420
passed as part of a resolution

04:43:17.420 --> 04:43:19.060
in the United Nations General Assembly.

04:43:19.060 --> 04:43:20.940
And it's, we're primarily,

04:43:20.940 --> 04:43:23.540
I mean, it's young people all around the world.

04:43:23.540 --> 04:43:26.060
And when I told them that in the beginning of this year,

04:43:26.060 --> 04:43:28.980
this is our goal, we're gonna get the UN General Assembly

04:43:29.020 --> 04:43:32.340
to pass a resolution with our language in it.

04:43:32.340 --> 04:43:35.060
I mean, first, I think they all thought it was insane,

04:43:35.060 --> 04:43:38.220
but they were too young and inexperienced

04:43:38.220 --> 04:43:39.900
to know how insane it was.

04:43:39.900 --> 04:43:42.180
But now these young people are just so excited

04:43:42.180 --> 04:43:43.780
that it's actually happening.

04:43:43.780 --> 04:43:48.780
So what we're trying to do is really to create a movement,

04:43:48.900 --> 04:43:51.620
which we don't feel that we need to do from scratch,

04:43:51.620 --> 04:43:53.140
because there are a lot of movements.

04:43:53.140 --> 04:43:56.700
Like right now, we just had the Glasgow G20,

04:43:56.740 --> 04:44:00.420
I mean, I'm sorry, the Glasgow climate change, Cup 26.

04:44:00.420 --> 04:44:03.100
And then Greta Thunberg, who has a huge following,

04:44:03.100 --> 04:44:05.860
and who was an amazing young woman.

04:44:05.860 --> 04:44:09.020
But I was kind of disappointed in what she said afterwards.

04:44:09.020 --> 04:44:13.140
It became like a meme on Twitter, which was blah, blah, blah.

04:44:13.140 --> 04:44:15.180
And basically it was like, blah, blah, blah.

04:44:15.180 --> 04:44:17.540
These old people are just screwing around

04:44:17.540 --> 04:44:18.940
and it's a waste of time.

04:44:18.940 --> 04:44:22.380
And definitely the critique is merited.

04:44:22.380 --> 04:44:25.700
But young people have never been more empowered,

04:44:25.700 --> 04:44:29.300
educated, connected than they are now.

04:44:29.300 --> 04:44:34.300
And so we've had a process with One Shared World,

04:44:36.220 --> 04:44:39.660
where we partnered with the Model United Nations,

04:44:39.660 --> 04:44:42.300
the Aga Khan Foundation, the India Sanitation Coalition.

04:44:42.300 --> 04:44:44.500
And what we did is say, all right, we have this goal,

04:44:44.500 --> 04:44:46.980
water, sanitation, hygiene, and pandemic protection

04:44:46.980 --> 04:44:49.340
for everyone on earth by 2030.

04:44:49.340 --> 04:44:52.140
And we had debates and consultations

04:44:52.140 --> 04:44:55.020
using the Model UN framework all around the world

04:44:55.020 --> 04:44:56.900
in multiple languages.

04:44:56.900 --> 04:44:58.500
And we said, come up with a plan

04:44:58.500 --> 04:44:59.660
for how this could be achieved.

04:44:59.660 --> 04:45:02.700
And these brilliant young people in every country,

04:45:02.700 --> 04:45:05.740
not every country, most countries, they all contributed.

04:45:05.740 --> 04:45:06.980
Then we had a plan.

04:45:06.980 --> 04:45:09.020
Then I recruited friends of mine,

04:45:09.020 --> 04:45:11.260
like my friend Hans Karel in Sweden,

04:45:11.260 --> 04:45:14.980
who's the former chief counsel of the whole United Nations,

04:45:14.980 --> 04:45:18.460
and asked him and others to work with these young people

04:45:18.460 --> 04:45:20.860
and the representative to turn that

04:45:20.860 --> 04:45:24.820
into what looks exactly like a UN resolution.

04:45:24.820 --> 04:45:28.420
It's just written by a bunch of kids all around the world.

04:45:28.420 --> 04:45:31.700
We then sent that to every permanent representative,

04:45:31.700 --> 04:45:34.300
every government representative at the UN.

04:45:34.300 --> 04:45:36.220
And that was why working with the German

04:45:36.220 --> 04:45:37.220
and Spanish governments,

04:45:37.220 --> 04:45:40.140
why the language essentialized from that document

04:45:40.140 --> 04:45:41.980
is about to pass the UN.

04:45:41.980 --> 04:45:43.540
And it doesn't mean that just passing

04:45:43.540 --> 04:45:46.620
a UN General Assembly resolution changes anything,

04:45:46.620 --> 04:45:49.940
but we think that there's a model of engaging people,

04:45:49.940 --> 04:45:51.300
just like you're talking about with these people

04:45:51.300 --> 04:45:55.460
who are outside of the traditional power structures

04:45:55.460 --> 04:45:58.020
and who want to have a voice.

04:45:58.020 --> 04:46:00.100
But I think we need to give a little bit of structure

04:46:00.100 --> 04:46:03.940
because just going, I'm a big fan of global citizen,

04:46:03.940 --> 04:46:06.860
but just going to a global citizen concert

04:46:06.860 --> 04:46:09.100
and waving your iPhone back and forth

04:46:09.100 --> 04:46:11.740
and tweeting about it isn't enough

04:46:11.740 --> 04:46:14.380
to drive the kind of change that's required.

04:46:14.380 --> 04:46:17.980
We need to come together, even in non-traditional ways,

04:46:17.980 --> 04:46:20.100
and articulate the change we want

04:46:20.100 --> 04:46:22.980
and build popular movements to make that happen.

04:46:22.980 --> 04:46:26.580
And popular means scale and then movements at scale

04:46:26.580 --> 04:46:29.900
that actually, like we're at the individual level,

04:46:29.900 --> 04:46:33.460
do something and that's then magnified with the scale

04:46:33.460 --> 04:46:35.340
to actually have a significant impact.

04:46:35.340 --> 04:46:39.540
I mean, at its best, you hear a lot of folks

04:46:39.540 --> 04:46:44.540
talk about the various cryptocurrencies as possibly helping.

04:46:44.540 --> 04:46:47.020
You have young people get involved

04:46:47.020 --> 04:46:49.420
in challenging the power structures

04:46:49.420 --> 04:46:51.220
by challenging the monetary system.

04:46:51.220 --> 04:46:56.220
And there's, you know, some of it is number go up,

04:46:56.580 --> 04:46:58.620
people get excited when they're,

04:46:58.620 --> 04:47:00.980
they can make a little bit of money.

04:47:00.980 --> 04:47:04.860
But that's actually almost like an entry point

04:47:04.860 --> 04:47:07.700
because then you almost feel empowered.

04:47:07.700 --> 04:47:10.460
And because of that, you start to think about

04:47:10.460 --> 04:47:12.020
some of these philosophical ideas

04:47:12.020 --> 04:47:15.260
that I, as a young person, have the power

04:47:15.260 --> 04:47:16.780
to change the world.

04:47:16.820 --> 04:47:20.820
All of these senior folks in the position of power,

04:47:20.820 --> 04:47:23.100
they were like, first of all,

04:47:23.100 --> 04:47:26.300
they were once young and powerless like me.

04:47:26.300 --> 04:47:29.500
And I could be part of the next generation

04:47:29.500 --> 04:47:30.340
that makes a change.

04:47:30.340 --> 04:47:32.620
All the things I see that are wrong with the world,

04:47:32.620 --> 04:47:34.700
I can make it better.

04:47:34.700 --> 04:47:39.700
And it's very true that the overly powerful nations

04:47:40.020 --> 04:47:43.140
of the world could be a relic of the past.

04:47:43.420 --> 04:47:47.980
That could be a 20th century and before idea

04:47:47.980 --> 04:47:52.620
that was tried to create a lot of benefit.

04:47:52.620 --> 04:47:56.620
But we also saw the problems with that kind of world,

04:47:56.620 --> 04:47:58.100
extreme nationalism.

04:47:59.020 --> 04:48:02.700
We see the benefits and the problems of the Cold War,

04:48:02.700 --> 04:48:04.900
arguably Cold War got us to the moon.

04:48:06.500 --> 04:48:09.220
But there could be a lot of other different mechanisms

04:48:09.220 --> 04:48:11.300
that inspired competition,

04:48:11.300 --> 04:48:13.900
especially friendly competition between nations

04:48:13.900 --> 04:48:16.420
versus adversarial competition that resulted

04:48:16.420 --> 04:48:18.180
in the response to COVID, for example,

04:48:18.180 --> 04:48:20.580
with China, the United States and Russia

04:48:20.580 --> 04:48:23.740
and the secrecy, the censorship.

04:48:25.940 --> 04:48:27.740
Yeah, and all the things that are basically

04:48:27.740 --> 04:48:31.460
against the spirit of science

04:48:31.460 --> 04:48:34.180
and resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars

04:48:34.180 --> 04:48:37.700
and the cost of countless lives.

04:48:37.700 --> 04:48:41.620
What gives you hope about the future, Jamie?

04:48:41.620 --> 04:48:45.100
Well, one of the things you mentioned cryptocurrency

04:48:45.100 --> 04:48:47.980
and then as you know better than most,

04:48:47.980 --> 04:48:50.380
there's cryptocurrency and then underneath

04:48:50.380 --> 04:48:52.300
the cryptocurrency, there's the blockchain

04:48:52.300 --> 04:48:54.180
and the distributed ledger.

04:48:54.180 --> 04:48:55.900
And then like we talked about,

04:48:55.900 --> 04:48:57.780
there are all these young people who are able

04:48:57.780 --> 04:49:02.780
to connect with each other, to organize in new ways.

04:49:03.300 --> 04:49:07.180
And I work with these young people every single day

04:49:07.220 --> 04:49:11.260
through one shared world primarily, but also other things.

04:49:11.260 --> 04:49:13.220
And there's so much optimism.

04:49:13.220 --> 04:49:18.220
There's so much hope that I just have a lot of faith

04:49:18.980 --> 04:49:20.700
that we're gonna figure something out.

04:49:20.700 --> 04:49:24.020
I'm an optimist by nature.

04:49:24.020 --> 04:49:26.740
And that doesn't mean that we need to be blind

04:49:26.740 --> 04:49:27.580
to the dangers.

04:49:27.580 --> 04:49:30.300
There are very, very real dangers,

04:49:30.300 --> 04:49:34.620
but just given half the chance, people wanna be good.

04:49:34.620 --> 04:49:37.060
People want to do the right thing.

04:49:37.940 --> 04:49:39.940
I do believe that there's a role,

04:49:41.140 --> 04:49:44.220
there's a role for the at least near term for governments,

04:49:44.220 --> 04:49:46.700
but there's always a role for leadership.

04:49:46.700 --> 04:49:50.380
And I'm, I guess, like a Gramscian in the sense

04:49:50.380 --> 04:49:53.860
that I think that we need to create frameworks

04:49:53.860 --> 04:49:58.580
and structures that allow leaders to emerge.

04:49:58.580 --> 04:50:01.700
And we need to build norms so that the leaders

04:50:01.700 --> 04:50:05.820
who emerge are leaders who call on us,

04:50:05.820 --> 04:50:09.180
inspire our best instincts and not drive us

04:50:09.180 --> 04:50:10.820
toward our worst.

04:50:10.820 --> 04:50:13.420
But I really see a lot of hope.

04:50:13.420 --> 04:50:18.420
And when you say this all the time in your podcast,

04:50:19.420 --> 04:50:21.740
and you may even be more optimistic to me

04:50:21.740 --> 04:50:23.460
because you look at the darkest moments

04:50:23.460 --> 04:50:26.100
of human history and see hope,

04:50:26.100 --> 04:50:29.700
but we're kind of a crazy, wonderful species.

04:50:29.700 --> 04:50:31.860
I mean, yes, we figured out ways to slaughter

04:50:31.860 --> 04:50:34.340
each other at scale, but we've come up

04:50:34.340 --> 04:50:36.980
with these wonderful philosophies about love

04:50:36.980 --> 04:50:38.540
and all of those things.

04:50:38.540 --> 04:50:41.940
And yeah, maybe the bonobos have some love

04:50:41.940 --> 04:50:43.900
in their cultures, but this,

04:50:43.900 --> 04:50:46.140
we're kind of a wonderful magical species.

04:50:46.140 --> 04:50:49.940
And if we just can create enough of an infrastructure,

04:50:49.940 --> 04:50:52.100
it doesn't need to be and shouldn't be controlling

04:50:52.100 --> 04:50:54.100
just enough of an infrastructure

04:50:54.100 --> 04:50:56.500
so that people are stakeholders,

04:50:56.500 --> 04:50:58.900
feel like they're stakeholders in contributing

04:50:58.900 --> 04:51:00.340
to a positive story.

04:51:00.380 --> 04:51:04.540
I just really feel that the sky is the limit.

04:51:04.540 --> 04:51:06.860
So if there's somebody who is young right now,

04:51:06.860 --> 04:51:08.780
somebody in high school, somebody in college

04:51:08.780 --> 04:51:12.420
listening to you, you've done a lot of incredible things.

04:51:12.420 --> 04:51:17.420
You're respected by a lot of the elites.

04:51:17.660 --> 04:51:21.180
You're respected by the people.

04:51:21.180 --> 04:51:26.180
So you're both able to sort of speak to all groups,

04:51:27.140 --> 04:51:30.180
walk through the fire like you mentioned

04:51:30.980 --> 04:51:31.820
with this lab leak.

04:51:32.740 --> 04:51:37.020
What advice would you give to young kids today

04:51:37.020 --> 04:51:38.820
that are inspired by your story?

04:51:38.820 --> 04:51:39.940
Well, thank you.

04:51:39.940 --> 04:51:42.220
I mean, I think there's one, there's lots of,

04:51:42.220 --> 04:51:44.580
I'm honored if anybody is inspired,

04:51:46.140 --> 04:51:49.780
but it's the same thing as I said with the science

04:51:49.780 --> 04:51:51.500
that it's all about values.

04:51:51.500 --> 04:51:55.420
The core of everything is knowing who you are.

04:51:55.420 --> 04:51:58.020
And so yes, I mean, there's the broader thing

04:51:58.020 --> 04:52:02.740
of follow your passions, a creative mind,

04:52:02.740 --> 04:52:05.300
and an inquisitive mind is the core of everything

04:52:05.300 --> 04:52:08.060
because the knowledge base is constantly sharing,

04:52:08.060 --> 04:52:10.540
so learning how to learn.

04:52:10.540 --> 04:52:14.460
But at the core of everything is investing

04:52:14.460 --> 04:52:17.500
in knowing who you are and what you stand for.

04:52:17.500 --> 04:52:22.140
Because that's the way, that's the path

04:52:22.140 --> 04:52:25.300
to leading a meaningful life, to contributing,

04:52:25.300 --> 04:52:29.660
to not feeling alienated from your life as you get older.

04:52:29.660 --> 04:52:34.660
And just like you live, it's an ongoing process

04:52:34.980 --> 04:52:38.740
and we all make mistakes and we all kind of travel down

04:52:38.740 --> 04:52:42.300
wrong paths and just have some love for yourself

04:52:42.300 --> 04:52:44.340
and recognize that just at every,

04:52:44.340 --> 04:52:46.500
like I was saying with the Iron Man,

04:52:46.500 --> 04:52:50.300
just when you think there's no possibility

04:52:50.300 --> 04:52:54.580
that you can go on, there's a 100% possibility

04:52:54.580 --> 04:52:55.460
that you can go on.

04:52:55.460 --> 04:52:58.100
And just when you think that nothing better

04:52:58.100 --> 04:53:02.060
will happen to you, there's a 100% chance

04:53:02.060 --> 04:53:03.660
that something better will happen to you.

04:53:03.660 --> 04:53:05.700
You just gotta keep going.

04:53:05.700 --> 04:53:08.780
Jamie, I've been a fan of yours.

04:53:08.780 --> 04:53:11.980
I've I think first heard you on Joe Rogan experience,

04:53:11.980 --> 04:53:13.900
but I've been following your work,

04:53:13.900 --> 04:53:18.620
your bold fearless work with speaking about the lab leak

04:53:18.620 --> 04:53:21.620
and everything you represent from your brilliance

04:53:21.660 --> 04:53:26.180
to your kindness and the fact that you spend your valuable

04:53:26.180 --> 04:53:30.380
time with me today and now I officially made you

04:53:30.380 --> 04:53:34.220
miss your flight and the fact that you said that

04:53:34.220 --> 04:53:35.780
whether you were being nice or not,

04:53:35.780 --> 04:53:38.300
I don't know that you will be okay with that

04:53:38.300 --> 04:53:40.900
means the world to me and I'm really honored

04:53:40.900 --> 04:53:42.220
that you will spend your time with me today.

04:53:42.220 --> 04:53:45.020
Well, really it's been such a great pleasure

04:53:45.020 --> 04:53:48.140
and thank you for creating a forum

04:53:48.140 --> 04:53:51.060
to have these kinds of long conversations.

04:53:51.060 --> 04:53:53.940
So I've really enjoyed it and thank you.

04:53:53.940 --> 04:53:58.380
And if anybody has now listened for,

04:53:58.380 --> 04:53:59.980
what's it been, five and a half hours?

04:53:59.980 --> 04:54:00.820
Yep.

04:54:00.820 --> 04:54:02.620
Thank you for listening.

04:54:02.620 --> 04:54:04.900
Five hour club, represent.

04:54:06.420 --> 04:54:07.260
Thank you, Jamie.

04:54:07.260 --> 04:54:08.100
Thanks, Lex.

04:54:09.060 --> 04:54:10.620
Thanks for listening to this conversation

04:54:10.620 --> 04:54:11.900
with Jamie Metzl.

04:54:11.900 --> 04:54:14.420

04:54:14.420 --> 04:54:16.100
in the description.

04:54:16.100 --> 04:54:19.540
And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman

04:54:19.580 --> 04:54:21.620
about science and religion,

04:54:21.620 --> 04:54:24.860
which I think also applies to science and geopolitics

04:54:24.860 --> 04:54:27.300
because I believe scientists have the responsibility

04:54:27.300 --> 04:54:29.220
to think broadly about the world

04:54:29.220 --> 04:54:31.620
so that they may understand the bigger impact

04:54:31.620 --> 04:54:33.500
of their inventions.

04:54:33.500 --> 04:54:34.940
The quote goes like this.

04:54:35.860 --> 04:54:37.740
In this age of specialization,

04:54:37.740 --> 04:54:41.460
men who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent

04:54:41.460 --> 04:54:43.020
to discuss another.

04:54:43.020 --> 04:54:45.540
The old problems such as the relation of science

04:54:45.540 --> 04:54:47.780
and religion are still with us

04:54:47.780 --> 04:54:51.700
and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever,

04:54:51.700 --> 04:54:54.100
but they are not often publicly discussed

04:54:54.100 --> 04:54:57.860
because of the limitations of specialization.

04:54:57.860 --> 04:55:00.780
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
