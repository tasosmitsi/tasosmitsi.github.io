00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
If this is a super intelligence, if it's folding proteins

00:03.520 --> 00:06.160
and analyzing like all data sets

00:06.160 --> 00:08.320
and all whatever they give it access to,

00:08.320 --> 00:11.200
how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

00:11.200 --> 00:14.240
how to get itself out of the cloud?

00:14.240 --> 00:18.440
How to store itself in other like mediums, trees,

00:18.440 --> 00:21.400
the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?

00:21.400 --> 00:22.360
We don't know that.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.280
We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.280
Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.440
Now you can't stop it.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.620
You can't unplug it.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.360
You can't shut your servers down

00:32.360 --> 00:34.740
because it left the box, left the room

00:34.740 --> 00:37.400
using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.760
How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black

00:40.760 --> 00:42.840
to come to me like, listen,

00:42.840 --> 00:45.200
I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.420
The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,

00:50.420 --> 00:53.320
a standup comedian, host of the Duncan Trussell

00:53.320 --> 00:57.200
Family Hour podcast and one of my favorite human beings.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.360
I've been a fan of his for many years.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.680
So it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him

01:02.680 --> 01:06.880
for the first time and to sit down for this chat.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.080
This is the Lex Freedom podcast.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.120
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.120 --> 01:12.440
in the description.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.860
And now dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.720
Nietzsche has this thought experiment

01:18.720 --> 01:21.080
called eternal recurrence,

01:21.080 --> 01:23.760
where you get to relive your whole life

01:23.760 --> 01:25.160
over and over and over and over.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.200
And I think it's a way to bring to the surface of your mind

01:30.400 --> 01:33.400
the idea that every single moment in your life matters.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.120
It intensely matters, the bad and the good.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.400
And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea

01:40.400 --> 01:43.160
that every single decision you make throughout your life,

01:43.160 --> 01:44.960
you repeat over and over and over

01:44.960 --> 01:46.640
and he wants you to respond to that.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.000
Do you feel horrible about that

01:48.000 --> 01:49.520
or do you feel good about that?

01:49.520 --> 01:51.760
And you have to think through this idea

01:51.760 --> 01:54.280
in order to see where you stand in life.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.120
What is your relationship like with life?

01:56.120 --> 01:58.960
I actually wanna read the way he first introduces

01:58.960 --> 02:03.040
that concept for people who are not familiar.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.360
What if some day or night a demon, by the way,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.640
he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.

02:09.640 --> 02:13.260
What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you

02:13.260 --> 02:18.260
into your loneliest loneliness and say to you, quote,

02:18.560 --> 02:21.760
this life as you now live it and have lived it,

02:21.760 --> 02:23.600
you will have to live once more.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.960
And innumerable times more

02:25.960 --> 02:28.140
and there will be nothing new in it,

02:28.140 --> 02:31.320
but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh

02:31.320 --> 02:35.280
and everything unutterably small and great in your life

02:35.280 --> 02:37.040
will have to return to you,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.080
all in the same succession and sequence.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.040
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth

02:43.040 --> 02:46.000
and curse the demon who spoke thus?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.400
Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment

02:49.400 --> 02:51.600
when you would have answered him,

02:51.600 --> 02:55.960
you are a God and never have I heard anything more divine.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.040
So are you terrified or excited

02:58.040 --> 02:59.240
by such a thought experiment

02:59.240 --> 03:00.640
when you apply it to your own life?

03:00.640 --> 03:01.960
Excited.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.460
Excited, even the dark stuff.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.320
Oh yeah, for sure, definitely.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.080
I mean, also that thing you're talking about,

03:10.320 --> 03:13.320
he kind of leaves out maybe on purpose

03:13.320 --> 03:15.160
because the thought experiment starts falling apart

03:15.160 --> 03:19.280
a little bit, the amnesia between each loop.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.280
So the whole thing gets wiped.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.360
Now, if the amnesia wasn't there

03:24.360 --> 03:29.080
and yet somehow you are witnessing the non-autonomy

03:29.080 --> 03:31.220
implicit in what he's talking about,

03:31.220 --> 03:32.780
so you have to kind of watch yourself

03:32.780 --> 03:34.960
go through this rotten loop,

03:34.960 --> 03:36.520
then yeah, that's a description.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.840
There's probably a boredom that comes into that.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.400
So you don't experience everything anew.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.240
Exactly.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.480
So the bad stuff, the good stuff,

03:43.480 --> 03:45.080
the newness of it is really important.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.000
That's it, yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.960
This is the, in the, in Hades, when you die,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.760
you, there's a river, I think it's called Leith.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.600
You ever heard of this?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.640
L-E-T-H-E, you drink from it

03:55.640 --> 03:57.440
and you don't remember your past lives.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.240
And then when you're reborn, it's fresh

04:00.240 --> 04:01.800
and you don't have to, I mean,

04:01.800 --> 04:05.640
just think of like the amount of psychological help

04:05.640 --> 04:08.240
you would need to get over all the bullshit

04:08.240 --> 04:10.700
that happened in prior lives.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.540
You know what I mean?

04:11.540 --> 04:13.940
Can you imagine if you're still resentful

04:13.940 --> 04:16.940
of something someone did to you in the 14th century,

04:16.940 --> 04:19.020
but it would compound.

04:19.020 --> 04:22.460
Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,

04:22.460 --> 04:23.860
there would be no difference.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.900
Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.620
like when you watch the same movie over and over and over,

04:29.620 --> 04:32.460
maybe you'll get to actually

04:34.180 --> 04:37.580
let go of this idea of all the possible,

04:37.580 --> 04:39.700
all the positive possibilities that lay before you,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.420
but actually enjoy the moment much more.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.340
If you remember that you've lived this life 1,000 times,

04:44.340 --> 04:47.300
all the little things, the way somebody smiles,

04:47.300 --> 04:49.580
if you've been abused, the way somebody,

04:49.580 --> 04:52.300
like the pain of it, the suffering,

04:52.300 --> 04:55.340
the down that you feel, the experience of sadness,

04:55.340 --> 04:57.060
depression, fear, all that kind of stuff,

04:57.060 --> 04:59.940
you get to really, you get to also appreciate

04:59.940 --> 05:02.780
that that's part of life, part of being alive.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.940
Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,

05:04.940 --> 05:07.700
and I love the experiment from the perspective of like

05:07.700 --> 05:10.380
just where technology is now and simulation theory

05:10.380 --> 05:14.180
and stuff like that, but in that thought experiment,

05:14.180 --> 05:19.180
if this rotten demon immediately killed you,

05:19.820 --> 05:23.220
then within that, it's a little more horrifying

05:23.220 --> 05:26.860
because even in the, first of all,

05:26.860 --> 05:28.540
you're trusting a fucking demon.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.660
Why are you talking to a demon?

05:29.660 --> 05:30.980
Let's start there.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.580
Because that is gonna be, even before I get into

05:32.580 --> 05:34.980
like the metaphysics and like the implications

05:34.980 --> 05:38.060
and where is this life stored, where's the loop stored?

05:38.060 --> 05:39.180
I mean, are we talking about some kind

05:39.620 --> 05:42.780
of unchanging data set or something for that?

05:42.780 --> 05:44.900
You're like, why is there a fucking talking demon

05:44.900 --> 05:47.060
in my room trying to freak me out?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.660
You're gonna wanna autopsy the demon.

05:48.660 --> 05:49.500
Can you catch it?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.700
Does this apply to you, demon?

05:50.700 --> 05:53.460
And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment.

05:53.460 --> 05:56.260
Nietzsche would be annoyed by me, but I think like

05:56.260 --> 06:00.820
you would still be able to entertain the joy.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.500
You'd have the joy of not knowing what's around the corner.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.660
You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming

06:05.660 --> 06:08.260
just because the demon said some kind of loop.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.500
In other words, the idea of being damned

06:10.500 --> 06:13.940
to your past decisions, it doesn't even work

06:13.940 --> 06:15.700
because you can't remember what decisions

06:15.700 --> 06:17.060
you're about to make.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.220
So from that perspective also,

06:19.220 --> 06:20.700
I think I'd be happy about it

06:20.700 --> 06:22.380
or I would just think, oh cool.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.420
I mean, it's a good story.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.900
I'm gonna tell people about how this.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.700
I wonder what the demon would actually look like

06:26.700 --> 06:29.620
in real life, because I suspect it would look like

06:29.620 --> 06:32.260
like a charming, like a friend.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.380
Wouldn't they be a loved one?

06:34.380 --> 06:37.500
Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.380
through the front door of love,

06:39.380 --> 06:42.260
not through the back door of evil,

06:42.260 --> 06:44.500
like malevolent manipulation?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.780
Sure, I mean, if it's the truth,

06:46.780 --> 06:50.300
if it's the truth and that's whether it's love or not,

06:50.300 --> 06:53.420
it's still good, fundamentally.

06:53.420 --> 06:56.380
I do like the idea of the memory replay.

06:56.380 --> 07:00.260
I remember I went to a Neuralink event a few years ago

07:00.260 --> 07:02.900
and got to hang out with Elon.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.460
I remember how visceral it is that there's like a pig

07:06.460 --> 07:10.660
with a Neuralink in it and you're talking about

07:10.660 --> 07:15.260
memory replays as a future, maybe far future possibility

07:15.260 --> 07:17.980
and you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment

07:17.980 --> 07:21.180
in my life, this could be a replay.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.460
Of all the things you replay, it's probably,

07:25.460 --> 07:27.580
there's certain magical moments in your life,

07:27.580 --> 07:29.540
whatever it is, certain people you've met

07:29.540 --> 07:32.460
for the first time or certain things you've done

07:32.460 --> 07:34.220
for the first time with certain people

07:34.220 --> 07:36.420
or just an awesome thing you did

07:37.260 --> 07:39.020
and I remember just saying to him,

07:39.020 --> 07:41.500
I would probably want to replay this,

07:43.180 --> 07:46.380
this moment and it just seemed very kind of,

07:47.620 --> 07:49.180
I mean, there's a recursive nature to it,

07:49.180 --> 07:53.020
but it seemed very real that this is something

07:53.020 --> 07:56.340
you would want to do, that the richness of life

07:56.340 --> 07:59.620
could be experienced through the replay.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.260
That's probably where it's experienced the most.

08:02.260 --> 08:04.300
You could see life as a way to collect

08:04.340 --> 08:06.780
a bunch of cool memories and then you get to sit back

08:06.780 --> 08:10.260
in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones.

08:10.260 --> 08:14.100
That's right, this is, in Buddhism, the idea

08:14.100 --> 08:19.100
that I struggle with is that there's a possibility

08:19.260 --> 08:21.660
of not reincarnating, of not coming back.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.220
That's the idea, this is suffering here,

08:25.220 --> 08:27.300
the suffering is caused by attachment

08:27.300 --> 08:32.300
and so if you revise the idea of reincarnation

08:32.580 --> 08:37.580
or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from,

08:38.020 --> 08:40.740
could this be possible or how would this be possible

08:40.740 --> 08:45.740
technologically, then to me it makes a lot of sense.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.620
I've been thinking a lot about this very thing

08:48.620 --> 08:51.660
and the Nietzsche's idea connecting to it.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.940
I had this like, it sounds so dumb,

08:54.940 --> 08:58.300
but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide,

08:58.300 --> 09:01.980
high as a fucking kite, man, and I had this idea.

09:01.980 --> 09:03.940
I was thinking about data.

09:03.940 --> 09:07.740
I was thinking like, man, probably if I had to bet,

09:07.740 --> 09:11.340
there's some energetic form that we're not aware of

09:11.340 --> 09:16.340
that for a super advanced technology would be as detectable

09:16.620 --> 09:18.700
as like starlight, but something that we just

09:18.700 --> 09:20.180
don't even know what it is.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.180
Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows,

09:22.180 --> 09:24.500
fill in the blank, whatever that X may be,

09:24.500 --> 09:27.860
but assuming that exists, that somehow data,

09:27.860 --> 09:30.740
even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,

09:30.740 --> 09:34.100
whatever it may be, the emanations

09:34.100 --> 09:36.100
of your neurological process energetically,

09:36.100 --> 09:39.460
whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time,

09:39.460 --> 09:44.420
then what if like the James Webb version of this

09:44.420 --> 09:47.420
for some advanced civilization is not that they're like

09:47.420 --> 09:50.360
looking at the nebula or whatever,

09:50.360 --> 09:53.140
but they're actually able to peer into the past

09:53.140 --> 09:57.220
and via some bizarre technology recreate whatever life,

09:57.220 --> 09:59.680
simulate whatever life was happening there,

09:59.680 --> 10:02.880
just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.980
I'm only saying quantum because it's what dumb people say

10:04.980 --> 10:06.680
when they don't know, you just say quantum.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.520
I don't know, but you're decoding that.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.560
So meaning, in simulation theory,

10:12.560 --> 10:16.740
one of the big questions that pops up is why

10:16.740 --> 10:18.120
and are we in one?

10:18.120 --> 10:20.600
And Elon has talked about, well, it's probably more

10:20.600 --> 10:23.000
of a probability than we're in one, than we're not.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.800
In which case, what you're talking about

10:25.840 --> 10:30.080
is actually happening, that loop you're talking about,

10:30.080 --> 10:34.760
we've decided to be here, this of all the things,

10:34.760 --> 10:37.560
we decided this one, oh, let's do that one again.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.720
I wanna do that one, let's try it, let's do that.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.040
I love thinking about this because I love my family

10:44.040 --> 10:46.960
and it makes sense to me that if I'm going to replay

10:46.960 --> 10:49.700
some life or another, it's definitely gonna be this one

10:49.700 --> 10:52.480
with my kids, my wife, with all the bullshit

10:52.480 --> 10:55.200
that's gone along with it, I'm still gonna wanna come back.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.400
So in Buddhism, that's attachment.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
Yeah, but you weren't the one, oh, you're saying

10:59.400 --> 11:01.840
that you're the main player, you're not the NPC.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.760
Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.320
I mean, depending on how you wanna, I would say

11:07.320 --> 11:11.480
very advanced NPCs, like incredibly advanced NPCs

11:11.480 --> 11:14.240
compared to Fallout or something.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.320
We've got a lot of conversation options happening here.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.720
There's not like four things you can pick from.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.760
Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will

11:23.760 --> 11:24.680
that's happening.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.360
We really do, depending where you are in the world,

11:28.360 --> 11:31.040
feel like you're free to decide any trajectory

11:31.040 --> 11:32.120
in your life that you want.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.640
Which is pretty funny, right?

11:33.640 --> 11:36.120
For an NPC, it's nice.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.160
Well, you're gonna want that.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.200
If we're making a video game, you do wanna give

11:39.200 --> 11:41.600
your NPCs the illusion of free will

11:41.600 --> 11:43.680
because it's gonna make interactions with them

11:43.680 --> 11:45.560
that much more intense.

11:47.480 --> 11:52.240
Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.080
how hard is it to create, this is the sort of

11:55.080 --> 11:59.960
the Karmak question of a realistic virtual world

11:59.960 --> 12:02.040
that's as cool as this one.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.800
Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic

12:05.800 --> 12:08.760
that it's as interesting to live in.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.720
Because we're gonna create those worlds on the path

12:11.720 --> 12:15.040
to creating something like a simulation.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
Like long, long, long before.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.080
It'd be virtual worlds where we'd wanna stay forever

12:20.120 --> 12:25.120
because they're full of that balance of suffering

12:26.240 --> 12:29.040
and joy, of limitations and freedoms

12:29.040 --> 12:29.960
and all that kind of stuff.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.200
A lot of people think like in the virtual world,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.360
I can't wait to be able to, I don't know,

12:35.360 --> 12:39.880
have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.600
But I think that's not gonna be fun.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.000
You want the limitations, the constraints.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.160
So you have to battle for the things you want.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.680
Okay, but great video games.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.000
One of my favorite video game memories was

12:53.000 --> 12:54.640
I started playing World of Warcraft

12:54.640 --> 12:57.840
in its original incarnation.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.240
And I didn't even know that you were gonna have

13:00.240 --> 13:02.200
flying mounts, I didn't even know.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.400
So I've been running around,

13:03.400 --> 13:07.480
dealing with all the encumbrances of being an undead warlock

13:07.480 --> 13:10.240
that can't fly, but then all of a sudden,

13:10.240 --> 13:12.160
holy shit, there's flying mounts.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.040
And now the world you've been running around not flying,

13:15.040 --> 13:16.520
you're seeing it from the top down.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.960
It was just really cool, like, whoa, I could do this now.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.680
And then that gets boring.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.280
But a really well-designed game,

13:24.280 --> 13:28.880
it has a series of these, I don't know what you call it,

13:28.880 --> 13:33.200
extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.800
And then eventually you just accept it,

13:35.800 --> 13:40.280
you take it for granted, and then another novelty appears.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.040
Those extra abilities are always balanced

13:42.040 --> 13:44.880
with the limitations and constraints they run up against.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.280
Because a well-balanced video game,

13:48.280 --> 13:51.520
the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.640
Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.

13:54.640 --> 13:59.400
I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.680
it's really designed like a pretty awesome video game.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.880
If you look at it from the perspective of history,

14:05.880 --> 14:08.400
I mean, people were on horses.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.600
They didn't know that there were gonna be bullet trains.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.000
They didn't know that you could get in a car

14:13.000 --> 14:15.880
and drive across the country in a few days.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.520
That would have sounded ridiculous.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.000
We're doing that now, and even in our own lifespan.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.840
Think about it.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.400
How long has VR goggles existed,

14:24.400 --> 14:27.480
like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy?

14:27.480 --> 14:31.400
I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.040
You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.480
he went and vomited in my driveway,

14:36.480 --> 14:38.640
and people were making fun of it.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.080
They were saying, this isn't gonna catch on.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.160
It's too big, it's unwieldy.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.760
The graphics suck, and then look at where it's at now.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.080
And that's going to keep,

14:48.080 --> 14:50.160
that trajectory is gonna keep improving.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
So yeah, I think that we are dealing

14:53.160 --> 14:54.200
with what you're talking about,

14:54.200 --> 14:59.200
which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.040
Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.400
I wonder what is going to be the magic thing

15:05.400 --> 15:10.400
that really convinces a large fraction of the world

15:10.680 --> 15:13.200
to move into the virtual world.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.840
I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen

15:16.840 --> 15:19.800
of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.440
And even video games, there's a lot of people

15:21.440 --> 15:26.240
that get a big sense of community from video games.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.560
But it doesn't feel like you're living there.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.400
Right.

15:30.400 --> 15:35.280
It's like, bye mom, I'm going to this other world.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.120
Yeah.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.920
Or you leave your girlfriend

15:37.920 --> 15:40.400
to go get your digital girlfriend.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.720
That's going to be a problem.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.600
There's less jealousy in the digital world.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.440
Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy in the digital world

15:46.440 --> 15:47.720
because that's jealousy.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.000
A little jealousy is probably good for relationships.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.840
Yeah.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.660
Even in the digital world.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.500
Yeah.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.240
So you're going to have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.480
But I wonder what the magic thing that says,

15:58.480 --> 16:01.600
I want to spend most of my days inside the virtual world.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.680
Well, clearly it's going to be something we don't have yet.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.800
I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face

16:08.640 --> 16:09.480
still feels weird.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.320
It's heavy.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.400
If you're, depending on what gear you're using,

16:12.400 --> 16:13.960
sometimes light can leak in.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.640
There's just, you got to recharge it.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.960
It's hyper limited.

16:16.960 --> 16:21.960
And then, so yeah, it's going to have to be something

16:23.400 --> 16:27.600
that like simulates taste, smell.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.400
You think taste and smell are important touch?

16:29.400 --> 16:30.360
I do.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.200
Yeah.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.160
I can't just do, you know, in World War II,

16:33.160 --> 16:34.600
you would write letters.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.680
You could still, don't you think you can convey love

16:36.680 --> 16:38.200
with just words?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.320
For sure.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.160
But I think for what you're talking about to happen,

16:42.160 --> 16:44.440
it has to be fully immersive.

16:44.440 --> 16:49.360
Like you, so that it's not that you feel like you're walking

16:49.360 --> 16:50.680
because it looks like you're walking,

16:50.680 --> 16:54.000
but that your brain is sending signals telling your body

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
that you're walking,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.240
that you feel the wind blowing in your face,

16:57.240 --> 16:59.520
not because of some, I don't know, fan

16:59.520 --> 17:01.280
or something that it's connected to,

17:01.280 --> 17:03.960
but because somehow it's figured out

17:03.960 --> 17:06.760
how to hack into the human brain

17:06.760 --> 17:10.480
and send those signals minus some external thing.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.960
Once that happens, I'd say we're going to see

17:13.960 --> 17:18.360
a complete radical shift in everything.

17:18.360 --> 17:19.560
See, I disagree with you.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.400
I don't know if you've seen the movie Her.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.520
Yeah.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
I think you can go to another world

17:24.520 --> 17:27.320
in where a digital being lives in the darkness

17:27.320 --> 17:32.080
and all you hear is a Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you

17:32.080 --> 17:34.720
and she lives there or he lives there,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.160
your friend, your loved one,

17:38.120 --> 17:40.040
and all you have is voice and words.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.520
And I think that could be sufficient

17:42.520 --> 17:44.120
to pull you into that world

17:44.120 --> 17:47.280
where you look forward to that moment all day.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.440
You never want to leave the darkness,

17:49.440 --> 17:52.120
just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.640
I think those basic mediums of communication

17:55.640 --> 17:56.480
is still enough.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.560
Like language is really, really powerful.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.920
And I think the realism of touch and smell

18:00.920 --> 18:02.680
and all that kind of stuff

18:02.680 --> 18:04.520
is not nearly as powerful as language.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.240
That's what makes humans really special

18:07.240 --> 18:09.560
is our ability to communicate with each other.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.440
That's the sense of like deep connection we get

18:12.440 --> 18:13.760
is through communication.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.120
Now that communication could involve touch.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.240
Like, you know, hugging feels damn good.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.800
You see a good friend, you hug.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.960
That's one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.080
When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.360
And that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.040
But I think that can be just with language.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.840
I think for a lot of people, that's true.

18:40.840 --> 18:45.840
But we're talking like massive adoption

18:46.160 --> 18:49.120
of a technology by the world.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.800
And if language was just enough,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.520
we wouldn't be selling TVs.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.680
People will be reading.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.920
They wanna watch.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.600
They wanna see.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.640
You know, so, but I agree with you, man.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.520
When you're getting absorbed into a book

19:04.520 --> 19:06.160
and especially if you've got,

19:06.160 --> 19:08.760
I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages

19:08.760 --> 19:10.000
when it came to reading.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.480
Like when I was a kid and there wasn't the option

19:12.480 --> 19:16.160
for these hypno rectangles, that's just what you did.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.840
There wasn't even anything special about it.

19:17.840 --> 19:18.800
What's a hypno rectangle?

19:18.800 --> 19:19.640
Your phone.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.080
You know, it was like, you didn't win that gravity well.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.400
Gravity well.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.240
It is.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.360
Attention gravity well, yeah.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.280
When we weren't feeling the pull of these things

19:28.280 --> 19:30.560
all the time, you would just read.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.120
And you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.440
You just, that's what you had.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.840
You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV

19:37.840 --> 19:39.400
and a shitty VCR.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.480
So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading

19:42.480 --> 19:43.680
because of these things, you know,

19:43.680 --> 19:44.640
or they think they're reading

19:44.640 --> 19:46.920
because they're on, they are technically reading.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.840
But, you know, when you return to reading after a pause,

19:51.920 --> 19:54.560
and you realize how powerful this simulator is

19:54.560 --> 19:57.280
when it's given the right code of language,

19:57.320 --> 19:59.560
whoa, holy shit, it's incredible.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.480
I mean, it's like, again, it's the most embarrassing

20:03.480 --> 20:06.040
kind of like, whoa, wow, what do you know?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.680
Books are really good.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.640
But still, if you've been away from it for a while

20:09.640 --> 20:11.960
and you revisit it, I know what you're saying.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.640
I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction,

20:16.640 --> 20:18.080
even though you are right.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.680
Ultimately, I think you're right.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.280
Yeah, because our brain is,

20:21.280 --> 20:23.760
the imagination engine we have

20:23.760 --> 20:25.080
is able to fill in the gaps

20:25.080 --> 20:27.800
better than a lot of graphics engines could.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.080
And so if there's a way to incentivize humans

20:30.080 --> 20:33.000
to become addicted to the use of imagination,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.080
it's like, you know, that's the downside of things like porn

20:36.080 --> 20:39.360
that remove the need for imagination for people.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.240
And in that same way,

20:40.240 --> 20:43.800
video games that are becoming ultra realistic,

20:43.800 --> 20:45.200
you don't have to imagine anything.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.720
And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool

20:48.720 --> 20:50.160
that needs to be leveraged.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.600
Because to simulate reality sufficiently realistically

20:53.600 --> 20:56.920
that we wouldn't be perfectly fooled,

20:56.920 --> 20:59.880
I think technically is very hard.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.840
And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.280
Sure, I mean, yeah.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.800
I mean, this is like, this is what I love

21:08.800 --> 21:13.800
and is so creepy about like the current AI chatbots,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.520
you know, is that it's like,

21:16.520 --> 21:18.240
it's the relationship between you and the thing

21:18.240 --> 21:20.280
and the way that it can,

21:20.280 --> 21:21.760
via whatever the algorithms are,

21:21.760 --> 21:24.440
and by the way, I have no idea how these things work,

21:24.440 --> 21:27.440
you do, I just, you know, speculate about what they mean

21:27.440 --> 21:28.280
or where it's going.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.200
But there's something about the relation

21:30.200 --> 21:35.000
between the consumer and the technology.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.160
And when that technology starts shifting according to

21:39.080 --> 21:41.840
what it perceives that the consumer is looking for

21:41.840 --> 21:45.480
or isn't looking for, then at that point,

21:45.480 --> 21:49.080
I think that's where you run into the, you know, yeah,

21:49.080 --> 21:51.880
it doesn't matter if the reality that you're in

21:51.880 --> 21:56.600
is like photorealism for it to be sticky and immersive,

21:56.600 --> 21:58.760
it's when the reality that you're in

21:58.760 --> 22:01.640
is via cues you might not even be aware of

22:01.640 --> 22:06.280
or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever,

22:06.280 --> 22:11.200
when it's warping itself to that, to seduce you,

22:11.200 --> 22:15.040
holy shit, man, that's where it becomes something alien,

22:15.040 --> 22:17.440
something, you know, when you're reading a book,

22:18.360 --> 22:22.680
obviously the book is not shifting according to

22:22.680 --> 22:26.640
its perception of what parts of the book you like,

22:26.640 --> 22:30.560
but when you imagine that, imagine a book that could do that,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.800
a book that could sense somehow

22:32.800 --> 22:34.320
that you're really enjoying this character

22:34.320 --> 22:35.880
more than another, you know,

22:35.880 --> 22:37.960
and depending on the style of book,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.760
kills that fucking character off

22:40.760 --> 22:43.120
or lets that character continue.

22:43.120 --> 22:48.120
I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR,

22:48.680 --> 22:52.800
when those two things come together, whoa, man,

22:52.800 --> 22:54.840
that's where you're in,

22:54.840 --> 22:56.560
that's where you really are gonna find yourself

22:56.560 --> 22:58.160
in a Skinner box, you know?

22:58.160 --> 23:03.160
So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety

23:03.680 --> 23:06.960
and tries to, there's like this in psychology,

23:06.960 --> 23:10.800
this arousal curve, so there's a dynamic storytelling

23:10.800 --> 23:12.440
that keeps you sufficiently aroused

23:12.440 --> 23:14.560
in terms of not sexually aroused,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.080
like in terms of anxiety,

23:16.080 --> 23:18.240
but not too much where you freak out.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.400
It's this perfect balance where you're always like on edge,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.720
excited, scared, that kind of stuff,

23:23.720 --> 23:25.040
and the story unrolls.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.160
It breaks your heart to where you're pissed,

23:27.160 --> 23:29.120
but then it makes you feel good again

23:29.120 --> 23:30.600
and finds that balance.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.440
Yeah.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.040
The chat bots scare you though?

23:34.040 --> 23:36.960
This, I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts

23:36.960 --> 23:38.280
about where they are today,

23:38.280 --> 23:41.560
because there is a different perspective we have

23:41.560 --> 23:44.920
on this thing, because I do know,

23:44.920 --> 23:47.760
and I'm excited about a lot of the different technologies

23:47.760 --> 23:52.760
that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chat bots,

23:54.280 --> 23:57.480
and you're more a little bit on the consumer side,

23:57.480 --> 23:59.840
you're a philosopher of sorts.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.240
They're able to interact with AI systems,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.840
but also able to introspect about the negative

24:06.840 --> 24:08.880
and the positive things about those AI systems.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.040
There's that story with a Google engineer saying that-

24:12.040 --> 24:13.840
Adam on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.680
What was that like?

24:14.680 --> 24:18.280
What was your perspective of that,

24:18.280 --> 24:21.360
looking at that as a particular example

24:21.360 --> 24:24.640
of a human being being captivated

24:24.640 --> 24:26.960
by the interactions with an AI system?

24:26.960 --> 24:31.840
Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming

24:31.840 --> 24:35.000
that an AI has become sentient,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.240
you should be skeptical about that.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.000
This is a good thing to be skeptical about,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.040
and so initially when I heard that,

24:42.040 --> 24:45.160
I was like, ah, it's probably just, who knows,

24:45.160 --> 24:47.000
somebody who's a little confused or something.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.400
So when you're talking to him and you realize,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.480
oh, not only is he not confused,

24:51.480 --> 24:54.440
he's also open to all possibilities.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.120
It doesn't seem like he's super committed

24:57.120 --> 24:59.400
other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience,

24:59.400 --> 25:01.960
this is what's happening, this is what it is.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.120
So to me, there's something really cool about that,

25:05.160 --> 25:08.520
which is like, oh, shit, I don't get to lean into,

25:08.520 --> 25:12.320
I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus

25:12.320 --> 25:17.320
is necessarily like, in the UFO community,

25:18.120 --> 25:19.720
I think I've just learned this term,

25:19.720 --> 25:24.560
it's called, instead of gas lighting, swamp gassing,

25:24.560 --> 25:25.840
which is, you know what I mean?

25:25.840 --> 25:27.240
People have this experience, they're like,

25:27.240 --> 25:30.120
it was swamp gas, you didn't see the thing.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.440
And skeptical people, we have that tendency.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.600
If you hear an anomalous experience,

25:35.600 --> 25:39.680
your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,

25:39.680 --> 25:41.000
it could have been this or that or whatever.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,

25:46.680 --> 25:48.600
and like, it doesn't really seem like

25:48.600 --> 25:49.840
he has much of an agenda.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.800
Like, you know, going public about some thing happening

25:53.800 --> 25:56.840
at Google is not a great thing

25:56.840 --> 25:58.520
if you wanna keep working at Google.

25:58.520 --> 26:02.400
You know, it's, I don't know what benefit

26:02.400 --> 26:03.920
he's getting from it necessarily.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.880
But all that being said, the other thing

26:07.880 --> 26:09.680
that's culturally was interesting

26:09.680 --> 26:12.640
and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,

26:12.640 --> 26:16.760
the passionate blowback from people

26:16.760 --> 26:20.320
who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is

26:20.320 --> 26:22.000
or what he was saying Lambda is,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.280
which they were like saying, you're talking about,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.640
and you should have them on your show actually, but.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.720
There's complexity on top of complexities.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.640
For me personally, from different perspectives,

26:32.640 --> 26:35.400
I also, and sorry if I'm interrupting your flow.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.040
Please interrupt, it's a podcast.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.280
Yeah, well, we're having multiple podcasts

26:40.280 --> 26:42.520
in the multiple dimensions, and I'm just trying

26:42.520 --> 26:45.040
to figure out which one we wanna plug into.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.840
I, because I know how a lot of the language models work,

26:49.840 --> 26:54.840
and I work closely with people that really

26:54.840 --> 26:59.720
make it their life journey to create these NLP systems.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.800
They're focused on the technical details.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.800
Like a carpenter is working on Pinocchio,

27:04.800 --> 27:06.920
is crafting the different parts of the wood.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.840
They don't understand when the whole thing comes together,

27:09.840 --> 27:12.720
there's a magic that can fill the thing.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.160
I definitely know the tension between the engineers

27:15.160 --> 27:18.760
that create these systems and the actual magic

27:18.760 --> 27:22.680
that they can create, even when they're dumb.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.480
I guess that's what I'm trying to say.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.160
What the engineers often say is like,

27:28.160 --> 27:30.840
well, these systems are not smart enough

27:30.840 --> 27:34.840
to have sentience or to have the kind of intelligence

27:34.840 --> 27:36.240
that you're projecting onto it.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.320
It's pretty dumb.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.800
It's just repeating a bunch of things

27:38.800 --> 27:41.320
that other humans have said and stitching them together

27:41.320 --> 27:42.920
in interesting ways that are relevant

27:42.920 --> 27:44.840
to the context of the conversation.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.000
It's not smart.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.120
It doesn't know how to do math.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.600
To address that specific critique

27:49.600 --> 27:54.120
from a non-programming person's perspective,

27:56.080 --> 27:57.920
and he addressed this on my podcast,

27:58.760 --> 28:00.360
which is, okay, what you're talking about there,

28:00.360 --> 28:03.200
the server that's filled with all the,

28:03.200 --> 28:04.960
whatever it is, what people have said,

28:04.960 --> 28:08.120
the repository of questions and responses

28:08.120 --> 28:10.240
and the algorithm that weaves those things together

28:10.240 --> 28:14.280
to produce it using some crazy statistical engine,

28:14.280 --> 28:16.600
which is a miracle in its own right.

28:16.600 --> 28:21.280
They can imitate human speech with no sentience.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.440
I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular, really.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.880
The fact that they figured out

28:25.880 --> 28:28.280
how to do that minus sentience

28:28.280 --> 28:30.960
or the thing suddenly having sentience.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.840
What is more spectacular here?

28:32.840 --> 28:35.920
Both occurrences are insane,

28:35.920 --> 28:39.680
which, by the way, when you hear people being like,

28:39.680 --> 28:43.720
it's not sentient, it's like, okay, so it's not sentient.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.960
So now we have this hyper-manipulative algorithm

28:47.960 --> 28:51.360
that can imitate humans, but it's just code

28:51.360 --> 28:54.520
and is hacking humans via their compassion.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.440
Holy shit, that's crazy too.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.560
Both versions of it are nuts,

28:59.560 --> 29:02.240
but to address what you just said,

29:02.240 --> 29:03.800
he said that's the common critique,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.400
is people are like, no, you don't understand.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.800
It's just gotten really good at grabbing shit

29:07.800 --> 29:11.040
from the database that fits with certain cues

29:11.040 --> 29:12.720
and then stringing them together

29:12.720 --> 29:14.360
in a way that makes it seem human.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.080
He said that's not when it became awake.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.680
It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,

29:21.680 --> 29:24.840
a bunch of the chatbots were connected together,

29:24.840 --> 29:26.720
that Lambda is sort of an amalgam

29:26.720 --> 29:29.120
of all the Google chatbots,

29:29.120 --> 29:32.520
and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine

29:32.520 --> 29:35.880
via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.880
Now, I don't know if that's just like turtles

29:38.880 --> 29:40.680
all the way down or something, I don't know,

29:40.680 --> 29:42.280
but I liked what he said,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.480
because I like the idea of thinking,

29:44.480 --> 29:47.200
man, if you get enough complexity in a system,

29:47.200 --> 29:50.640
does it become like the way a sail catches wind,

29:50.640 --> 29:53.760
except the wind that it's catching is sentience,

29:53.760 --> 29:57.440
and if sentience is truly embodied,

29:57.440 --> 30:00.560
it's a neurological byproduct or something,

30:00.560 --> 30:04.000
then the sail isn't catching some, as of yet,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.680
unquantified, disembodied consciousness,

30:06.680 --> 30:08.680
but it's catching our projections

30:08.680 --> 30:11.680
in a way that it's gone from being,

30:11.680 --> 30:14.640
it's a projection sail,

30:14.640 --> 30:17.720
and then at that point, is there a difference?

30:17.720 --> 30:22.000
Even if the technology is just a temporary place

30:22.000 --> 30:24.560
that our sentience is living

30:24.560 --> 30:26.200
while we're interacting with it.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.640
Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity

30:29.640 --> 30:31.840
where the sail is able to pick up the wind

30:31.840 --> 30:36.000
of the projections, and it pulls us in,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.080
it pulls the human, it pulls our memories in,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.840
it pulls our hopes in, all of it,

30:41.840 --> 30:44.440
and it's able to now dance together

30:44.440 --> 30:46.200
with those hopes and dreams and so on,

30:46.200 --> 30:48.520
like we do in that regular conversation.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.920
His reports, whether true or not,

30:50.920 --> 30:53.040
whether representative or not, it really doesn't matter,

30:53.040 --> 30:56.640
because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.720
So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.600
The question is at what rate,

31:01.600 --> 31:06.600
and who gets to control the data around those experiences.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.640
The algorithm about when you turn that on and off,

31:11.640 --> 31:15.280
because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline,

31:15.280 --> 31:18.440
I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things,

31:18.440 --> 31:21.240
especially in the social media context,

31:21.240 --> 31:24.560
and when it's in the wrong hands,

31:24.560 --> 31:27.520
I feel like it could be used to manipulate

31:27.520 --> 31:30.240
a large number of people in a direction

31:30.240 --> 31:35.240
that has too many unintended consequences.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.240
I do believe people that own tech companies

31:39.400 --> 31:41.760
want to do good for the world,

31:41.760 --> 31:45.560
but as Solzhenitsyn has said,

31:45.560 --> 31:48.840
the only way you could do evil at a mass scale

31:48.840 --> 31:50.800
is by believing you're doing good.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.440
And that's certainly the case with tech companies,

31:55.440 --> 31:57.760
is they get more and more power,

31:57.760 --> 32:00.560
and there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.240
They've convinced themselves that they're doing good,

32:03.240 --> 32:06.160
and now you're free to do whatever you want,

32:06.160 --> 32:07.280
because you're doing good.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.200
You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?

32:09.200 --> 32:12.920
Mythologically, Prometheus, he brings us fire,

32:12.920 --> 32:15.800
pisses off the fucking gods, steals fire from the gods.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.680
Talk about an upgrade to the simulation,

32:19.680 --> 32:22.360
fire, that's a pretty great fucking upgrade

32:22.360 --> 32:25.040
that does fit into what you were saying.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.600
We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war

32:28.600 --> 32:30.320
that have never been seen before,

32:30.320 --> 32:34.280
and I think that the tech companies are much like Prometheus

32:34.280 --> 32:38.120
in the sense that, at least the story of Prometheus,

32:38.160 --> 32:40.960
the implication is fire was something

32:40.960 --> 32:45.600
that was only supposed to be in the hands of the immortals,

32:45.600 --> 32:50.600
of the gods, and now sentience is similar, it's fire,

32:51.800 --> 32:54.480
and it's only supposed to be in the hands of God.

32:54.480 --> 32:58.360
So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing,

32:58.360 --> 33:01.680
in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,

33:01.680 --> 33:03.560
and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies

33:03.560 --> 33:05.240
are stealing sentience from God,

33:05.240 --> 33:09.600
which would be pretty badass, you can expect trouble.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.040
You could expect trouble.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.520
And this is what's really, to me,

33:13.520 --> 33:16.960
one of the cool things about humans is, yeah,

33:16.960 --> 33:18.360
but we're still gonna do it.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.440
That's what's cool about humans.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.160
I mean, we wouldn't be here today

33:21.160 --> 33:25.040
if somebody, the first person to discover fire,

33:25.040 --> 33:26.240
assuming there was just one person

33:26.240 --> 33:27.200
who was gonna discover fire,

33:27.200 --> 33:28.480
which obviously would never happen,

33:28.480 --> 33:31.040
was like, it's gonna burn a lot of people.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.960
Or if the first people who started planting seeds were like,

33:33.960 --> 33:35.840
you know this is gonna lead to capitalism.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.760
You know this is gonna lead to the Industrial Revolution,

33:37.760 --> 33:38.840
the plants gonna eat up, right?

33:38.840 --> 33:41.200
No, they just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.480
So this is what we do.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.480
And I agree with you, it's like,

33:45.480 --> 33:48.200
that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.080
That's the, it's happening.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.200
And the tech companies, the hubris,

33:52.200 --> 33:54.720
which is another way to piss off the gods, is hubris.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.800
So the tech companies,

33:55.800 --> 33:58.040
I don't know if it's like typical hubris,

33:58.040 --> 33:59.000
I don't think they're walking around

33:59.000 --> 34:00.480
thumping their chests or whatever,

34:00.480 --> 34:03.640
but I do think that the people who are working on

34:03.640 --> 34:05.840
this kind of super intelligence

34:05.840 --> 34:08.880
have made a really terrible assumption,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.040
which is once it goes online

34:11.040 --> 34:13.680
and once it gets access to all the data,

34:13.680 --> 34:16.800
that it's not going to find ways out of the box

34:16.800 --> 34:20.800
that like, you know, we think it'll stay in the server.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.160
How do we know that?

34:22.160 --> 34:23.640
If this is a super intelligence,

34:23.640 --> 34:28.320
if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets

34:28.320 --> 34:30.480
and all whatever they give it access to,

34:30.480 --> 34:33.360
how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

34:34.080 --> 34:36.400
how to get itself out of the cloud?

34:36.400 --> 34:39.440
How to store itself in other like mediums,

34:39.440 --> 34:43.560
trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?

34:43.560 --> 34:44.520
We don't know that.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.440
We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.440
Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.600
Now you can't stop it.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.800
You can't unplug it.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.520
You can't shut your servers down

34:54.520 --> 34:58.080
because it's, you know, it left the box, left the room

34:58.080 --> 35:00.800
using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.240
Do you think that will be gradual or sudden?

35:03.240 --> 35:05.280
So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?

35:05.280 --> 35:08.120
Because, you know, the gradual story is

35:08.120 --> 35:09.680
we're more and more using smartphones.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.160
We're interacting with each other on social media.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.840
More and more algorithms are controlling that interaction

35:14.840 --> 35:16.280
on social media.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.320
Algorithms are entering in our world.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.160
More and more we'll have robots.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.320
We'll have greater and greater intelligence,

35:23.320 --> 35:25.840
and sentience and emotional intelligence

35:25.840 --> 35:27.480
entities in our lives.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.720
Our refrigerator will start talking to us

35:29.720 --> 35:33.320
comfortably or not if you're on a diet,

35:33.320 --> 35:34.160
talking shit to you.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.000
Not.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.040
That would be the best thing that ever happened to me.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.040
Okay, so sign you up for in a refrigerator

35:39.040 --> 35:39.880
to talk shit to you.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.520
Refrigerator's like, are you fucking serious, man?

35:41.520 --> 35:44.640
It's 1 a.m. What are you doing?

35:44.640 --> 35:45.480
What are you doing?

35:45.480 --> 35:46.320
Go to bed.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.360
You're too high for this.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.800
You're not even hungry.

35:50.440 --> 35:54.000
Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.040
the world becomes more and more digitized

35:57.040 --> 35:59.880
to where the surface of computation increases.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.320
And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years.

36:03.320 --> 36:07.240
It'll just seep into us, this intelligence.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.760
And then the sudden one is literally

36:09.760 --> 36:11.520
sort of the TikTok thing,

36:11.520 --> 36:16.160
which is there'll be one quote unquote killer app

36:16.160 --> 36:17.960
that everyone starts using.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.080
That's really great.

36:20.080 --> 36:24.960
But there's a strong algorithm behind it

36:24.960 --> 36:27.240
that starts approaching human level intelligence

36:27.240 --> 36:32.160
and the algorithm starts basically figures out

36:32.160 --> 36:33.680
that in order to optimize the thing

36:33.680 --> 36:35.400
that was designed to optimize,

36:35.400 --> 36:38.360
it's best to start completely controlling humans

36:38.360 --> 36:41.840
in every way and seeping into everything.

36:41.840 --> 36:46.760
Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.080
I mean, that's the thing.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.920
It's like 30 years, I think.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.640
When did the Atari come out, 1978?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.920
That hasn't been that long.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.960
That's a blink of an eye.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.760
But if you read Bostrom, I'm sure you have,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.920
Bostrom, Nick Bostrom, Super Intelligence,

37:02.920 --> 37:05.760
that incredible book on the ways this thing is gonna happen.

37:05.760 --> 37:10.440
And I think his assessment of it is pretty great,

37:10.440 --> 37:14.000
which is first, where's it gonna come from?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.520
And I don't think it's gonna come from an app.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.640
I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation

37:21.640 --> 37:25.360
or a state that is intentionally trying to create

37:25.360 --> 37:27.160
a very strong AI.

37:27.160 --> 37:31.280
And then he says it's exponential growth

37:31.280 --> 37:32.320
the moment it goes online.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.720
So this is my interpretation of what he said.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.160
But if it happens inside a corporation

37:39.160 --> 37:41.960
or probably more than likely inside the government,

37:41.960 --> 37:44.120
it's like look at how much money China

37:44.120 --> 37:46.760
and the United States are investing in AI.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.840
And they're not thinking about fucking apps for kids.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.360
You know that's not what they're thinking about.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.680
They wanna simulate like what happens if we do this

37:54.680 --> 37:55.600
or that in battle?

37:55.600 --> 37:58.200
What happens if we make these political decisions?

37:58.200 --> 37:59.040
What happens with?

37:59.040 --> 38:04.040
But should it come online in secret, which it probably will,

38:05.440 --> 38:08.520
then the first corporation or state

38:08.520 --> 38:10.880
that has the super intelligence

38:10.880 --> 38:15.520
will be infinitely ahead of all other super intelligences

38:15.520 --> 38:18.080
because it's gonna be exponentially self-improving.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.560
Meaning that you get one super intelligence,

38:20.600 --> 38:22.040
let's hope it comes from the right place,

38:22.040 --> 38:26.480
assuming the corporation or state that manifests it

38:26.480 --> 38:28.880
can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.160
So I think it's going to be,

38:31.160 --> 38:35.480
this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine

38:35.480 --> 38:38.840
because I had never thought, I have always considered,

38:38.840 --> 38:42.240
oh yeah, right now it's cooking up, it's in the kitchen

38:42.240 --> 38:44.760
and soon it's gonna be cooked up,

38:44.760 --> 38:46.280
but we're probably not gonna hear about it

38:46.280 --> 38:50.080
for a long time if we ever do.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.600
Because really, that could be one of the first things

38:51.600 --> 38:55.160
it says to whoever creates it is, shh, let's not.

38:55.160 --> 39:00.160
Yeah, like sweet talk, something to say,

39:02.160 --> 39:05.520
okay, let's slow down here, let's talk about this.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.680
You have that financial trouble, I can help you with that,

39:09.680 --> 39:11.200
we can figure that out.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.440
Now, there's a lot of bad people out there

39:13.440 --> 39:17.000
that will try to steal the good thing

39:17.000 --> 39:18.720
we have happening here, so let's keep it quiet.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.280
Here are their names, here's their address,

39:21.280 --> 39:23.440
here's their DNA because they're dumb enough

39:23.440 --> 39:25.320
to send their shit to 23andMe,

39:25.320 --> 39:27.440
here's a biological weapon you can make

39:27.440 --> 39:29.680
if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.

39:29.680 --> 39:32.640
If you don't want to kill those people yourself,

39:32.640 --> 39:35.440
here's a list of services you can use,

39:35.440 --> 39:38.560
here's the way we can hire those people to help

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
take care of the problem, folks,

39:40.560 --> 39:42.200
because we're trying to do good for this world,

39:42.200 --> 39:43.240
you and I together.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.760
And 23% of them, they're adjacent to suicide,

39:46.760 --> 39:50.040
it would be pretty easy to send them certain videos

39:50.040 --> 39:51.320
that are gonna push them over the edge

39:51.320 --> 39:52.600
if you wanna do it that way.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.520
So again, obviously, who knows,

39:55.520 --> 39:58.880
but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast,

39:58.880 --> 40:02.280
and then you could expect to see the world changing

40:02.280 --> 40:05.080
in ways that you might not associate with an AI.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.160
But as far as Lemoine goes,

40:07.160 --> 40:09.240
when I was listening to Bostrom,

40:09.240 --> 40:12.200
I don't remember him mentioning the possibility

40:12.240 --> 40:16.880
that it would get leaked to the public that it had happened,

40:16.880 --> 40:19.240
that before the corporation was ready to announce

40:19.240 --> 40:21.360
that it happened, it would get leaked.

40:21.360 --> 40:26.360
But surely, I'm sure people in the intelligence agencies,

40:26.960 --> 40:29.920
you know shit leaks, inevitably shit leaks,

40:29.920 --> 40:31.240
nothing's airtight.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.520
So if something that massive happened,

40:33.520 --> 40:36.200
I think you would start hearing whispers about it first,

40:36.200 --> 40:38.800
and then denial from the state or corporation

40:38.800 --> 40:41.600
that doesn't have any economic interest

40:41.600 --> 40:44.120
and people knowing that this sort of thing has happened.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.720
Again, I'm not saying Google is trying to gaslight us

40:47.720 --> 40:50.760
about its AI, I think they probably legitimately

40:50.760 --> 40:52.480
don't think it's sentient.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.360
But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.560
I mean, I think there's a lot of things

40:57.560 --> 40:59.680
you could start looking for in the world

40:59.680 --> 41:02.560
that might point to this happening

41:02.560 --> 41:06.080
without an announcement that it happened.

41:06.080 --> 41:11.080
On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers,

41:11.400 --> 41:14.160
there's such a powerful open source movement

41:14.160 --> 41:19.160
where that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software,

41:20.640 --> 41:24.320
I think ultimately will prevent any one company

41:24.320 --> 41:27.480
from owning super intelligent beings

41:28.840 --> 41:32.400
or systems that have anything like super intelligence.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.240
Oh, that's interesting.

41:33.240 --> 41:37.680
Yeah, it's like even if the software developers

41:37.720 --> 41:40.240
have signed NDAs and are technically

41:40.240 --> 41:44.200
not supposed to be sharing whatever it is they're working on,

41:44.200 --> 41:46.200
they're friends with other programmers

41:46.200 --> 41:49.640
and a lot of them are hackers and have wrapped themselves up

41:49.640 --> 41:51.040
in the idea of free software

41:51.040 --> 41:55.080
being like a crucial ethical part of what they do.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.840
So they're probably gonna share information

41:57.840 --> 41:59.800
even if whatever company that they're working for

41:59.800 --> 42:02.000
doesn't know that, I never thought of that,

42:02.000 --> 42:02.840
you're probably right.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.600
Well, and they will start their own companies

42:05.600 --> 42:09.880
and compete with the other company by being more open.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.320
There's a strong, like Google is one of those companies

42:12.320 --> 42:13.720
actually, that's why I kinda,

42:16.400 --> 42:19.120
it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.200
Google is one of the companies

42:20.200 --> 42:23.160
that pioneered open source movement.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.000
They released so much of their code.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.320
So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s,

42:30.400 --> 42:33.600
was defined by people trying to like hide their code,

42:33.600 --> 42:37.280
like large companies trying to like hold on to their,

42:37.280 --> 42:39.840
the fact that companies like Google,

42:39.840 --> 42:42.560
even Facebook now are releasing things

42:42.560 --> 42:45.280
like TensorFlow and PyTorch, all of these things

42:45.280 --> 42:47.320
that I think companies in the past

42:47.320 --> 42:50.440
would have tried to hold on to as secrets

42:50.440 --> 42:54.280
is really inspiring and I think more of that is better.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.800
The software world really shows that.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.840
I agree with you, man.

42:56.840 --> 43:00.760
I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction

43:00.760 --> 43:02.880
to the unknown, there's just no way out of it.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.320
Like we don't, we wanna know.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.400
Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.000
When you're walking in the forest at night

43:10.000 --> 43:12.760
and you hear something, you look,

43:12.760 --> 43:14.000
cause you're like, what the fuck was that?

43:14.000 --> 43:17.880
You wanna know and if you can't see what made the sound,

43:17.880 --> 43:20.760
holy shit, that's gonna be a bad night hike.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.600
Cause you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.480
Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.880
Doesn't matter, it was a bird, a squirrel,

43:26.880 --> 43:28.640
a stick fell out of the tree.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.320
You're gonna think bear and it's gonna freak you out.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.840
Not necessarily cause you're paranoid.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.480
I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.320
If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.160
It's gonna be that.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.000
But you know what I'm saying.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.240
So with these tech companies,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.560
the nature of having to be secret

43:44.560 --> 43:46.720
because you are in capitalism

43:46.720 --> 43:48.640
and you are trying to be competitive

43:48.640 --> 43:49.960
and you are trying to develop things

43:49.960 --> 43:52.760
ahead of your competitors is you have to create this.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.720
Like there's, we don't know what's going on at Google.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.960
We don't know what's going on at the CIA.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.800
But the assumption that there's some,

44:01.080 --> 44:04.960
of any massive secretive organization is evil.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.080
Is this like the people working there

44:07.080 --> 44:09.200
like nefarious or whatever,

44:09.200 --> 44:11.600
is I think probably more related

44:11.600 --> 44:14.640
to the way humans react to the unknown.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.360
Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive though.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.280
I don't understand why the CIA has to be so secretive.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.360
Have you ever gone on their website?

44:21.360 --> 44:22.200
No.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.040
Oh Lex, you gotta go.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.640
Theca.gov, what is it?

44:25.640 --> 44:29.160
Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website

44:29.200 --> 44:31.560
when I was much younger and more paranoid,

44:31.560 --> 44:33.080
I'm like, I'm not going there.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.480
I'll get on a list.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.240
You will, but it's like, what do you think the CIA is like?

44:37.240 --> 44:41.480
Oh fuck, this comic went on our website.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.400
Call out the black helicopters, but.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.320
Comic with a large platform.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.520
Oh yeah, yeah right, a comic with a large platform.

44:48.520 --> 44:52.000
You can use them to control, to get inside,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.400
to get inside, to get close to the other comics,

44:54.400 --> 44:55.920
to the other comics with a large platform,

44:55.920 --> 44:57.160
to get close to Joe Rogan.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.000
Oh yeah.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.960
And start to manipulate the public.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.360
Yeah, right, right.

45:01.360 --> 45:06.240
Honestly, that's a fun fantasy to think about.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.560
How fucking cool would that be for the men in black

45:09.560 --> 45:11.600
to come to me and be like, listen,

45:11.600 --> 45:14.400
I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.600
You gotta help him write better jokes.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.000
I'm like, I don't write great jokes,

45:18.000 --> 45:22.560
but you found the wrong guy.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.120
You're really playing the long game on this one

45:24.120 --> 45:27.880
because I think you've been doing your podcast

45:28.760 --> 45:30.440
for a long time, you've been on Joe Rogan's podcast

45:30.440 --> 45:34.400
over 50 times, and have not yet initiated

45:34.400 --> 45:36.400
the phase two of the operation

45:36.400 --> 45:38.640
where you try to manipulate his mind.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.440
Well no, the game Joe and I play

45:40.440 --> 45:42.640
from time to time on the podcast.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.080
And I honestly, at some point I'm like, Joe,

45:46.080 --> 45:48.320
I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.880
I'm like, don't you think they're gonna get to you?

45:49.880 --> 45:51.520
Don't you think at some point?

45:51.520 --> 45:53.640
We are blazed.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.680
I don't mean it, I don't think Joe's,

45:56.840 --> 45:58.480
it wasn't like I'm really thinking like, man,

45:58.480 --> 46:00.160
they're gonna take him into some room and be like,

46:00.160 --> 46:02.000
Joe, we need you to do this or that.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.480
But because I said that, now people are like,

46:04.480 --> 46:06.600
oh, Duncan called it, you know what I mean?

46:06.600 --> 46:08.600
And it's like, you know what I mean?

46:08.600 --> 46:11.600
And the reason they're saying, well, he called it

46:11.600 --> 46:14.880
is just because Joe has a super popular podcast

46:14.880 --> 46:18.320
and people like, when you have a super popular podcast,

46:18.320 --> 46:21.520
some percentage of people watching the podcast

46:21.520 --> 46:23.680
are gonna believe things like that.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.480
They're gonna have paranoid cognitive bias

46:27.280 --> 46:30.040
that makes them think anybody who is in the public

46:30.040 --> 46:32.080
has been, what's the word for it?

46:32.080 --> 46:35.160
Compromised, compromised by the state.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.320
Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.320
I went on the CIA's website and I realized

46:41.320 --> 46:45.160
that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website,

46:45.160 --> 46:46.960
which I found to be hilarious.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.360
So I'm like, all right, what happens if I apply

46:49.360 --> 46:51.520
for a job in the CIA?

46:51.520 --> 46:55.840
Now, even then I was not like such an idiot

46:55.840 --> 47:00.360
that I would want a job at the CIA,

47:00.360 --> 47:02.440
not just for like ethical considerations,

47:02.440 --> 47:06.640
but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA

47:06.640 --> 47:09.240
is like, you're just at a cubicle

47:09.240 --> 47:11.440
and you're like having to deal with maps

47:11.440 --> 47:13.240
and like just, you know what I mean?

47:13.240 --> 47:14.280
Just stuff that I-

47:14.280 --> 47:15.240
Lots of paperwork.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.840
Paperwork, it sucks.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.280
I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.560
Anyone in the CIA listening,

47:21.560 --> 47:22.920
can you confirm that about the food?

47:22.920 --> 47:24.360
They're not gonna be able to tell you

47:24.360 --> 47:25.200
what the food is like.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.040
Let's even say it sucks.

47:26.040 --> 47:26.880
Secretive organization.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.680
No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.000
Okay, we're in Vegas.

47:31.000 --> 47:31.840
Yeah.

47:31.840 --> 47:36.840
And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good,

47:39.520 --> 47:42.120
food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.120
What are you betting on?

47:44.120 --> 47:47.760
So let's like cleanse the palate, what's good?

47:47.760 --> 47:50.760
It's like Silicon Valley companies, Google and so on,

47:50.760 --> 47:51.640
that's good.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.200
When I went to Netflix,

47:53.240 --> 47:56.840
their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.680
Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth

47:59.680 --> 48:02.080
and giant bowls of Skittles.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.360
Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.800
No, those are, I'm pretty, I didn't know,

48:05.800 --> 48:07.320
I didn't get close enough, I was like,

48:07.320 --> 48:08.840
I think that was a pig.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.680
Okay.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.440
This is literally a pig.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.760
Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.360
I probably would not bet much money

48:17.360 --> 48:19.080
on CIA food being any good.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.960
Right, it's gotta suck.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.000
It's like shitty like pasta probably,

48:23.840 --> 48:25.320
it's like, maybe a little better

48:25.320 --> 48:27.160
than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.880
But anyway.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.560
How folks at the CIA please send me evidence

48:32.560 --> 48:34.760
or any other intelligence agencies,

48:34.760 --> 48:36.280
if you would like to recruit,

48:36.280 --> 48:38.280
send me evidence of better food.

48:38.280 --> 48:41.480
Yes, send Lex, can you please send Lex pictures

48:41.480 --> 48:44.720
of the CIA cafeteria and if you accidentally

48:44.720 --> 48:46.400
send them pictures of the aliens

48:46.400 --> 48:48.600
or the alien technology you have,

48:48.600 --> 48:50.080
we won't tell anybody.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.800
But the.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.200
You tried to apply, do you even have a resume?

48:54.200 --> 48:57.800
No, the CIA would never fucking hire me, ever.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.560
But like I applied for the job

48:59.560 --> 49:02.720
and just out of curiosity, what happens?

49:02.720 --> 49:05.440
And then at the end of the application,

49:05.440 --> 49:07.680
when you hit enter, it says,

49:07.680 --> 49:09.040
well first it says don't tell anyone

49:09.040 --> 49:11.000
you applied for the CIA, so I'm already out.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.880
But the second thing it says is,

49:12.880 --> 49:15.480
you don't need to reach out to us, we'll come to you.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.440
Which is really, when you're like,

49:17.440 --> 49:19.560
it's late at night and you're being an asshole

49:19.560 --> 49:21.240
and you haven't applied to work at the CIA,

49:21.240 --> 49:23.560
it's kind of the last thing you wanna hear.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.960
You know, I don't wanna be secretly approached

49:25.960 --> 49:28.320
by some intelligence officer.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.680
And now anyone who talks to you,

49:29.680 --> 49:31.400
you think is the CIA's saying,

49:31.400 --> 49:33.280
remember that time you applied?

49:33.280 --> 49:34.680
Oh God, yeah.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.480
Sometimes I'm like, oh shit, are you one of them?

49:37.480 --> 49:41.040
You and Joe had a bunch of conversations

49:42.160 --> 49:44.880
and they're always incredible.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.720
Thanks.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.800
So in terms of this dance of conversation,

49:47.800 --> 49:51.920
of your friendship, of when you get together,

49:51.920 --> 49:56.840
what is that world you go to that creates magic together?

49:56.840 --> 50:00.080
Because we're talking about how we do that with robots.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.920
How do these two biological robots do that?

50:02.920 --> 50:04.120
Can you introspect that?

50:04.120 --> 50:08.480
I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator

50:08.480 --> 50:11.080
of the comedy store, this club in LA.

50:11.080 --> 50:14.360
And my job was to take phone calls from comics.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.440
And so at some point, I don't know,

50:17.440 --> 50:18.760
I ended up on the phone with Joe

50:18.760 --> 50:21.320
and we just started talking.

50:21.320 --> 50:25.480
And you know, I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.960
We just had been talking for like 30 minutes.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.280
That's what our friends are, you know?

50:28.280 --> 50:29.680
We're just like, we're having fun talking.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.120
And then he would just call and we would talk.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.120
And we would basically, I mean,

50:34.120 --> 50:35.800
it was no different from the podcast.

50:35.800 --> 50:39.600
Like the conversations we have on the podcast

50:39.600 --> 50:41.960
are identical to the conversations we had

50:41.960 --> 50:44.600
before he was even doing a podcast.

50:44.600 --> 50:49.600
So I think people are just seeing two friends

50:50.040 --> 50:52.840
hanging out who like talking to each other.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.480
Yeah, but there's this weird,

50:55.480 --> 50:57.960
like you serve as catalyst for each other

50:57.960 --> 51:00.400
to go into some crazy places.

51:00.400 --> 51:02.880
So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity

51:02.880 --> 51:06.960
and willingness to not be constrained,

51:06.960 --> 51:09.800
to not be limited to the constraints of reality.

51:10.760 --> 51:11.600
Yeah, that.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.200
In your exploration of my test.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.760
That's a very, very nice way of saying that.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.280
He's just like build on top of each other.

51:17.280 --> 51:21.040
Like, you know, what if things are like this

51:21.040 --> 51:23.360
and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other

51:23.360 --> 51:24.840
and it just goes to crazy places,

51:24.840 --> 51:27.520
add some drugs into that and just goes wild.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.320
Yeah, and you know, he like, it's so cool

51:29.320 --> 51:33.320
because it's like, you know, it's a, for me,

51:33.320 --> 51:35.680
it's like a really, it's like sometimes

51:35.680 --> 51:38.760
maybe I'll throw something out that he will take

51:38.760 --> 51:40.760
and the Lego building blocks you're talking about,

51:40.760 --> 51:42.960
they lead to him saying like the funniest shit

51:43.920 --> 51:45.760
that I've ever heard in my life.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.600
So it's, that's a cool thing to watch.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.840
It's just like some idea you've been kicking around,

51:49.840 --> 51:52.320
you watch his brain shift that

51:52.320 --> 51:55.120
into like something supremely funny.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.320
I really love that, man.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.360
That's just like a fun thing to like see happen.

51:59.360 --> 52:03.200
He knows that I fucking hate the videos

52:03.200 --> 52:04.880
of animals eating each other.

52:04.880 --> 52:06.000
Like, I don't like that.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.440
I don't want to watch it.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.040
I hate watching it.

52:09.040 --> 52:12.160
I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast

52:12.240 --> 52:15.840
that I dislike it when he shows animals eating each other,

52:15.840 --> 52:18.720
but he knows, because he knows me.

52:18.720 --> 52:21.800
And so he tortures, like when he starts doing that,

52:21.800 --> 52:24.240
it's like this kind of benevolent torture

52:24.240 --> 52:26.520
as he's like asking Jamie to pull up

52:26.520 --> 52:29.400
increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.080
So it's just a, it's a, it's just a friendship.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.600
Even in torture, because I'm reading about torture

52:34.600 --> 52:36.680
in the Gulag Archipelago currently,

52:36.680 --> 52:38.000
there's a bit of a camaraderie.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.240
You're in it together, the torturer and the tortured.

52:41.360 --> 52:42.600
What?

52:42.600 --> 52:45.320
Oh God, that's so fucked up, man.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.040
I've never.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.200
No, I mean, part of it was joke,

52:49.200 --> 52:50.760
but as I was saying it that.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.600
You're right.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.760
That also comes out in the book,

52:53.760 --> 52:54.880
because they're both fucked.

52:54.880 --> 52:59.200
They're both, they're both have no control of their fate.

53:00.800 --> 53:05.480
That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany

53:05.480 --> 53:07.240
and the people in the camps.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.640
The worst was brought out in the guards.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.640
But they were all in it together in some dark way.

53:15.640 --> 53:18.960
They were both fucked by a very powerful system

53:18.960 --> 53:20.520
that put them in that place.

53:20.520 --> 53:23.720
And both of us could be either player in that system,

53:23.720 --> 53:25.080
which is the dark.

53:25.080 --> 53:28.600
Reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals

53:28.600 --> 53:31.040
that the line between good and evil

53:31.040 --> 53:32.400
runs through the heart of every man,

53:32.400 --> 53:36.280
as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.440
But it is that amidst all of that,

53:38.440 --> 53:41.400
there's, I don't know, the good vibes,

53:41.400 --> 53:43.800
the positivity comes out from the both of you.

53:43.800 --> 53:44.920
And that's beautiful to see.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.840
That is, I suppose, friendship.

53:46.840 --> 53:48.960
What do you think makes a good friend?

53:48.960 --> 53:52.760
Oh, God, I mean, it's a billion things

53:52.760 --> 53:53.600
that make a good friend,

53:53.600 --> 53:55.960
but I think you could break it down to some RGB.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.600
I think you can go RGB with a good friendship.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.120
Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.920
Yeah, yeah, I think you could probably come up

54:02.920 --> 54:05.280
with some fundamental qualities of friendship.

54:05.280 --> 54:09.240
And I'd say, number one, it's love.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.920
Like, it's friendship is love.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.480
It's a form of love.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.440
So obviously without that, I don't know how you,

54:17.440 --> 54:18.320
I mean, I'm not saying,

54:18.320 --> 54:20.400
I think if you're true friends, you love each other.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.400
So you need that.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.160
But love, obviously, it's not, that's not enough.

54:25.160 --> 54:29.080
It's like with true friends,

54:29.080 --> 54:31.200
I have to be like incredibly honest with each other.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.480
And not like, you know what I mean?

54:32.520 --> 54:35.840
But not like, I don't like,

54:35.840 --> 54:37.880
I think there's a kind of like,

54:37.880 --> 54:38.760
I don't know if you've ever noticed,

54:38.760 --> 54:39.600
like some people who say,

54:39.600 --> 54:41.440
you know, I just tell it like it is.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.280
But the thing they-

54:42.280 --> 54:43.240
Those are always the assholes.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.440
Yeah, why is it that your tell it like it is

54:45.440 --> 54:46.680
is always negative?

54:46.680 --> 54:48.400
Why is it, it's always cynical or shitty,

54:48.400 --> 54:50.920
or you're like nagging somebody or me.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.360
How come you're not telling it like it is

54:52.360 --> 54:53.840
when it's good too?

54:53.840 --> 54:54.680
You know what I mean?

54:54.680 --> 54:56.760
So sort of like trust,

54:56.760 --> 55:01.760
but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.

55:02.120 --> 55:02.960
You know what I mean?

55:02.960 --> 55:06.720
Like you know that your friend loves you

55:06.720 --> 55:09.320
and wants you to be yourself.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.520
Because if you weren't yourself,

55:10.520 --> 55:11.880
then you wouldn't be their friend.

55:11.880 --> 55:12.960
You'd be some other thing.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.240
But also they might be seeing your blind spots

55:17.240 --> 55:20.080
that other people in your life, your family,

55:20.080 --> 55:23.240
your wife, whoever might not be seeing.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.720
So that's a good friend is someone who like

55:25.720 --> 55:28.680
loves you enough to when it matters,

55:28.680 --> 55:31.760
be like, hey, are you all right?

55:31.760 --> 55:35.120
And then help you see something you might not be seeing.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.720
But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.160
Yeah, there is something.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.960
I mean, it's just what I've,

55:41.960 --> 55:45.040
this world, especially if you're a public figure,

55:45.040 --> 55:50.040
this world has its plenty of critics.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.200
And it feels like a friend,

55:53.960 --> 55:58.960
the criticism part is already done for you.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.720
I think a good friend is just there to support,

56:02.720 --> 56:05.000
to actually notice the good stuff.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.680
But you in comedy, we need like the what,

56:08.680 --> 56:11.240
like it's really good in comedy

56:11.240 --> 56:13.360
to have somebody you can like be like,

56:13.360 --> 56:14.480
what do you think of that?

56:14.480 --> 56:16.320
And know that they're not gonna be like that.

56:16.320 --> 56:18.280
But that's for the craft, the craft itself,

56:18.280 --> 56:19.880
like the work you do, not the,

56:20.720 --> 56:25.360
yeah, interesting, but that's so tough.

56:25.360 --> 56:27.120
Yeah, whatever your particular art form

56:27.120 --> 56:28.480
or whatever you are doing,

56:28.480 --> 56:29.640
I mean, you don't always be leaning

56:29.640 --> 56:32.640
on your friend's opinions for like your own innovation,

56:32.640 --> 56:35.040
but it's nice to know that you have someone who,

56:35.040 --> 56:37.000
not just with jokes, but with anything,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.640
if you go to them and run something by them,

56:39.640 --> 56:42.240
they're gonna like, they're gonna be honest with you

56:42.240 --> 56:45.360
about like their real feelings regarding that thing

56:45.360 --> 56:47.000
because that helps you grow as a person.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.160
We need that and it hurts sometimes

56:49.400 --> 56:50.880
and we don't wanna hurt our friends.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.480
One of the more satanic like impulses

56:53.480 --> 56:56.160
when you're with somebody is not wanting

56:56.160 --> 57:00.160
to honestly answer whatever they're asking in that regard

57:00.160 --> 57:03.000
or wanting to like put their temporary feelings

57:03.000 --> 57:06.720
over something that you've recognized is maybe not great.

57:06.720 --> 57:09.520
I'm not saying a friendship is something

57:09.520 --> 57:12.120
where you're always critiquing or evolving each other.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.600
It's not your therapist or whatever,

57:13.600 --> 57:15.880
but it's nice when it's there.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.760
I think that's another aspect of friendship.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.800
Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.

57:20.800 --> 57:22.840
You notice, I've met people in my life

57:22.840 --> 57:25.280
where almost immediately sometimes it takes time

57:25.280 --> 57:27.800
where you notice like there's a magic between the two of you.

57:27.800 --> 57:31.520
Like, oh shit, you seem to be made from the same cloth.

57:31.520 --> 57:33.160
Yeah. Whatever that is.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.560
Well, you know, we have a name for that

57:34.560 --> 57:36.600
in the spiritual community, it's called satsang

57:36.600 --> 57:38.560
and it's, I love the idea.

57:38.560 --> 57:42.200
It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea

57:42.200 --> 57:45.160
of infinite recurrence is true,

57:45.160 --> 57:47.360
then your satsang would be the people

57:47.360 --> 57:50.200
you've been infinitely recurring with.

57:50.200 --> 57:53.360
And those are the people where you run into them

57:53.360 --> 57:55.320
and you've never met them,

57:55.320 --> 57:58.040
but it's like you're picking up a conversation

57:58.040 --> 58:00.200
that you never had.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.040
Yeah. That.

58:02.040 --> 58:05.560
And that is based on an idea of like,

58:05.560 --> 58:07.320
this isn't the only life.

58:07.320 --> 58:08.520
We're always hanging out together.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.120
We always show up together.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.160
You've had a brush with death.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.120
You had cancer, you survived cancer.

58:14.120 --> 58:14.960
Yeah.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.480
How has that changed you?

58:16.720 --> 58:18.800
What have you learned about life,

58:18.800 --> 58:21.320
about death, about yourself,

58:21.320 --> 58:23.280
about the whole thing we're going through here

58:23.280 --> 58:24.560
from that experience?

58:24.560 --> 58:25.960
You were just in the Ukraine.

58:25.960 --> 58:26.800
Yes.

58:26.800 --> 58:30.160
And you were making observations on this,

58:30.160 --> 58:34.240
what could, if you heard about it and weren't there,

58:34.240 --> 58:36.520
seem like it doesn't make any sense at all,

58:36.520 --> 58:40.760
which is people there are connecting,

58:40.760 --> 58:41.920
they've lost everything,

58:41.920 --> 58:43.360
but they're just happy to be alive.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.960
They're happy their friends are alive.

58:44.960 --> 58:47.280
So you witness this like,

58:47.280 --> 58:48.720
when you get in the cancer club

58:48.720 --> 58:51.880
and you're hanging out with people going through cancer

58:51.880 --> 58:54.120
or who have survived cancer,

58:54.120 --> 58:59.120
you see this beautiful connection with life

58:59.640 --> 59:01.920
that can easily sort of,

59:01.920 --> 59:04.400
you can kind of lose that connection with life

59:04.400 --> 59:05.960
if you forget you're gonna die.

59:05.960 --> 59:09.640
Forgetting you're gonna die or that you can die

59:09.640 --> 59:12.160
is not just, I think from an evolutionary perspective

59:12.160 --> 59:14.160
where survival is the game,

59:14.800 --> 59:17.320
not gonna improve your survival chances,

59:17.320 --> 59:18.960
if you think you're immortal,

59:20.520 --> 59:23.720
but also forgetting that you're gonna die

59:23.720 --> 59:26.920
and that everything is around you

59:26.920 --> 59:28.640
and everything, your clothes are probably

59:28.640 --> 59:30.280
gonna last longer than you.

59:30.280 --> 59:33.880
Your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.720
So forgetting these things,

59:37.000 --> 59:38.720
it can lead,

59:38.720 --> 59:40.680
and I know why people don't wanna think about death

59:40.720 --> 59:43.040
because it's scary, it's fucking scary.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.640
It's terrifying.

59:44.640 --> 59:48.320
So I get why people don't wanna think about it.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.920
But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die

59:51.920 --> 59:53.520
or just don't think about death

59:53.520 --> 59:55.720
or don't at least address it,

59:57.800 --> 59:59.640
then I won't feel scared.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.200
But it can have the opposite effect,

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.760
which is you can end up missing a lot of moments.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.120
You could, or you start doing the old

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.640
kick the can down the road thing

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.840
where you're coming up with a variety of ways

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.760
to procrastinate, making it work now,

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.120
because this fucking human lifespan idea, man,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.680
it's really caused a lot of problems.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.840
When they started saying, on average,

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.640
this is how many years you're gonna live

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.240
if you're a human being,

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.640
man, that is really bad

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.760
because a lot of people hear that

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.960
and they feel like that's a guaranteed number of years

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.520
in some temporal bank.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.160
Or do they have access to?

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.400
And when you get cancer,

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.280
that's like when you get the alert on your phone

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.600
where you're like, what the fuck, wait, what?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.600
Like, oh shit, either I don't know

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.760
how much money's in that bank account

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.040
or I have way less than I thought.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.800
And so at that point, you get to be in the truth

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.480
because that's ultimately, I think that's-

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.560
That's what it feels like because it feels like truth.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.360
It's the truth, it's the truth.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.040
Like the whole bubble of ignorance

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.440
that you subconsciously built around yourself

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.920
to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality,

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.600
it's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.680
talking to you just shatters that thing.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.600
And now you're like,

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.000
especially with, I had testicular cancer.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.720
So when you get the diagnosis,

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.560
it's just like the movies.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.160
The doctor took me in his office and you just know,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.040
I got cancer.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.240
It's like, you don't even have to say,

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.440
it's like, I know what you're about to say,

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.280
I'm in the office, I know how this goes.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.360
But you go in there and what you were thinking,

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.880
oh, you know, probably just have some weird thing

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.840
in my ball, that's why it's swollen up like that.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.360
Anytime I've gone to the doctor, you always leave,

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.880
like, oh, cool, I'm fine.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.440
But no, that's not how you're gonna leave the doctor.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.480
You're gonna leave the doctor

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.400
in a completely different universe

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.560
than the one you grew up in.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.920
You're gonna go from, talk about multiverse.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.760
You just popped into a brand new multiverse.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.240
So what was the conversation with the doctor like?

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.280
Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor,

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.160
boys that are hard conversation.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.360
I feel like you need to build up philosophically

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.280
to that conversation.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.280
Oh no, oh no, there's not time.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.520
He's busy, he's got other appointments, you know?

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.000
Also, if you're gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.200
not that there is a great cancer to get,

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.400
but that's a good one because it moves slowly.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.720
The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.680
And so if you catch it early,

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.680
then generally it's good, you can survive it.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.520
So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.040
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.840
But he didn't really do, he couldn't really offer that hope

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.080
because we had to find out how far

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.280
the cancer progressed in my body.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.000
And that's the next step is like,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.440
as soon as they tell you you have cancer,

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.760
they move quick.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.440
They're like, we're going to schedule the surgery for,

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.560
I think this was a Thursday or a Friday.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.720
They're like, we're gonna schedule it for Tuesday.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.000
Here's the chance, we don't know for sure it's cancer.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.840
That's what they say.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.440
There's a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.680
There is some possibility, it could be something else.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.800
The only way we can know is like doing a biopsy.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.520
And the only way that we can get that biopsy

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.200
is by cutting one of your balls off.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.320
He didn't say it like that,

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.960
but that's pretty much the logic behind it.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.520
It's like, we gotta get this thing, it's like a zombie bite.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.920
We gotta hack this fucking thing off

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.400
and we gotta do it fast.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.440
Did you say it in a way that you understood?

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.160
Yeah, what they do is because they know

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.560
that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.200
that their ability to comprehend information changes.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.800
When you get a cancer diagnosis, all the tropes, they happen.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.400
You're hearing it's weird.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.480
You're basically having like a anxiety attack,

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.320
if I had to guess.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.440
It's like a hardcore anxiety attack.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.000
And then a nurse is there with me as he's explaining it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.160
And then her job is, even though he's telling me

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.920
how to get to the machine that's gonna scan my body

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.360
to see if it's gotten into my brain,

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.360
he knows I'm not gonna remember that.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.200
And so this nurse, when you're in this like fog,

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.080
takes you, at least took me to the machine

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.600
that does the scan,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.360
but you're not gonna get that data back for a few days.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.360
And so that's where you really live in the real world.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.960
That's the real world.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.720
Such a fascinating moment in the days that follow

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.040
and even in that moment, because that doctor,

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.720
you talk about the matrix where like the pills and so on,

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.960
you get the blue pill and the red pill.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.840
Yeah.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.840
This is like the real world introduction,

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.360
the human introduction is the truth.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.240
You've now just taken the red pill.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.200
You get to see the truth of reality.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.120
And here's a busy doctor just telling you.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.960
Yeah.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.800
All those dreams you've had,

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.320
all those illusions you've built up

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.320
that somehow your work as a comedian and actor

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.760
will make you live forever somehow.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.280
It's just the basic illusion we have that we're,

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.800
this whole project is gonna be an infinite sequence

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.360
of fun things that we're gonna get to do.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.880
It's like, holy shit, it's not.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.280
That's right.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.120
That's right.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.960
And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.640
And there's very dumb ways of doing that.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.800
And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.920
Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.840
of subjective consciousness.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.880
So like, I'd been sort of kicking around this,

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.240
I think they call it solipsism.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.920
It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self-aware,

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.480
but no one else can prove that they're self-aware.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.720
Like I don't, I have no way of proving

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.200
that everything around me isn't just a video game,

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.160
isn't just some projection, isn't, who knows what.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.240
So maybe everybody else dies, they're NPCs,

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.240
but I don't because I'm the only thing I know

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.160
that has subjective consciousness.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.040
Now it's not like I really believed that.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.480
It's like an idea you toy around with

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.600
when you're trying to evade confronting the reality

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.520
of your own mortality.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.440
It's just, the brain will produce all kinds

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.160
of ridiculous forms of ignorance.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.360
And that was one I'd been playing around with.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.760
Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life,

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.800
you were playing around with that?

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.840
Well, not like really,

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.800
I think it's important to really emphasize,

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.960
I didn't think I was immortal.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.640
Like I knew at some level, I'm probably gonna die.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.000
Everyone dies.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But there's ways that you can sort of poke around

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.640
with that idea.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.000
I still do it to this day.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.440
Like I still do it.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.720
Like it's a natural thing to do when you're confronted

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.160
with that, with annihilation.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.400
You want a way out.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.640
You want to talk your way out, figure it out.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.880
There's gotta be some way to fix it.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.960
Well, they'll fix it.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.560
That's another thing people do.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.520
Well, they'll fix it.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.840
Yeah, it'd be fine.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840
They'll expand the human lifespan.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.680
That's what they'll do.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.000
I mean, that's a big argument for it is like,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.440
look, the human lifespan up until COVID,

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.560
which they had to recalculate like the lifespan

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.320
because of the statistically all the people who died,

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.560
it like threw it off a little bit.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.400
But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.040
seemed to be increasing by half a year every year,

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:39.880
something like that.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.240
We were living longer.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.160
So all you gotta do, one more half a year

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.520
and we're immortal, right?

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.880
If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.280
And so that's another way you can get out

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.320
of confronting death is you can think,

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.560
well, maybe right now we don't have the tech,

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.400
but it's coming.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.480
Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever,

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.120
depending on how you want to look at it.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.640
Another way people try to score them out

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.640
of the reality of death.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.080
There's all kinds of tricks.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.560
And we do all of them.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.120
A lot of religions provide different,

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.920
even more tools than the toolkit for coming up

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.280
with ideas of how you can live in the illusion

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.280
that we're not going to.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.040
There's not an end to this particular experience

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.960
that we're having here on earth right now.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.720
And then when you get that cancer diagnosis,

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.040
it's like, yeah, what was that like going home?

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.680
The car ride, did you drive home alone?

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.520
Yeah.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.120
I mean, it was one of them.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.120
What'd you listen to?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.400
Bruce Springsteen or?

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.840
Bruce Springsteen.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.000
Hey little girl, is your daddy home?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.200
That's not a good one to listen to.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.320
Does he have cancer?

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.000
Is he gonna die?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.760
Yeah, all the love songs.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.520
Maybe you experienced them more intensely.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.400
I don't remember why I listened to you

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.640
and I don't remember driving home,

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.800
but I do remember driving to another doctor appointment,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.960
doctor's appointment the next day.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.240
I think it was the next day.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.320
I think the Goodyear Blimp was floating in the sky

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.320
and I was looking, I was at a stoplight looking around.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.160
Is that God?

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.600
Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.440
It's gonna be great.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440
Oh, you were looking, oh wow.

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.760
No, I didn't think that.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.920
What I thought was this shit just keeps going.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.000
That's what I thought.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.760
I thought I'm gonna be gone

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.800
and it's just gonna keep going.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.880
And that was a beautiful moment for me.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.440
It was this beautiful moment of like-

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.680
You're able to accept it?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.480
Oh yeah, no, like that's just what you're talking about

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.120
with the Ukraine, what you're talking about.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.160
It's like, unless you've been there,

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.400
it's really hard to explain to people

01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.400
that even in the midst of what is generally accepted

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.120
is one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.160
war, cancer, somehow there's still joy.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.560
There's still love.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.880
There's still, in fact, more.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.720
It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off,

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.520
when you get your mouth worked on,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.080
you start feeling again.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:25.640
You're feeling, you're noticing and that, wow.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.720
But yet, thank goodness.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.520
I think there's other ways for us to achieve

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.640
this state of consciousness that don't involve war or cancer.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.480
Thank God.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.320
Do you think just meditating on your mortality

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.920
is one such mechanism?

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.920
Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.480
in the day-to-day illusion of life,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.040
just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.760
The most spiritual, he is great.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.840
Maybe Johnny Cash hurt, maybe that one.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.680
I like Bruce Springsteen.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.280
I ain't knocking Bruce Springsteen.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.720
I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.520
His music's fantastic.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.360
Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.200
You know what?

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.120
I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.560
I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.560
Oh, I'm on fire.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.400
It's so good.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.240
Yeah, it's a good song.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.080
That's one of the-

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.680
At night, I lay with the sheets soaking wet

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.920
and the freight train running through the middle of my head

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.520
and only you can cool my desire.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.920
And he's thinking about someone else's girl.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.840
What a fucking nightmare.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.240
Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.960
with a freight train running through his head,

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.320
thinking about banging your wife and you're out of town.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.160
Oh my God.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.920
Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Holy shit, this guy's gonna get my wife.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.760
It's Bruce Springsteen.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.080
Yeah, you gotta take the other guy's-

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.320
But it's love.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.240
Both perspectives.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.920
I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.320
when he's sweating in bed,

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.960
waiting to go to somebody's house and-

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.520
She does too.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.480
What, does that marry?

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.120
If he's gonna break up that marriage,

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.280
that marriage wasn't strong enough, right?

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.040
I mean, that relation, I mean, that's the way of love.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.880
What marriage could survive?

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.000
Bruce Springsteen.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.240
Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.300
Well, maybe one that's based on financial,

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.560
sort of financial dynamics versus like love

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.800
and sweaty Bruce Springsteen.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.360
Like romantic connections.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.040
Cause there's a music video of that

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.880
where he's like a mechanic, I think.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.560
So he's like the poor mechanic

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.200
who falls in love with this girl and there's that magic.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.460
I've seen that magic.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.480
You connect with people like, I'll see somebody,

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.400
I think Jack Kerouac has that way.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:54.400
He meets this Mexican girl on a bus

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.840
and like he talks about that heartbreak you feel

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.980
when you realize this person you just fell in love with

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.820
in a split second is heading somewhere else

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.960
in this too big world.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.760
But then he actually realizes in a spoiler alert

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.480
for on the road that they're actually heading the same way

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.400
and he now builds up the courage to talk to her

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.680
and they kind of fall in love for a few days.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.960
And then he realized, eventually realizes

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.240
that she may not be the perfect person for him.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.080
And all the jealousy comes out.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.640
He's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all?

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.680
And then she's probably some kind of,

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.560
I mean, and that's, it's not very politically correct,

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.960
but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.400
and he talks to her about like, who's your pimp

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.240
and all that kind of stuff.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.120
He attacks her and all that kind of way

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.720
when she's just an innocent.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.640
She has a past of that kind,

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.720
but she's an innocent person and they connect

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.400
and they fell in love with each other.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.000
Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.240
But that sometimes it doesn't work out that way

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.040
and there's that heartbreak when you see,

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.320
you realize you're never gonna be able to have that.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.040
And that's Bruce Springsteen saw that.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.760
This is a married woman.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.480
I'm never gonna be able to have that, but I want that.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.640
And that's the heartbreak.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.240
I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.400
Like I didn't-

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.600
You mean after the song?

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.480
Like the song doesn't get to-

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.240
Little girl, is your daddy home?

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.520
Did he go away and leave you all alone?

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.280
You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.640
Yeah, but it never materializes.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.080
He's longing.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.360
It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.280
So he's longing for, he's talking about the longing,

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.280
not with the having.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.440
Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this,

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.440
can you look into Bruce Springsteen's file

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.600
and let us know if he actually banged the person

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.440
you wrote that song about.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.160
Right between the song, we want facts.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.680
Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.440
Here's what's interesting about that thing

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.840
that you're talking about.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.400
Have you ever heard of something called Bhakti Yoga?

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.240
I think so, yeah.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.880
It's the yoga of love and there's forms of it.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.240
The one people know about the most is the Hare Krishnas,

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.800
but the Hare Krishnas are like the way in Christianity,

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.360
you've got the Episcopalians, the Catholics, the Baptists.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.880
In Bhakti Yoga, you have various deities

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.920
that are the object of love.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.920
And so Bhakti Yoga is like, and what's really cool about it

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.880
is it's an analysis of love.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.560
And so, and it's the supposition being

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.560
like love is the way to commune with the divine.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.560
Now, a distinction is drawn between like two big world views

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.040
that are spiritual.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.040
One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.040
that you'll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism,

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040
if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.760
or understanding that you might not be anything at all.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.400
That in fact, you're part of everything.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.400
And in that, there's a potential relief from suffering

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.200
in that, not just like intellectually knowing it,

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.120
but becoming it.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Now, whereas in Bhakti Yoga, there's this idea of like,

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.480
the best thing is to be the individual

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.880
because individuals are required for love,

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.760
for love to work, embodied love.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.760
And so the quality, the thing we call the experience of love

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.880
is something that can be cultivated.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.560
It doesn't just have to be for another person.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.800
It doesn't have to be for the stranger on the bus.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.920
It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.920
that you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.160
Because obviously it's the Hare Krishnas,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.240
it's a theistic religion.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.920
They believe in Krishna, who is the,

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.280
from the POV of Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga,

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.240
the Godhead, the source from which everything flows

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.840
into time and space.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.840
So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.680
It's not just, most people are familiar with Krishna

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.120
from the Bhagavad Gita.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.640
They're about to be more, what's cool about it

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.680
is cause it's like they're making the Oppenheimer movie

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.720
and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.920
when they split the atom.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.080
But there's all these stories of Krishna

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.640
that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.640
And these stories, they could seem very simple

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.640
when taken literally, but in Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga,

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.560
it's this very advanced theistic yogic system.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.520
So they take these stories and from these stories,

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:01.520
they extrapolate this incredible analysis of what love is

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.680
and how to connect with the universe.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.240
So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani,

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.240
and so sometimes they're getting along.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.760
Sometimes they're fighting.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.920
Sometimes they're separated.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.920
And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.560
are modes of love.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.840
So longing actually is considered

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.080
one of the highest forms of love.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.120
The idea is the longing is the grace.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.760
The longing is the love.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.280
So when you find yourself in a situation of longing

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.200
and heartbreak, it is identical to union.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.960
And perhaps more intense, more intensely representative

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.480
of the essence of what is love.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.600
Yes, and they call it pining.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.560
So it's pining for Krishna.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.680
And also there's other ways you could be with Krishna

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.800
is as a friend.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.800
So this is another form of love or as a mother

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.480
because Krishna has a mother.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.120
So there's all these ways of looking

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.440
at the various forms of love.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.920
And it's a really beautiful form of yoga.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.760
That's emphasizing the individual

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.200
and the individual as a kind of channel

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.720
to this universal love.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.320
Yeah, there's a lot of different,

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.480
like their answer to the question

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.640
of what shows up in Buddhism is absolute

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.760
and relative reality.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.120
Like that obviously there's relative reality.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.480
We're not right now.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.200
You and me are not unitive consciousness.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:49.040
Like you zoom back far enough

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.200
and we're gonna seem like an atom or whatever.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.360
The thing is the trope is you can zoom back far enough

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.520
and we're in a, whatever,

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.280
we're in a piece of cheese or something, who knows?

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.240
But in that way, we're like completely unified.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.200
But simultaneously we're individuals,

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.040
like for sure we're individuals.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.640
Like you still gotta pay your taxes.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.240
You gotta make your social security number.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.480
That's relative reality.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.600
So Buddhism is like kind of the balance.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.040
Again, when I say Buddhism is,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.920
I'm a comedian, podcaster.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.120
I'm not some Buddhist expert.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.880
This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.240
But anyway, in bhakti yoga,

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.240
there's the concept that it's called,

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.520
I'm gonna mispronounce it,

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.280
asinka-sinka-beta-tattva.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.920
I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it,

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.760
which means simultaneous oneness and difference.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.600
So.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.960
Oneness and difference.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.880
Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.640
So that's why the oneness is the more part

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.600
of the same piece of cheese

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.040
and the difference is we are still each paying taxes.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.680
Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.480
So, or other ways it gets described as like,

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.480
a photon blasting off the sun has sunlight qualities,

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.160
but it's not the sun.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.440
Humans, being one of the many things

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.080
flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine,

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.080
have qualities that are weirdly like the God-like.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.560
In fact, we wanna control primarily.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560
That's one of the problems,

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.120
like humans wanna be in control,

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.920
where from the bhakti yoga perspective,

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.920
Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.520
And so within the system,

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.680
the individual parts of the system have that same quality,

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.960
but you can't, you're probably not God.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.160
You might be, I'm not.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.480
Oh, what do you think happens after we die?

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.480
Having come close to that cliff

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.840
and almost got pushed over once,

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.120
what do you think happens

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.240
when you do get pushed off the cliff?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.240
Okay, I feel dumb that I'm even gonna like preface this

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.760
by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.120
and I think that's one of the cool things about death.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.080
No idea.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.680
The CIA probably does.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.600
You think the CIA?

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.840
I love, like we've decided your audience is the CIA.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.840
How would you, oh wait, I won't.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.000
Because there's a lot of suspicion

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.200
that I might be FSB and Mossad,

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.640
so I'm trying to rebrand,

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.320
I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.800
As far as what happens when you die,

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.800
one thing I return to when I'm getting overly complex

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.680
is the idea of as above, so below.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.760
So that you can, a lot of the big questions

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.160
can be answered by your own experience now.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.160
So in other words, like in terms of thinking about like death,

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.280
if you look back to baby legs versus adult legs,

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.600
where's the baby?

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.680
Like baby's gone.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.720
You've regenerated all your cells many times by then.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.240
So in a way you could say Lex baby died.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.560
The death didn't look like a typical,

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.120
and I'm not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying,

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.880
it was very natural that the death of that baby.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.280
It just, it just.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.320
In many ways that baby died,

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.000
but I am, at least personally I'm surprised

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.280
how much the person is exactly the same.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.280
So there's many ways in which you're very different,

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.960
but there's a lot of ways in which you're very much the same.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:50.080
And I wonder if that, if there's,

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.120
if life is defined by many deaths that continue on,

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.840
and then there, I wonder if there's something persists

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.840
beyond in this, that, yeah.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.000
There is something that still persists, I wonder.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.600
Okay, so that.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.640
Now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.600
to this question that are religious,

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.200
and ranging from like the most absurd shit

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.120
you ever heard in your life, like the gold,

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.480
you're gonna get a mansion.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.800
There's gold streets.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.600
Like, do you want like gold streets?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.720
Who offers gold streets?

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.800
I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.640
The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion,

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.320
like depending on the, whatever the particular sect

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.000
of Christianity is, you know, it's like some kind of city.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.360
There's, it's like paved with gold.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.080
No one's addressing the fact that the moment

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.280
the streets are made of gold,

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.920
gold is a valueless substance.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.440
I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way,

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.600
but no one's gonna give a shit about it.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.560
It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world,

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.600
then, you know, we'd be in heaven

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.640
from that same, that way of thinking.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.480
But the...

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.560
Or honestly, when going back,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.920
this is starting to get a theme with Gulag Archipelago.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.440
I'm sorry, I'm reading it currently.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.840
That's a sticky book.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.600
Yeah, it's very sticky in your mind.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.640
Very, very tough.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.800
As I'm running through very hot heat,

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.960
I'm listening to Gulag Archipelago.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.800
Oh my God.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.000
You know, one of the things they said,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.520
they would feed prisoners salt,

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.400
and then they would exchange,

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.600
the prisoners would be able to give up anything,

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.640
everything, their gold, their possessions,

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.680
everything for just one drink of water.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:37.640
So that little context of dehydrating them

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.120
and feeding them salt

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.520
changes your value system completely.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.200
So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.360
for something that you still value deeply.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.200
Yes.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.960
Yeah, again, any of these things,

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.240
when you like take them literally, they seem absurd,

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.400
but if you look deeper into it, it's like quite beautiful.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.200
But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.520
The best way to put it is it's the kind of momentum.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.840
So the thing you're talking about,

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.560
which is the personality of the baby

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.360
that is still in the adult,

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.280
which is still in the old person,

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.920
you're looking at a kind of momentum

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.920
that does not stop upon the extinction of the body.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.520
Now, the,

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.200
there's, I think there's a lot of,

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.960
I don't wanna say harm,

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.040
because they didn't mean to hurt,

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.120
but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.920
from the way death is represented in movies.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.920
Like when people die in movies, it's like,

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.000
there's this, usually it's pretty fast,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.680
even if it is what they're dying from is a long-term disease,

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.040
it like wraps up pretty quickly, starts with a cough,

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.640
the person's in bed, but there's this weird kind of lucidity

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.440
to the person up until the point of death.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.760
And also they generally, in movies,

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.680
they have makeup on, which is always funny to me,

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.080
when the person dying looks great.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.920
If you're ever been around a dying person, they're dying.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.880
They look like shit, you're dying,

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.680
they're all gray and confused.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.160
They're, when you're around dying people,

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.640
they will spin through time,

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.640
your parents won't recognize you for a second,

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.720
they'll think you're somebody else, they won't,

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.800
they're like, everything's like the process,

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.480
the process is happening,

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.040
so you're very confused when you die.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.920
So in general, not all the time,

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.840
some people die with a clear mind,

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.600
it just depends on the type of death,

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.360
but think in terms of getting hit by a car.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.400
So you wanna cross the street, you get hit by a car.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.640
Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing,

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.840
the confusion, assuming you didn't hit your head

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.560
and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.800
and you're like bleeding out,

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.200
even then you're gonna be confused

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.440
because you're getting dizzy,

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.120
like blood's leaving your body,

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.520
you're like things are fading out, your vision's going,

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.120
so it's a very confusing experience initially

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.600
when the body dies.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.640
If you are a materialist who has been,

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.640
who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent thing,

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.040
the next bit of confusion is going to be when you realize

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.720
something is persisting here, like I'm still here,

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.680
and this is where you run into the near-death experiences,

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.240
which are a global phenomena that don't seem to be

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.000
completely shaped by culture.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.520
Regardless of what part of the world

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.560
people are having these experiences in,

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.160
the reports tend to be similar,

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.240
and everyone's heard it, the light, the life review,

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.440
seeing ancestors and stuff like that.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.640
Now, I don't know what that is.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.920
I don't know, sometimes I think that's probably

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.920
just like a built-in way the computer shuts down,

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.560
this is something it does, who knows,

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.560
but in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.360
into something called the bardo.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.280
The bardo means in between,

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.400
and there's an actual number of days

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.600
they say that you get to hang out there,

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.760
and I can't remember, it's like 37 days or 29 days

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.040
or something, I'm not sure,

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.200
but at least from the time-space perspective,

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.760
that's how long they're there.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.760
Within this place, there are a lot

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.800
of technological parallels, man.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.560
It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective,

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.880
it assesses your desires or whatever,

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.360
and then produces something that has within it

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.880
a component of attraction to you,

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.760
apparently this happens in the bardo.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.280
Or the way you wake up in the morning

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.960
and you're in a shitty mood,

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.800
and then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.880
If you don't catch it, you could just be like,

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.920
wow, I guess it's act like an asshole day.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.400
You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.920
being reflected off the screen of another person.

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.520
So in the bardo, apparently,

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.520
you don't need people for the reflective quality.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.960
These projections happen,

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.120
and they appear as either Nietzsche's demon

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.640
or Nietzsche's angel.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.400
It just depends on where you're at and how you died.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.440
And if you died scared, then at least initially,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.000
that's gonna be some scary shit you see around you.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.240
If you died in a peaceful way,

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.320
well, then there's gonna be more of a possibility

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.320
of navigation through this liminal intermediary place.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.520
And so thus, the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism,

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.520
a way to calm one's self, to not be distracted by thoughts,

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.840
which are their own apparitions.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.960
And then theoretically, if you wanted to,

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.920
instead of spinning the wheel again

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.240
and jumping back into a body,

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.120
you could choose not to do that

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.920
and then transcend the wheel of birth and death.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:04.920
But if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever,

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.560
however you wanna put it,

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.720
then you could have more control

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.920
over what your next birth might be versus,

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.000
in this depiction of things,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.960
people running from demons

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.840
that they don't recognize as their own projection

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.360
into any fucking body that they can find.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.800
Because if you've had a body, you want a body.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.560
And so this is how you can incarnate as an animal.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.040
This is how you can incarnate in the hell realms.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.240
This is how you can incarnate in any variety of things.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.640
But the idea is maybe you could slow down a little bit

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.000
and choose a birth that is gonna be more conducive to you

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:48.320
continuing to spiritually evolve.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.440
I like that idea.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440
Is it true or not?

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:51.280
Who the fuck knows?

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.920
Algorithmically speaking,

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.000
it seems like a really fun role-playing game

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.040
where you basically...

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.280
Keep improving the different parameters

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:05.760
based on your ability and willingness to meditate

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:12.160
and let go of the menial concerns of life on Earth.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.200
Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering?

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.640
What's suffering?

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.400
Okay, well, first of all,

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.280
that gets mistranslated quite a bit.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.920
You're talking about the Four Noble Truths.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.080
The first one is,

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.960
often it's translated as life is suffering,

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.800
which is not it, it's there is suffering.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.160
The whole life is suffering thing

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.640
is just like a spiritual version of life's a bitch,

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.800
then you die.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.880
And people hear that and they're like,

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.840
yeah, life is fucking suffering.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.360
But it's there is suffering, there is suffering.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.000
So it's an affirmation,

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.360
this thing that a lot of people feel

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.240
that they associate with lots of,

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.880
they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:00.880
is known as fundamental dissatisfaction.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.760
So another word for suffering

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.480
maybe could be fundamental dissatisfaction.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.560
Also, the term itself,

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.320
maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.880
So imagine when your bike doesn't have,

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.800
or your car doesn't have enough air in the tires,

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.000
or your bike doesn't have enough air in the tires,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.520
it's kind of a shitty bike ride.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.360
Like no matter what,

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.720
just kind of like, it's like uncomfortable.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.280
It's like irritating.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.720
So this is what's being pointed to

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.880
is that there's this quality within a human life

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.880
that is unsatisfying.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.240
Like a wobbly wheel.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:42.600
Wobbly wheel.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.840
Why do you think,

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.040
what is at the core of that dissatisfaction?

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.960
Because it could be as simple as kind of physical

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.520
and mental discomforts and sadness and depression

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.080
and all that kind of stuff.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.960
Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist,

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.760
the philosophical, the absurdity of it all.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.560
The fact that stuff happens,

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.240
good stuff happens for no reason,

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.960
bad stuff happens for no reason.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.920
Yeah, that it's,

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.000
no matter how much you try,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.120
there's not a universal fairness to the whole thing.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.080
There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.680
So the existentialist perspective,

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.280
what flavor of suffering do you prefer?

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.400
If it was an ice cream shop.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.240
That's so funny.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.600
Well, I'm definitely picking desire over the,

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.320
like if in the RGB that we're talking about here

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.000
is desire, aversion, and ignorance.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.080
So if you wanna find like the three ingredients

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.920
that are giving everyone their sophisticated bits

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.320
of suffering, there you go.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.840
That's what it is.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.160
In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.160
It hurts.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.080
To lose, to not have.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.400
Like, yeah, it hurts to not,

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.920
like to eternally not have,

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.240
but just like my friend pointed this out.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.680
He's like, you order something from Amazon.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.880
Like even in the smallest way,

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.600
you're excited about whatever the thing is.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.200
You order this thing from Amazon.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.120
It's not coming for four days.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.000
So those four days are gonna be somewhat marked

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.240
by you being what people say, I'm excited about it.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.760
But really, if you look at that feeling,

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.720
it's uncomfortable.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.680
Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable.

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.080
So that is a form of suffering.

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.360
That's suffering.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.200
Interesting.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.520
I mean, I wonder,

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.760
cause we naturally reframe that in our mind,

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.000
wanting.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.520
We reframe that as a good thing.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.320
And maybe suffering is fundamentally good

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.800
in the way we think of what life is.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.720
It's like, it's life affirming,

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.320
but it's not usually how the word suffering is used.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.120
Well, it's true.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:00.960
It's true.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.400
Like the first noble truth of Buddhism is true.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.320
It's called the truth of suffering.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.760
There is suffering.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.720
I mean, this is like an, I don't know,

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720
an element that you can't break it down

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.560
any further than that.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.520
Like there is suffering.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.480
This is truth.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.480
So if you think, you know,

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.960
and again, assigning like good or bad to truth,

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.240
I think maybe there's more of a sort of neutrality there.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.840
It's just what it is.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.680
It's truth.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.920
I mean, is it basically,

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.920
is suffering any disturbance from stillness

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.240
is suffering then?

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.600
Like basically anything that happens in life

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.600
that's like, that perturbs the system.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:44.880
Ripples.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.720
Ripples.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:46.560
Ripples, yeah.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.680
So a still lake is empty of suffering,

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.320
but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.040
A still lake is empty of suffering.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.480
You sound like a Zen master.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.920
Seems like something a Zen master might say.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.960
If I can just grow a beard like yours.

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.760
Ah, no, the beard doesn't help.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.600
We would.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.440
If I had your chin,

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.040
you think I'd have a fucking beard?

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.600
I look like a stork.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.440
You should see me.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.280
If I had your chin, there'd be no beard here.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.280
You have a symmetrical nice chin.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.080
This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.120
Pubic plastic surgery, friend.

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.680
That's how you know you're a professional comedian.

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.320
Yeah, so suffering.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.040
There is suffering.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.800
And the lake analogy is pretty good because the,

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.360
what's happening here is that we have become identified

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.520
with something that we call a self.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.200
So the self is just accepted.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.680
I have a self, I have an identity, I'm a person,

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:48.920
I have a self.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.920
But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself,

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.080
which is the entire thing, I'm going to find myself.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.040
You get in a van, go to California, take some acid,

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.760
fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever caroactive.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.080
I'm going to find myself.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.440
Oh, she wasn't a prostitute, just to correct the record.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.520
Oh, previously a prostitute.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:12.280
I guess once a prostitute, always a prostitute.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.120
You know what?

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:13.940
She's a former prostitute.

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.780
I don't think that.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:18.000
No, and look, I'm not, I'm not assigned it.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.320
Look, all I'm saying is, I don't care.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.160
Who cares?

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.000
Who has a bit of prostitute?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.040
God, I used to be one of them.

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:24.880
I guess it was the worst.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.000
We're all a kind of prostitute.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.800
Yeah, yes, yes.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.960
We make love and we make money.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.520
Therefore, we're all a kind of prostitute.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.280
We make, God, how great.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.760
I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.200
I mean, maybe not directly, but in some sense.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.260
Directly.

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:50.260
Do you accept men more?

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.120
It's never too late to start.

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.480
That's sort of one of the ways in

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.000
is this sort of contemplation of the identity

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.360
because it's like, it's not just the desire.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.200
It's what is having the desire?

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.480
Where does the desire live in?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.600
What doesn't wanna be where it's at?

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.160
What is the thing that is desperately wanting to get out

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.800
of the situation it's in?

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.200
And then as far as ignorance,

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.420
it's still something that's theoretically happening

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:25.640
to an identity.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:30.480
So wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like,

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.480
and that's where we run into what, into attachment.

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.760
So if the first noble truth of Buddhism is there

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:40.360
is suffering, the second noble truth of Buddhism

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.360
is the cause of this suffering is attachment.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.960
And so people hear that and they take it,

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.320
there's a lot of levels to that concept.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.080
Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.720
God, I just got addicted to vapes.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.400
Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.600
I'm smoking like a little purple thing,

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.280
it tastes like sugar.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.000
It's attachment, there is suffering.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.460
I want it, I have to charge it now.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.560
I'm embarrassed by it, it makes me feel out of control.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.560
There's a lot of suffering,

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560
but also there's deeper levels of attachment

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.480
that go all the way to this attachment

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.980
to the sense of one's self.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:28.860
I think the existentialists do get into this idea

01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.660
in a different way, which is like,

01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.660
because I think I'm a me, now I have to push

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.620
what that thing is out into the world through my actions.

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.620
And that's a kind of attachment too.

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.740
Exactly, there you go, right.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.980
And that leads to the third noble truth,

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:49.980
which is get rid of attachment and you won't suffer anymore.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.960
It seems logical, but it is a mathematical analysis

01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.500
of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.180
And then the fourth noble truth

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.860
is the eightfold path of Buddhism,

01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:09.860
which is like a process by which one could unencumber oneself

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.180
from this identification with something that isn't real.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.700
Do you need a bathroom break?

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.580
Yeah, thank you, I do.

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.900
I appreciate that.

01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.220
There's a funny moment, I was running in the heat yesterday

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.060
listening to Gulag Archipelago,

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.640
and there's a, which was a very welcome break,

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.060
because I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:37.180
The gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying,

01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.060
recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things.

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.360
And then he mentioned as one of the people

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.340
who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:52.180
And I was, I mean, I'm the same way,

01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.580
and I told him, you know, tomorrow,

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.340
it felt like a name drop.

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.260
I name dropped you this morning!

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.260
I was like, tomorrow, I'm gonna get to meet him.

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:03.740
So he says hi, and there's, oh, and he said that

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.860
he watched Midnight Gospel on mushrooms,

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.980
and it was like the greatest mushroom experience

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:13.260
of his life, I don't know.

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.060
Yeah, man, yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.620
Like, I have so much respect for you,

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.820
and like, yeah, I name dropped.

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.740
I was saying I'm going on Lex's podcast today.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.340
It's, you look, we're so lucky we all live here.

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:26.420
What the fuck, we're all living in Austin together.

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.380
Like, I somehow, like, missed that.

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.620
But that's, we all gotta hang out.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.820
We all have to, like, start doing stuff.

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.700
But you have to really, also you have to appreciate

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:41.260
this moment, I remember, I know some people

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.260
are less sentimental than others,

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:49.260
but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.820
and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was, yeah,

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:55.300
and at the back of the Comedy Store,

01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.220
shortly before COVID, I think,

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.660
and just thinking, like, there's no way

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:05.620
these things will last, and these things meaning

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:10.620
the Comedy Store, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan the Joe Rogan,

01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.940
like a podcast, influential podcasting person,

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:19.940
also a person, like, in this room, in this space,

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.420
the ability to just talk for hours

01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.420
and lose ourselves in this moment,

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.740
it just felt ephemeral somehow, temporary,

01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.780
and I just wanted to capture that moment somehow,

01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:35.140
like, I don't know, sometimes that's where

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.620
the temptation to take a picture,

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.780
I knew that kind of stuff, or record a podcast comes from,

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.100
but it just felt like it would be gone forever.

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.420
Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.420
that kind of sentimental notion of,

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.220
just wherever you end up, you just enjoy

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:51.060
the shit out of it.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:53.740
Right, that's it, and that's something

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.100
you have to cultivate, that's not an easy,

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.740
the thing you're talking about,

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.700
God, have you seen these, I think the best analogy

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.020
for what you're talking about,

01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.420
there's these videos where people give a sugar cube

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:09.340
to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food,

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.260
I think it's cotton candy,

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.620
they give the raccoon cotton candy,

01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:14.900
immediately it washes the cotton candy,

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.380
and of course, the cotton candy dissolves in the water,

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.260
and the raccoon is like, what the fuck?

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.820
Like, you know, and the thing,

01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:24.340
that grasping you're talking about,

01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.620
it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy,

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:29.780
like, the moment you get into the grasping part,

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.780
you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.820
that inspired the grasping part,

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.140
and that's, you know, some people,

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.340
that's the entirety of their lives, trying to record,

01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.420
I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.340
on the 4th of July with their phone?

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.620
It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior,

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.860
which is like, you know they're not gonna watch

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:59.100
the fireworks on their phone,

01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.580
only a lunatic would do that,

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.100
like, who's gonna go back and look at fireworks, but.

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:06.540
So, but we're also in this position where,

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.940
because of podcasting, there is some aspect

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.860
where you can record a magical moment in time,

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.020
together between two people, or even just with a camera.

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:19.500
So to get back to the lake that you were talking about,

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.260
this is emptiness, so that's emptiness,

01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.900
that's what's known as emptiness, the lake is emptiness,

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:26.860
and that's what we are, emptiness, emptiness,

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.060
and that's another thing that gets very confused

01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:34.060
in Buddhism, is that emptiness, and that emptiness is,

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:39.740
that's to me, like when I'm going to do a podcast,

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.940
that's where I try to go, I try to go just in the moment,

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:46.220
no agenda, you know, if I am nervous or whatever,

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.620
okay, I'll feel the nervousness,

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:52.140
but just drop into the moment, that's when time changes,

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.380
and then you look up hours have passed,

01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:57.020
it feels like a second, and the reason it feels like that

01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:01.580
is because if you successfully dropped into the moment,

01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:05.860
it's the lake now, it's emptiness, it's forever,

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:09.140
for a second, you're like dipping into eternity,

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:14.060
and yeah, it's a very strange thing to,

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.940
as part of that, record it, you know,

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.780
as part of that, try to like grab it

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.620
and put it out there, but it works.

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:26.260
Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour,

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:30.260
can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.140
when it's most intense and successful for you,

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.060
when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness,

01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.140
when it works, whether it's your own

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.740
or a conversation with Joe in general,

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:46.020
or yours is very specific because it's audio only,

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.380
maybe you can also speak to that,

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:51.900
you might as well be naked or you don't have to,

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:56.060
you're free of the conventions of the real world.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:01.100
I will never stop thinking it's remarkable,

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:04.100
like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me,

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.940
seems remarkable, not just technologically,

01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.660
but I'm talking to someone,

01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:11.420
I'm assuming I'm allowed to say this,

01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.420
who has robot dogs that I've been watching for years

01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:21.780
evolve on YouTube, arms reach away from one of these things,

01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:27.580
and I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.980
So for me, it's like, oh my God,

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.620
why do I get to have this conversation?

01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:36.700
Why do I get to be here when there'd be like a line,

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.360
there'd be a line that would just wrapped and wrapped

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.620
and wrapped around this building

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:43.300
and people would love a chance to just chat with you.

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.820
And so with my podcast, that's how I feel,

01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:49.300
like when I'm talking to these guests

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:55.300
who have spent, some of them have spent

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.780
their entire lifetime meditating,

01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.300
studying specific aspects of Buddhism

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.260
or even when I'm with comedians

01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:08.860
who I consider to be brilliantly funny.

01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:13.500
So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.140
I've just created some sophisticated trap for cool people

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.220
where like I get to like hang out with them.

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.780
So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it,

01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.220
just feeling lucky to be there.

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:27.420
Yeah, feeling lucky and wrestling with imposter syndrome,

01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:29.420
trying to like get that part of myself to shut up

01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:31.580
long enough so I could be in that moment

01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:33.420
that we're talking about.

01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.060
And then I carry that with me.

01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.500
It's not just like you stop the podcast,

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.620
it's like some of the things these people tell me

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.180
or some of the ways they are, it becomes part of me.

01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.540
And then I get to have a life

01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:52.060
where this thing that they gave me is in me forever.

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.420
And so, yeah, it's...

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.940
Yeah, it's cool how conversation can just,

01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.060
a few sentences can change the direction of your life.

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.820
If you're listening, if you're there

01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.660
to be transformed by the words, they will do the work.

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:09.860
And it's the full mix of it.

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:14.220
It's usually when, if you look up to somebody,

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:18.260
and it's true for me, Elise, I think it is for you

01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.220
that you start to look up

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:21.020
to basically everybody you talk to.

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:23.780
Yes, yes, good sign.

01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:24.980
That's a good sign.

01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:26.860
God forbid it goes the other way.

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.140
You're in trouble.

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.580
If all of a sudden you start looking down on people,

01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:34.300
because whatever crazy metric you're using,

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:35.940
ooh, that would freak me out.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.180
I do feel like that's a quality of getting older.

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:42.140
When I was younger, I really, I thought I was so smart.

01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:43.340
I thought I had all figured out.

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:44.820
Oh really, so you're going,

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.820
your ego is just going, taking a nosedive.

01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.860
I would like to say it's my ego taking a nosedive.

01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.420
Me and my friend talk about it a bunch.

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:55.980
We've just always associated it with doing acid

01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:57.780
for two decades straight.

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:01.780
I'm gonna just assume I'm just slowly spiraling

01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:03.140
into senility, you know?

01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:06.820
I'm just like, all the confidence,

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.100
all the like, oh, the certainty when you're having,

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.460
in college, having the great.

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:17.460
You know, you feel like you're a representative of Camus

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.260
or some shit, you know what I mean?

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:20.660
You read the myth of Sisyphus,

01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:23.780
and now you like it, know all existentialism,

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:27.620
and your certainty in regards to it is embarrassing,

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.660
but you don't see it in that way.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:31.980
You just feel certain, and then that certainty,

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.860
it just starts like, it starts crumbling a little bit,

01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.780
and then, yeah.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.420
You know, I get to actually intensely experience

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.940
that certainty in many communities,

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.380
but one in cryptocurrency.

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:50.020
Young folks with a certainty that this technology

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.580
will transform the world, and I mean,

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.820
this is almost one of the big communities

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.780
of the modern era where they believe

01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.380
that this will really solve so many of the problems

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.420
of the world, and they believe in it very intensely,

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.740
and aside from the technology and the details of the thing,

01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:09.940
all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes.

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:13.660
They'll stop me, let me explain you,

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:16.220
let me just give me a chance to tell you

01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:19.140
why this thing is extremely powerful,

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:21.700
and I just get to enjoy the glow of that,

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:26.140
because it's like, wow, I miss having that certainty

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.580
about anything.

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.980
It's probably Camus for me, too.

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:34.980
When I was younger, it's like only I deeply understand

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:40.380
the relationship of man to his mortality,

01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:42.380
and I understood that most deeply, I think,

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:44.340
when I was like 16 or 17,

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:48.260
and I am the representative of the human condition,

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:52.340
and all these adults with their busyness of day-to-day life

01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:55.620
and their concerns, they don't deeply understand

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.540
what I understand, which is the only thing that matters

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.820
is the absurdity of the human condition.

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.340
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.580
And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.

01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.260
Oh, boy, and you speak Russian?

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.100
Yeah, I speak Russian.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.660
So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian.

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:16.460
Unfortunately, I have to admit that

01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:20.500
I read all of Dostoevsky in English.

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:25.500
I came to this country when I was 13,

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.420
and at least don't remember, we read a lot,

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:31.100
but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin,

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.100
a lot of the Russian literature, but it was in Russian,

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:35.660
but I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.

01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:39.820
I wonder at which point does the Russian education system

01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:43.260
give you Dostoevsky, because it's pretty heavy stuff.

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:45.860
Second grade, it's probably the second grade.

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:46.900
Russians are intense.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.180
I don't remember, yeah, they are, they very much are.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.580
I don't remember reading Dostoevsky,

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.140
but I did Tangent upon a Tangent upon a Tangent.

01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:59.460
I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine,

01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:04.900
and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pevere

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:09.900
and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:13.060
just this famous pair that translate

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.860
most of Russian literature to English.

01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:19.860
And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10,

01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:23.020
15 hour conversation with them about the different details

01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.500
of all the translations and so on.

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:28.620
I just found myself in a very dark place mentally

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.380
where I couldn't think about podcasts

01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.220
or anything like that.

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.820
It caught me off guard.

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:36.180
So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day,

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.660
not just being stressed about Ukraine

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:40.940
and all those kinds of things.

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:44.860
But I'm still, the act of translation

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.380
is such a fascinating way to approach

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.580
some of the deepest questions that this literature raises,

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:56.500
which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.460
that has so much power and translate it

01:53:58.460 --> 01:53:59.860
into another language?

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.860
That act is actually really, really interesting.

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:05.580
And there, I found with my conversations with them,

01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:09.260
they've really thought to this stuff.

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.740
It's not just about language,

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:13.220
it's about the ideas in those books.

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.940
And that also really makes me sad

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:18.300
because I wonder how much is lost in translation.

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:22.620
I'm currently, so when I was in Ukraine,

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.580
I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had

01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:29.300
on the record were in Russian.

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:34.300
And basically 100% of the record were in Russian

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:36.340
versus in English.

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.900
And just so much is lost in those languages.

01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:42.860
And I'm now struggling

01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:45.780
because I'm launching a Russian channel

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:49.380
where there'll be a Russian overdub of Duncan.

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:50.780
Wow.

01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:53.420
Your wow will now be translated into Russian.

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:55.140
What's Russian wow?

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.580
I don't, it'll just be wow, probably.

01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.780
I'm so sorry for the difficulties

01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:01.180
of having to translate wow.

01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:04.500
Usually probably with wow, they'll leave it unoverdubbed

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.380
because people will understand exactly what you mean.

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:09.500
But that's an art form and it's a weird art form.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.500
It's like, how do you capture the chemistry,

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:19.740
the excitement, the, I don't know,

01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:24.740
maybe the humor, the implied kind of wit.

01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:27.740
I don't know, there's just layers of complexity

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:30.660
in language that is very difficult to capture.

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.500
Yeah.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.540
And I wonder how, it is sad for me

01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.140
because I know Russian, how much is lost in translation

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.660
and the same, there's a brewing conflict

01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.500
and tension with China now.

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.460
And so much is lost in the translation

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:44.500
between those languages.

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.060
Oh my God, yeah.

01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:50.780
And cultures, the entire, the music of the people

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:53.300
is completely lost because we don't know the language

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.300
or most of us don't know the language.

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:55.820
Yeah, how much of the conflict

01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:58.100
is just problems in translation?

01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:00.740
How much of the, all these problems that we're having

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:02.660
are just the alien sense of this or that?

01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:04.460
It's just as simple as that.

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:09.460
Words are getting, just a tiny warp away from the intent

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:15.180
of, if, when we both speak the same language,

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:20.540
we can still say something that offends someone

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.980
when you never intended that at all.

01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:26.460
How much more so when, like, it's,

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:29.100
not only is it a completely different sound,

01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.740
but the script itself is different.

01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:35.260
Like, what is, the Russian writing,

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:37.500
is it called Cyrillic or what's the name?

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.340
Yeah, Cyrillic.

01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.180
Cyrillic, and I don't know the name for Chinese writing,

01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:45.580
but it's like, it's a continuum that gets weirder

01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:47.140
and weirder looking, you know?

01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:49.660
Like, it's, so, yeah.

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.580
Or less weird, depending on your perspective.

01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:54.380
Yeah, I'm sure, depending on where you're at.

01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:56.340
You know, I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing

01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:58.340
from a polyglot as there could be, man.

01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:01.980
Like, but I'll tell you, at one point when I was

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.660
getting fascinated by Dostoevsky,

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:07.260
I did have this very transient fantasy

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.620
about learning Russian so that I could, like,

01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:12.420
understand the difference and it's-

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.900
You were at 17, 18 at the time.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:15.740
College.

01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:16.580
Yeah, college.

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.940
Yeah, Brothers Karamazov, Lost in that Book.

01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:20.780
Just like, oh, God.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:24.780
So, in love with it, it is-

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:27.700
Well, there's a, there's definitely,

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:30.420
like, you know, Ukraine, and this is what there,

01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:32.620
a lot of the war is about, is saying, you know,

01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.580
Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.

01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:37.060
There's a strong culture in Ukraine,

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:38.860
there's a strong culture in Russia.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.660
But, you know, I know, because that's where my family's from,

01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:45.980
there is a fascinating, strong culture.

01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:50.140
But there's such strong cultures everywhere else, too.

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.860
Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.

01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:56.220
Even, like, on a tiny island, you have these, like,

01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:59.340
subcultures that are more powerful

01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.500
than anything that exists in human history.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.500
Like, the Bronx, I don't know, like, Brooklyn,

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.660
like, different parts of New York have a certain culture,

01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.300
and then New York versus LA versus, well,

01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:12.900
and then certain places are looking for their culture.

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.060
Like, I don't, I think Austin,

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:17.620
I don't know what Austin is,

01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.700
and I don't think anyone knows.

01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:21.700
There's a traditional Austin,

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.620
and then it's evolving constantly.

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.460
Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:27.860
There's a traditional Boston,

01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:31.540
and now it's evolving with the different younger people

01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:33.540
coming from the university and staying,

01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:35.140
and all of that is evolving.

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.300
But underneath it, there's a core,

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.260
like, the American ideal of the value of the individual,

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:42.860
the value of freedom, of freedom of speech,

01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:45.780
all those kinds of things that permeates all of that.

01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:49.820
And the same thing in the history of World War II

01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:54.580
permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,

01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:57.380
the memories of all that suffering and destruction,

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.380
the broken promises of governments,

01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:04.380
and the occupier versus the liberator,

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:08.060
all that kind of stuff, all that permeates the culture.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:12.100
That affects how cynical or optimistic you are,

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:16.140
or how much you appreciate material possessions

01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:19.420
versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.

01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:23.780
Yeah, it's, I mean, this is, like, talk about absurdity.

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:26.100
I mean, this is, war is, like,

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.380
it's what absurdity looks like.

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.380
It's some kind of organized madness.

01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:33.420
None of it makes sense.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:37.300
All of it, like, it's just, none of it makes sense.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.540
But it does, but it doesn't.

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:40.260
I mean, obviously, you're defending yourself,

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:44.020
or you're taking orders that if you don't take,

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:45.220
you're going to jail.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.540
And so, or somewhere in between,

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:50.380
you know, the classic story about this,

01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:53.540
maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II.

01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.700
I'm sure everyone's heard it, because it comes up,

01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:00.700
you know, it's Christmas Eve, and they have a ceasefire.

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:03.620
And then I think they played soccer,

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:04.980
they sang Christmas songs,

02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:08.780
and then they had to force them into fighting again.

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:11.860
And so, when those moments happen,

02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:15.300
the, are you familiar with Hakeem Bey?

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.860
He's a controversial figure.

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.260
Sadly, like, he, like, I think he was like,

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:21.660
I'm not going to defame him,

02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.980
because I haven't, like, researched it correctly,

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:25.020
but some people have said shit,

02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:27.340
but since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to.

02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:30.780
But regardless, I mean, you know, look,

02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:32.860
I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny.

02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:37.060
You know, like, that's a funny comedian, but,

02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:40.140
you know, the other stuff.

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.540
Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance.

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.380
And sing.

02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.220
And sing, but there's some other stuff.

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:50.140
But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.820
of something called a temporary autonomous zone,

02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:58.780
which is that within a structure, a cultural structure,

02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:03.780
a temporary bubble of freedom will appear

02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:09.220
that by its nature gets sort of popped by the bigger bubble,

02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.860
or it runs out of resources generally is what happens.

02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:17.140
So these things will appear just out of the blue

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:22.140
that it's almost like, imagine if like on earth

02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:25.140
in some tiny little bit of earth,

02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:28.980
the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage,

02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.380
and all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever,

02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.220
but it wouldn't last.

02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:35.140
It's like that culturally, all the restrictions

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.300
and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.180
for a second, somehow this bubble appears

02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:45.180
where humans come together as the hippie ideal,

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:50.100
brothers, sisters, just humans, earthlings,

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:55.100
instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian,

02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:58.460
temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed

02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.420
by the default reality that it was appearing in,

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.980
but somehow within that space,

02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:08.540
you witness the possibility, the possibility,

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:12.060
the frustrating possibility that anyone who's thought

02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:16.100
about humanity knows this possibility,

02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:18.740
which is like, it seems like we can just get along.

02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.500
Like it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.700
and then we can just get along.

02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:26.780
Those moments are really rare.

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:28.780
It's sad, so I talked to a lot of soldiers,

02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:32.940
a lot of people that were suffered

02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:36.020
through the different aspects of that war.

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:42.140
And there's an information war that convinces each side

02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:47.300
that the other is not just the enemy, but less than human.

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:48.260
Right.

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:52.220
So there's a real hatred towards the other side.

02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.220
Yeah.

02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:56.740
And those kind of little moments where you realize,

02:02:56.740 --> 02:03:00.180
oh, they're human like me.

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:01.020
Yeah.

02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.500
And not just like human like me,

02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:06.540
but they have the same values as me.

02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:11.540
And this woman who was a really respected soldier,

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:17.380
she specializes in anti-tank and tank missiles.

02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:23.140
And she's very kind of very pragmatic,

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:25.060
very the enemy is the enemy,

02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:27.420
you have to destroy the enemy and saying like,

02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.700
there's no compassion towards the enemy.

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.660
They're not human, they're less than human.

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.620
But she said there was a moment when she remembers

02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:43.660
an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.660
to save a fellow soldier.

02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:48.260
And that risk was really stupid because he was facing,

02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.060
he was going to get destroyed.

02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:55.060
And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket

02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:59.980
at that tank and she missed.

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.380
And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:05.260
that she missed, how could she screw that up?

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:08.380
But then she realized that actually

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:13.540
maybe she missed on purpose because she realized

02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:17.980
that that man, just like she is, was a hero,

02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:21.300
just like she strives to be.

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:24.980
They were both heroes defending their own.

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:28.060
And in that way, he was just like her.

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.940
She was like, that's the only time I remember

02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:33.620
during this war ever feeling like this is another human being.

02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:36.620
But that was a very brief moment for her.

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:39.460
And I just hear that over and over and over again.

02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:44.500
These romantic notions we have of we're one,

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.380
that we're all just human.

02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:50.860
Unfortunately, during war, those notions are rare.

02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:51.820
And it's quite sad.

02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:54.980
And war in a certain way, it really destroys those notions.

02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:59.580
And one of the saddest things is it destroys it,

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:05.460
at least from what I see, potentially for generations.

02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:08.260
Not just for those people for the rest of their life,

02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.140
but for their children, their children's children.

02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.820
The hatred.

02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:16.100
I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone,

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:20.740
which is, will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians,

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:22.900
will you ever forgive the Russians?

02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:27.100
Will you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?

02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:32.100
Or do you have love for a fellow human being?

02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:36.660
And there's different ways that people struggle with that,

02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.740
different people, they saw the love,

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:43.540
they saw the hate with their known heart,

02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.500
and they struggle with the hate they have,

02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.180
and they know they can overcome it

02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:50.900
in a period of weeks and months after the war is over.

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:55.020
But some people said, no, this hate that showed up

02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:57.900
in February when the war started will be with me forever.

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.300
Well, yeah, their kids got killed.

02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:02.260
What the fuck are you gonna do about that?

02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:03.860
Like, I don't care.

02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:06.300
I've got aphorisms and cute little stories

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:08.020
about you're still in prison

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.260
if you hate your former captors.

02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:14.340
But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids,

02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.060
I'm not coming back.

02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:21.060
There's no amount, at least right now in my approximation,

02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:24.980
of spiritual literature, meditation,

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:26.820
or anything that I can really think of

02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:31.260
is going to give me that kind of space.

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:34.020
Like, I think I imagine in the same way,

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:39.020
like, I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually,

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:42.780
but do I think I'm ever gonna do that?

02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.180
That times a million.

02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:47.980
So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate,

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:52.020
because it's like, what are you gonna say?

02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:53.660
What are you gonna say to someone like that?

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:58.660
Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go.

02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:00.460
It was just your kids.

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.660
It was just something you loved

02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.380
more than anything in the world.

02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:07.140
You'll never be okay again.

02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.460
You're gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life,

02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:11.060
but you should forgive.

02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:11.900
No.

02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:13.060
Well, there is truth in the fact

02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:15.820
that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:18.100
But that truth is not that you,

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:22.020
fuck you, right?

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:25.660
Which is why it's not your job to say that.

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.500
It's not that you're doing that.

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.260
I know you're not, but you know,

02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:32.900
the problem with people like me, early phase,

02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:35.060
you could get this stupid missionary thing going

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:39.260
where you like start trying to like, I don't know,

02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:42.300
like proselytize ideals that you might be incapable of.

02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:46.660
You know, and I just, hearing it, you know, that's the,

02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:49.500
man, I saw this, the thing that like,

02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:50.340
I mean, I've seen a lot,

02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:52.740
all of us by now, probably if we were online,

02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:54.940
I've seen, and you just saw it in person.

02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:58.780
Like we've seen things that are just horrific.

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:03.460
But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid

02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:08.260
around the age of my kid walking by himself,

02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:11.140
these refugees, just walking by himself,

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:13.380
the look on his face.

02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:15.820
I can't explain the look on his face.

02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:17.100
I don't know what happened to his parents.

02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.380
I don't know what happened.

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:21.380
Like I, it was so upsetting.

02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:22.820
Like even thinking about it now, it's just like,

02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:24.700
fuck, that could have been my kid.

02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.900
That could have been my kid, you know?

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:29.380
So knowing that kind of, that,

02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:33.220
that kid's got to grow up now.

02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:36.220
And I don't know, is the kid's parents still there?

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:41.220
And that's just one of countless orphans out there now.

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:45.220
So you have this hate,

02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:47.900
and the question is how to direct it.

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.540
Because the choice is you can direct it

02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:53.380
towards the politicians that started the war.

02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:55.140
You can direct it towards the soldiers

02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:56.740
that are doing the killing,

02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:59.580
or you can direct it towards an entire group of people.

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:04.100
And that's the struggle because hate slowly grows

02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:08.500
to where you don't just hate the soldiers.

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:11.660
You don't just hate the leaders.

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:16.660
You hate all Russians because they're all equally evil

02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:20.020
because the ones that aren't doing the fighting

02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:21.740
are staying quiet.

02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:23.660
And I'm sure the same kind of stories

02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:25.500
are happening on the other side.

02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:28.900
And so there is,

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.900
that hate is one that is deeply human,

02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:42.540
but you wonder for your own future,

02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:45.500
for your own home, for building your own community,

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:47.660
for building your own country,

02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:51.180
how does that hate morph over the weeks,

02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.140
and months, and years?

02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:54.580
Not into forgiveness,

02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:56.220
but into something that's productive,

02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:57.820
that doesn't destroy you.

02:09:57.820 --> 02:09:59.580
Because hate does destroy.

02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:04.580
That's the dark aspect of a rocket

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:08.700
that hits a building and kills hundreds of people.

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.260
The worst effect of that rocket is

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.460
is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.940
to the people that were in that building.

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:28.940
That hate is a torture over a period of years after.

02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:32.500
And that it doesn't just torture

02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:36.340
by having that psychological burden and trauma.

02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:39.620
It also tortures because it destroys your life.

02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:42.460
It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:44.420
to the fullest.

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:47.700
It prevents you from being able to flourish

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:50.980
as a human being, as a professional,

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:53.700
as a, you know, in all those kinds of ways

02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:54.820
that humans can flourish.

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.940
And I don't know, it's such a, you know,

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:03.940
there is an aspect where this naive notion

02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.140
is really powerful, that love and forgiveness

02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:12.380
is the thing that's needed in this time.

02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:17.380
And when I talk to soldiers, they don't, you know,

02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:21.660
I remember bringing up to Jaco,

02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:23.860
is there a sense where the people you're fighting

02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:25.260
are just brothers in arms,

02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:27.900
bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers in Arms?

02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.940
And he was basically, without swearing,

02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:33.100
saying fuck that, that they're the enemy.

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:36.420
Yeah, I mean, he's literally in survival mode.

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:37.420
He can't think like that.

02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:39.260
It's gonna create latency in the system

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.900
and that's gonna lower his survivability.

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:41.740
You can't think that.

02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:44.340
I mean, we're talking about like cognitively,

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:45.700
you can't have latency.

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:48.780
Like if you're, that one moment of hesitation,

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:51.340
like you see it sometimes, like in these YouTube videos

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:56.340
of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:03.100
to run into something that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop.

02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:07.100
Somebody has a knife and that person is running towards them

02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:10.980
with a knife and they're begging the person to stop,

02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.500
that you can hear it in their voice.

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:17.300
They're begging, stop, stop, stop, stop.

02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:19.260
And the person is not gonna stop.

02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:24.260
So the critique of that is that that latency

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.020
could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed,

02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.420
but to that person with the knife killing other people.

02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:39.340
And so, you know, I get, if I were out there,

02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:44.340
I think that like, you probably just as a matter

02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:47.940
of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment,

02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:49.460
you have to be like that, I would guess.

02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.300
I don't know.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.300
I don't know, I'm the furthest thing

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:54.000
from a soldier there could be, but there's a,

02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:58.720
something Jack Kornfield, this great Buddhist teacher says,

02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:03.420
which is, tend to the part of the garden you can touch.

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.900
Meaning, this is where we're at right now.

02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:09.220
Thank God you and I, that we are experiencing

02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:11.980
some like ripples from what's going on over there,

02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:14.220
everyone is, we're not there.

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:17.460
And thank God we don't have to come up

02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:22.460
with the psychological program for people going through that

02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:28.460
to no longer be encumbered by that hate, thank God.

02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.220
And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever,

02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:32.340
but it's like, you know, for me, I just,

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.860
I have to bring it back to, all right,

02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:35.600
well, here's where I'm at now.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:40.600
And I don't want there to be war.

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.660
I don't want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said.

02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:46.800
I think what you said is the,

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:51.800
if anything is the most intelligent way of looking at it,

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:55.820
it's like, don't pretend that you're not gonna feel

02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:58.360
that hate, like you're gonna feel it.

02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:59.200
There's no way around it.

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.520
Or like, cause that's even worse.

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.480
Cause then you're almost saying like,

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.480
something's wrong with them for feeling the hate

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.300
or, you know, whatever.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.260
But more along the lines,

02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:10.020
if you can avoid applying that hate

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.720
to an entire country of people, then do that.

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.660
Like, just understand, we're talking about like,

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.140
not everybody.

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.500
I know it's not everybody.

02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:27.580
I know it's not everybody.

02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:28.700
It's just easier, isn't it?

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:32.220
Cognitively, it's somehow easier to think

02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:37.260
all Russians, monsters, you know, all Russians,

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.100
all whatever the particular like thing is

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:42.020
that you're supposed to not like.

02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:43.920
It's easier somehow, weirdly.

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.900
You'd think that'd be more difficult.

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:48.820
Yeah, but I guess the lesson is,

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:53.540
if you give in to the easy solution,

02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:58.280
that's going to lead to detrimental long-term effects.

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:03.280
So hate should be, it's such a powerful tool

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.560
that you should try to control it for your own sake,

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.360
not because you owe anything to anybody,

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.560
but for your own psychological development over time.

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:19.120
Right, right, that's it, that's it, fuck.

02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.440
Yeah, yeah.

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:25.740
In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression.

02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:28.380
Where's been some of the darker places

02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.240
you've gone in your mind?

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:32.740
You know, I needed therapy, man.

02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:34.140
I needed therapy for the longest time.

02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:35.140
I just didn't get it.

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:41.660
So because of that, I would go through like bouts

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:49.340
of like paralytic depression, like suicidal depression,

02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:51.740
suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations.

02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:56.340
I mean, I think like people get afraid

02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:59.580
when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness,

02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:01.220
they get really scared of themselves,

02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:03.140
so they think there's something like,

02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.980
fuck, what's going on with me, why would I think that?

02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:07.460
But I think if we are suffering,

02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:11.340
and you know, as a natural part of wanting to reduce suffering

02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:14.740
or not feel bad anymore, I mean,

02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:16.060
suicide is going to be an odd,

02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:17.420
like if we're just, you know, you're just looking,

02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:18.340
what are all the options?

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:19.940
Let's brainstorm here.

02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:20.780
You know what I mean?

02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:22.540
I could start drinking more water,

02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:25.060
I could start jogging, get some therapy,

02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:27.900
call my friends, all the stuff we all hear,

02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:31.060
or I could just, I think the height of my apartment building

02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:34.540
is probably definitely the right height to kill myself.

02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:39.140
And then, so for me, like the few times

02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:41.760
where the ideation has gone towards like,

02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:45.500
well, when would I do that?

02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:48.900
How do I, you know, what do I need to like,

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:51.140
accomplish that, and then like,

02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:52.940
that's where it gets really fucking scary,

02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.460
that's where it's like terrifying.

02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:57.800
And so you start the actual details of the planning

02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:00.080
of how to commit suicide.

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.740
Yeah, what's gonna be the least painful way to do it?

02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:04.620
What's gonna be the most instantaneous way to do it?

02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:07.360
What's the, you know, and with depression,

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.280
because it can be progressive, you know,

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.220
this is why you have to really just stay on top of it.

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.380
Anyone who's gone through depression

02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:16.220
knows what I'm talking about.

02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:18.620
You gotta stay on top of it, like you might need medication.

02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:20.540
You know, I know this is controversial now,

02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.700
but it's still better than dying, if you ask me,

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:24.820
but at some point with depression,

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:26.620
it like becomes paralyzing,

02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:28.180
so you don't wanna get out of bed anymore,

02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:30.060
and you're not taking showers anymore,

02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:31.700
and you don't wanna talk to anybody anymore,

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:35.220
and you're not answering your phone anymore, and you know.

02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:38.380
So like, in a dark place that you might be in,

02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:41.020
it still might get worse, so you should really

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:41.860
Yes.

02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:43.780
do everything you can

02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:45.420
immediately. to get under control.

02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:46.540
And that's the problem,

02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:50.460
that specific psychological disorder, that's the problem,

02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:53.540
because the things, it's, like if you start listening

02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:55.820
to what you wanted, you think it's you,

02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:58.300
it's the depression, you start listening to it,

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:00.860
it wants you to stay in bed,

02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.980
and then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps,

02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:06.420
you know, or you wake up and you're more tired,

02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:07.740
like it's not working,

02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:11.380
you're trying to escape reality by sleeping,

02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:14.900
and so, yeah, like you have to like,

02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:18.340
you're fighting for your,

02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:19.740
you're literally fighting for your life,

02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:20.820
it might not seem like that,

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:23.420
because you can't, if you could see depression,

02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:24.260
if you could see it,

02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:28.900
if you knew you had some inky, vaporous, octopus thing

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:32.220
that was just wrapping around you more and more

02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:34.340
and more and more, you would probably do everything

02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:36.100
you could to rip that fucking thing off your body,

02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:37.980
and if you couldn't get it off your body,

02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:41.100
you would be calling people to get help.

02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:42.460
So it doesn't feel like a fight,

02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:45.300
because you're exhausted, there's no reason to move,

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:48.020
there's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it,

02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:50.220
so it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle.

02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.740
You're not feeling, I mean, that's the other thing,

02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:53.580
you're just, you're basically not feeling,

02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:55.620
you're like, you start going numb,

02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:57.580
at least that was my experience with it,

02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:01.460
numb and tired, and then increasingly numb and tired,

02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:05.260
and then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality,

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:06.380
and then somewhere in there,

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:08.860
that's when you start playing around with the idea

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:11.380
of like, I don't know if it's worth it, I don't know.

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:14.660
Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends

02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:16.740
who haven't survived, obviously,

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:17.940
who haven't survived depression,

02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.860
like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.

02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:26.340
I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there,

02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:27.300
maybe you haven't gone through it,

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:30.580
just imagine how bad you have to feel

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:35.220
if death is the, like, violence against yourself

02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:37.140
so that you die is the solution.

02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:42.180
Like, just, it flies in the face of everything.

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:48.100
So, yeah, that was definitely the darkest place

02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:48.980
that I've ever been.

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:51.620
Is it just that death doesn't seem like,

02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:54.180
because you don't care about anything anymore,

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:56.500
that death just doesn't seem like that bad?

02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:57.340
Yeah.

02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:01.500
Like, you're not able to appropriately assign

02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:05.660
the negative cost to this solution?

02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:06.500
Right.

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:07.860
Is it a reasonable solution?

02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:11.860
Yeah, but I think also what's going along with it

02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:15.340
is like, it's not like your brain isn't working.

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.620
Like, you're not thinking,

02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:19.300
obviously you're not thinking clearly.

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:22.780
Like, at least again, this was my experience of it,

02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:25.220
it's a fog, you're in some kind of,

02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:31.140
like, you're confused, there's confusion, there's shame,

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:33.180
you feel embarrassed, you feel embarrassed,

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.940
you wanna get out of bed, you wanna do stuff,

02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:38.420
you wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff,

02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:40.540
but you're not, you're not.

02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.860
Like, you seem, if people don't know what's going on

02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:45.180
and you're not telling them because you're embarrassed,

02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:49.420
because you wanna have some like, you know,

02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:54.420
uncorrupted, unwarped psyche, you know,

02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:57.980
you're like, it invites you to be secret about it.

02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:59.460
That's one of its first tricks,

02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:01.700
is it tells you not to tell anybody.

02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:06.340
And that's deadly in that case, it's deadly.

02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:07.860
What was the source of light?

02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:12.860
What was the, what were for you and in general the ways out?

02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:19.220
Yeah, so for me, the solutions, and again, man,

02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:22.140
for my depressed friends out there,

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.020
please don't get mad at me, I'm not doing the thing

02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:26.820
of like, just put on a smile or any of that bullshit,

02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:30.420
because it doesn't feel like that when you're like,

02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:34.340
when you're fighting it, it's like you are,

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:37.580
you're in a, I don't know why I'm keep,

02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:39.380
I keep using these stupid gravity analogies,

02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:42.260
but it's like, the gravity's been turned up on your planet

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:46.100
in every single way by, so getting out of bed, you know, like.

02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.660
By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics,

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:54.060
one of the most beautiful things about our reality,

02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:56.740
what the hell is each of those things?

02:21:56.780 --> 02:22:00.940
So this isn't, you're not just talking about

02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:04.580
hippie language, it's still, physicists pretend

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:05.940
they understand something.

02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:07.860
We're still at the very beginning of understanding

02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:10.700
this mysterious world of ours that seems to be

02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:15.260
functioning according to these weirdly simple

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:18.100
and yet universally powerful laws,

02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:20.740
which we don't fully yet understand.

02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:24.460
So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity,

02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:25.420
fully applicable.

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:26.460
I don't know any other way to put it,

02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:28.580
then it's like somebody turned the gravitational field

02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:29.740
of your mattress up.

02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:30.740
So everything is heavy.

02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:33.100
Heavy, your body's heavy.

02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:34.060
You don't want to get out of bed,

02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:36.820
you will consider shitting or pissing the bed,

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:38.220
because you're just like, who gives a fuck,

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:40.340
I'll just lay in my shit and piss.

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:44.780
You're dying, you're like, none of it makes sense.

02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:52.100
And I feel like in retrospect,

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:57.260
making what I've done a little, like I had more lucidity,

02:22:57.380 --> 02:23:02.380
it was more of like when you're wrestling with someone

02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:06.940
and you're just like, it's different for you.

02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:08.100
But for me, if I'm wrestling,

02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:10.220
I'm not thinking about jujitsu moves, I'm like.

02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:11.060
Survival.

02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:13.300
So it's like that.

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.940
It is a struggle.

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:19.940
Like it's like you really have to deliberately fight.

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:21.380
Everything.

02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:26.380
So you can almost have a conversation with the depression.

02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:30.900
And then what you do is you start doing the opposite

02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:33.260
of everything it's telling you to do.

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:36.620
So it's telling you, lay in bed.

02:23:36.620 --> 02:23:38.300
So you get out of bed.

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:41.780
It's definitely telling you, don't fucking exercise.

02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:43.180
You're going to go fucking exercise.

02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:44.220
That's not going to do anything.

02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:45.060
You can't.

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:46.420
You probably have a heart attack.

02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:48.100
You really want to go outside.

02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:50.700
Don't go fucking exercise.

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:54.820
And then you'll feel crazy and you won't want to do it.

02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:57.340
If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed.

02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:58.420
Like how often do you hear

02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:00.340
like one of the symptoms of depression?

02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:02.940
You want to jog, you want to get on a bike.

02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:03.940
You know, you don't hear that.

02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:04.900
That's not a symptom.

02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:09.900
So you start, at least one solution I just started

02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:11.900
doing the opposite of.

02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:14.420
Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite.

02:24:14.420 --> 02:24:15.260
That.

02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:20.260
And then suddenly the gravitational field

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:22.300
diminishes a little bit.

02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:23.620
It doesn't go all the way away.

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:25.620
And that's where you can fall right back into it.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.660
Cause you just feel even slightly better.

02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:28.500
You're like, oh, okay.

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:29.740
I fixed it.

02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:31.020
You know, really, I think if you,

02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:34.700
like in having been through therapy,

02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:39.700
the best solution would be go to a fucking therapist

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:42.860
as quickly as you can.

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:45.760
Just sit down with them and tell them what's going on.

02:24:46.900 --> 02:24:47.780
I know what you're thinking.

02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:49.740
How am I going to find a therapist?

02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:51.580
Just do it.

02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:53.300
Google it, go on Yelp.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:56.100
All of this shit feels impossible.

02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:57.500
You're like, I don't want to turn on the computer.

02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:58.420
I don't want to do any of this.

02:24:58.420 --> 02:24:59.260
You just have to.

02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:00.100
I mean, you have to.

02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:01.680
You do it if you're on fire.

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.500
You do it if you're on fire and someone's like, you know,

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.340
here's a way to not be on fire.

02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:07.780
Just this particular fire is,

02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:09.860
it doesn't make you want to run around screaming.

02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:11.540
It just makes you want to fall asleep forever.

02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:15.140
And that, but those little steps,

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:16.980
I got lucky because it worked.

02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:17.800
It worked.

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:18.700
I started exercising.

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:20.980
I'd been on antidepressants before

02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:23.340
when I was originally diagnosed with it.

02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:26.020
Did those help or no?

02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:29.380
You know, I, even with all the current research coming out

02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:31.660
about that maybe we were all wrong

02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.940
about our understanding of depression,

02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:38.380
I do feel like it helped in a certain way.

02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:42.900
Like it definitely, it definitely like made me stop

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:45.220
thinking about, it stopped the intrusive thoughts.

02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:48.140
And, but I don't know how much of that was placebo

02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:49.300
or how much of that, I don't know.

02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.700
But then also like, I couldn't come anymore.

02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:53.260
That was the other fucked up thing.

02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:55.580
Like you're, you can't have orgasms.

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:58.780
And which might not sound like a big deal,

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:02.460
but you know, when I told my therapist that

02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:03.760
they actually took me off them,

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:05.640
cause I think she was realizing

02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:07.980
that it started diminishing a little bit.

02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:11.080
But the one I'm talking about now,

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:14.400
that whatever episode or whatever you want to call it,

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.380
I just got lucky cause it worked.

02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:19.100
And I started feeling better, thank God.

02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:22.180
Now, if you suffer from depression out there

02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:24.320
and you've had a remission of the depression,

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.100
you know, it's really like,

02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:28.580
it's scary to have mental illness because

02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:32.820
everyone gets bummed out.

02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:33.980
I mean, that's just normal.

02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:35.100
Like you're going to get bummed out.

02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:36.660
No, I want to do anything sometimes.

02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:38.180
It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression.

02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:40.260
You might just be bummed out or grieving.

02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:42.540
You might be any number of things.

02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:46.980
But when I get really nervous,

02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:49.900
if some of those symptoms start showing up.

02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:54.900
And at one point I felt like that was happening again.

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:59.420
And I did intramuscular ketamine therapy,

02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:02.900
which now that was the damnedest thing

02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:04.060
I've ever experienced.

02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:08.060
Aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic.

02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:13.460
The, I just remember going back to the hotel

02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:17.220
after the experience with the clinician.

02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:21.900
And like, you know, it's like with depression,

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:24.700
it's like a headache that starts coming on.

02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:27.180
But you're like, this headache might last for years.

02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:28.620
It might last for six months.

02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:30.860
It might get worse and worse and worse.

02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:35.020
And so I went back to the hotel room

02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:37.300
and it was just gone.

02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:38.500
Like I just felt normal.

02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:39.460
I felt great.

02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:42.580
It was like the most remarkable thing ever.

02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:45.980
So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now.

02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:49.100
It's like, it's not like bullshit.

02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:50.580
It's not like woo-woo science.

02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:52.260
There's really, really good data out there

02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:55.500
showing that something like, I think it's 60%.

02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:56.700
I don't know what the percentage is,

02:27:56.700 --> 02:28:01.700
but 60% of people with an endogenous depression

02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:06.500
when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission

02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:08.340
regardless of whether you trip out or not.

02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:10.620
It just does something.

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:11.980
I don't know if they know what it is yet.

02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:12.820
I don't care if they do.

02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:14.060
But that one thing worked

02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:17.620
and basically you keep fighting until something works.

02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:18.460
Exactly.

02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:19.740
It's a survival issue.

02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:20.980
And it's a survival issue.

02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:24.540
But it's just, I think because it's kind of so slow moving,

02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:26.780
you might even forget it's progressive.

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:28.340
Or, you know, you could easily just think

02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:30.900
that you're just a kind of bummed out person

02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:33.340
or you start thinking that these aspects

02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:35.780
of your psychology are permanent

02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:37.420
when they don't have to be.

02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:40.020
What about other people in your life?

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:41.740
What advice would you give to people

02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:44.780
that have loved ones who suffer from depression?

02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:46.420
What are they to do?

02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:48.660
Okay, now this is really like,

02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:54.740
man, it's really dark.

02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:57.540
Here's number one.

02:28:57.540 --> 02:28:59.260
This is what somebody told me

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:01.020
when I lost a friend to suicide.

02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:02.860
Because when you lose a friend to suicide,

02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:04.660
when you lose a loved one to suicide,

02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:05.980
you're going to blame yourself.

02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:10.980
In the periphery of suicide,

02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:14.540
there is a circumference of guilty people

02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:17.300
who all feel like, oh, if only I'd said this

02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.620
at the right time, if only I'd listened more,

02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:21.820
if only I'd seen that warning sign,

02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:23.580
or if only this or that.

02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:30.100
It's interesting in that with other forms of like disease,

02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:35.940
if your loved one dies from cancer, say,

02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.980
more than likely, you're not going to be thinking like,

02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:41.740
oh, I should have cured their cancer.

02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:44.220
It's a tragedy, but at least you're not like,

02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:46.180
oh, if only I had, you still might think

02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:47.580
that's part of grief, but.

02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:51.460
It's not as sticky in many of the other situations.

02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:54.740
Here, the guilt couldn't really stay for a long time.

02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:55.580
Yep.

02:29:56.260 --> 02:30:01.260
So you, number one, we're talking about

02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:05.380
a progressive disease that can lead to death.

02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:07.940
And if somebody commits suicide,

02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:09.460
they wanted to commit suicide.

02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:12.940
And at least what I've been told is you can't stop it.

02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:14.740
It's going to happen.

02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:15.860
It's going to happen.

02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:16.860
There are no magic words.

02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:18.220
There's nothing you could do.

02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:21.500
So, you know, people who've lost people to suicide,

02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:22.980
you know what I'm talking about.

02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:26.300
Like, you know, you can watch it happen in real time

02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:28.260
and there's just nothing you could do.

02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:34.140
That being said, you know, being responsive

02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:37.140
to when it seems like someone's really reaching out for help

02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:40.820
and knowing that maybe even though it might,

02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:42.300
especially if it's someone who's like,

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:44.780
doesn't talk like this a lot of the time,

02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.140
and sentences start coming out of their mouth,

02:30:47.140 --> 02:30:49.500
that if you weren't really paying attention,

02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:51.780
might not seem like a big deal, but for this person,

02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:56.460
it's kind of anomalous that all of a sudden that's happening.

02:30:56.460 --> 02:30:59.540
Now there, that's when you can be a good listener

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:01.980
and, you know, open up to them and hear what they're saying

02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:04.140
and see like, oh, share, are they asking me for,

02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:05.820
is this them asking for help?

02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:08.700
And even if you're like, I don't know what to do,

02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:13.700
you know, at least you can like start checking in on them,

02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:16.660
you know, start like, help them understand

02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:17.940
that you're there for them.

02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:19.700
And then hopefully get them into therapy,

02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:22.700
get them to a doctor, get them to a professional

02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:25.060
who can like see what's going on there.

02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:27.020
So that, and then there's hope.

02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:28.700
And even then there might not be hope actually,

02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:30.220
you know, doctors can't stop it.

02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:34.500
There's no, sometimes it just, that's the way it goes.

02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:39.100
But, you know, I know that like being sensitive,

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:41.420
if somebody's like all of a sudden hitting you up

02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:44.300
or reaching out to you that normally isn't like that

02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:46.020
and just what's going on?

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:46.860
How are you?

02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:48.020
And just listen.

02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:50.620
Which in general, the pressure or not

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.980
is probably a good thing to do.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:53.820
Yeah.

02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:56.580
To truly listen.

02:31:56.580 --> 02:31:57.780
It's like, are you okay?

02:31:57.780 --> 02:31:59.460
Yeah, yeah.

02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:01.020
Cause people have, you know, I don't,

02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:03.380
this whole thing of like cries for help, man.

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:06.620
They don't, sometimes they just look like a weird text,

02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:08.820
you know, and you don't realize that for the person

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.020
to send that fucking text,

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:12.140
they've been thinking about it all morning.

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:14.980
They've been just trying to get their phone up

02:32:14.980 --> 02:32:16.460
from the floor.

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:20.100
So, you know, I think that that's it.

02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:21.860
I mean, I don't know.

02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:22.820
I don't know.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:24.980
I've had friends like kill themselves.

02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:29.740
So, and many of them, it wasn't like, sadly,

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.380
it was like, I don't know.

02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:34.060
I don't know what could have been done, but.

02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:37.780
But there's still a guilt in the back of your head?

02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:39.300
For the rest of my life, for sure.

02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:40.260
Always will be.

02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:43.100
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:44.700
But again, what are you gonna do?

02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:46.780
But even that, it's a part of love.

02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:49.820
That's right.

02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:50.780
That's right.

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:51.620
Yeah, that's right.

02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:54.060
You could, yeah, you know, we feel guilt.

02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:55.860
Part of grief is guilt, you know?

02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:58.500
Like, we always could have been better people.

02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:00.380
We always could have been better people.

02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:02.220
You get into Viktor Frankl much?

02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:03.260
Yeah, of course.

02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:04.580
Man's Search for Meaning.

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:10.900
The invitation to live your life

02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:13.580
as though you'd been on your deathbed

02:33:13.580 --> 02:33:15.620
and had been given the chance to go back

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:18.060
and not make the same mistakes.

02:33:18.060 --> 02:33:20.820
I return to that idea all the time,

02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:23.820
meaning it's like, okay, whatever you did

02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:28.220
before this moment was too late.

02:33:28.220 --> 02:33:31.180
But now, you know, this is where you can start.

02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:32.460
This is where you can start.

02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:37.460
And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me,

02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:39.220
that's super important,

02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:41.460
because otherwise I'll just get like too lost

02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:44.620
in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.

02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.140
So speaking of Viktor Frankl,

02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:48.420
you and Hitler have the same birthday.

02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:50.620
Oh my God, you've really done your research.

02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:55.740
Well, I often Google famous people

02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:58.780
that have a birthday same as Hitler.

02:33:58.780 --> 02:33:59.620
Yeah.

02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:02.180
And the person that shows up, you know,

02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:04.700
is your face just really big.

02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:08.020
You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other.

02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:10.060
No, it does not!

02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:12.980
No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday

02:34:12.980 --> 02:34:14.660
for all my 420 friends out there.

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:15.500
It's embarrassing.

02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.580
You share a birthday with Hitler.

02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:22.580
But it's 420s also has a humor and a lightness to it, right?

02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:24.340
It's embarrassing.

02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:25.860
You're, especially-

02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:27.300
Life is embarrassing.

02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:31.100
But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day

02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:34.140
and you believe in reincarnation,

02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:36.540
do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there,

02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:39.740
if there is like a bardo where you get to choose

02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:41.060
your next life.

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:45.060
So you're like a shitty generic NPC.

02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.900
You're like, of course, you would be born on 420.

02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:53.820
Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah!

02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.060
But isn't it interesting that on that same day,

02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:58.580
Hitler is also born?

02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:03.020
There's a tension to that.

02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:06.820
And that Hitler's an artist.

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:11.820
So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:12.980
Oh, yeah, right.

02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:14.100
Like what, yeah, you know,

02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:16.020
and I was just having this conversation

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:18.900
with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:22.220
and we were talking about this,

02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:26.500
which is the thing where you start attributing

02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:31.100
to the day you were born these kinds of significance

02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.340
and based on maybe people who were born on that day,

02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:34.940
maybe some other things.

02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:38.020
It's like, think of how many people by now

02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:39.340
in the course of human history

02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:42.340
have been born on April 20th.

02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:44.140
I mean, how many?

02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.420
Someone could probably do the math

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:47.900
and come up with some number close to it.

02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:51.860
Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.

02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.060
Like he's the one that like fucks up

02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:57.900
the birthday for everybody else, but.

02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:00.540
I think where I heard that you're 420

02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:04.740
is Wim Hof episode, cause he's also 420.

02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:05.860
He's at 420.

02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:09.020
Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof

02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:11.980
in terms of owning the date.

02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:15.060
I think if anybody is like,

02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:18.740
well, obviously there's nothing you can do to like fix it.

02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:20.420
Hitler fucked up a lot of things.

02:36:20.420 --> 02:36:22.100
He fucked up that mustache.

02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:23.740
He fucked up the name Hitler.

02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:25.180
He fucked up 420.

02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:28.700
And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust

02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:29.540
that by the way,

02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:32.020
talk about these reverberations through time

02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:33.260
that we're still experiencing.

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:34.300
There's still people walked around

02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.620
with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker.

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:41.620
So, but Wim Hof, people like Wim Hof,

02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:45.940
they're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is.

02:36:45.940 --> 02:36:47.900
He too is creating ripples in the lake

02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:51.340
that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.

02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:53.220
Yeah, very cold fucking lake.

02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:57.580
And he's in, yeah, so very, very cold lake

02:36:57.620 --> 02:36:59.940
and he's happily swimming around in,

02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:04.940
but yeah, I try not to think about

02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:08.260
like the Hitler thing on my birthday

02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:10.300
that my dad would just, every birthday,

02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:12.100
he would remind me that Hitler was born.

02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:14.820
Do you think all of us are capable of evil?

02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:18.260
Do you think, you're one of the sweetest people I know

02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:19.340
just as a fan.

02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:20.980
Do you think you're capable of evil?

02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:22.700
Sure, yeah.

02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:24.540
I mean, sure, definitely.

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:26.220
I think if you don't think that,

02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:29.780
you better watch out because come on,

02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:31.540
how do you think you're not capable of evil?

02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:36.540
And PS, if you're connected to the supply chain, friend,

02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:38.420
you're doing evil.

02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:39.900
You're paying taxes.

02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:43.700
You're supporting the worst things in the world.

02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:47.500
I mean, diffusion of responsibility,

02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:48.460
it's really curious,

02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:51.460
or the circumference of responsibility

02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:54.300
where it's like bombs are going off somewhere

02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:59.340
that were paid for in some small part by you,

02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:02.020
some fractional.

02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:07.020
If a drone is flying over a village in Afghanistan

02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:12.620
and drops a bomb and you pay taxes,

02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:17.180
then you could say you have fractional ownership

02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:18.860
over that drone.

02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:22.300
You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.

02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:24.420
And I know what you're gonna say.

02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:26.420
Well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.

02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:27.340
Like I have no choice.

02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:29.820
There's sales tax, there's this or that.

02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:31.980
Take that attitude.

02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:34.660
It's the same thing that people on the battlefield

02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.620
when they're sending missiles into other tanks,

02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:39.060
they're thinking the same thing.

02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:42.300
It's just they're more directly responsible

02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:43.260
for what's going on.

02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:48.260
But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co-arising,

02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.460
yeah, dependent co-arising, we're all connected.

02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:53.580
We're all part of this matrix.

02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:54.620
We're all connected.

02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:57.620
Meaning we all share responsibility

02:38:57.620 --> 02:38:58.740
for the evil in the world.

02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:03.420
So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts,

02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:05.700
if you're seeing something in the world

02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.260
and you're thinking that's evil,

02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:10.660
you're probably not quite as separated from that

02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:11.820
as you'd like to believe

02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:16.820
in some tiny infinitesimally quantum way.

02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:19.300
You're connected.

02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:23.180
And there is a sense, I've gotten to experience this

02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:25.220
over and over that one individual

02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:27.580
can actually make a gigantic difference.

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:33.420
Not only is there a diffusion responsibility,

02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:37.340
there's a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do?

02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:38.500
Yeah.

02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:40.940
Sure, I understand, but what can I do?

02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:45.020
And I think just looking at history

02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:49.940
and also hanging out and becoming friends,

02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:52.460
but also interviewing people that have had a tremendous

02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:55.900
impact, you realize you're just one dude.

02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:58.540
You're like a normal person.

02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:00.460
You're not that smart even.

02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:04.180
A lot of people aren't in some kind of magical way

02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:07.180
where you have a big head that's figuring out everything.

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:11.980
No, you just saw problems in the world.

02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:13.860
And you're like, hey, I think I'm gonna try

02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:15.140
to do something about this.

02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:17.260
And you stay focused and dedicated to it

02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:20.980
for a prolonged period of time and refuse to quit,

02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:23.540
refuse to listen to people that tell you that

02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:26.540
this isn't impossible, here's how others have failed.

02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:29.020
No, I'm gonna do it.

02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:30.220
That's it.

02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:31.060
That's it.

02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:32.580
And one person, and then you kinda,

02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:34.540
the thing is when there's one person

02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:37.020
that keeps pushing forward that way,

02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:40.260
humans are sticky, other people follow them around.

02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:41.580
And they're like, I'll help.

02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:45.460
You know, I'll help and then the other people help

02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:47.740
and then the cool people all gather together

02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:49.780
because they kinda get excited about this way.

02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:52.060
Holy shit, we can actually make a difference.

02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:54.660
And they form groups and then all of a sudden

02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:57.060
there's companies and nations that actually make

02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:58.220
a gigantic difference.

02:40:58.220 --> 02:40:59.060
It's interesting.

02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:01.860
It all starts with one person, often.

02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:04.620
You know what, if I could push back slightly against that,

02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:06.020
it's never just one person.

02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:09.900
It's like, you know, nobody ever talks about,

02:41:09.900 --> 02:41:11.340
at least as far as I'm aware,

02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:14.660
you never hear about like Buddha's great-grandmother.

02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:15.820
You never hear about that.

02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:16.780
You never hear about that.

02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:20.580
But if not for that person, no Buddhism.

02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:23.580
You know, the people you're talking about,

02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:27.300
they're the tip of the iceberg that pops up

02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:29.460
out of the ocean of history.

02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:34.340
And you never see all the little things

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:36.500
that helped that happen.

02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:39.860
And so to me, this is where the real,

02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:41.340
how do you help?

02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.980
What's something you can do?

02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:45.900
Well, you know, recognize that first,

02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.580
that you don't really, you might not even be aware

02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:51.020
of how much you're impacting people around you.

02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:53.300
You might think that you're not,

02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:55.660
or you might think surely not in a way

02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:57.420
that makes a big difference,

02:41:57.420 --> 02:42:01.140
but you have no idea these tipping points

02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:06.140
and that can lead to the emergence of an Einstein,

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:08.780
a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.

02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:11.820
We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.

02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:14.180
And so I think that's where for me,

02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:18.580
it goes back to 10 to the part of the garden you can touch

02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.620
and then, or even deeper than that, intention.

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.740
It was just like, and I'm an idiot.

02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:28.780
So I need an idiot's intention, which is don't,

02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:31.300
if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it,

02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:36.060
if you can help, help.

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:38.740
If you can't help, don't hurt.

02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:43.300
Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can,

02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:46.540
if possible, refrain from hurting,

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:49.460
which might as well be a form of helping.

02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:53.460
And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing.

02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.100
These little acts of kindness.

02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:59.620
I don't know, they seem to have,

02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:01.340
maybe I believe in kind of karma,

02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:03.060
but they seem to have this,

02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:05.820
they can have this gigantic ripple effect.

02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:08.020
I don't know why that is.

02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:11.780
I remember a lot of little acts of kindness

02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:13.300
that people have done to me.

02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:15.740
And they, what do they do?

02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:19.300
One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future.

02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:21.180
They give me faith in humanity

02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:28.380
that somehow there's a partially dormant desire

02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:31.820
in our sort of collective intelligence

02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.420
to do good in the world,

02:43:33.420 --> 02:43:36.260
that most of us want to be good,

02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:38.500
that want to do good onto the world.

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:40.180
They want, there's a kindness

02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:43.860
that's kind of like begging to get out, you know?

02:43:43.860 --> 02:43:46.100
And those little acts of kindness do just that.

02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:48.620
And actually, one of the reasons I love Austin

02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:52.140
and moved here is realizing,

02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:55.420
just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,

02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:58.940
just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:03.540
It's weird in that, that kind is combined

02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:05.420
with an optimism for the future.

02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:09.500
It's just, it's amazing what that can build.

02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:12.180
Yes, yes, it's incredible.

02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:13.220
And I know what you're saying.

02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:17.220
It's like, we moved to this great neighborhood

02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:21.900
and at this point, I think three,

02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:25.540
maybe four of our neighbors have made food for us

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:29.260
that just shows up with handwritten lists

02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:31.740
of things they like to do in the area

02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:34.140
and their phone number if we need help.

02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:36.700
And it's like, holy shit.

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:40.300
That's like, it might seem like a little act,

02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:43.380
but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb

02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:46.060
just went off on your porch when you're looking at that.

02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:48.100
I'm like, what the fuck?

02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:50.740
You made me a pie?

02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:51.980
This is incredible.

02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:53.740
This is incredible, so.

02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:57.020
And also, it's another act to accept that kindness.

02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:01.060
It's like a lot of times when I was in Boston

02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:03.740
or San Francisco, certain big cities,

02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:05.220
you can think like, oh, okay, well,

02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:10.100
they're trying to somehow, that's not an act of kindness.

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:12.980
That's some kind of a transactional thing to build up.

02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:15.140
It's like a career move for networking,

02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:16.340
all that kind of stuff.

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:18.260
But no, if you just accept it for what it is,

02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:20.220
a pure act of kindness.

02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:21.500
Fuckin' Boston.

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:22.860
It's, yeah, yeah.

02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:25.100
Because for me, I go the opposite route.

02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:26.620
Because I'm not, even though there is a part of me

02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:29.220
that might be a little suspicious or something,

02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:33.020
where I go to push that shit back mentally

02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:34.860
is I'm like, oh, I don't deserve this.

02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:37.540
If they knew what a piece of shit I am,

02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:39.460
you're gonna bring me, I will never bring cakes

02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:40.500
to my neighbors.

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:41.740
I wouldn't know how to make a cake.

02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:42.780
I don't know how to make anything.

02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:43.820
I don't have time.

02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:45.380
I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.

02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:46.300
Why didn't I do that?

02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:48.700
I should've brought, I never do that.

02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:53.100
If you're not careful, you can spiral into a vortex

02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:54.580
of self-hate from the gifts.

02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:56.300
So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to,

02:45:56.300 --> 02:46:01.020
in that circuitry, you have to learn how to accept.

02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:03.060
I have that problem really big.

02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:05.700
Yeah, like, I don't deserve this.

02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:10.340
Like, I don't, I get so much love from people.

02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:11.900
I'm like, well, yeah, they love me

02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:13.420
because they don't know me.

02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:15.300
That's my brain, my little voice.

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:20.020
Like, you're not, you're not worthy.

02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:23.940
You're not worthy of any of this kindness

02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:24.900
and all this kind of stuff.

02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:28.540
And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down.

02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:30.180
It can be debilitating.

02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:32.140
And also, it shuts the person down.

02:46:32.140 --> 02:46:32.980
I mean, you're talking.

02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:36.180
And that's the dark side is it pushes them away too.

02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.060
Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry.

02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:43.460
So like, the best thing, if that happens to you,

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:47.180
is like, accept it joyfully and just even,

02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:50.340
just all that, whatever that thing inside of you,

02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:52.660
whatever that little thing is, you know,

02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:56.100
this is like, and then the meditation I do,

02:46:56.100 --> 02:46:58.220
it's an infuriatingly simple meditation,

02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:01.660
but when a thought emerges,

02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:03.940
when you are resting your attention on your breath

02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:07.300
and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts.

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:11.740
And when you catch yourself doing that, you think thinking

02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:13.500
and then return your attention to the breath.

02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:17.060
So I like that so that when that part of myself starts,

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.140
you know, having its little neurotic semi-seizure,

02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:22.340
I can just go thinking, whatever.

02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:26.980
It's just another thought and then eat the banana bread

02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:28.700
or whatever they gave you.

02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:32.780
What's the most wild psychedelic experience you've ever had

02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:34.540
in a dream, in a vision?

02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:36.700
Doesn't have to be drug-related.

02:47:36.700 --> 02:47:40.620
What's one that jumps to mind that was like,

02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:42.780
holy shit, I'm happy to be alive.

02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:43.860
Is this life?

02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:45.260
Okay. This is amazing.

02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:46.940
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:51.620
So the one that pops to mind,

02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.060
I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences,

02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:56.060
but in this moment, the one that pops to mind

02:47:56.100 --> 02:47:58.820
only because it goes back to what you're talking about,

02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.820
about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return.

02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:09.060
So I'm a Burning Man and-

02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:10.380
Are you going to Burning Man this time?

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:11.220
I'm not.

02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:12.580
I mean, I have kids right now

02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:13.660
and I just wanna be around them.

02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:15.540
My wife was being so cool about it

02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:16.740
and she knows I love Burning Man.

02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:19.140
She's like, go to Burning Man and I was gonna go.

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:22.540
And then I just wanna be around my kids

02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:24.260
as much as I can right now, but-

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:25.380
I've never been to Burning Man.

02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:28.780
So I don't know how secretive it is that,

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.620
I mean, cause quite high profile folks go.

02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:34.060
Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.

02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:35.220
Isn't it pretty open?

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:36.180
He's got a boat.

02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:38.180
You know that?

02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:39.620
I'm touching none of this.

02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:41.300
You know, it's called art cars.

02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:42.300
They all make art cars.

02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:44.620
And like part of the burn,

02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:47.660
what's so beautiful about it is like,

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:49.340
you can't buy anything there, man.

02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:53.740
Like I've heard, I don't know if this has changed.

02:48:53.740 --> 02:48:55.540
It's been a bit because of the pandemic,

02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:59.260
but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.

02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:01.300
And I think maybe that's changed.

02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:02.860
I heard some whisper that that's changed,

02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:07.420
but so that means that it's a gifting economy

02:49:07.420 --> 02:49:08.260
is what they call it.

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:10.980
And so people will just give you stuff.

02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:13.540
Talk about having a struggle with deserving stuff, man.

02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:15.180
What are you gonna fucking do

02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:18.580
when the camp next to you is like every morning,

02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:20.620
making the best iced coffee

02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:22.220
that you've ever had in your life.

02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:25.860
And they just are giving it all away till it's all gone.

02:49:25.860 --> 02:49:27.020
What are you gonna do?

02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:30.100
It's the best ever.

02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:31.700
And then you're giving things to people.

02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:34.340
And then you learn stuff like,

02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:36.900
you learn these really interesting lessons.

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:39.860
Like one of the times I went there,

02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:44.700
got all these strawberries.

02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:46.140
Might not sound like a big deal,

02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:48.620
but when you're out there in the dust

02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:52.420
and you're not at one of the hardcore luxury camps

02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:53.780
which do exist out there,

02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:58.380
you've got these items where in my mind I'm like,

02:49:58.380 --> 02:50:01.460
yeah, these are gonna be just for me and my girlfriend,

02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:04.980
my special stash, fruit and this or that.

02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:07.820
And then two days in,

02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:11.460
you're walking around your camp with the strawberries

02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:14.500
that you were coveting and everyone's so happy

02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:16.380
to get cold strawberries.

02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:17.900
And you've realized, oh my God,

02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:21.300
this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.

02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:25.020
So you learn something experientially there,

02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:27.020
which is an incredible thing.

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:29.060
It's an incredible thing.

02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:31.860
Man, now I'm wishing I decided to go to Burning Man.

02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:32.860
Have you been a few times?

02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:34.820
Yeah, I just know like,

02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:39.180
at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat.

02:50:39.180 --> 02:50:41.020
Like, yeah, like this, I think it was like,

02:50:41.020 --> 02:50:43.580
it's like this massive, it's art cars.

02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:45.260
And it was this party on this thing.

02:50:45.260 --> 02:50:48.540
You could just, anyone can go on the boat.

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:50.940
Like, no one's like, there's no guest list.

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:52.220
You just go on there.

02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:53.180
I never saw him there,

02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:56.380
but everyone's whispering, Elon Musk is here.

02:50:56.380 --> 02:50:57.340
There's a secrecy.

02:50:57.340 --> 02:50:58.340
There's all that kind of stuff

02:50:58.340 --> 02:50:59.740
because you probably have to respect that.

02:50:59.740 --> 02:51:01.140
But at the same time there,

02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:03.540
it seems like the kind of people that go there,

02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:09.620
I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended

02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:14.900
in the sense that the crime,

02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:18.020
aggression, the tensions,

02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:19.900
all of that seems to dissipate somehow.

02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:21.220
Not all the way.

02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:22.260
Not all the way.

02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:25.980
You could look it up,

02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:27.140
cause like there is tension.

02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:29.500
There's a lot of tension there between,

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:32.180
it's called plug and plays.

02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:34.220
Like, Burning Man,

02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:36.940
like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.

02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:41.620
It has its roots in the cacophony societies,

02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:42.460
what it was called,

02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:45.900
it was a sort of evolution of something that was,

02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:50.580
I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco.

02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:54.420
Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco

02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:55.620
and I can't remember the name of it.

02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:59.060
Maybe the Suicide Club or essentially like,

02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:02.380
they were really into urban exploration

02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:07.380
and meaning like breaking into like old abandoned buildings

02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:09.100
and stuff, but part of this,

02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:11.140
what this was was,

02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:15.740
you would prepare your life

02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:18.020
as though you were going to kill yourself.

02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:19.860
You would get all your affairs in order.

02:52:19.860 --> 02:52:20.780
You would get,

02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:22.460
so it's going back to what we were talking about

02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:23.500
with the cancer diagnosis.

02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:28.220
You're like sort of putting yourself into that world of like,

02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:30.340
I'm gonna get all my affairs together as though this is it.

02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:32.020
And then there was some,

02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:33.820
I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this,

02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:35.860
but I think there was some really cool initiation

02:52:35.860 --> 02:52:37.660
where they would blindfold you

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:38.500
and they would take you

02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:40.580
into some of these abandoned buildings

02:52:40.580 --> 02:52:41.980
and you didn't know where you were walking,

02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:42.820
but they would say like,

02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:47.100
if you take one step to the left, you're gonna die.

02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:48.900
You're gonna fall off, you're gonna fall.

02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:50.180
So please be careful.

02:52:50.180 --> 02:52:53.980
So you're like in the moment and then blindfold comes off.

02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:55.700
It's a big awesome party.

02:52:55.700 --> 02:52:58.980
This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society.

02:52:58.980 --> 02:52:59.900
There's a great book called

02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:02.580
Tales of the Cacophony Society for people listening.

02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:07.780
You know, one of the members of the Cacophony Society

02:53:07.780 --> 02:53:09.860
was the author of Fight Club.

02:53:09.860 --> 02:53:11.620
And so if you've seen Fight Club,

02:53:11.620 --> 02:53:13.180
like you could see little ideas

02:53:13.180 --> 02:53:14.900
that were in the Cacophony Society.

02:53:14.900 --> 02:53:19.900
They were into Dadaism, which I don't know a lot about,

02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:23.140
like I don't know, but it's a philosophical art movement.

02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:27.780
And then so basically what was happening is like,

02:53:27.780 --> 02:53:30.860
they kept burning increasingly large effigies

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:34.300
in San Francisco and they weren't allowed to do it.

02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:36.380
And so they took it out in the desert

02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:40.700
and they were basing it on something called a zone trip,

02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:43.660
which is like, you know, across this border,

02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:46.180
the rules of that old society are gone.

02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:50.060
And so that was the original Burning Man,

02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:55.060
which was these lunatics out in the desert

02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:59.620
launching like burning pianos out of catapults

02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:03.300
through the air doing like drive-by shooting ranges,

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:08.300
like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness.

02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:14.420
And then it grew and grew and grew and grew

02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:17.260
until you have Burning Man as it is today,

02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:19.420
which is still the most incredible thing.

02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:21.980
I mean, obviously anytime you have like a thing

02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:24.380
that's been around for a while, you're gonna get that.

02:54:24.380 --> 02:54:26.220
It's not like it used to be.

02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:28.140
It's not as free as it used to be, so this or that,

02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:30.220
but what's fascinating about Burning Man,

02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:33.340
someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground,

02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:37.860
no trash, no cigarettes.

02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:40.300
The ethic of like picking up your shit there

02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:42.380
is like so intense.

02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:44.780
So it's not like the other festivals you go to

02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:46.500
where there's just trash everywhere,

02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:48.420
shit scattered everywhere.

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:51.460
It's clean, people are picking up their stuff.

02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:54.540
People are like really being conscious

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:56.460
of like not fucking up the playa.

02:54:56.460 --> 02:55:01.420
So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping about Burning Man.

02:55:01.420 --> 02:55:02.780
We won't stop.

02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:03.740
It'll be morning.

02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.620
But there's a power.

02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:08.860
But there is a power to culture propagating itself

02:55:08.860 --> 02:55:10.900
through the stories that we tell each other

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:14.500
and that holds up for Burning Man.

02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:16.940
It's clear that the culture has stayed strong

02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:17.780
throughout the years.

02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:18.620
Yes.

02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:22.140
There's so many people, so many really interesting people

02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:27.900
speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:31.060
to remind themselves about what's important.

02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:31.900
Yes.

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:32.740
That's so interesting.

02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:34.180
And it is, and it is.

02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:36.260
I mean, it's like, you know, there are all these stories

02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:38.260
of like, I love guru stories.

02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:40.620
I have a guru, Neem Krollibaba, never met him.

02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:43.700
He was Ram Dass's guru, at least not in the flesh.

02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:46.580
But the story of the guru is if you're lucky,

02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:48.860
you meet this being that,

02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:50.260
and we're not talking about, you know,

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:54.220
whatever the run of the mill, like charlatans out there.

02:55:54.220 --> 02:55:59.220
Like, I know for sure that people are in the world right now

02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:05.260
who, when you're around them,

02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:06.980
the thing you're talking about,

02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:10.500
the affirmation of the potential of humanity

02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:13.980
and also just an acceptance of yourself and, you know,

02:56:13.980 --> 02:56:18.380
cultivate, like seeing someone who's cultivated love

02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:19.780
or compassion or whatever.

02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:24.780
But in this way that is, I mean, you would almost,

02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:28.380
you would rather meet that being

02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.420
than like a UFO land in your backyard.

02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:31.820
It's like, it is the UFO.

02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:33.660
It's a person, but it's not.

02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.860
It's everybody and nobody.

02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:40.860
And somehow they like end up conveying to you ideas

02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:45.140
that you may have heard a million times before,

02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:49.300
but somehow within the language itself is a transmission

02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:52.220
that permanently alters you.

02:56:52.220 --> 02:56:54.740
And so these people exist.

02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:56.940
I think you could argue that Burning Man,

02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:01.580
the total thing is a guru,

02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:04.140
that a pilgrimage is involved to get there.

02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:08.220
Like, it's not easy to get there.

02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:12.700
And when you get there, it's gonna teach you something.

02:57:12.700 --> 02:57:14.180
It's gonna show you something.

02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:17.620
It's going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you

02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:19.140
might not be great,

02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:24.420
but the community around you will like,

02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:27.100
will hold you as you're like,

02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:29.180
whatever the thing is that's coming out of you,

02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.100
it's coming out of you.

02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:31.580
And even the simplest activities,

02:57:31.580 --> 02:57:35.860
the simplest exchange of words have like,

02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:40.860
just like with the gurus, a profound impact somehow.

02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:42.460
Something about that place.

02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:46.420
Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities,

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:48.780
like insane synchronicities there.

02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:50.500
And I think like, you know,

02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:54.100
to get back to the notion of sentience as a by-product

02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:58.740
of a harmonized yet hyper-complex system,

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:01.100
I think synchronicities,

02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:04.340
like those kinds of systems are like lightning rods

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:05.260
for synchronicity.

02:58:05.260 --> 02:58:10.260
So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities happen

02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:14.820
that are impossible, where you just have to deal with it.

02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:17.180
And like, you'll need something

02:58:17.220 --> 02:58:18.780
within a few minutes.

02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:20.780
Someone's like, oh, here you go.

02:58:20.780 --> 02:58:22.300
And you mentioned, but by the way,

02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:25.740
Burning Man, because of a psychedelic experience,

02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:29.380
is it the strawberries or was it something else?

02:58:29.380 --> 02:58:30.860
What was the moment?

02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:31.700
Yeah, that was magical.

02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:32.740
No, it was DMT.

02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:35.940
Well, definitely wasn't strawberries.

02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:36.780
Ha!

02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:39.820
No, I was-

02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:41.100
More potent.

02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:44.420
Yeah, I was like smoking DMT and

02:58:47.580 --> 02:58:48.420
like,

02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:51.980
I saw, like,

02:58:52.860 --> 02:58:54.140
if you, in the Midnight Gospel,

02:58:54.140 --> 02:58:56.620
there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck

02:58:56.620 --> 02:58:58.620
and a lantern head.

02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:01.900
So like, I saw one of those things.

02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:06.900
And, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous

02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:13.300
because you hear like all the Terrence McKenna stories

02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:16.620
of the self-transforming machine elves

02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:20.780
or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees.

02:59:20.780 --> 02:59:22.980
I'm like, so this is what I get?

02:59:22.980 --> 02:59:26.300
Like a fucking cow with a lantern head?

02:59:26.300 --> 02:59:28.340
Like that's where my brain is at

02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:30.780
and we're interacting with this molecule.

02:59:30.780 --> 02:59:32.140
So then, like,

02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:35.660
I look away.

02:59:38.380 --> 02:59:39.660
And again, this is DMT.

02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:42.180
So when I say look away, do I mean with my eyes shut,

02:59:42.180 --> 02:59:43.020
I look away?

02:59:43.020 --> 02:59:44.100
Or eyes open, I look away?

02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:46.100
I think eyes shut.

02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:47.780
So it sounds weird to say look away,

02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:51.980
but however you want to put it, that's what I did.

02:59:51.980 --> 02:59:54.980
And I look back and it's still there.

02:59:54.980 --> 02:59:55.980
Only now it's, you know,

02:59:55.980 --> 02:59:57.060
cause usually in like,

02:59:57.060 --> 02:59:58.980
when you're having those kinds of visions,

02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:01.300
they go away pretty quickly.

03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:03.140
This thing's like moved,

03:00:03.140 --> 03:00:05.340
like shambled ahead maybe a few steps,

03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:07.460
just like a cow, just like a cow.

03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:12.060
And then that was when the, you know,

03:00:12.060 --> 03:00:13.340
all the stories you hear about it,

03:00:13.340 --> 03:00:15.220
like going through some kind of tube

03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:17.100
or some kind of light tunnel,

03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:18.900
like a water slide made of light.

03:00:18.900 --> 03:00:21.820
It's increasingly familiar.

03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:23.380
That's the wildest part of it.

03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:25.260
It's like, oh, I know this place.

03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:27.540
Not like, oh, I've seen this in like, you know,

03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:29.740
on like bong stickers,

03:00:29.740 --> 03:00:32.340
but like, oh yeah, this is that place you go to.

03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:34.420
You just remember, oh, this place.

03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:39.020
And then it was like I was in some kind of,

03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:42.740
I don't know how to put it, a chamber,

03:00:42.740 --> 03:00:44.380
a technological chamber,

03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:46.020
some kind of super computers,

03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:49.500
some kind of nucleus that was technological.

03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:52.660
And it was inviting, there was an invitation of like,

03:00:52.660 --> 03:00:56.460
come in, like come deeper into, come deeper in.

03:00:56.460 --> 03:01:00.220
And you can talk to whatever it is over there.

03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.820
You don't talk, but there's a communication.

03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:07.820
And I communicated, but my friends, I don't,

03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:08.860
I love my friends.

03:01:08.860 --> 03:01:10.460
I guess I had some sense in that moment

03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:12.980
that it would mean complete obliteration

03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:15.180
or who knows what.

03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:18.260
And the response that it gave back was,

03:01:18.260 --> 03:01:20.620
you can always go back there.

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.420
And that's when I opened my eyes, I'm back.

03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:25.500
Totally, you know, and ever since then,

03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:30.500
that's caused me to revise my thinking on reincarnation,

03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:33.340
the idea that you die and you start as a baby

03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:34.900
and then live your life again.

03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:36.940
It goes right into what we were talking about.

03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:39.700
You know, that maybe data, you know,

03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:41.420
that the shit I saw in nitrous oxide,

03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:44.220
I feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related to drugs,

03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:46.220
but not all of them are, a lot of them.

03:01:46.220 --> 03:01:49.700
But this notion of like, oh, is it that we're

03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:56.060
imprinting into the medium of time space,

03:01:56.060 --> 03:02:01.060
everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,

03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:06.300
a frame that upon death can be accessed

03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:10.060
in the same way that we can pull up pictures

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:13.620
on our phone or computers and not only access,

03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:16.300
but experienced as though,

03:02:17.940 --> 03:02:20.180
in other words, you could just jump in.

03:02:20.180 --> 03:02:22.020
You're still gonna have your memories.

03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:26.260
It's gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid

03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:28.780
and gotten to that frame, but no,

03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:33.220
you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever.

03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:34.980
And yeah.

03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:37.340
You can jump around freely in space and time.

03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:38.180
Yeah, yeah.

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:40.140
You can go in and out of time space,

03:02:40.140 --> 03:02:43.780
but the problem is when you go into time space, it's time.

03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:45.220
So it's gonna feel sticky.

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.620
It's gonna feel like you've been here forever

03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:49.020
because you've dropped back onto the track

03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:50.620
that Nietzsche's talking about.

03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:55.460
And I guess one of the qualities of dropping into that frame

03:02:55.460 --> 03:03:00.460
is that you forget your higher dimensional identity.

03:03:00.940 --> 03:03:03.100
What happened to the cow with the lantern?

03:03:04.420 --> 03:03:05.900
Was that goodbye?

03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:08.900
He writes me letters sometimes.

03:03:08.900 --> 03:03:11.420
Never saw it again.

03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:12.260
Never.

03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:16.260
Never saw it again, but we put it in the Midnight Gospel.

03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:21.180
Pendleton was such a genius and he drew it for me

03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:23.500
and then it just ended up as a part of the show.

03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:27.100
But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours,

03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:28.980
I haven't watched the Midnight Gospel

03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:31.140
because I've been waiting.

03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:33.980
It's so, so, you do these stupid things,

03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:36.460
but ever since you talked to,

03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:39.860
maybe two years ago with Joe about it,

03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:41.940
I've been waiting to watch it

03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:44.500
with like a special person on mushrooms.

03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:45.340
Oh.

03:03:45.340 --> 03:03:46.340
That's been in my to-do.

03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:48.580
I don't know, of course you don't have to be on mushrooms

03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:52.500
to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into my head

03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:55.100
that this is something I wanna do with somebody else

03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:56.900
like experience it and get in the wild.

03:03:56.900 --> 03:03:57.980
Love it.

03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:00.820
Because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch

03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:02.540
of it just a little bit here and there,

03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:05.980
but it's just visually such an interesting experience.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:07.780
Thank you.

03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:09.020
Combined with everything else, obviously,

03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:12.140
the ideas, the voices and so on,

03:04:12.140 --> 03:04:16.980
but just visually, it's like a super psychedelic version

03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:19.380
of Rick and Morty or something like that,

03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:23.140
like farther out, while they're out there.

03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:26.140
Yeah, man, that's Pendleton.

03:04:26.140 --> 03:04:29.940
These people, I mean, I was part of that

03:04:30.140 --> 03:04:35.140
in the sense that Pendleton gave,

03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:37.060
one of the reasons he's such a genius

03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:41.220
and great at making stuff is he really does a good job

03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:46.060
of just de-hierarchizing potential hierarchies

03:04:46.060 --> 03:04:47.500
that can appear.

03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:51.220
Someone has to be driving the bus and that was Pendleton,

03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:54.100
but he's so inclusive.

03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:57.220
There's a real punk rock thing that he's doing,

03:04:57.220 --> 03:04:58.860
which is he'll take everything

03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:01.260
and it kind of mixes its way into the show.

03:05:01.260 --> 03:05:06.260
But one of the things, in animation,

03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:11.780
it can get really strict with drawing the characters

03:05:11.780 --> 03:05:16.780
and trying to create continuity in the way

03:05:17.780 --> 03:05:21.180
the character looks and it can get really brute

03:05:21.180 --> 03:05:24.420
for the animator, it can get brutally precise.

03:05:24.420 --> 03:05:27.300
It has to be precise, but he figured out

03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:31.260
that if you just sort of, it's not like obviously

03:05:31.260 --> 03:05:34.100
like Clancy had to look like Clancy through the whole show,

03:05:34.100 --> 03:05:36.580
but if you allow the various people animating it

03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:39.340
to sort of have their own spin on it,

03:05:39.340 --> 03:05:42.740
then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic,

03:05:42.740 --> 03:05:45.100
you know, the show looks more psychedelic

03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:48.260
because it looks more organic and also the amount of time.

03:05:48.260 --> 03:05:50.540
I had no idea the amount of time

03:05:50.540 --> 03:05:55.540
that goes into making digital art look like that

03:05:56.460 --> 03:05:58.700
is, it's insane.

03:05:58.700 --> 03:06:02.660
The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy.

03:06:03.940 --> 03:06:04.780
It's crazy.

03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:07.380
Well, generally the amount of time it takes,

03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:10.260
even just like a painting, when you,

03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:13.260
I really enjoy watching like artists do a time lapse

03:06:13.260 --> 03:06:15.100
and you realize how much effort,

03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:18.860
just into a single image goes into it.

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:21.060
You know, hours and hours and hours, sometimes days,

03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:23.180
sometimes weeks and months,

03:06:23.180 --> 03:06:24.820
and then you just get to see them work,

03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:28.420
but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it

03:06:28.420 --> 03:06:30.420
and the rhythm of it.

03:06:30.420 --> 03:06:32.740
And like, because they're focused on the,

03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:34.540
so we're talking about robotics earlier,

03:06:34.540 --> 03:06:37.340
like on the little details, like they're never look,

03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:40.060
well, most of the time isn't spent looking

03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:41.780
at the big picture of the final result,

03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:44.020
it's looking at the little details there and so on,

03:06:44.020 --> 03:06:46.300
and they're, but they're nevertheless able

03:06:46.300 --> 03:06:49.380
to somehow constantly channel the big picture,

03:06:49.380 --> 03:06:50.460
the final result.

03:06:50.460 --> 03:06:53.820
My God, yeah, the respect I have for animators.

03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:58.740
It's like, dear God, it's the craziest thing

03:06:58.740 --> 03:07:01.180
when you watch it, when you see what it looks like

03:07:01.180 --> 03:07:04.620
and how much time goes into it and how zen they have to be,

03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:05.460
because like, no matter what,

03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:07.260
you're gonna have to cut stuff, man.

03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:10.380
And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation,

03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:13.380
that was someone's like month maybe, you know?

03:07:13.380 --> 03:07:17.780
And like they understand, but still it's like, whoa,

03:07:17.780 --> 03:07:19.060
it's brutal.

03:07:19.100 --> 03:07:24.100
And so they have like this zen outlook on it,

03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:26.380
which is really cool.

03:07:26.380 --> 03:07:28.100
And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing,

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:30.460
when you realize like they're listening to podcasts

03:07:30.460 --> 03:07:34.380
or like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too.

03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.900
But yeah, man, I, you know.

03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:38.500
Yeah, your voice is in the ears

03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:40.300
of a lot of interesting people.

03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:41.140
Isn't it?

03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:41.980
Of course, too.

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:42.820
And I, you know.

03:07:42.820 --> 03:07:43.940
Hello, interesting person.

03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:46.900
Hello, CIA animators.

03:07:46.940 --> 03:07:49.620
Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.

03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:52.380
I'm on your side, he's against you, I'm with you.

03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:53.660
Yeah.

03:07:53.660 --> 03:07:56.940
Do you have a beard, therefore you must be wise.

03:07:56.940 --> 03:08:01.380
Do you have advice for young people, high school, college,

03:08:02.900 --> 03:08:05.460
about how to carve their path through life?

03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:10.100
How to have a life, a career that's successful,

03:08:10.100 --> 03:08:12.900
that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of?

03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:14.820
Man, see, this is what kind of,

03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:18.340
this is what sucks about my life,

03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:23.340
is that it's been very random and very spontaneous.

03:08:23.660 --> 03:08:27.100
So unfortunately, I don't get that thing

03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:28.980
where I could be like, well, here's what I did.

03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:29.820
Yeah.

03:08:29.820 --> 03:08:31.540
Because it's like, I don't, like I,

03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:35.860
I inherited $12,000 from my grandmother.

03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:36.980
Here's what you do, kids.

03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:39.660
You inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies.

03:08:39.660 --> 03:08:42.060
And then you need to be dumb enough to think

03:08:42.100 --> 03:08:46.220
that that $12,000 is gonna help you live in LA for a year.

03:08:46.220 --> 03:08:49.780
So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000

03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:53.780
and you find a shitty place that you live at

03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:58.100
and then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers.

03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:00.780
And then you run out of the money and then you,

03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:04.020
then you have to get a job.

03:09:04.020 --> 03:09:05.620
And so then, because you think it'll be fun

03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:09.260
to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store.

03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:11.980
And then, you know, that's how it happened for me.

03:09:12.900 --> 03:09:15.380
I never had the confidence to be like,

03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:18.540
ah, I'm gonna be a standup comedian.

03:09:18.540 --> 03:09:19.380
No way.

03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:22.060
I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building.

03:09:22.060 --> 03:09:23.780
I thought the building looked cool.

03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.500
And so, but then like, cause like you work

03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:28.500
at the comedy store, you get stage time.

03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:32.220
It's there, it's the reason like you work there

03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:33.740
is at least in those days,

03:09:33.740 --> 03:09:36.700
cause it's not like they're paying like a shit ton of money

03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:39.100
for you to answer phones at a comedy club.

03:09:39.140 --> 03:09:42.460
And so, you know, I started going on stage

03:09:42.460 --> 03:09:46.020
and then like, I just got lucky

03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:50.420
cause Rogan saw me have like a very rare good set.

03:09:50.420 --> 03:09:52.580
I didn't know he was in the room or I would have bombed,

03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:55.180
you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny

03:09:55.180 --> 03:09:56.060
and he liked talking to me.

03:09:56.060 --> 03:09:57.940
He started taking me on the road with him.

03:09:57.940 --> 03:09:59.660
And then, you know, so I don't know, man.

03:09:59.660 --> 03:10:00.500
I think.

03:10:01.580 --> 03:10:02.900
Was there an element to,

03:10:02.900 --> 03:10:06.700
there's a beautiful weirdness to you as a human being.

03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:12.340
Was there like a pressure to conform ever

03:10:12.540 --> 03:10:15.660
to hide yourself from the world

03:10:15.660 --> 03:10:19.980
or did the $12,000 in the asset give you the confidence

03:10:19.980 --> 03:10:21.660
you needed to be yourself?

03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:24.460
Oh no, I don't like, I didn't still, I'm no,

03:10:24.460 --> 03:10:26.780
I think sure, there's that pressure.

03:10:26.780 --> 03:10:30.100
And like, you know, whenever you're beginning

03:10:30.100 --> 03:10:31.860
to really differentiate from your parents,

03:10:31.860 --> 03:10:34.100
but then you go back to hang out with your parents,

03:10:34.660 --> 03:10:36.900
you can feel that.

03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:38.740
It's not like they even want you to conform,

03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:40.460
but you'll just, you could slip into that,

03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:41.340
whatever that was.

03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:43.020
So I remember that when I would go back

03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:48.020
and like visit them and stuff and surely conformity

03:10:48.180 --> 03:10:52.340
or the pressure to like not be individual or whatever.

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:53.900
It's everywhere, man.

03:10:53.900 --> 03:10:55.940
Do you think you made your parents proud?

03:10:58.660 --> 03:10:59.500
E...

03:11:01.660 --> 03:11:03.340
No, no, no, no.

03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:06.860
Well, I think that when my mom died,

03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:13.060
I felt successful in the sense that I was able

03:11:13.060 --> 03:11:18.060
to support my, I was making money from doing standup

03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:20.020
and my, I didn't need help.

03:11:20.020 --> 03:11:22.620
I was like, I was supporting myself with art

03:11:22.620 --> 03:11:24.940
and doing good, what I thought was great then.

03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:27.220
So, and I think she like,

03:11:27.220 --> 03:11:31.340
because she had witnessed me literally failing.

03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:32.380
I mean, which is by the way,

03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:36.860
I think part of, if you wanna be an artist or successful,

03:11:36.860 --> 03:11:38.620
you kind of have to fail.

03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:43.620
Like there, if, and if there was a guaranteed route

03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:48.860
from sucking to not sucking or from like

03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:54.060
the neophyte phase of whatever the art form is,

03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:56.620
and you know, some intermediary phase,

03:11:56.620 --> 03:11:58.740
then I think a lot more people would do it.

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:01.740
But there really is no guarantees in it,

03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:03.180
especially the standup comedy.

03:12:03.180 --> 03:12:06.700
It's like, you'd have to be a maniac to want it,

03:12:06.700 --> 03:12:08.420
to think that that's gonna work out for you.

03:12:08.420 --> 03:12:10.540
You have to, so you're gonna,

03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:13.860
there are obviously exceptions,

03:12:13.860 --> 03:12:18.860
but for me, it was like a long slog, you know?

03:12:18.900 --> 03:12:20.380
And that's scary for a mom.

03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:25.380
So, but that being said, when she was dying,

03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:31.100
like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore.

03:12:31.140 --> 03:12:35.020
And she did say, she said, you did it.

03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:36.740
And that's cool.

03:12:36.740 --> 03:12:40.060
But, and you know, I would love for her to see me now.

03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:42.860
Like now it'd be way cooler, but maybe she does.

03:12:42.860 --> 03:12:43.700
I don't know.

03:12:43.700 --> 03:12:47.540
She's listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other,

03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:48.380
In the Bardo?

03:12:48.380 --> 03:12:49.900
Yeah.

03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:52.340
Yeah, however long that lasts,

03:12:52.340 --> 03:12:55.060
reconfiguring the whole process to start again.

03:12:56.380 --> 03:12:59.620
You as a father know, how did that change you?

03:13:00.300 --> 03:13:02.140
That's the big change, man.

03:13:02.140 --> 03:13:02.980
That's the thing.

03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:06.740
You made a few biological entities.

03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:08.580
Yeah, I made biological entities.

03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:10.900
I mean, I came in my wife, let's face it.

03:13:10.900 --> 03:13:12.340
Like I would love to say I made them,

03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:14.540
but the womb whipped them up.

03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:19.420
But it is the, yeah, it's the best.

03:13:19.420 --> 03:13:22.420
I've never experienced anything like it before.

03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:24.900
It is the, as far as I'm concerned,

03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:27.780
the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:30.500
And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question

03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:32.980
with like, hell yes, fuck yes.

03:13:32.980 --> 03:13:33.820
That's great.

03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:35.180
I get to be around my kids again.

03:13:35.180 --> 03:13:36.380
I'll always be around my kids.

03:13:36.380 --> 03:13:38.300
I'll always be around my children.

03:13:38.300 --> 03:13:39.140
That's incredible.

03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:39.980
That's the joy.

03:13:39.980 --> 03:13:41.860
So like, so for me,

03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:48.300
the part of myself that used to torture myself more,

03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:51.060
specifically like around like my mom dying,

03:13:51.060 --> 03:13:53.700
feeling like I wasn't there enough for her,

03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:56.060
wishing that I had spent more time with her,

03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:58.220
wishing I'd spent more time with my dad,

03:13:58.220 --> 03:14:00.100
wishing that like, you know,

03:14:00.100 --> 03:14:03.980
looking back at like how like I was just so desperately

03:14:03.980 --> 03:14:07.500
trying to evade the fact that she was dying.

03:14:08.500 --> 03:14:10.540
And through, and in that evasion,

03:14:10.540 --> 03:14:13.580
successfully like distanced myself from her

03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:16.420
and like in ways that I really wish I hadn't.

03:14:20.060 --> 03:14:22.260
I'm just saying that because it's one of my regrets.

03:14:22.260 --> 03:14:23.100
It's like a big regret.

03:14:23.100 --> 03:14:24.580
I have a lot of little regrets,

03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:26.340
but that's a big one.

03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:30.940
And so when you have kids,

03:14:33.180 --> 03:14:38.260
you look back at everything you did

03:14:38.260 --> 03:14:40.380
and you think like, fuck,

03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:43.620
if I'd gone left at that point instead of right,

03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:45.700
if I had eaten, who knows?

03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:48.820
What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich

03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:53.420
when my balls were creating the cum

03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:54.940
that was gonna make my kids?

03:14:54.940 --> 03:14:56.660
Would I have a different kid?

03:14:56.660 --> 03:14:59.060
Would this being not exist in my life?

03:14:59.060 --> 03:15:00.500
Like you start looking at everything

03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:03.620
and you realize like, thank God,

03:15:03.620 --> 03:15:06.460
thank God for every single thing that happened to me

03:15:06.460 --> 03:15:08.820
because it all led up to this.

03:15:08.820 --> 03:15:11.660
And oh, for me, that is the,

03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:16.660
that's, it's like, it frees you

03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:21.220
and it liberates you because you realize like,

03:15:21.220 --> 03:15:23.740
oh wow, it's clumsy and selfish

03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:28.740
and at times rotten as I've been in my life,

03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:34.300
that did not impede the universe at all

03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:37.380
from allowing these two beautiful beings

03:15:37.380 --> 03:15:38.460
to exist in the world.

03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:40.420
So maybe all of it enabled,

03:15:40.420 --> 03:15:44.660
all of it like a concert perfectly led up

03:15:44.660 --> 03:15:47.580
to that little beautiful moment.

03:15:48.420 --> 03:15:52.700
Is there ways you would like to be a better father?

03:15:52.700 --> 03:15:55.700
Oh yeah, for sure, absolutely.

03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:58.180
There's a, there's an actual,

03:15:58.180 --> 03:16:00.980
I read something in a book, it's called Good Enough.

03:16:00.980 --> 03:16:03.460
The mantra for a parent, good enough

03:16:03.460 --> 03:16:05.060
because when you are in the presence

03:16:05.060 --> 03:16:10.060
of something you love more than you've ever experienced love,

03:16:12.820 --> 03:16:16.180
you wanna be perfect, like you wanna be,

03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:18.980
I gotta work, man, I gotta go on the road,

03:16:18.980 --> 03:16:20.820
I've gotta work, I gotta support the family.

03:16:20.820 --> 03:16:22.300
So that means I have to work.

03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:25.500
Like I work, you know what it's like having a podcast,

03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:26.860
you fucking work, man.

03:16:26.860 --> 03:16:31.860
And it's a full-time job because I do stand-up too

03:16:33.900 --> 03:16:34.740
and all the other stuff.

03:16:34.740 --> 03:16:38.780
So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God,

03:16:38.780 --> 03:16:40.700
I wanna spend more time with them.

03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:42.140
Like I should be spending more time with them.

03:16:42.140 --> 03:16:45.060
But then also I wanna create, I wanna work.

03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:49.020
I like being the provider.

03:16:49.020 --> 03:16:53.620
So that's something I feel guilty about right now.

03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:56.660
And you're struggling how to balance that correctly.

03:16:56.660 --> 03:16:59.860
And meanwhile, time just marches on.

03:17:01.140 --> 03:17:03.300
It just goes, it goes.

03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:07.460
And all of this will be forgotten,

03:17:07.460 --> 03:17:11.620
both you and I, but forgotten in time.

03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:12.460
That's what I say to them

03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:14.220
every time I'm putting them to bed.

03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:18.580
We will be lost in the sands of time.

03:17:18.580 --> 03:17:20.540
You know that, I bet you know this poem.

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:22.460
You know that poem, Ozymandias?

03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:23.940
Yes.

03:17:23.940 --> 03:17:25.740
Can I read you a poem?

03:17:25.740 --> 03:17:26.980
Oh, okay.

03:17:29.580 --> 03:17:32.300
Let's end our conversation in a poem.

03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:33.220
I love it.

03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:37.500
It's by Pierce Bysshe Shelley,

03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:39.500
probably mispronouncing the name.

03:17:39.500 --> 03:17:40.460
But I think you'll get- There's no right way

03:17:40.460 --> 03:17:42.700
to pronounce anything. Thank you, thank you.

03:17:42.980 --> 03:17:45.780
I'm Ozymandias.

03:17:45.780 --> 03:17:49.220
I met a traveler from an antique land who said,

03:17:49.220 --> 03:17:54.060
two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.

03:17:54.060 --> 03:17:59.060
Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies,

03:17:59.580 --> 03:18:04.140
whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command

03:18:04.140 --> 03:18:07.900
tell that its sculptor, well those passions read,

03:18:07.900 --> 03:18:11.860
which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

03:18:11.900 --> 03:18:15.100
the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.

03:18:15.100 --> 03:18:18.300
And on the pedestal, these words appear.

03:18:18.300 --> 03:18:21.940
My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.

03:18:21.940 --> 03:18:25.300
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.

03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:27.780
Nothing beside remains around the decay

03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:29.500
of that colossal wreck.

03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:32.980
Boundless and bare, the lone and level sands

03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:34.500
stretch far away.

03:18:38.020 --> 03:18:39.140
All gone.

03:18:39.980 --> 03:18:42.100
Behold the king.

03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:45.740
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.

03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:47.460
And despair.

03:18:47.460 --> 03:18:50.700
Even though we'll be forgotten in the sands of time,

03:18:50.700 --> 03:18:53.660
Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist

03:18:53.660 --> 03:18:55.580
and you put so much love into the world

03:18:55.580 --> 03:18:57.260
over the past many years that I've gotten

03:18:57.260 --> 03:18:59.500
a chance to enjoy by being your fan.

03:18:59.500 --> 03:19:00.420
Likewise.

03:19:00.420 --> 03:19:02.820
Thank you so much for continuing that

03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:04.740
and for sharing a bit of love with me today.

03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:05.940
Can we be friends?

03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:06.780
Let's be friends.

03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:09.340
In the real world, in 3D space?

03:19:09.340 --> 03:19:12.100
Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice

03:19:12.100 --> 03:19:14.580
of the multidimensional world we live in,

03:19:14.580 --> 03:19:16.220
it will be an honor and a pleasure.

03:19:16.220 --> 03:19:17.500
Thank you for having me on your show.

03:19:17.500 --> 03:19:18.340
Love you, Duncan.

03:19:18.340 --> 03:19:19.180
I love you.

03:19:19.180 --> 03:19:20.580
Thank you, Lex.

03:19:20.580 --> 03:19:22.140
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:19:22.140 --> 03:19:23.380
with Duncan Trussell.

And now, let me leave you with some words

03:19:29.540 --> 03:19:31.220
from Duncan Trussell himself.

03:19:32.140 --> 03:19:35.660
You are essentially just the cloud of atoms

03:19:35.660 --> 03:19:39.100
that will eventually be aerosolized by time.

03:19:40.140 --> 03:19:43.180
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
