00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
The following is a conversation with Neal Stephenson, a legendary science fiction writer

00:04.760 --> 00:10.680
exploring ideas in mathematics, science, cryptography, money, linguistics, philosophy, and virtual

00:10.680 --> 00:17.140
reality, from his early book Snow Crash to his new one called Termination Shock.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.020
He doesn't just write novels.

00:19.020 --> 00:25.100
He worked at the space company Blue Origin for many years, including, technically, being

00:25.100 --> 00:27.180
Blue Origin's first employee.

00:27.180 --> 00:33.260
He also was the chief futurist at the virtual reality company Magic Leap.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.180
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:35.180 --> 00:38.660
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:38.660 --> 00:43.540
And now, here's my conversation with Neal Stephenson.

00:43.540 --> 00:50.820
You write both historical fiction, like World War II in Cryptonomicon, and science fiction,

00:50.820 --> 00:53.220
looking both into the past and the future.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.680
So let me ask, does history repeat itself?

00:56.680 --> 00:59.700
In which way does it repeat itself, in which way does it not?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.740
I'm afraid it repeats itself a lot.

01:02.740 --> 01:05.920
So I think human nature kind of is what it is.

01:05.920 --> 01:12.320
And so we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging again and again.

01:12.320 --> 01:20.120
And so it's kind of the exception rather than the rule when something new happens.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.600
What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human nature?

01:25.600 --> 01:33.720
Well, the standards of living, life expectancy, all that have gotten incredibly better within

01:33.720 --> 01:36.760
the last, particularly the last hundred years.

01:36.760 --> 01:44.200
I mean, just antibiotics, modern vaccines, electrification, the internet.

01:44.200 --> 01:49.760
These are all improvements in most people's standard of living and health and longevity

01:49.760 --> 01:58.240
that exceed anything that was seen before in human history.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.800
So people are living longer, they're generally healthier, and so on.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.760
But again, we still see a lot of the same behavior patterns, some of which are not very

02:09.760 --> 02:10.760
attractive.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.040
So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.680
Presumably with technology, you have less and less constraints on resources.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.720
So we get to maybe emphasize the better angels of our nature.

02:22.720 --> 02:30.760
And in so doing, does that not potentially fundamentally alter the experience that we

02:30.760 --> 02:32.720
have of life on Earth?

02:32.720 --> 02:37.960
Until the last 10 or so years, I would have taken that view, I think.

02:37.960 --> 02:49.840
But people will find ways to be divisive and angry if it scratches a kind of psychological

02:49.840 --> 02:51.880
itch that they have got.

02:51.880 --> 02:57.680
And we used to look at the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic collapse of

02:58.280 --> 03:09.640
prior to the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler, at least partially

03:09.640 --> 03:17.120
by just the misery that people were living in at that time.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.520
The economic collapse.

03:18.520 --> 03:25.560
Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.360
And that sounds like a plausible explanation.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.240
But there are economic troubles now, for sure.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.320
We had the bank collapse in 2008.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.920
And there's stagnation in some people's standards of living.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.840
But it's hard to explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years, just

03:43.840 --> 03:49.440
strictly on the basis of people are poor and angry and sad.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.180
I think they want to be angry.

03:52.180 --> 03:58.820
So without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons

03:58.820 --> 04:05.460
you can draw from World War II, this singular event in human history, it seems like?

04:05.460 --> 04:10.940
And yet, as you say, history rhymes, at the very least.

04:10.940 --> 04:17.600
Being who I am, I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened in conjunction

04:17.600 --> 04:21.900
with that war, which may not be where you want to go.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.460
Well, there's several things inside to interrupt.

04:24.460 --> 04:30.420
So one in cryptonomicon is more like the Alan Turing side of things.

04:30.420 --> 04:38.240
And then first of all, there's the tools of war, which is the kind of technology.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.860
But then there's just like the human nature, the nature of good and evil.

04:41.860 --> 04:42.860
Yeah.

04:42.940 --> 04:49.840
One of the things that emerges from the war and from the extermination camps is that we're

04:49.840 --> 04:55.240
never allowed to have illusions anymore about human nature.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.920
So you have to learn that lesson to be an educated person.

05:00.920 --> 05:07.400
And you have to know that even in a supposedly enlightened, civilized society, people can

05:07.400 --> 05:10.600
become monsters quite easily.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.540
So that is for sure the big takeaway.

05:13.540 --> 05:22.700
Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn about the line between good and evil runs through the heart

05:22.700 --> 05:23.700
of every man?

05:23.700 --> 05:24.700
Yeah.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.740
That all of us are capable?

05:26.740 --> 05:27.740
Great line.

05:27.740 --> 05:28.740
Yeah.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.740
Of evil?

05:29.740 --> 05:35.500
I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager, because my grandfather

05:35.500 --> 05:41.100
had it in his house, because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed with the

05:41.100 --> 05:49.960
Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what had happened.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.820
And so he had those books lying around and I would read them.

05:55.820 --> 06:03.500
And it's a similar kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war,

06:03.500 --> 06:13.540
this creation of this system of camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior.

06:13.540 --> 06:22.460
To me, it's a story of how fear and desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead

06:22.460 --> 06:23.960
to evil.

06:23.960 --> 06:31.820
But it's also a story of bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and basically

06:31.820 --> 06:32.820
survival.

06:33.140 --> 06:40.500
We have like a man's search for meaning, which is the story of a man in a concentration camp

06:40.500 --> 06:45.820
basically finding beauty in life even under most extreme conditions.

06:45.820 --> 06:54.300
So to me, World War II is not necessarily a bleak view of human nature.

06:54.300 --> 07:02.620
It's a little moment of evil that revealed a much bigger good in humanity.

07:03.420 --> 07:08.460
So I'm not so sure that it leads me to a pessimistic view of the world, the fact that somebody

07:08.460 --> 07:14.020
like Hitler could happen, the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler and get

07:14.020 --> 07:20.660
excited and maybe even love the hate of the other for some moment of time.

07:20.660 --> 07:27.780
I think that all of us are capable of that, but I think all of us also have a capacity

07:27.780 --> 07:29.100
for good.

07:29.580 --> 07:38.380
I don't know what you think, but I think we have a greater desire for good than evil.

07:38.380 --> 07:45.940
It seems like that's where technology is very useful as a guide, as a helping hand.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.580
Can you give me an example, maybe?

07:48.580 --> 07:54.180
So I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current technologies.

07:54.260 --> 08:04.660
Technology is knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like Wikipedia,

08:04.660 --> 08:12.020
and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success, which is making

08:12.020 --> 08:15.260
the world's information accessible at your fingertips.

08:15.340 --> 08:24.460
That kind of technology enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people

08:24.460 --> 08:30.900
want to do good is true, then letting them discover all of the information out there,

08:30.900 --> 08:36.220
false information and true information, all of it, and let them explore, that's going

08:36.220 --> 08:40.740
to lead to a better world, to better people.

08:41.220 --> 08:50.620
I personally, I mentioned to you offline, love artificial intelligence, and so AI that's

08:50.620 --> 08:57.060
an assistant, that's a guide, like a mentor to you, that you can, in the way that Google

08:57.060 --> 09:02.780
Search is, but smarter, where you can help send it out and say, this is the direction

09:02.780 --> 09:09.180
in which I want to grow, not authoritarian lecturing down from the algorithm of telling

09:09.620 --> 09:19.220
you, this is how you should grow, but almost the opposite, where you use it as an assistant,

09:19.220 --> 09:23.460
a servant in your journey towards knowledge.

09:23.460 --> 09:28.380
That sounds like an easy thing, but it's actually, from an AI perspective, very difficult.

09:28.380 --> 09:33.340
This is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about a book

09:33.500 --> 09:39.980
that essentially does that, and I've been sort of watching people try to come at the

09:39.980 --> 09:46.220
problem of building that thing from different directions for, ever since the book came out

09:46.220 --> 09:54.420
basically, and so I kind of have, although I haven't worked on it myself, I do get a

09:54.420 --> 10:01.900
sense of the level of difficulty in realizing that goal.

10:01.900 --> 10:10.340
So that book is in the 90s, so as Google is coming to be, it's essentially, not Google,

10:10.340 --> 10:15.020
but the search engine, the initial search engine, which gave birth to Google, essentially,

10:15.020 --> 10:16.020
in contrast.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.020
Right.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.020
Yeah, yeah.

10:18.020 --> 10:24.860
That was still in the era of AltaVista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different search engines,

10:24.860 --> 10:28.100
and yeah, I'm pretty sure I had not heard of Google at that point.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.180
That would have been 95, 96.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.340
I think the book came out in 94.

10:33.340 --> 10:39.420
And then, of course, the social networks followed, which is another form of guidance through

10:39.420 --> 10:41.220
the space of information.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.220
Yeah.

10:42.220 --> 10:48.140
Well, what happens is that these things come along and then people find ways to game them,

10:48.140 --> 10:55.620
and so I saw an interesting thread the other day pointing out that 20 years ago, if you

10:55.620 --> 11:04.740
had Googled Pythagorean Theorem, chances are you would have been taken directly to

11:04.740 --> 11:07.580
a page explaining the Pythagorean Theorem.

11:07.580 --> 11:12.460
If you do it now, you're probably going to, the top hits are going to be from somebody

11:12.460 --> 11:15.460
who's got an angle, who's got a scheme, right?

11:15.460 --> 11:23.060
They're trying to sell you math tutoring or they're working some kind of marketing

11:23.060 --> 11:25.020
plan on you.

11:25.020 --> 11:32.300
So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time for their original

11:32.300 --> 11:35.180
educational purpose.

11:35.180 --> 11:41.180
That doesn't mean that they can't, it shouldn't be replaced by newer and better ones.

11:41.180 --> 11:45.700
First of all, to defend the people with the angle, right?

11:45.700 --> 11:51.700
They're trying to find business models, fund oftentimes, which is funny you went with Pythagorean,

11:52.300 --> 11:57.300
you went at math, those greedy bastards.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.300
But it's great.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.500
How can we monetize the Pythagorean Theorem?

12:01.500 --> 12:09.860
Well, I mean, education, right, is to figure out, people who love math education, for example,

12:09.860 --> 12:17.860
love it purely, not purely, but very often love it for itself, for just teaching math.

12:17.860 --> 12:22.820
But then they start, you know, when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube

12:22.820 --> 12:27.380
algorithm, they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I make money off of this?

12:27.380 --> 12:35.980
The primary goal is still that love of education, but they also want to make that love of education

12:35.980 --> 12:38.300
their full-time job.

12:38.300 --> 12:45.140
But I see that sort of that dance of humanity with the algorithms as it finds this kind

12:45.140 --> 12:54.420
of local pocket of optimality, or sub-optimality, whatever, it's a pocket of some sort.

12:54.420 --> 12:59.540
But I see that pocket is way better than what we had before in the 80s, right, or 90s before

12:59.540 --> 13:00.900
the internet.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.780
And now we're now, this is also human nature.

13:03.780 --> 13:10.100
We start writing very eloquent articles about how this pocket is clearly, pocket is not

13:10.100 --> 13:14.820
very good, and we can imagine which better lands far beyond.

13:14.820 --> 13:18.820
But the reality is, it's better than before, and now we're waiting for a new book.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.820
We have to escape from the local minimum.

13:20.820 --> 13:25.660
And you have to wait either for lone geniuses or for some kind of momentum of a group of

13:25.660 --> 13:31.460
geniuses that just say, enough is enough, I have an idea, this is how we get out.

13:31.460 --> 13:37.340
And it's too easy to be sort of, I think, partially because you can get a lot of clicks

13:37.340 --> 13:42.060
in your articles, being cynical about being in this pocket, and we are forever stuck in

13:42.060 --> 13:48.980
this pocket, and then coming up with this grandiose theory that humanity has finally,

13:48.980 --> 13:52.700
is collapsing, stuck forever like a prison in this pocket.

13:52.700 --> 14:00.300
But reality, it's just clickbait articles and books until we, one curious ant comes

14:00.300 --> 14:01.940
up with the next pocket.

14:01.940 --> 14:06.660
Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier.

14:06.660 --> 14:12.820
And eventually we'll be, as you've talked about, we'll colonize the solar system, and

14:12.820 --> 14:16.140
then we'll be stuck in the solar system.

14:16.140 --> 14:21.100
And then people will say, well, we're screwed because when the sun energy runs out, there's

14:21.100 --> 14:25.100
no way to get to the next solar system, and so on.

14:25.100 --> 14:28.700
It goes on until we colonize the entirety of the observable universe.

14:28.700 --> 14:29.700
Yeah.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.420
I think getting out of the solar system is going to be a hard one.

14:33.420 --> 14:34.820
So can you mention this?

14:34.820 --> 14:41.220
Can you elaborate why you think, back to sort of a serious question, why do you think it's

14:41.220 --> 14:43.980
hard to get outside of our solar system?

14:43.980 --> 14:52.380
It's just an energy, I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want.

14:52.380 --> 15:01.740
But the idea of getting there in one lifetime or multiple, a few lifetimes requires huge

15:01.820 --> 15:05.300
amounts of energy to accelerate.

15:05.300 --> 15:10.300
And then as soon as you get halfway there, you need to expend an equal amount of energy

15:10.300 --> 15:15.020
to decelerate, or you'll just go shooting by.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.300
And so that means carrying a lot of energy.

15:18.300 --> 15:26.700
And there's ideas like Yuri Milner, I think, is still funding the idea to use laser propulsion

15:26.780 --> 15:32.380
to send something to another star system, a small object.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.620
But it'll have no way to slow down, as far as I know.

15:35.620 --> 15:36.620
They never talk about that part.

15:36.620 --> 15:37.620
Yeah.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.620
How do we slow down?

15:38.620 --> 15:39.620
Yeah.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.940
It's a quick flyby to take a good picture, I guess.

15:42.940 --> 15:46.340
Yeah, you better take some good pictures on your way by.

15:46.340 --> 15:49.420
And that's great if it happens, I'm not knocking it.

15:49.420 --> 15:54.020
But the amount of energy that's needed is just staggering.

15:54.060 --> 16:01.300
And there's other issues like just how do you maintain an ecosystem for that long in

16:01.300 --> 16:02.740
isolation?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.180
How do you prevent people from going crazy?

16:05.180 --> 16:10.700
What happens if you hit something while traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light?

16:10.700 --> 16:18.580
What about some combination of expanding human lifespan, but also just good old-fashioned,

16:18.580 --> 16:20.900
stable society on a spaceship?

16:20.900 --> 16:21.900
Yeah.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.140
The generation ship.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.140
Yeah.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.140
Yeah.

16:25.140 --> 16:26.740
No, I think that's the only way.

16:26.740 --> 16:31.820
It would have to keep going for a long time.

16:31.820 --> 16:38.300
And they might get to where they're going and find a shitty solar system.

16:38.300 --> 16:46.660
We can try to do some advanced survey, but if you get there and all the planets in that

16:46.700 --> 16:53.540
solar system are just garbage planets, then it's kind of a big letdown for this 1,000-year

16:53.540 --> 16:58.180
voyage that you've just been on.

16:58.180 --> 17:07.060
We have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay between in order to survive

17:07.060 --> 17:12.660
in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with.

17:12.660 --> 17:19.380
So that sets a bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature

17:19.380 --> 17:21.740
and atmosphere and so on.

17:21.740 --> 17:31.180
So when you look at all those complications, then basically building sort of exactly the

17:31.180 --> 17:36.220
environment we want out of available materials in this solar system starts to look a hell

17:36.220 --> 17:39.180
of a lot better.

17:39.180 --> 17:47.340
It's hard to make an economic argument, let's say, for making that journey.

17:47.340 --> 17:51.420
One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that the people who are trying

17:51.420 --> 17:57.420
to build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for religious reasons.

17:57.420 --> 18:04.220
I think that's the only reason that you would do it because economically it just makes more

18:04.220 --> 18:10.060
sense to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect.

18:10.060 --> 18:13.460
Well, isn't everything done for religious reasons?

18:13.460 --> 18:16.580
Why do we exploration?

18:16.580 --> 18:20.220
Why do we go to the moon again and do the other things?

18:20.220 --> 18:24.500
What is JFK said is not because they're easy, but because they're hard, isn't that kind

18:24.500 --> 18:25.980
of a religious reason?

18:25.980 --> 18:31.140
I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were

18:31.220 --> 18:34.220
communism's greatest achievement.

18:34.220 --> 18:40.540
Yeah, so the conflict between nations is a kind of...

18:40.540 --> 18:43.820
It's not exactly a religion, but it's what you're talking about.

18:43.820 --> 18:49.940
Well, it's a struggle for meaning, and that meaning isn't found in some kind of...

18:49.940 --> 18:52.220
It's hard to find meaning in mathematics.

18:52.220 --> 18:56.540
It's found in some kind of music and religion, whatever, art.

18:56.540 --> 19:01.180
Some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to...

19:01.180 --> 19:07.740
Well, people that find meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines

19:07.740 --> 19:15.780
nevertheless, not in the actual proving, proving some kind of thing.

19:15.780 --> 19:22.440
So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we're building

19:22.480 --> 19:31.480
these kind of generation ships and just, why not launch them one a year out like wandering

19:31.480 --> 19:36.320
ants out into the galaxy?

19:36.320 --> 19:43.360
I have nothing against it, it's just, like I said, it's got the motivation to do it has

19:43.360 --> 19:50.360
to come from some kind of spiritual or kind of non-tangible calculus.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.880
So from a business model perspective, you don't think there's a business model there?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.480
No, no way.

19:56.480 --> 20:01.400
One of the many fascinating things you've done in your life, you were at the very beginning,

20:01.400 --> 20:08.520
you were the person that convinced Jeff Bezos to start a spaceship company, a space company.

20:08.520 --> 20:16.000
You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the beginning, working on alternate propulsion

20:16.040 --> 20:22.160
systems and at least according to Wikipedia, alternate business models.

20:22.160 --> 20:28.680
Yeah, I mean, to go back to the first thing you said, Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required

20:28.680 --> 20:31.080
a lot of convincing.

20:31.080 --> 20:36.120
He'd been thinking about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability.

20:36.800 --> 20:49.800
But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work,

20:49.800 --> 20:55.320
explore the corners of the space of possibilities.

20:55.320 --> 21:02.320
And so that's what, that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.640
And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years.

21:08.640 --> 21:17.080
And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction it's

21:17.080 --> 21:24.520
been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace technologies

21:24.520 --> 21:30.920
and models to make chemical-fueled rockets for space tourism.

21:31.040 --> 21:36.240
I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just

21:36.240 --> 21:38.040
an accident of history.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.840
It comes out of World War II.

21:40.840 --> 21:48.760
So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard.

21:48.760 --> 21:55.600
But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't quite reach it and the

21:55.600 --> 21:58.520
Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized.

21:58.520 --> 22:07.520
So he decides he's going to lob warheads into it with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
of resources.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.960
It's a terrible idea.

22:09.960 --> 22:17.720
But so it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.240
But that's the situation that existed.

22:20.240 --> 22:25.360
So they built these rockets, that's the V2.

22:25.360 --> 22:32.280
And then it's just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic bombs being

22:32.280 --> 22:37.120
developed in a completely separate superweapon program.

22:37.120 --> 22:44.120
And so suddenly the existence of the bombs creates a demand for rockets that didn't exist

22:44.120 --> 22:50.400
before because if you've got atomic bombs, you need a way to deliver them.

22:50.400 --> 22:56.700
You can do it with bombers, but it's a lot better to just hurl them to the other side

22:56.700 --> 23:00.320
of the world on the top of a rocket.

23:00.320 --> 23:06.080
So suddenly rockets, which had gotten a boost because of Hitler's V2 program, got a much

23:06.080 --> 23:10.720
bigger boost during the 50s and 60s.

23:10.720 --> 23:15.480
And it is a complete, you're right, for some reason never thought of this, it is an accident

23:15.480 --> 23:19.800
of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time.

23:20.200 --> 23:25.080
First of all, nuclear weapons didn't have to be developed at the same time as World

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
War II.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.680
That's an accident in history.

23:27.680 --> 23:32.320
And then the fact that, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.320
That's an accident.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.280
Okay, that's fascinating.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.480
That's a fascinating set of coincidences.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.560
Yeah, which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way.

23:42.560 --> 23:50.120
By the time these rockets are kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and

23:50.120 --> 23:54.500
so devastating that nobody really wants to use them.

23:54.500 --> 24:00.560
But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it into the socket on

24:00.560 --> 24:08.120
the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb.

24:08.120 --> 24:15.440
So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war.

24:15.440 --> 24:22.440
And I'd love to be in a meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
It's probably a Russian.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.040
Why don't we strap a person to the rocket?

24:26.040 --> 24:27.040
Yeah.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.040
Yeah.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.080
Well, it probably was because they did it first, right?

24:30.080 --> 24:31.080
The Russians did it.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.320
And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.320
Could be.

24:35.320 --> 24:40.160
They're a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life

24:40.160 --> 24:41.160
of an astronaut.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.160
Could be.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.160
Yeah.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
Yeah.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.480
This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because of these

24:47.480 --> 24:56.240
historical accidents, trillions of R&D dollars and rubles were put into development of chemical

24:56.240 --> 25:02.080
rocket technology, which is now advanced to an incredibly high degree.

25:02.120 --> 25:08.200
But there's other ways to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.480
That's all orbit is.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.600
It's just going really fast.

25:12.600 --> 25:19.600
And because so many nerds are obsessed with space, people have been thinking about alternate

25:19.600 --> 25:24.440
schemes for as long as they've been thinking about rockets.

25:24.440 --> 25:33.000
And so one of the first things that I learned, kind of trying to explore new possibilities

25:33.000 --> 25:42.000
was that I could put all of my brain power to work and be creative as I could and invent

25:42.000 --> 25:46.560
some idea that I thought was new for making things go fast.

25:46.560 --> 25:51.760
And I would always find out that some guy in Russia or somewhere had thought the same

25:51.840 --> 25:57.600
idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math.

25:57.600 --> 26:03.920
And so at a certain point, you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and

26:03.920 --> 26:10.080
just go poking around trying to find those guys.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.380
So there's a number of ideas that we looked at.

26:15.380 --> 26:18.520
Some are crazier, some are less crazy.

26:19.360 --> 26:23.720
The direction that that company eventually took was chemical rockets.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.600
Is there something you can comment on possible ideas?

26:26.600 --> 26:34.480
So first of all, you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.480
Yeah.

26:36.480 --> 26:46.160
You've probably heard of Project Orion, which Freeman Dyson and some of his collaborators

26:46.160 --> 26:53.640
had a scheme to power a large space vehicle by detonating atomic bombs behind it.

26:53.640 --> 26:58.720
And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time was George

26:58.720 --> 27:01.320
Dyson, the son of Freeman.

27:01.320 --> 27:08.200
And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old film that they'd shot on

27:08.200 --> 27:16.400
a beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by lumps of C4.

27:16.400 --> 27:21.800
So that was an idea, but for a private company, obtaining a large number of atomic bombs was

27:21.800 --> 27:23.400
probably out of scope.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.320
So it was more of a theoretical thing.

27:27.320 --> 27:38.400
There's a conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur

27:38.400 --> 27:44.600
Kantrowitz and some others, where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle

27:44.600 --> 27:47.480
that has a block of ice on the back.

27:47.480 --> 27:55.600
And the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.360
Plasma is opaque because it conducts.

27:58.360 --> 28:04.600
And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the laser pulse and gets really

28:04.600 --> 28:10.020
hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice.

28:10.020 --> 28:14.120
And then you wait a moment for that to dissipate and then you do it again.

28:14.120 --> 28:19.120
So it would just kind of vibrate its way.

28:19.120 --> 28:23.340
Like it sounds really violent, but Freeman said that if you were wearing like rubber

28:23.420 --> 28:31.060
sold tennis shoes standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a mild vibration.

28:31.060 --> 28:35.420
So there your source of energy is on the ground and you're getting higher specific impulse

28:35.420 --> 28:39.500
than you could get by burning chemicals.

28:39.500 --> 28:47.740
Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr, that just

28:47.740 --> 28:54.180
would heat up a heat exchanger by converging, many converging solid state lasers from the

28:54.180 --> 28:55.500
ground.

28:55.500 --> 29:05.180
And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves to do that.

29:05.180 --> 29:08.100
We looked at tall towers.

29:08.100 --> 29:13.940
I spent a while looking kind of semi seriously at giant bullwhips.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.460
What's a bullwhip?

29:15.460 --> 29:19.620
Just a whip, just you have them here in Texas, right?

29:19.620 --> 29:21.980
Yeah, I understand.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.940
But how does that have to do with propulsion?

29:23.940 --> 29:29.580
If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object that can break the

29:29.580 --> 29:31.900
speed of sound.

29:31.900 --> 29:39.860
So it's unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years, people with no technology have been

29:39.860 --> 29:49.100
able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound, just through an architectural trick.

29:49.100 --> 29:58.940
Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium can do this.

29:58.940 --> 30:02.300
So that's the thing I still think about from time to time.

30:02.300 --> 30:10.980
You can use the same physics to make freestanding loops of chain or other flexible materials

30:10.980 --> 30:14.460
that just kind of stand up under their own physics.

30:14.460 --> 30:19.820
I mean, it's kind of awesome to imagine.

30:19.820 --> 30:28.060
So imagine using the same kind of physics of a whip, but have at the end of it, a spaceship.

30:29.020 --> 30:34.220
That would detach at the moment of maximum velocity.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.860
Why not?

30:36.860 --> 30:37.860
Why wouldn't that?

30:37.860 --> 30:43.220
So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question.

30:43.220 --> 30:52.540
It was more almost a symbolic way of saying, look, there's all kinds of physics we haven't

30:52.540 --> 30:55.180
explored yet.

30:55.180 --> 31:01.500
It's no more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets.

31:01.500 --> 31:08.100
It's just that more money's gone into chemical rockets.

31:08.100 --> 31:14.440
Can I ask you a question on propulsion that's a little bit more out there?

31:14.440 --> 31:21.820
So I don't know if you've seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about

31:21.820 --> 31:26.620
UFOs like the Tic Tac aircraft.

31:26.620 --> 31:32.700
I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it, but I haven't gone deep into it.

31:32.700 --> 31:42.380
So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots and there's a lot of reports about objects

31:42.380 --> 31:49.460
that moved in ways they haven't seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics.

31:49.460 --> 31:52.620
If we consider the aircraft that we have today.

31:52.620 --> 32:02.400
So the reason I asked you that is because it kind of, to me, whatever the heck it is,

32:02.400 --> 32:08.020
it's inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion.

32:08.020 --> 32:14.980
If it's like secret projects from foreign nations or it's physical phenomena that we

32:14.980 --> 32:18.420
don't yet understand like ball lightning, all those kinds of things.

32:18.420 --> 32:25.700
Or if it is aliens or objects from an alien civilization, I most likely believe if it's

32:25.700 --> 32:31.180
an object from an alien civilization, it's got to be like a really dumb drone that just

32:31.180 --> 32:32.180
like got lost.

32:32.180 --> 32:37.060
It's definitely not like the pinnacle of intelligence.

32:37.060 --> 32:44.700
It's like some like teenagers like science fair experiment just flew for a few centuries

32:44.700 --> 32:51.180
out and just landed and then we humans are all like really excited about this.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.180
This wild thing.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.900
I mean, what do you think about those?

32:54.900 --> 32:57.380
First of all, like the millions of reports of UFOs, right?

32:57.380 --> 33:03.500
There's some psychology there that's deeply cultural, but also the possibility of aliens

33:03.500 --> 33:05.020
having visited earth.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.020
Yeah.

33:06.020 --> 33:11.140
I mean, I'd like to see some better pictures for the reason I mentioned earlier having

33:11.140 --> 33:15.900
to do with the difficulty of traveling between star systems.

33:15.900 --> 33:19.500
It's really hard for me to believe it's aliens.

33:19.500 --> 33:25.620
I just can't understand why you would go to all that trouble to transport something across

33:25.620 --> 33:32.420
light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.060
Like how is that interesting?

33:34.060 --> 33:36.780
How does that justify the trip?

33:36.780 --> 33:45.540
Especially if you travel across those kinds of distances, you'd make a bigger splash.

33:45.540 --> 33:51.380
First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be something we'd notice.

33:51.380 --> 33:58.540
It's got to decelerate into our solar system by, unless it got here really, really, really

33:58.540 --> 33:59.540
slowly.

33:59.540 --> 34:04.220
So I guess that's a possibility and just kind of snuck in.

34:04.380 --> 34:08.060
So at the end we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy.

34:08.060 --> 34:09.100
You would think.

34:09.100 --> 34:17.300
So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad, it makes more sense

34:17.300 --> 34:23.820
in that it would explain why if these things are alien technologies, they're just kind

34:23.820 --> 34:32.300
of hanging around our aircraft carriers for no particular reason, not trying to communicate.

34:32.300 --> 34:39.420
Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth or are visiting Earth and we

34:39.420 --> 34:41.460
wouldn't notice it at all?

34:41.460 --> 34:42.460
Oh sure.

34:42.460 --> 34:48.340
I mean if they've got technology to get here, they've probably got technology to conceal

34:48.340 --> 34:49.340
the fact that they're here.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.900
Oh they're trying to conceal themselves.

34:50.900 --> 34:55.460
I meant more like they're not trying to conceal themselves, but we're just, our cognitive

34:55.460 --> 35:00.940
capabilities are too limited and we are not thinking big enough.

35:00.940 --> 35:05.500
We're looking for little green men, we're looking for things that operate at a time

35:05.500 --> 35:06.500
scale that's human-like.

35:06.500 --> 35:13.260
Yeah, no, I love thinking about ideas like that.

35:13.260 --> 35:20.100
That's great science fiction novel fodder, that the aliens are so different that we simply

35:20.100 --> 35:22.140
don't see them.

35:22.140 --> 35:29.500
I mean is there, in terms of language, do you think it would be difficult, not aliens

35:29.500 --> 35:34.140
visiting us but traveling to other places to find a common language?

35:34.140 --> 35:41.780
You've written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations.

35:41.780 --> 35:47.460
How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans in terms of

35:47.460 --> 35:50.100
language so we're not lost in translation?

35:50.100 --> 35:54.480
Yeah, I mean there's different takes on that depending on how biologically similar they

35:54.480 --> 35:56.220
are to us.

35:56.940 --> 36:05.700
There's a school of thought that says basically advanced life has to be carbon-based for

36:05.700 --> 36:07.540
just reasons of chemistry.

36:07.540 --> 36:14.420
So right away if you impose that limitation then you're kind of assuming something that's

36:14.420 --> 36:17.640
starting to be biologically similar to us.

36:17.640 --> 36:25.620
So if they're about as big as we are and they kind of move around in space in a physical

36:25.620 --> 36:32.820
body the way we do, then there's probably a way to solve that communication problem.

36:32.820 --> 36:39.140
If they're like beings of pure energy from Star Trek or something like that, then it's

36:39.140 --> 36:40.140
a different story.

36:40.140 --> 36:44.620
Well, I love thinking about that kind of stuff too.

36:44.620 --> 36:55.100
Consciousness itself may be alien, it could be, like you said, beings of pure energy.

36:55.140 --> 37:01.220
I think of life as just complex systems and the kind of forms those complex systems can

37:01.220 --> 37:07.420
take seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we see here on Earth.

37:07.420 --> 37:11.460
I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.460
Are you ready?

37:12.460 --> 37:13.460
This is for Twitter.

37:13.460 --> 37:14.460
I'm ready.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.700
What would you expect from Twitter?

37:15.700 --> 37:18.180
Can humans have sex with aliens?

37:18.180 --> 37:20.780
Niel Stielsen.

37:20.780 --> 37:24.540
You could pass.

37:24.540 --> 37:28.700
I asked the language question, can they communicate?

37:28.700 --> 37:30.940
Can they fall in love before sex?

37:30.940 --> 37:33.620
That's how it works.

37:33.620 --> 37:38.140
So which question am I answering, the sex or the love?

37:38.140 --> 37:45.180
I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligent species.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.180
Yeah.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.940
I mean, sex can mean a lot of things.

37:49.940 --> 37:50.940
So I mean-

37:50.940 --> 37:53.220
Reproduction, right?

37:53.220 --> 38:02.660
You know, in Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to really suspend your disbelief to

38:02.660 --> 38:07.940
think that Spock was half Vulcan and half human, right?

38:07.940 --> 38:14.380
Because that's just not going to work DNA-wise.

38:14.380 --> 38:26.820
So if by sex you mean reproductive sex, then I would say no, unless you go to a panspermia

38:26.820 --> 38:37.180
kind of theory, which is that humans were seeded onto the planet as part of a galactic

38:37.180 --> 38:40.100
program of some sort.

38:40.100 --> 38:44.300
And then we're just returning home, hanging out with our old relatives.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.580
Yeah, yeah.

38:47.580 --> 38:52.260
But that doesn't seem plausible.

38:52.260 --> 39:00.600
We know that humans had sex with Neanderthals, with Denisovans, so you could think of them

39:00.600 --> 39:06.820
as aliens that came from our planet.

39:06.820 --> 39:11.780
So that's a kind of data point, I guess.

39:12.260 --> 39:20.540
But if you broaden your definition of sex to mean any kind of gratifying physical interaction,

39:20.540 --> 39:21.540
then sure.

39:21.540 --> 39:22.540
Right.

39:22.540 --> 39:23.540
Dancing.

39:23.540 --> 39:28.500
And that's how we get to love, and love can take many forms.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.260
Love can certainly take many forms.

39:30.260 --> 39:36.260
I have to ask you in terms of space, just looking at where Blue Origin is, looking at

39:36.260 --> 39:43.780
where SpaceX is today, and maybe looking out 10, 20 years out from now, are you impressed

39:43.780 --> 39:44.780
with what's happening?

39:44.780 --> 39:47.580
We just saw William Shatner go up to space.

39:47.580 --> 39:51.900
Yeah, I was just watching his video this morning before I came here.

39:51.900 --> 39:54.860
Are you impressed with where things stand today?

39:54.860 --> 39:55.860
Yeah.

39:55.860 --> 40:03.660
I mean, SpaceX in particular has done things that are just unbelievable.

40:03.660 --> 40:12.100
And I don't think anyone was anticipating 20 years ago, let's say, when this all started,

40:12.100 --> 40:19.260
just the speed with which they'd be able to rack up these incredible achievements.

40:19.260 --> 40:26.520
If you've kind of even seen a little bit of how the sausage is made and so the difficulty

40:27.520 --> 40:36.840
any kind of space travel, what they've achieved is just unbelievable.

40:36.840 --> 40:44.640
What about maybe a question about Elon Musk, even more than Jeff Bezos, he has a very kind

40:44.640 --> 40:53.360
of ambitious vision of this project that we're on as a species, of becoming a multi-planetary

40:53.360 --> 41:01.240
species and becoming that quickly, as soon as possible, landing on Mars, colonizing Mars.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.080
What do you think of that project?

41:03.080 --> 41:04.080
There's two questions to ask.

41:04.080 --> 41:09.040
First, the question is, what do you think about the project of colonizing Mars?

41:09.040 --> 41:19.320
And second, what do you think about a human being who is so unapologetically ambitious

41:19.440 --> 41:23.400
at achieving the impossible, at what a lot of people would say is impossible?

41:23.400 --> 41:34.400
I think that colonizing Mars is the kind of goal that's easily stated, it's catchy, it's

41:34.400 --> 41:41.040
the kind of thing that can inspire people to get involved in a way that some other programs

41:41.040 --> 41:42.840
might not.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.480
So I think it's well chosen in that way.

41:45.720 --> 41:54.280
I have technical questions about, there's a problem of perchlorates on the surface of

41:54.280 --> 41:58.040
Mars that's going to be big trouble.

41:58.040 --> 42:04.080
And there's radiation, so this is known.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.400
What about business questions?

42:05.400 --> 42:12.160
Do you think, because you mentioned sort of going outside of the solar system would best

42:12.200 --> 42:15.600
be done for religious reasons.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.800
What about colonizing Mars?

42:17.800 --> 42:20.440
Can you spin it into a business proposition?

42:20.440 --> 42:27.640
It's hard to think of a resource that's on Mars that could be brought back here cheaply

42:27.640 --> 42:37.000
enough to compete with stuff we could just dig out of the ground here or grow here.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.440
So I don't know if there is a business plan for that or if it's just strictly we're going

42:42.440 --> 42:49.120
to go there and see what happens.

42:49.120 --> 42:55.800
Maybe again, we need communism to get us going, to give us a reason, a little bit of the competition.

42:55.800 --> 43:02.000
Well, there's plenty of people who are sufficiently excited by the colonized Mars vision that

43:02.000 --> 43:10.640
they're willing to just go all in on it, even if there is not a business plan behind it.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.240
So I think it's well chosen.

43:13.240 --> 43:23.600
It's just I think it's probably the only approach to take.

43:24.520 --> 43:33.360
When white people came to this continent and started colonizing it, there was not a lot

43:33.360 --> 43:35.600
of coherent planning.

43:35.600 --> 43:40.840
What plans they did have turned out to be terrible plans.

43:40.840 --> 43:47.600
Trying to come up with plans that extend decades into the future is a waste of time.

43:48.080 --> 43:58.120
To do it for the kind of like unexplainable love of the unknown, like the journey towards

43:58.120 --> 44:02.200
exploring the unknown and just kind of keep going.

44:02.200 --> 44:14.160
Well, you saw it with Shatner and his reaction to the flight yesterday.

44:14.160 --> 44:20.040
For him, that trip was more than worth it just for these intangible reasons.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.040
What did he say?

44:21.040 --> 44:22.160
I haven't watched the video yet.

44:22.160 --> 44:28.700
He was trying to express, talking a lot about the moment where suddenly you kind of rise

44:28.700 --> 44:38.400
above the thin blue blanket of the atmosphere and you're up into the blackness.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.040
That had a huge impact on him.

44:41.040 --> 44:45.840
So he was kind of, I wouldn't say groping for words because he was pretty eloquent,

44:45.840 --> 44:52.960
but he was trying to express his feelings about that in a way that is pretty gripping

44:52.960 --> 44:55.960
to watch.

44:55.960 --> 45:00.600
So you've worked on this kind of stuff, we can go back to 10 years ago.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.960
You wrote an essay called Innovation Starvation.

45:04.440 --> 45:13.280
You worked on this kind of idea since then, kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically

45:13.280 --> 45:19.960
about our age today and our unwillingness to take on big risky projects.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.480
So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk?

45:23.480 --> 45:31.600
Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind

45:31.600 --> 45:36.280
of pessimistic perspective of our age.

45:36.280 --> 45:45.920
Yeah, well, he's clearly willing to tackle big ambitious projects without a lot of kind

45:45.920 --> 45:53.000
of soul searching or trying to make up his mind, right?

45:53.000 --> 46:00.760
It's like, let's dig tunnels under cities, go.

46:00.760 --> 46:04.400
Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter, step two, actually do it.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
Yeah.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
Yeah.

46:06.400 --> 46:17.400
And I mean, things have slowed down quite, our ability to build things at pace is a lot

46:17.400 --> 46:18.440
less than it was.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.320
And there's reasons for that.

46:20.320 --> 46:26.760
We're more concerned with safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building

46:26.760 --> 46:32.560
some of the great public's works projects of the mid 20th century.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.560
But even we're at the point now where even just maintaining the stuff that we've got

46:36.560 --> 46:43.800
is such a huge project that we need to put big resources into it and good minds into

46:43.800 --> 46:52.360
it or else we're going to be losing things that we take for granted.

46:52.360 --> 46:56.160
Do you think that there's a lot to be done in the digital space?

46:56.840 --> 47:02.320
You mentioned sort of Wikipedia and knowledge, don't you think there could be a lot of flourishing

47:02.320 --> 47:06.680
in the space of innovation in terms of innovation in the digital space?

47:06.680 --> 47:07.680
Yeah.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.840
I mean, I'd like to see that.

47:08.840 --> 47:16.880
I think it's where a lot of the brain power went during the last couple of generations

47:16.880 --> 47:23.160
because people who might previously have been building rockets or other kinds of sort of

47:23.160 --> 47:29.640
hard technologies ended up instead going into programming computer science, which

47:29.640 --> 47:33.640
is understandable and great.

47:33.640 --> 47:38.600
We've got structural problems right now in the way social media works that are pretty

47:38.600 --> 47:39.600
severe.

47:39.600 --> 47:46.240
And so I certainly hope that we're not 10 years from now that we're not exactly where

47:46.240 --> 47:49.760
we are today when it comes to that stuff.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.800
We need to move on.

47:51.800 --> 47:59.200
The beautiful thing about problems is they show you how not to do things and they give

47:59.200 --> 48:07.640
opportunity to new ideas to flourish and to beat out the ideas of the old, which is a

48:07.640 --> 48:15.720
dream for me to see new social media that beats out the ways of the old.

48:15.720 --> 48:21.920
So I tend to, you perhaps agree that it's impossible to do social media well.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.920
Oh, not at all.

48:22.920 --> 48:28.160
I mean, I listened to your interview with Jaren a couple of weeks ago and I know Jaren

48:28.160 --> 48:31.520
and we've talked about this.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.800
He went hard on me.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.120
He basically says it's impossible.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.760
It is very nice.

48:36.760 --> 48:42.600
Well, the last time I kind of paid attention to Jaren's thoughts on it, he was thinking

48:42.680 --> 48:50.320
in terms of that basically there should be, you know, micro payments such that if I, by

48:50.320 --> 48:59.680
clicking the like button on something, I'm essentially giving valuable intellectual property

48:59.680 --> 49:03.160
to Facebook or Twitter or whatever.

49:03.160 --> 49:08.920
It's not a very large amount of IP, but it's definitely a transfer of information that

49:08.920 --> 49:12.000
when they aggregate it is beneficial to them.

49:12.000 --> 49:20.800
So and now I do remember that he on his interview with you was talking about what data unions

49:20.800 --> 49:24.040
or yeah, those are a lot of interesting ideas.

49:24.040 --> 49:30.840
But for me, the biggest disagreement was in the level of cynicism.

49:30.840 --> 49:36.760
He has a distrust and cynicism towards people in Silicon Valley being able to do these kinds

49:36.760 --> 49:38.120
of things.

49:38.160 --> 49:43.960
And I'm really, okay, when you have a large crowd of people that are doing things the

49:43.960 --> 49:50.840
wrong way, you should nevertheless maintain optimism because what's important is to find

49:50.840 --> 49:54.080
the one person in that room that's going to do things the right way.

49:54.080 --> 49:57.760
Cynicism is going to completely silence out the whole room.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.320
So he was saying, I've been here a long time.

50:01.320 --> 50:06.080
I've known, you know, I just like how these folks work.

50:06.080 --> 50:13.360
They think they're gods and they know the right way to do things and they will tell

50:13.360 --> 50:15.360
you how to do those things.

50:15.360 --> 50:20.480
And that kind of hubris is going to always lead you astray when you are the one who's

50:20.480 --> 50:22.800
engineering the algorithms.

50:22.800 --> 50:29.480
And there's a lot of deep truth to that because algorithms are powerful and many people when

50:29.480 --> 50:32.880
given power do not do the best of things.

50:32.880 --> 50:38.640
I mean, most, what is it, the old Lincoln line, if you want to test the man's character,

50:38.640 --> 50:39.640
give him power.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.640
Yeah.

50:40.640 --> 50:41.640
Yes.

50:41.640 --> 50:45.800
But that doesn't mean that some people are not able to handle the power and that some

50:45.800 --> 50:50.960
people are not able to come up with good ideas that create better social media.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
Yeah.

50:51.960 --> 50:57.280
I didn't interpret Jaren's statements as being entirely cynical and hopeless.

50:58.120 --> 51:05.080
He's definitely raising, you know, issues of concern, but he wouldn't be out, you know,

51:05.080 --> 51:08.480
writing the books that he's written and talking about this stuff if he didn't think there

51:08.480 --> 51:09.480
was a way.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.520
If he didn't think there was hope, yeah.

51:11.520 --> 51:15.440
And part of it, as you probably know with Jaren, he just loves a good argument.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.440
Yeah.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.040
He just loves to have a little bit of fun.

51:19.600 --> 51:27.760
Well, I have to ask you about, I mean, we talked about taking all big, bold, risky ideas.

51:27.760 --> 51:33.080
So in your new book, Termination Shock, it's set here in Texas.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.080
Part of it is, yeah.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.080
Yeah.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.080
Most of it.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.080
Yeah.

51:37.080 --> 51:38.080
It's a great place to set it.

51:38.080 --> 51:43.240
So in it, the main character, TR, McCooligan, a Texas billionaire, oil man and truck stop

51:43.240 --> 51:48.440
Magnate decides to solve climate change, to take on climate change by himself.

51:48.440 --> 51:54.560
So this is an interesting philosophical exploration of how to solve climate change from a perspective

51:54.560 --> 51:57.720
that's perhaps different than we've been thinking about.

51:57.720 --> 52:04.920
I wouldn't use the word solve, but let's say ameliorate the temporary effects.

52:04.920 --> 52:05.920
But please.

52:05.920 --> 52:06.920
Take on.

52:06.920 --> 52:07.920
Yeah.

52:07.920 --> 52:08.920
Take on the challenge.

52:08.920 --> 52:15.400
It's very interesting, but there's a gradual nature to this process.

52:15.400 --> 52:28.360
And I mean, just like in your book, the power of innovation is something that has saved

52:28.360 --> 52:30.900
us quite a few times in history.

52:30.900 --> 52:34.800
So what role does that play in this gradual process?

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
Right.

52:35.800 --> 52:43.880
Ultimately, we don't solve the problem until we get the CO2 out of the atmosphere.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.920
But that is going to take a while.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.080
We're still adding more.

52:49.080 --> 52:52.480
We haven't even started to reduce the amount.

52:52.480 --> 53:00.560
So there's two possibilities inside to introduce the amount that we're putting in the atmosphere.

53:00.560 --> 53:03.700
And two is removing what we got in the atmosphere.

53:03.700 --> 53:04.700
We have to do both.

53:04.700 --> 53:05.700
Right.

53:05.700 --> 53:11.000
So those are two different kind of efforts in terms of what's involved.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.600
Because it stays up there.

53:12.600 --> 53:18.940
So I think just last week, China announced that they're going to try to level off their

53:18.940 --> 53:23.380
CO2 emissions in 2030.

53:23.380 --> 53:30.460
So 2031, they'll only put as much CO2 into the atmosphere as they did in 2030, which

53:30.460 --> 53:33.460
is still a lot of CO2.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.820
In 2060, they're saying we'll be net zero.

53:36.820 --> 53:42.800
So if everyone in the world does that, and the PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere by then is

53:42.800 --> 53:51.880
say 450 parts per million, it'll stay at 450 parts per million until we take it out.

53:51.880 --> 53:57.000
And taking it out is hard.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.320
We took us a long time.

53:58.320 --> 54:04.260
We had to empty out huge coal mines and oil reservoirs and burn all that stuff.

54:04.260 --> 54:11.380
We had to chop down forests and dig up peat bogs in order to create all of that CO2.

54:11.380 --> 54:19.660
And so we have to reverse all of those processes somehow in order to remove the CO2 and get

54:19.660 --> 54:26.420
it back down, hopefully into the 200 and some parts per million range where it used to be.

54:26.420 --> 54:32.320
So how about you get a single Texas billionaire to have a massive gun that blasts huge quantities

54:32.320 --> 54:35.640
of sulfur into the upper atmosphere?

54:35.640 --> 54:38.320
That's idea number one.

54:38.320 --> 54:44.700
This is called solar geoengineering, and we know that it's a possibility on a technical

54:44.700 --> 54:49.060
level because volcanoes have been doing it forever.

54:49.060 --> 54:55.240
So many times in human history, we've seen a volcanic eruption that was followed by a

54:55.240 --> 54:59.100
global cooling trend that lasted for a couple of years.

54:59.100 --> 55:06.340
And one of these things happened, I think in the 60s or 70s in Indonesia, and the Australian

55:06.340 --> 55:11.740
sent a plane up into the stratosphere to take some samples of the plume.

55:11.740 --> 55:17.660
And when it came back down, the windscreen of the plane had sort of a deposit on it.

55:17.660 --> 55:26.240
So one of the Australian scientists licked it and reported that it was painfully acid.

55:26.240 --> 55:31.920
So that was our first kind of clue that what was being injected into the stratosphere was

55:31.920 --> 55:37.240
sulfur dioxide.

55:37.240 --> 55:43.120
And so we know, then Pinatubo came along in the 90s and did this experiment for us.

55:43.120 --> 55:50.540
So we know that sulfur in the stratosphere, it forms little spherical droplets of sulfuric

55:50.540 --> 55:58.080
acid after it combines with water, and those bounce back some of the sun's rays and reduce

55:58.080 --> 56:05.920
the amount of solar energy entering the troposphere, which is where we live.

56:05.920 --> 56:10.780
So we know that it works, and we also know that this stuff goes away after a couple of

56:10.780 --> 56:12.340
years.

56:12.340 --> 56:17.860
So it gradually washes out, and so it's not a permanent thing.

56:17.860 --> 56:25.020
Good news, bad news is, good news is, it's not permanent, so if you don't like what's

56:25.020 --> 56:29.500
happening, you can just stop and wait a couple of years, and you'll get back to where you

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
started.

56:30.500 --> 56:35.020
And the bad news, if you're in favor of this kind of thing, is that you have to keep doing

56:35.020 --> 56:39.940
it forever.

56:39.940 --> 56:46.440
So this guy is one of those, he's read these papers, the TR, the character in the book,

56:46.440 --> 56:48.020
he knows all this.

56:48.020 --> 56:55.020
And all people who are familiar with climate science kind of know this, it's a pretty well

56:55.020 --> 56:57.080
established fact.

56:57.080 --> 57:05.760
And so he just decides he's going to take action unilaterally and do this.

57:05.800 --> 57:11.200
And so there's different ways to get the sulfur up there, but because it's Texas, he builds

57:11.200 --> 57:16.260
the biggest gun in the world, it's just six barrels pointed straight up, and he begins

57:16.260 --> 57:20.400
firing shells loaded with sulfur into the stratosphere.

57:20.400 --> 57:26.800
And so the book is about not so much that as how people react to his doing that, what

57:26.800 --> 57:33.360
the political ramifications are around the world, because this is an extremely controversial

57:34.000 --> 57:37.800
idea, and not everyone's on board with it.

57:37.800 --> 57:45.360
And even if you are willing to consider using a technological intervention, the fact is

57:45.360 --> 57:49.400
that it's going to have different effects on different parts of the world.

57:49.400 --> 57:59.040
So some areas may suffer more negatives than positives, and they're not going to be happy.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.800
So what do you think?

58:00.800 --> 58:10.960
So in his case, in T.R.'s case, he can get around getting permission from governments.

58:10.960 --> 58:19.320
If we were to look at us facing, outside of the story, us facing climate change, where

58:19.320 --> 58:21.040
do you think the solution will come from?

58:21.040 --> 58:29.000
Working together or from a bold billionaire Texans?

58:29.000 --> 58:38.440
I'm pretty sure that this kind of intervention is never going to emerge from Western democracies.

58:38.440 --> 58:42.960
This kind of, sorry, government coordinate, which option one?

58:42.960 --> 58:43.960
Solar geoengineering.

58:43.960 --> 58:44.960
Solar geoengineering.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
Yeah.

58:46.960 --> 58:53.560
I want to sort of the distinction, one is the idea, the technological idea you're talking

58:53.560 --> 59:00.680
about, but two is like who comes up with the idea and agrees on it, governments or individuals.

59:00.680 --> 59:01.680
Yeah.

59:01.680 --> 59:07.240
If this were to happen, I think it would be either an individual or more likely just some

59:07.240 --> 59:15.720
government somewhere that just decides it's in their interests to unilaterally do this.

59:16.200 --> 59:24.400
That's not me advocating it, it's just, it's so, it would be comparatively so cheap and

59:24.400 --> 59:32.480
easy to implement a solar geoengineering scheme that someone is probably going to do it once

59:32.480 --> 59:34.760
things get bad enough.

59:34.760 --> 59:40.040
But I don't think that governments will, or Western governments, just because they're

59:40.040 --> 59:45.560
not, well, we've seen what happened with vaccines, right?

59:45.560 --> 59:55.480
So getting people to take vaccinations or wear masks has turned out to be incredibly

59:55.480 --> 59:59.160
hard even though it might save those people's lives.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:08.440
See, I blame, that's not Western, I blame failure of leadership there, of leaders not

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:13.200
coming off as authentic, not being inspiring, uniting, all those kinds of things.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.480
I think that's possible.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:20.280
I think it's just that we've gotten, the leaders we have right now aren't the right people

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.160
because we've lived through kind of a long stretch of relatively comfortable times.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.120
And it feels like unfortunate if you just look at history, that hard times make great

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:40.200
leaders and easy times make like bureaucrats that are egotistical and greedy and not very

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.960
interesting and not very bold.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.560
Yeah, no, I think that's fair.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.880
So, you know, we may be entering one of those interesting times of hardship in the Chinese

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.920
curse sense, yeah.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:01:00.640
So I could be wrong, but I mean, there have been some efforts to explore solar geoengineering.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:08.800
There was a plan to send up some balloons, high altitude balloons to take some measurements

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:17.640
in Scandinavia that got squashed by objections from people who lived up there who were just

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.520
opposed to the whole program on principle.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.720
So we'll see a lot more of that and it's going to be a hard program to advocate for just

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:36.240
because I think people don't quite understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:44.600
and how far we are from even slowing down the rate that we're adding more to say nothing

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.240
of bringing that number down.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.640
We're a long way out from that.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.760
Do you see in terms of portfolio of solutions, us becoming a multi-planetary species as part

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:05.600
of that, as this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.320
a multi-planetary species and what percent should that be, you think?

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.520
You know, in an indirect way, maybe.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.960
I mean, you know what people will say, which is the same argument that has been leveled

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.640
against space exploration since the Apollo program, which is why don't we solve our problems

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.800
here on Earth before we spend money going into space.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.240
So I've never been a believer in that argument.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:42.920
I think there could be a sense in which the new perspective that could be obtained by

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.160
thinking about, like if we're thinking about terraforming Mars, changing its atmosphere,

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:56.680
making it more amenable to life and survival, you could see that maybe changing people's

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.800
opinions about terraforming the Earth.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.960
Yeah.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:12.560
There are some dangerous consequences to this particular idea of blasting software, of geoengineering.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.800
What do you make of sort of big bold ideas that are a double-edged sword?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:29.080
Are all ideas like this, all big ideas like this, they have the potential to have highly

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.200
beneficial consequences and a potential to have highly destructive consequences?

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.320
I wouldn't say all.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:41.480
I think, you know, going back to what we were talking about earlier, how technology developed

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:48.240
in the 50s and 60s, there was a period of time there when people maybe had unrealistic

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:57.400
ideas about new technology and weren't sufficiently attentive to the possible downsides.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:08.540
So we got, and there's a reason why, I mean, in the mid-20th century, we saw antibiotics,

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:18.320
we saw the polio vaccine, we saw just simple things like refrigerators in the home.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.780
My grandmother to her dying day called the refrigerator the ice box because when she

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.960
grew up, it was a box with ice in it.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.940
So you see all that change and it's largely for the benefit of people and so if somebody

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:39.600
comes along and says, hey, we're going to build nuclear reactors to make energy or here's

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:50.240
a new chemical called DDT that's going to kill mosquitoes, then it's easy to just buy

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.600
into that and not be alert to the possible downsides.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:02.560
Of course, we know that the way that those early reactors were built and the way that

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:13.200
the supply chain was built to create the fuel and deal with the waste was poorly thought

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:22.320
out and we're still dealing with the resulting problems at places like Hanford in the state

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.360
of Washington.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:30.240
And we know that DDT, although it did kill a lot of insects, also had terrible effects

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.000
on bird populations.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.480
So the kind of backlash that happened in the 70s that is still kind of going on is to sort

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:49.920
of assume that everything is a double-edged sword and always to look for, we have to absolutely

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:57.920
convince ourselves that the downside isn't going to come back and bite us before we can

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:09.040
adopt any new technology and I think the people are overly sensitized to that now.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:16.160
Yeah, it's funny, depending on the technology, people are a little bit too terrified of certain

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:24.720
technologies, like artificial intelligence is one, my sense is that the things that they're

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.080
afraid of aren't the things that are likely going to happen in terms of negative things.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:36.080
It's probably impossible to predict exactly the unintended negative consequences, but

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:42.960
what's also interesting is for AI as an example, people don't think enough about the positive

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.520
things.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.360
The same is true with social media.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.160
It's very popular now, for some reason, to talk about all the negative effects of social

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:50.880
media.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:57.920
We've immediately forgotten how incredible it is to connect across the world.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.240
There's a deep loneliness within all of us who long to connect and social media, at least

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.760
in part, enables that, even in its current state.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:15.200
And all the negative things we see with social media currently are also in part just revealing

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.560
the basics of human nature.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.920
It didn't make us worse, it's bringing it to the surface.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.960
And step one of solving a problem is bringing it to the surface.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:31.280
The fact that there's a division, the fact that we're easily angered and upset and all

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.440
of that, the witch hunts, all those kinds of things, that's human nature and it just

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.440
reveals that allowing us to now work on it, it's therapy.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:47.840
And so that's another example of a technology that's just, we're not considering the positive

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840
effects now and in the future enough of.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.160
I have to ask about, there's a million things I can ask you about, but virtual reality,

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.360
I got to ask you.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:05.120
You've thought about virtual reality, mixed reality, quite a bit.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.360
What are the interesting trajectories you see for the proliferation of virtual reality

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.800
or mixed reality in the next few years?

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.480
Yeah, so I was at Magic Leap for what, five years.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.120
With the best title of all time.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.160
Oh, thanks.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.840
Chief Futurist?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.400
Yeah.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:32.880
Yeah. And so I've had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:40.400
R&D. So we're trying to make content for AR, but because it's such a new medium,

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.400
it's more of an engineering R&D project almost than a creative project.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:59.280
So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into making an AR system that runs.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.800
So AR, an AR device, if it's really going to do AR, needs to be running SLAM in real time.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.200
And that alone is a big.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.400
So for people who don't know, first of all, virtual reality is creating almost fully

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.480
artificial world and putting you inside it.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:28.880
Augmented reality, AR, is taking the real world and putting stuff on top of that

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.720
real world. And when you say SLAM, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to sense,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:42.560
accurately detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct the 3D

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.240
structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it. And doing that in real time,

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.120
presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.400
perception system. Yeah, that's an engineering project.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.360
Right. Yeah, well said. And it's just one of the things that the system has to do.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.360
It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:24.560
looking at is. It's performing all those functions, and it's got to keep doing that without

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:35.440
burning up the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast. And that's just table stakes.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.680
It's just the basic functions of the operating system. And then any content that you want to add

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:49.360
has to sit on top of that. It's got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.600
it looks real and you don't get sick. So it's an amazing thing and a magically shipped device that

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:07.360
can do that in 2019. And they're about to ship the ML2, but I don't know any more about that

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:15.040
than anyone else because I don't work there anymore. Does it still to some degree boil down to

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.600
a killer app, a content question? Like you said, it's kind of a wide open space. Nobody

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:28.800
knows exactly what's going to be the compelling thing. So doesn't a super compelling experience

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.560
of some sort alleviate some of the need for engineering perfection?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Well, there's a base layer of engineering that you have to have no matter what. But you're

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.320
certainly right that people like in the early days of video games put up with kind of low frame

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:54.560
rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having so much fun playing Doom

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:05.360
or whatever. Even Tetris. Yeah. Yeah. So for sure that's true. And so I was

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:14.720
working on consumer facing content. There was a great team in Wellington, New Zealand that made

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:27.280
a game called Dr. Groydbrot's Invaders that realized the potential of AR gaming in a way

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:36.000
that I don't think anything else has before or since. And so that was definitely the strategy

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:47.360
until April 2020, which is when the company decided to pivot to commercial industrial

01:12:48.160 --> 01:13:00.080
applications instead. And I haven't seen their financial projections, but I assumed they had

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:09.360
good reasons for making that strategic decision. It just means that it's no longer necessarily

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:15.520
targeted at just end users who want to play a game or be entertained, but it's...

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:23.120
That to me from a sort of a dreamer futurist perspective is heartbreaking because I don't

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:33.440
know necessarily from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics where to me the

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:42.720
future of robotics is consumer facing. And a lot of great roboticists, Boston Dynamics and companies

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:50.320
like that are focused on sort of industrial applications for financial business reasons.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.520
Yeah. No, I can see the parallels for sure. We'll see. It was a fun project. We

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:07.520
worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats, which just populated your room with Baby Goats.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.280
That seems like a killer app right there.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:21.040
Well, we thought highly of the idea for sure. But because of the slam, the system knew, for example,

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.760
here's a table. Here's a little end table. We know the heights. We know how high our

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:36.400
animated Baby Goat can jump. And so our engineers had to build a system for converting the slam

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:47.280
primitives into game engine objects that the AIs and the game could navigate around.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.880
And that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how-to, a sample app,

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.520
than as a finished consumer facing.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:09.360
You mean the Baby Goat AI? Yeah. That seems to me like a world I could entertain myself for hours

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.760
just every day coming home to see Baby Goats.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.840
Yeah. I mean, it was an ambient kind of, it's not a thing that you would sit there and play like a

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.040
video.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:21.600
Just life.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.160
But now there's Baby Goats. I mean, what's the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life?

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.560
Exactly. It's kind of ambient. They're not really helping you do anything,

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560
but it's enriching your life.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.240
You can go and play fetch or something for a while if you want, but you don't have to.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:48.160
So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling in a fictional

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.680
universe. The hardware is worth a look. There's still a belief, I just saw it this morning,

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:03.360
looking at Twitter, that the Magic Leap never shipped anything. But they've been, since 2019,

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.800
you can go to their website and buy one of these devices anytime you want to spend the money.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.000
Yeah. And the new one is coming out I think in 2022, so in a few months.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.240
What do you think, looking out 50 years from now, what wins?

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.280
Virtual reality, augmented reality, or physical reality?

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.080
What wins?

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:40.320
Meaning like, what do people that have financial resources enjoy spending most of their time in?

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.840
Mm-hmm. I've always been a fan of AR, and it's kind of an easy answer because if you're

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.400
because if you're wearing an AR device and you put a bag over your head, it becomes a VR device.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:02.880
If you block out what's really there, then all you're seeing is a VR.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:11.280
But you are, with AR, constrained to kind of operate in something that's similar to

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.440
physical reality. With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:25.200
True, true. So there are still issues in those fantastical worlds with motion sickness,

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:34.480
right? So if your body is experiencing acceleration, your inner ear,

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.320
that differs from what your eye thinks it's seeing, then you'll get sick,

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.800
unless you're a very unusual person. So it doesn't mean you can't do it.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.760
It's a constraint that VR designers have to learn to work with.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:59.440
So do you think it's possible that in the future we are living mostly in a virtual reality world?

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.200
We become more and more detached from physical reality?

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.920
For entertainment, maybe, for certain applications, I'm personally more,

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.000
I mean, we have to make a distinction between what I would personally find interesting and

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.640
what might win in the market. So maybe some people, maybe lots of people would like to

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:32.160
spend a huge amount of time in VR. I'm personally more interested in enhancing the experience that

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:38.480
I have of the physical world because the physical world is pretty cool, right? There's a lot to be

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:45.680
said for moving around in the real world. Can I ask you for you personally to try to

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:54.880
play devil's advocate or to try to construct, to imagine a VR world where you and Neil Stephenson

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:04.240
want to stay? Not because the physical world all of a sudden became really bad for some reason,

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:11.200
like you're trying to escape it, but literally it's just more enriching. In the same way,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.920
there's a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical world.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.640
Double up on that glimmer for the virtual reality. Can you imagine such a world?

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.440
Well, I'll give maybe an example that's a bridge, which is that I like making things.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.520
So I like working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:46.160
So I've had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program. There's many to choose from.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:59.840
I use one called Fusion 360. I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and create the

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.400
things I want to create. It's not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time,

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:16.160
my whole field of view is occupied by this monitor that's showing me a window into a

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:23.120
three-dimensional space. I'm rotating things around. I'm imagining things. I'm making things.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:30.400
And so that is pretty close to being in virtual reality.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.440
Does that thing have to exist for you to experience true joy? Can you stay

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:41.200
in Fusion 360 the whole time? Do you have to 3D print it and touch it?

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:50.560
That's my game. That's what I'm up to. But it happens that if you're building a virtual

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:58.000
environment, if you're making a game level or creating a virtual set for a film or TV production,

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.480
the thing that you're designing in the program may never physically exist.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:12.640
In fact, it's preferable that it doesn't because the whole point of that is to make imaginary

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:20.160
things that you couldn't build otherwise. So I think lots of people spend a good chunk of

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:27.040
their working hours in something that's pretty close to VR. It's just that currently the output

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:34.400
device happens to be a rectangular object in front of them. You could replace that with a VR

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.560
headset and they'd be doing the same stuff. There's all kinds of interfaces. For example,

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.280
I enjoy listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Let's say actually podcasts because there's

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:51.600
an intimate human connection in a podcast. It's one way, but you get to learn about the person

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.400
you're listening to. And that's a real connection. And that's just audio. For a lot of people,

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:05.120
that's just audio. And for me, that's just audio as a fan of people. And you kind of a little bit

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.080
are friends with those people. Yeah. They're in your life. You're listening to them. Yeah.

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:21.680
They're as far away from real as it gets. There's not even a visual component. It's just audio,

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:30.160
but they're as real. If I was on a desert island, my imagination, this thing works pretty good

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:38.320
in terms of imagination. It creates a very beautiful world with just audio.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:47.520
Or even just reading books. Exactly. Reading books. Even more so with reading books,

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.520
because there are certain mediums which stimulate the imagination more.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.040
When you present less, the imagination works more, and that can create really enriching

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:08.720
experiences. To me, the question is, can you do some of the amazing things that make life amazing

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:15.680
in virtual worlds? It seems to me the answer there is obviously yes. Even if I, like you,

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.920
am attached to a lot of stuff in the physical world, I think I can very readily imagine

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.720
coming up with some of the same magical experiences in the virtual world, where you

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.800
make friends and you can fall in love, where the source of love in your life

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:45.120
is to a much greater degree inside of a virtual world. And then love means fulfillment. That

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.840
means happiness. That's the thing you look forward to. And not some kind of dopamine rush type of

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:59.040
love, but long lasting friendship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just depends on what is there in the

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:04.640
way of applications, the content, and can it feed you those things? Can it give you,

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:12.240
like in my example of using the CAD program, it gives me the ability to do something I enjoy,

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:19.360
which is imagining things and making things in a particular way. Can we psychoanalyze you for a

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:27.520
second? Sure. What exactly do you enjoy? Is there some component of you building the thing where

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:34.560
you get to at least a little bit share with others? Like is there a human in the loop outside of you

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:42.640
in that picture? Will anyone ever see it? Right. There's a source of your enjoyment,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:49.600
because I would argue that perhaps when like the turtles all the way down, when you get to the

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:55.120
bottom turtle, it has to do with other sharing with other humans. And if you can then put those

01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:03.440
humans inside the VR world, then you start to, then you can, okay, for example, you could do it

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:10.400
in the physical world, the 3D printing, but you share it in the virtual world, and that's where

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:16.720
the source of happiness is. I think, at least speaking for myself, I'm always thinking in terms

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.800
of an audience. And at some level, I feel like I'm doing this for someone or communicating

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.760
to someone, even if there's not a specific someone in mind. It could just be an abstract,

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:37.360
theoretical someone. And it's like another app I spend a lot of time in is Mathematica,

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.040
okay? Yeah, incredible app. Yeah, yeah. And when I do a Mathematica notebook, if I'm trying to

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:50.720
figure something out, I spend a lot of time typing, just my stuff is just a huge blocks of text,

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:57.600
me thinking out loud, and then some graphs and calculations and stuff. Because to me,

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:06.720
that act of explaining things and commenting helps me understand what I'm doing.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:11.440
And there's kind of an audience, an amorphous audience in mind.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.920
Yeah, yeah. I mean, most of this stuff, nobody will ever see, and yet I'm creating it as if

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:25.120
there were an audience that might read this stuff. Because that's a necessary constraint.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:35.120
It helps me do a better job. This might be a tricky question to answer. What comes to mind

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.360
as a particularly beautiful thing that you're proud of that you create inside Mathematica,

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:45.760
visualization wise, or something that just comes to memory, if it's possible to retrieve?

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:56.640
So the thing I've spent the most amount of time on is I got obsessed a long time ago,

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:04.960
was trying to tile the globe with hexagons. Yes. An actual globe?

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:14.480
Well, any spherical object, yeah, but with an eye towards putting it on the earth. And have it be

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:22.080
recursive. So you can have hexagons within hexagons, which is hard, and probably a bad idea,

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:29.680
because you can't tile a hexagon with smaller hexagons. They stick out.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:37.840
Got it. Oh, they stick out. Can you do some kind of fractal hexagon situation?

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:48.080
Yeah. So it's that. And people who know me now make fun of me for this. So they'll send me,

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:55.280
if they see a picture with hexagons in it, they'll send me a link to make fun of me.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:03.680
One of those people, Roger Penrose? I think Roger's a little above my level.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:12.720
Or he's into hexagons as well, and tiling. Yeah, yeah. So I did a lot of that, and I thought

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:19.520
it was pretty cool. But there's some surprisingly intractable problems that keep coming up.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.160
You've always got to have some pentagons. If you start with an icosahedron, which is

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:36.400
equilateral triangles, which is a logical place to start, you can cover those with hexagons. But

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:45.600
every vertex where the triangles come together is a pentagon, has to be a pentagon.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.760
Interesting. So it's all hexagons, and then there's a pentagon at the intersections.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.280
Cool. How did you figure that out? Is that a known fact?

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.000
Well, it's just if you look at it just by installation.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.280
It's an obvious thing. Got it.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:05.280
Yeah. So you can't make that go away. So any system that you come up with to do this has got to have

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.360
exceptions built into it for those 12. You could have quintillions of hexagons,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:24.640
but you've still got to have 12 pentagons somewhere. So I've blown a hell of a lot of

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.280
time on that over the years. By the way, a lot of those kind of

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.640
problems are very difficult to prove something about.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:45.120
Yeah. I think Uber did it because one of my friends who knows of my interest in this and

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:54.480
who likes to give me a hard time sent me a link. This was a couple of years ago to some code base

01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:01.120
that I think came out of Uber where they had done this. You break down the whole surface of the

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:10.720
earth into little hexagons. So that was a real knife through the heart, but I'll probably come

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:17.920
back to it someday. Is there something special about hexagons? Are you interested in all kinds

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:27.680
of tiling? Well, I'm interested in all kinds of tiling, but I know my limitations as a math guy.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:35.600
So hexagons are about my speed. Just a sufficient amount of complexity.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:43.920
Yeah. But no, tiling is a really interesting problem, both two and three-dimensional tiling

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:52.080
problems are fascinating, and they're one of those ancient puzzles that has attracted

01:30:52.160 --> 01:31:00.400
brainiacs for centuries. Let me ask you a little bit about AI.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:10.720
What are some likely interesting trajectories for the proliferation of AI in society over the

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:16.880
next couple of decades? Do you think about this kind of stuff? I do not think about it a lot

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:23.920
because it's a deep topic and I don't consider myself super well-informed about it. AI seems to

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:31.040
be a term that is applied to a lot of different things. So I've messed around just a tiny little

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:39.280
bit with neural nets with what's it called, PCA, principal component analysis. So I guess I tend

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:49.440
to think in terms of granular bottom-up ideas rather than big picture top-down.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.800
Oh, got it. So very specific algorithms, how are they going to,

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.520
what problem are they going to solve in society such that it has a lot of big ripple effects?

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:05.680
See, I mean, we could talk about a particular successful AI systems

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:13.040
and success defined in different ways over recent years. So one is language models with GPT-3.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.760
Most importantly, they're self-supervised, meaning they don't require much supervision

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:26.400
from humans, which means they can learn by just reading a huge amount of content created by humans.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.560
So read the internet and from that be able to generate text and do all kinds of things like

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.040
that. It's possible they have a big enough neural network, it's going to be able to

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:42.240
have conversations with humans based on just reading human language. That's an interesting

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.920
idea. To me, the very interesting idea that people don't think about it as AI because they're kind of

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:57.280
dumb currently is actual embodied robots. So robotics, like Boston Dynamics, I have downstairs

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:07.440
and upstairs legged robots. The currently Boston Dynamics robots and most legged robots,

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:13.440
most robots period are pretty dumb. Most of the challenges have to do with the actual,

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.200
first of all, the engineering of making the thing work, getting a sensor suite that allows you to

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.720
do the same thing as with Magic Leap, that base layer of like-

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.840
Where is that stuff?

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:31.040
Where am I and what am I looking at? I don't need to deeply understand

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:40.400
my surroundings at a level beyond of what will hurt if I run into it.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.560
Yeah. But even that is hard.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:51.200
That's hard, but the thing that I think people don't in the robotics space explore enough is

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:59.600
the human-robot interaction part of the picture, which is how it makes humans feel,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.920
how robots make humans feel. And I think that's going to have a very significant impact

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:13.040
in the near future in society, which is the more you integrate AI systems of whatever form

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:21.440
into society where humans are in contact with them regularly. So that could be embodied robotics,

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.840
or that could be social media algorithms. I think that has a very significant impact.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:32.320
And people often think like AI needs to be super smart to have an impact. I think it needs to be

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.840
super integrated with society to have an impact. And more and more that's happening,

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.680
even if they're dumb.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:53.360
Yeah. A lot of my exposure to robots is that I'm associated with a combat robotics team,

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:58.000
and I've been to a few BattleBots competitions. And in a lot of ways,

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.960
that's pretty far from the kind of robotics you're talking about, because these robots are remote

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:14.240
controlled. They're not autonomous. And so they're pretty simple. But it's interesting to watch

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:21.280
people's emotional reactions to different robots. So there was one that was in the last year's

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:29.840
season, the 2020 season called Rusty, that was just put together out of spare parts,

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.920
and it looked kind of cute. And it became this huge crowd favorite, because you could see it was

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.560
made of salad bowls and random pieces of hardware that this guy had scavenged from his farm.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.560
And so immediately, people kind of fell in love with this one particular robot,

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:56.240
whereas other robots might be like the bad guy, if you think of professional wrestling,

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:04.000
the heel and the baby face. So people do, for reasons that are hard to understand,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.560
form these emotional reactions.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.760
So we form narratives in the same way we do when we meet human beings,

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:14.240
we tell stories about these objects. And they can be intelligent, and they can be biological,

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:21.520
they can be almost close to inanimate objects. And that to me is kind of fascinating. And

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.720
if robots choose to lean into that, it creates an interesting world.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.360
If they start using feedback loops to make themselves cuter.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.560
Not just cuter, but everything that humans do. Let's not speak harshly of robots,

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.520
humans do the same thing.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.680
No, I wasn't meaning it in a... But you're right, humans, based on feedback,

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.680
will change their appearance, their dress.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.440
I do this on Instagram all the time. How do I look cuter? That's the fundamental question

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.720
I ask myself every morning.

01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:01.600
So why wouldn't a robot want to? It's like, oh, wow, people really don't like the quad mount

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:09.200
machine gun on top of my turret. Maybe I should get rid of that and people would feel more at ease.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:18.560
Or lean into it. Be proud of it. You won't take my gun, whatever this saying is, from my

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:26.640
dead cold hands. Adding personality such that you can start to heal, you can start to weave

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:36.160
narratives. I think that's a fascinating place where there's this feedback loop, like you said,

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:44.160
where AI, especially when it's embodied, puts a mirror to ourselves.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.280
Just like other humans, our close friends, they kind of teach us about ourselves.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.960
We teach each other and through that process grow close. And to me, it's so fascinating

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.800
to expand the space of deep meaningful interactions beyond just humans.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:16.720
That's the opportunity I see with robots and with AI systems. And that's why I don't like...

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.440
My biggest problem with social media algorithms is the lack of transparency. It's not the existence

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:29.600
of the algorithms. Well, there's many things. One is the data. Data should be controlled by

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.840
people themselves. But also the lack of transparency in how the algorithms work.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.240
LW And change your perception of what's real in hidden ways.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:46.880
AC In hidden ways. You should be aware, just like when you take psychedelics,

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.120
you should be aware that you took the psychedelics. It shouldn't be a surprise.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:59.360
And second, you should become a student and a scholar and there should be research done.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:06.240
There should be open conversation about how your perception has changed. And then you become your

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:13.600
own guide in this world of altered perception because arguably none of it is real. You get to

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:22.880
choose the flavor of real. I mean, this is something you explore quite a bit. Do you

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:32.480
yourself think that there is a bottom to it or there is reality? There's a base layer of reality

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:40.960
that physics can explore and our human perception sort of layers stuff. Let's go to Plato.

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.240
Is there such a thing as truth? LW I lean towards the platonic view of things.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:56.880
So I believe that mathematical objects have a reality that it's not all made up by human minds.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:06.800
And I don't know where that reality comes from. I can't explain it, but I do think that mathematical

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:23.040
objects are discovered and not invented. I did some reading of Husserl when I was writing anathem.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:34.560
He's a 20th century phenomenologist and he's writing at the same time as

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:43.680
as scientists are starting to understand atoms and becoming aware that when we look at this table,

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:51.920
it's really just a slab of almost entirely vacuum. And there's a very sparse

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.840
arrangement of tiny, tiny little particles there occupying that space that interact

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:09.440
with each other in such a way that our brains perceive this object. So that's kind of the

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:20.960
beginnings of phenomenology. And his stuff is pretty hard to read. You really have to

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:29.360
take it in small bites and go a little bit at a time. But he's trying to come to grips with these.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.840
With these kinds of questions.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.240
How did you come to grips with it? Like why is this table feel solid?

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:44.400
Well, I mean, we're an evolved system that there's we have biological advantages in knowing

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.640
where solid objects are. So we've got this system in our head that

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.360
integrates our perceptions into this coherent view of things.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:03.760
One of the take-homes that I like from Husserl is the idea of intersubjectivity and the idea that

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:12.320
the fundamental requirement for us to stay sane is for us to share our perceptions

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:20.720
and have them ratified by other. They don't even have to be people, but that a prisoner

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:29.360
in solitary confinement might domesticate a mouse or even insects because they perceive

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:38.000
the same things that the prisoner perceives. And so convince him that he's not just hallucinating.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:46.640
Yeah. Establish a consensus. But see, that doesn't mean any of it is real. You just

01:42:46.640 --> 01:43:01.200
establish a consensus. It could be very distant from something that's real in engineering sense

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:10.000
of real. Like you could build it using physics. I think that a valuable application for an AI robot

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:20.720
would be just to do nothing except that. Consensus. It just sits there. And if you hear a door slam,

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.480
you might turn to see what it is. If the robot at the same time turns to look at the door slam,

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:35.520
it's ratifying your perception. But isn't that the basis of love is when the door slams,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:45.840
love is when the door slams, you both look. But for deeper things, you both hear the same music

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:55.040
and others don't. By love, I mean depth of human connection.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.960
You arrive at similar reactions without having to explicitly communicate it.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.400
But we could start with a robot that listens explicitly for the slam doors.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.200
Yeah. Or scary sounds.

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:25.600
I can think of an example of this is when I went to college, we'd be sitting at the cafeteria,

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.240
a bunch of people eating our dinner together that we had just met, let's say.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:42.000
You know, so a bunch of new people in your life. And someone might make a funny remark or a not so

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.680
funny remark or something would happen. And you might then at that moment make eye contact with

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:56.400
someone you didn't know at the other end of the table. And in that moment, you would realize

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:04.560
this person is reacting. This person heard what I heard. They're reacting the way I reacted.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.560
Nobody else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened. But random

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:17.120
stranger down there and I, we have this connection. And then you build on that. So then the next time

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:24.160
something happens, you automatically look at your new friend and they look back at you. And before

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:30.400
you know it, you're hanging out together. Because you've already established without

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.960
even talking to each other that you're on the same wavelength.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:42.160
Yeah. It's seemingly so simple, but so powerful. It's establishing that you're on the same wavelength

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.640
at some level. There's no reason why you and a toaster can't have that. I'm just saying.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.560
Uh huh.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.760
Does this smell burned to you?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.520
Exactly. I think it's burnt.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.840
If a toaster could just say that to you.

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.880
Yeah. Yeah.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:06.640
Cryptonomicon published in 1999, set in the late nineties and involves hackers who build

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:12.160
essentially cryptocurrency. Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:20.800
So I have to kind of ask, uh, from you looking at this layout of what's been happening in

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:29.120
cryptocurrency, uh, the evolution of this technology, how has it rolled out differently

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:36.240
than you could have imagined in two ways? One, the technology itself, and two, the human side

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:44.400
of things, the human stories of the hackers and the financial folks and the powerful and the

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.800
powerless, the human side of things.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:54.320
Yeah. Well, Cryptonomicon is pre Bitcoin. It's pre Satoshi. It's pre blockchain, as you point out.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:03.520
So, um, at that point, uh, I was kind of reacting to what I was seeing among people like the Bay

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.520
Area cipher punks in Berkeley. There was some, some, there was a branch here in Austin as well.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:20.320
Um, and a lot of their thinking was, so based on the idea that you would have to have a physical,

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:27.440
uh, region of the earth that was free of government interference, that you, you couldn't

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:36.080
achieve that freedom by purely mathematical means on the network. You actually had to have,

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:43.280
you know, a room somewhere with servers in it, um, that, uh, that a government couldn't come and,

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.960
and meddle with. And so a lot of ideation happened around that view of things that

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:54.800
there were efforts to figure out jurisdictions where this might work. There was a lot of interest

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:01.360
for a while in Anguilla, which is a Caribbean Island that had some unusual jurisdictional

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:08.480
properties. Um, there was sea land, sea land, which is a platform in the North sea. Um,

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.760
and so there was a lot of effort that went into finding these physical locations that,

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:23.680
that were deemed kind of safe. Um, and that all goes away with blockchain. It's no longer necessary.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:30.960
Um, and so that really changes the picture in a lot of ways because, um, uh, you no longer have,

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:37.920
I mean, from a novelist point of view, the old system was a lot more fun to work with because

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:43.520
it gives you a situation where hackers are wandering around in strange parts of the world,

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:49.040
you know, trying to set up server rooms. So that's a great storytelling thing.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.360
There's still a little bit of that, right? And in the modern world, but it's just,

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:57.360
there's several server rooms as opposed to one centralized one.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.960
Yeah. Yeah. And there's the, like the new wrinkle is the need to do a lot of computation

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:11.200
and to keep your, your, uh, your, your GPUs from melting down. So people building things in Iceland

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:17.760
or, or in shipping containers on the bottom of the ocean or whatever. Um, so, um,

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.520
but there's still governments evolved and there's, there's still from a novelist perspective,

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.560
interesting dynamics, what is big governments like, uh, China and more sort of renegade governments

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:35.040
from all over the world, trying to contend with this idea of what to do, uh, in terms of control

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:42.960
and power over these kinds of centers that do the mining of the cryptocurrency. Yeah. So we're in a

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:49.200
stage now that kind of goes beyond the initial, like there was the stuff I was describing in

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:57.040
cryptonomicon had a little bit of air about it, of the underpants gnomes, uh, in that, you know,

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:03.440
we're going to, we're going to build this system and then we'll make money somehow. Uh, but the,

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:12.720
the intermediate step was, was left out. Um, and that is, uh, uh, I, I think we're now

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.680
sort of into that phase of the thing where the, where Bitcoin, you know, blockchain exists,

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:26.240
people know how it works. Uh, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist, people are using them

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:32.960
and it's sort of like, okay, what now, you know, where does this all lead? Um, so, um,

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.840
do you have a sense of where it all leads? Like, is it, is it possible that the set of technology

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:48.240
kind of continues to have a transformational effects on not just sort of finance, but

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:54.400
who gets to have power in this world? So the decentralization of power,

01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:01.920
you know, big questions, right? So I guess there's a little bit of the cynic in me thinking that

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:08.480
as soon as it becomes important enough, the existing banks and people in power are going to

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:15.280
sort of control it. I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won't be a big change in the end. Um,

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:23.760
there's a, a utopian strain sometimes in, in the way people think about this that I'm not so sure

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:31.280
about. There, there's a, there is a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:40.480
that make it a little easier to, uh, pull along the utopian thread. Yeah. Because it's harder

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:46.160
for governments to control Bitcoin. I mean, they, they have much fewer options.

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.960
The, they can ban, they can make it illegal. It's, it's more difficult. Yeah. So technology

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.480
here is on the side of the powerless, the voiceless, which is a very interesting idea.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:04.320
Of course, yes, it does have a utopian feel to it, but we have been making progress throughout

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:09.520
human history. Yeah. Maybe this is what progress looks like. There will be the powerful and the

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:16.080
greedy and the bureaucrats that take advantage of it, skim off the top kind of thing. But maybe

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:22.160
this does give more power to people that haven't had power before in a good way, like distributing

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:32.000
power and enabling sort of more greater resistance to sort of dictatorships and authoritarian

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:40.080
regimes, that kind of thing. And also enabling all kinds of technologies built on top of it.

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:47.520
Ultimately, when you digitize money, you know, money is a kind of speech or it's a kind of like

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:55.920
mechanism of how humans interact. And if you make that digital, more and more of the world

01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:02.560
moves to the digital space and then you can have the, then you can finally fully live in

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:09.040
that virtual reality with the toaster. Yeah. Yeah. In a lot of ways, I think in that realm

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:14.080
of technology that the money per se is one of the less interesting things you can do with it. So I

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:20.160
think, you know, cryptographically enforceable contracts and organizations built on those,

01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.680
that seems to me like it's got more potential for change just because we do already have

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:35.600
money. And although it's an old system, it's been digitized to a large extent by,

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.160
you know, the stripes and the credit card companies of the world.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:47.280
And I also love the idea of like, connecting to smart contracts, connecting data,

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.880
sort of making it more formal, it's like Mathematica, more structured, the integration

01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:04.560
of data, of weather data, of all kinds of data about the stuff in the world, so they can make

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:11.600
contracts between people that is grounded in data. And that's actually getting closer to

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:19.360
something like truth, because then you can make agreements based on actual data versus kind of

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:26.560
perceptions of data. And if you can formalize, like distribute the power of who gets to tell

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:34.720
the story, that's an interesting kind of resistance. Again, the powerful in the space of narrative.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:41.120
Pete Yeah. David Brin has been saying for a while that the only way to settle arguments with,

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:48.640
you know, across the political divide is to make bets. So people can say, you know,

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:55.440
the election was stolen, or, you know, whatever controversial position they're taking.

01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:08.320
And they'll keep saying it until you wager real money on it. So maybe there's something there,

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:14.400
if you could kind of turn that into a, put a user interface on that.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:22.160
Pete Yeah, have a stake in your divisiveness, in your arguments.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.720
David Will Dogecoin take over the world?

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:34.560
Pete You know, I don't follow the different coins that much. So I hear about Dogecoin,

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.360
and I've kind of followed the story of it.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:46.800
David So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in contrast to like Bitcoin and Ethereum,

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:52.720
which are these serious implementations of cryptocurrency that seek to solve some of

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:59.120
the problems that we're talking about with smart contracts and resist the banks and all those

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:06.480
kinds of things, Dogecoin operates more in the space of memes and humor, while still doing some

01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:15.520
of the similar things. And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether memes,

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:27.280
whether humor, whether narrative will go a long way in the future. Like, much farther than some

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:35.600
kind of boring old grounded technologies, whether we'll be playing in the space of fun. Like once

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:42.560
we built a base of comfort and stability, and like a robust system where everyone has shelter,

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:51.520
everyone has food, and the basic needs covered, are we going to then operate in the space of fun?

01:56:53.120 --> 01:57:00.880
That's what I think about Dogecoin, because it seems like fun spreads faster than anything else.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.280
Fun of different kinds, and that could be bad fun, and that could be good fun.

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:05.840
Pete Yeah.

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.640
David And so it's a battle of good fun versus bad fun.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:14.160
It goes viral very, very quickly when you post something that people find fun.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.000
Pete Yeah. And that's what Dogecoin represents. So Bitcoin represents like financial,

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:28.320
like serious financial instruments, and then Dogecoin represents fun. And it's interesting

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:35.680
to watch the battle go on on the internet to see which wins. This is also like an open question to

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:44.640
me of what is the internet? Because fun seems to prevail on the internet. And is that a fundamental

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:50.640
property of the internet moving forward when you look 100 years out? Or is this a temporary thing

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.680
that was true at the birth of the internet and is just true for a couple of decades

01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.760
until it fades away and the adults take over and become serious again?

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.720
Pete Well, I think the adults took over initially, and then it was later on that

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:11.200
people started using it for fun, frivolous things like memes. And I think that's pretty

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:23.360
much unstoppable. Because even people who are very serious enjoy sending around a funny picture or

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:25.360
something that amuses them.

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:32.000
Jared Yeah, I personally think we spoke about World War II. I think memes will save the world

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:38.880
and prevent all future wars. You've been handwriting your work for the past 20 years

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:43.440
since writing the Baroque cycle. What are the pros and cons of handwriting versus typing?

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:48.960
Pete For me, I started it as an experiment when I started the Baroque cycle because

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:54.320
I had noticed that sometimes if I was stuck having a hard time getting started, if I just

01:58:54.320 --> 01:59:03.840
picked up a pen and started writing, it was easy to go. So, I just decided to keep with that.

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:07.680
If it got in my way, I didn't like it, I could always just go back to the word

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:14.560
processor and be fine. But that never happened. So, there's a certain security that comes from

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:21.360
knowing that it's ink on paper and there's no operating system crash or software failure that

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:36.800
can obliterate it. It's a slower output technique and so, a sentence or a paragraph spends a longer

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:43.600
time in the buffer up here before it gets committed to paper, whereas I can type really fast.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:50.080
And so, I can slam things out before I've really thought them through. So, I think the first draft

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:58.480
quality ends up being higher. And then editing, first draft of editing is just faster because

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:06.560
instead of trying to move the cursor around or whatever or hitting the backspace key, I can just

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.560
draw a line through a word or a sentence or just around a whole paragraph and exit out.

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:19.280
And in doing so, I very quickly created an edit but I've also left behind a record of what the

02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:26.800
text was prior to the edit. Of course, all the digital versions have those quote unquote features

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:34.480
but their experience is different. Is there a romance to just the physical,

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.040
the touch of the pen to the paper, doing what has been done for centuries?

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:50.240
I think there is. I think there is just the simplicity of it and not having any intermediary

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:56.160
technology beyond the pen and the paper is just very simple and clean.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:07.920
So, I've got a bunch of fountain pens. I started buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:18.960
because I thought I would be more conservative with it. But it's still a trivial expenditure

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:28.000
so it doesn't really alter my habits very much. So, all that said, once you do type stuff up,

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:33.280
you use Emacs. I use Emacs, obviously the superior editor.

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:33.680
Of course.

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:40.080
Let me just ask the ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around forever.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.760
Do you think in 100 years, we will still have Emacs and Vim?

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:52.880
Or like, pick a let's say 50, 100 years.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean, whenever you're doing anything in Linux,

02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:05.280
you're spending a lot of time editing little config files and scripts and stuff. And you need

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:13.040
to be able to pop in and out of editing those things. And it needs to work. Like even if the

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:21.040
windowing GUI is dead and all you've got is like a command line, to get out of that problem,

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:29.520
you might need to enter an editor and alter a file. So I think on that level, there will always

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:36.880
have to be sort of very simple. Well, Emacs isn't very simple, but you know what I mean.

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:42.400
There have to be basic editors that you can use from either the command line or a GUI

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:49.040
just for administering systems. Now, how widespread they'll be.

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:59.520
There's a certain amount of, what's the story of the, there's the American folk tale of the

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:08.160
hammer guy who drives the railroad spikes, John Henry, trying to keep up with the steam hammer.

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:13.920
And eventually the steam hammer wins because he can't drive the spikes fast enough.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:24.160
So there's a sense in which Microsoft, who knows how much they've invested in code,

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:35.520
Visual Studio or Apple with Xcode. So they've put huge amounts of money into enhancing their IDEs.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:46.000
And Emacs in theory can duplicate all of those features by, if you just have enough Linux hackers

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:57.600
writing Emacs list macros. But at some point, it's going to be hard to maintain that level of,

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.600
to keep up feature for feature.

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.600
The, the, the interesting thing about Emacs just is lasted a long time.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:12.080
Yeah. And I, I think you've, you talked about that. There's a certain, like there's certain fads,

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:21.440
certainly in the, in the software engineering space. And it's interesting to think about

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:28.720
technologies that sort of last for a very long time and just kind of being in the

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:36.160
what is it? How do they get by? It's like the, the, the cockroaches of software or the bacteria

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.960
software or something like this base thing that nobody, everybody's just became reliant on.

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.560
And they just outlast everything else and slowly, slowly adjust with the times with a little bit of

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:54.480
a delay, with a little bit of customization by individuals kind of that, but they're always

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.840
there in the shadows and they outlast everybody else. And I wonder if that's, that, that might be

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.800
the story for a lot of technologies, especially in the software space.

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:08.720
You know, shell scripts, you know, all that stuff. You, you, you can't run the modern world without

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:17.440
a bunch of shell scripts, you know, booting up machines and, and, and running things. So it's,

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.960
that is going to be a hard thing to, to replace.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.160
And then tech for typesetting that you use, you said?

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:31.200
For when I, when I want to print it out, yeah, I just have some simple macros that I use, but then

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:38.480
I have to, the publisher put their foot down and they, they want it in, in Word format now. So

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:46.080
years ago, I wrote some macros to convert. And this time, what did I do? Copy, paste?

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:54.480
No, I, I use sort of a regular expressions. So I was to do italics in, you know, you,

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:59.600
you put it in curly brackets and you do backslash IT and then you type what you want to type.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:04.000
And that's how you get italics in, to type what you want to type. And that's how you get italics

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:09.680
in tech. So you can create a regular expression that'll look for some text between curly brackets

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:26.000
preceded by backslash IT. And then instead convert that to italics and Word will do that.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.800
Word, if you go deep enough into its search and replace

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:35.040
UI. You can do regular expressions. Is just reg-eps.

02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:40.880
Yeah. It's funny that you did that. I mean, I'm sure there's tools that help you with that

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:48.720
kind of thing, but, but the task is sufficiently simple to where you can do a much better job than

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:53.840
anyone, anybody else's tool can. Yeah. So that's a fascinating process.

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:58.320
Works fine for me. Yeah. And it keeps you from messing around with formatting.

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:05.520
Yeah. Like, oh, what if I put this chapter heading, you know, in, you know, a sans-serif

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:14.800
font, you know, it's a, it's just classic wanking. And so those options are closed off in what I'm

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:20.080
doing. Is there advice you could say, what does it take to write a great story?

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:28.240
The power of, of good yarns, good narratives to pull people in is, is incredible. And I think

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:36.000
my sort of amateur theory is that it's an evolutionary development that if you're,

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:45.840
you know, a cave person sitting around a fire in the rift Valley a million years ago,

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:54.240
if you can tell the story of how you escaped from the hyenas

02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:02.480
or how uncle Bob, you know, didn't escape from the hyenas. And if the people listening to you

02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:09.520
can take that in and they can build that scenario in their heads, like a kind of virtual reality and

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:16.880
see what you're describing, then you've just conferred an incredibly important advantage

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:22.720
on the people who've heard that story. Yeah. Right. And so they know a bunch of stuff now

02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:30.160
about how to stay alive that they could not have learned in any other way. I mean,

02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:35.680
animals who don't have speech though, they might warn each other. It might make a sound that says

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:44.560
danger, danger. But, but as far as we know, they can't tell more complicated stories.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.520
So it's a part of us. Yeah. The, the, the collective intelligence seems to be one of the

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:58.160
key characteristics of the homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold ideas together

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:03.760
in our minds. And storytelling is the fundamental aspect of that. Maybe even language itself is more

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:11.120
fundamental because the language is required to do the storytelling or maybe they evolve together.

02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:16.240
Maybe they co-evolve. Yeah. So I think that you've got to work with that. And I think

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:26.560
that sometimes it seems like in kind of literary circles that having a lot of plot is a little bit

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:34.320
frowned upon as it's pulpy or it's exploitative. But for me, I don't have any compunctions

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:40.640
whatsoever about that. I like stories that are grabby and fun and exciting to read. And

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.560
once you've got one of those going, once you've got a good yarn going

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.200
that people will enjoy reading, then you're free to do whatever you want

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:56.000
in the frame of that story. But if you don't have that, then you got nothing.

02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:03.280
What about having like, which you do a technological scientific rigor, like to the

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:10.480
accuracy and as much as possible, how does that add to the, to, to Bob telling the story or telling

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:16.480
the story about Bob or on the campfire? Well, the main thing that it does is present

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.480
little details that you might not have come up with on your own. So if you're just sitting there

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:34.800
freely imagining things, your brain probably isn't going to serve up the wealth of details and the

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:42.160
resulting complications and surprises that real, that the real world is constantly presenting us

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:50.480
with. And so in my case, if I'm trying to write a story about, you know, some, that involves some

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:58.000
technology, like a rocket or orbital maneuvers or whatever, then delving into those details

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.480
eventually is going to turn up some weird unexpected, you know, thing that gives me

02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:12.320
material to work with, but also subliminally readers who see that are going to be drawn in more

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:18.960
because they're going to, to, to find that, Oh, I didn't see that coming. You know,

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.600
you know, it's got some of the complexity and surprise value of the real world.

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:31.280
Yeah, it does something. Alex Garland, director who did, who wrote, directed Ex Machina.

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.480
I think about AI movies and the more care you take in making it accurate,

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.680
the more compelling the story becomes somehow. I'm not, I'm not sure what that is.

02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:51.360
Maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.720
maybe it just makes you a better writer. The key to any storytelling is getting the,

02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:02.720
the readers to suspend their, their disbelief. And there's all kinds of triggers and little

02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.480
tells that can break that. Right. And once it's broken, it's really hard to get it back.

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.200
You know, a lot of times that's the end. Somebody will just close the book and not pick it up.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:19.200
I got to ask you, you've answered this question, but I got to ask you

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:27.840
the most impossible question for an author to answer, but which Neil Stevenson book should

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:34.400
one read first? So when people ask me that, I usually ask them what they like to read.

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:40.960
Right. Cause I mean, there's the best known one is probably snow crash, but that's a,

02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:49.200
a cyberpunk novel that's at the same time making fun of cyberpunk. So it's kind of got some layers

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:56.160
to it that might not seem so funny if you don't have that, if you don't get the joke. Right.

02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:04.320
So there's, I've written, as you point out, I've written historical novels. Some people like those,

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:10.640
some people prefer those. So if that's what you like, then Cryptonomicon or the Baroque cycle.

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:17.040
Is where you would start. If you like sort of techno thrillers that are set in a modern day

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:26.080
setting, but aren't science fictiony per se, then Reamedy is one of those and Termination Shock

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:35.120
is definitely one of those. So it just depends on, on what people like.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:41.280
Well, what, uh, when people a long time ago recommend that reads no crash, they said, uh,

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:51.280
it's, uh, it's Neil Stevenson light. It's, it's the, uh, like if you don't want to be overwhelmed by

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:57.040
the depth, like the rigor book, like that's a good, that's a good introduction to the man.

02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:03.760
Okay. So, so essentially you broke it down by topics, but if you wanted to read all of them,

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:09.920
what's a good introduction to the, to the man, because obviously these worlds are very different.

02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.240
Yeah. The philosophy is a very different. Yeah. What's a good introduction to the human?

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.440
Um, hmm. People ask the same thing with this, the ASCII people,

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:28.000
it's a, it's a hard one to answer. Maybe seven eaves because it's got big themes. Um, it's,

02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:34.800
you know, it's about heavy, heavy things happening to the human race. Um, uh, but

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.840
hopefully the story is told through a cast of characters that, uh, people can relate to,

02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:47.520
you know, and it moves along. Uh, so, uh, it, it does go kind of deep eventually on

02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:52.160
how rockets work and orbital mechanics and all that stuff, but, um,

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:56.640
people were able to get through it anyway, or some people just skip over that.

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:00.320
It's fine. You know, um,

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:07.840
as an author, let me ask you what books had a big impact on your life that you've read? Is there

02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:14.880
any that jumped to mind that you learned from as a writer, as a philosopher, as a mathematician,

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:20.000
as an engineer? This is one of these questions where I always blank out and then when I'm

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.400
walking out the door, I'll, I'll remember 12. So this is a random selection that doesn't

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:32.640
represent the top, the top ones. Um, well, I mentioned, you know, Gulag Archipelago, that's

02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:37.520
kind of a hefty and dark, but, and then it has a personal connection as well.

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:44.480
Yeah, just like where you found the book to the part, the time in your life, where you found it,

02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:48.640
who recommended it. That's also part of the story. Yeah. So there's definitely that there's,

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:56.800
you know, I circle back to Moby Dick a lot, um, because we read it in a, uh, a really great

02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:01.280
English class I had in high school. And I came in with an oppositional

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.920
stance because I thought that the teacher was going to try to talk me into having all kinds of

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:15.280
highfalutin ideas about allegory and what does this mean? What's the symbolism? And it turned out that,

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:23.840
it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying than that. Um, what was the first

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:31.840
powerful book you remember reading that like convinced you that this form could have depth?

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.800
Was it Moby Dick? Was it like in high school? I'm trying to remember,

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:42.800
well, Moby Dick was definitely a big one. Um, I mean, I used to read a lot of classics comics

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:50.720
when I was, I don't know if you've seen these, it's a whole series of comic books that, um,

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.640
it was viral. You could, uh, in the, in the back of each comic book was an order form.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:03.440
You could check some boxes and fill out your address and mail it in and more would show up.

02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.160
But it was like, they would do the count of Monte Cristo, you know, Moby Dick, you know,

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:17.040
Robert Louis Stevenson, Robinson Crusoe, you know, all this sort of classic books, uh, were,

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:23.760
they had put into comic book form. That's amazing. Yeah. Reading Moby Dick, if you're nine years old,

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:30.640
is a tall order. There's some very complicated sentences in there. Yeah. Um, and a lot of

02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:34.800
digressions, but if you're just looking at the comic book, it's like, holy shit, look at that

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:42.240
whale, you know, um, and, um, and ultimately the power of the story doesn't need the complicated

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:49.200
words. It's, it's, it's all about the man and the, and the whale. Yeah. Yeah. So you could get kind

02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.520
of a grounding in a lot of classic works of literature without actually reading them, which

02:17:53.520 --> 02:18:00.640
is, you know, it's great when you're nine years old. So, so I read a lot of that stuff, uh, for

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:09.280
sure. The annotated Sherlock Holmes. Um, you, you mentioned David Deutsch, too, as an inspiration

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:13.280
for some of your work. I mean, you've, you've obviously didn't like really a lot of research

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:20.320
for the books you do. Roger Penrose. What, uh, do you remember a book that made you want to become

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:28.960
a writer or a moment that made you become a writer? I think like the, you know, the answer I usually

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:36.640
give is that when I was in like fifth grade, one of my friends came to school one day, he was

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:44.720
wearing leather shoes, like dress shoes. And I hated dress shoes because mine never fit. And so

02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:52.080
they were uncomfortable. I couldn't run, you know, they were cold. It was Iowa. So I kind of said,

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:59.760
I remember very clearly thinking, okay, I don't like where this is going. Like, does this mean

02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:09.760
that next year all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes? So I need to find a job

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:16.960
where I don't have to do that. So that was like the first time I thought about trying to find such

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:23.200
a job, you know, being a writer. And then, and then I just read a lot of just classic science

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:29.680
fiction short stories and started trying to write some of my own. And they were just classic young

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:38.080
adult stories like by Heinlein and the other classic names that you think of, but the Heinlein

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:43.520
ones stuck, have stuck with me in a way that the others didn't. What's the greatest science

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:51.040
fiction book ever written? Just removing your work from consideration.

02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:55.920
I'm loving torturing you right now.

02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.760
Greatest ever non-stevenson. Do we include fantasy or does it have to be science fiction?

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:09.200
Oh, interesting. Fantasy. Hmm. I did not expect that twist.

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:13.360
Well, in a weird way, they're lumped together in people's minds, right?

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:20.080
They are, but there's also a boundary somehow. I'm not sure what that is exactly.

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:26.320
Nobody is. It's a mystery. So I mean, if we do include it, then it's easily the Lord of the

02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:39.120
Rings. But I mean, greatness is an interesting quality to try to define. And for me, a lot of

02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:45.600
the fun and the joy of such books is not in what you'd call greatness, but just storytelling.

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:53.760
So I was always a big fan of Have Space Suit Will Travel, which is a Heinlein young adult book.

02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:56.000
It's just a fun, good read.

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:02.160
So fun is a big component. Greatness is overrated.

02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:07.920
Well, I don't know if it's overrated, but it's just, you know, it might be under defined.

02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:14.960
Have Space Suit Will Travel. Now I definitely have to read that one. You mentioned Iowa.

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:21.600
I was there a couple of times. I got to spend quite a bit of time with Dan Gabel,

02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:30.800
with Tom Brands, who are wrestlers. Is it now wrestling, martial arts, part of your life,

02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:34.320
any part of your formation of who you are as a human being?

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:41.440
I think so. It was a late thing for me, but growing up in Ames,

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:50.720
Dan Gabel was a few years older than me. And so sometimes we would go to the arena at the

02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:57.920
university and watch wrestling meets. And this was before his Olympic career.

02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:05.200
So everyone knew he was the star of that team and that he was the best. But people didn't yet know

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:13.520
he was the greatest of all time. It's funny. It feels like a small world that you would

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:19.840
be in the same space as Dan Gabel. Well, from 100 feet away, a little dot on the mat

02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:27.520
frouncing his opponents, him and Chris Taylor. So the other star was this 400 pound plus guy

02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:37.440
named Chris Taylor, who also went to the Olympics. So yeah, he was an athletic hero.

02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:45.920
There are certain states like Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Iowa, where wrestling is the sport

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.680
because those are states of small towns. And so if you're a small town, if you're like Dan Gabel,

02:22:52.640 --> 02:23:00.720
and you have to be on a football team with 20 other guys who are not Dan Gabel, then no matter

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:10.800
how good you are, your team might suck. But in a solo thing, you can go to the Olympics.

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:16.240
So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes in school and I didn't like it.

02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:22.800
I think partly it's just that it was so competitive and the people who cared about it

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.240
really cared about it a lot. And so it was pretty tough. I didn't think I had the right

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:37.200
body type. But then after college, I was in Iowa City for a few years when he was coaching the

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:45.840
wrestling team there. And he won like nine championships out of 10 years during that.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:50.960
During that time. So he was both the greatest individual wrestler of all time and like the

02:23:50.960 --> 02:24:02.800
greatest team coach. So I've never met him, but he's kind of been like in my sphere of awareness

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:08.800
since I was kind of my whole life. And people would always tell stories about him. I think he

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:16.640
got arrested once for some kind of, I don't know, minor offense in Ames. And so he just basically

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:22.640
stayed up all night. He was in this cage in the jail. He just stayed up all night doing pull-ups.

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:24.240
Yeah. Sounds about right.

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.280
Yeah. So yeah.

02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:34.320
So has that been, I mean, Iowa is such an interesting place in the world.

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:36.720
And wrestling is just part of that story.

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:44.000
Is that somewhere in there? Does that resonate deeply with who you are?

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:49.280
It was a formative thing for me growing up there for sure. It's just a,

02:24:52.320 --> 02:25:00.960
or at least used to be a very orderly place, high social capital, very minimal class differences.

02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.160
So like you'd have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy,

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:15.440
but that was it. Those were the rich people, right? And a college town is always a different

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:26.720
environment. Like Austin has some of this. So it was a pretty kind of utopian, other than the

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:33.680
weather and a few other things, environment to grow up in. The martial art I ended up doing

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:40.560
is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different feedback loop. So if you're

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:50.160
grappling, everything is through sense of touch. And your sense of touch is very old and simple,

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:56.320
right? Like earthworms don't even have eyes, but they can tell when they're being touched,

02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:08.400
right? So it's very fast. And with a standoff art like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting,

02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:16.400
you're not touching the other person most of the time. Your visual system is doing something way

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:23.600
more, it's doing slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to. And so

02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:30.880
that always felt more my speed. So in an Olympic style fencing,

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:38.560
it doesn't start really until you're crossing blades with the other person. And now you're back

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:45.200
to wrestling. You're feeling what they're doing and it's all about that. But some of the older

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:52.080
sword arts don't engage the blade that way. You stand off at a range and then you make

02:26:52.560 --> 02:27:04.240
cutting attacks. And so those are all processed visually. And I think I'm more of a slow

02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:12.960
thinker. So it works for me better. I mean, it has the same artistry and the beauty of boxing,

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.560
I suppose, just like you said. It's like there's no contact and it's all processed visually.

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:24.720
And I'm sure there's a dance of its own. That depends on the characteristic of a sword involved.

02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:31.920
Yeah. There's a set of stances and basic reactions that you try to learn that are thought to be

02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:40.480
defensible and safe or safer. And so it tends to be a series of short engagements where you'll

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:49.040
you'll close in, you'll try out your idea and it works or it doesn't. And then you back off again.

02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.080
It's interesting to think about human history because martial arts,

02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:01.120
okay, that's a thing. But in terms of sword fighting, just the full

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:09.680
range of humans that existed who mastered sword fighting or sought the mastery of sword fighting,

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.080
just imagine the thousands of people who the heights they have achieved

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.520
because the stakes are so incredibly high to be good.

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:26.000
And it's the richest, most powerful people in those societies spending whatever it takes

02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:33.440
to get the best gear and the best training because you're right, everything depends on it.

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.320
And it's still life and death. I mean, that's fascinating.

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:46.400
That's fascinating. We perhaps have lost that forever with greater weapons. I mean,

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:53.040
the artistry of sword fighting when it's life and death and you go into war, you have the Miyamoto

02:28:53.040 --> 02:29:01.360
Masashi's of the world, right? I don't know. There's a poetry to that that there's a mastery

02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:04.800
to that that I don't know if we could achieve with any other kind of martial art.

02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:12.800
Well, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the good effects of the internet social

02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:20.160
media that we sometimes overlook. And one of those is that there were all these isolated people around

02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:27.120
the world who were interested in this, who found each other and kind of created a network of people

02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:32.720
who help each other learn these things. So that doesn't mean that anyone is up to the level of

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:44.640
that you're talking about yet, but it is happening. And so there's a large number of old treatises,

02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:51.120
old written documents that have been dug up from libraries and people have been going over these

02:29:51.120 --> 02:30:00.080
and translating them from old dialects of Italian and German to make sense of them and learning how

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:09.280
to do these techniques with different weapons. Actually, there's a guy here in Austin named

02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:18.320
Daman Stith who does African, historical African martial arts. Also martial arts of enslaved

02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:25.280
Africans who would learn machete fighting techniques in the Caribbean, South America.

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:29.120
He's probably within a mile of us. He's an amazing guy.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.320
That's awesome. I'm going to look him up.

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:38.240
Can I ask you for advice? Can you give advice for young people, high school, college,

02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:46.480
undergrads, thinking about their career, thinking about life, how to live a life they can be proud

02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:53.200
of? You think quite a bit about what it's required to be innovative in this world.

02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:56.080
You think quite a bit about the future. So if somebody wanted to be

02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:01.360
a person that makes a big impact from the future, what advice would you give them?

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:12.720
I think a big part of it is finding the thing that you will do happily and I don't want to say

02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:18.800
obsessively because that sounds like maybe it's pathological. But if you can find a thing that

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:25.360
you'll sit down, you'll start doing it and hours later you kind of snap out of it, where did the

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:36.080
time go? Then that's a really key discovery for anyone to make about themselves when they're young

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:43.600
because if you don't have that, it's hard to figure out where you should put your energies.

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:51.200
You might have the best intentions. You might say, I want world peace or whatever.

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:58.560
But at the end of the day, what really matters is how do you spend your time?

02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:07.840
And are you spending it in a way that's productive? Because it doesn't matter how

02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:12.800
smart you are or well-intentioned you are unless you've figured that out.

02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:19.040
So finding that thing in which you can sort of naturally lose yourself in. The thing is,

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:28.240
at least for me, there's a lot of things like that but I first have to overcome the initial hump

02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:35.120
of really sucking at that thing. The fun starts a little bit after the first hump of really

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:42.880
sucking and then you could suck just regularly. Oftentimes people can give up too early, I think.

02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:48.640
I mean, that's true with mathematics for me, for a lot of people, is if you just give it a chance

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:55.760
to struggle. If you give yourself time to struggle, you'll find the thing within that thing

02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.880
that you can lose track of time with.

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:06.400
Yeah, that's a key detail. That's an important thing to add to what I said, which is that

02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:14.400
this might not happen the first time you do a thing. Maybe it will. But you might have to

02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:20.560
climb that learning curve and if there's pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:31.600
that, then it might prevent you from getting where you need to be. So there's some complexity

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:44.480
there that can make this kind of non-obvious. But that's why we need good teachers. Another

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.760
beneficial thing of the internet is YouTube and being able to learn things, how to do things

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:59.040
on YouTube. The dude who made the YouTube video doesn't care how many times you hit pause and

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:06.160
rewind. They're never going to roll their eyes and be impatient with you.

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:15.280
And sometimes spending a huge amount of time on one video or one book, making that the thing

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:20.160
you just spent a huge amount of time on, rereading, rereading, or rewatching, rewatching,

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:29.840
that somehow really solidifies your love for that thing and the depth of understanding

02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.320
you start to gain. And it's okay to stay with that. I used to think there's all these books

02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:41.360
out there. So I need to keep reading or keep reading. But then I realized, I think it was

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:48.720
somewhere in college where you could just spend your whole life with a single textbook. There's

02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:52.640
nothing in that textbook to really, really stay.

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:59.120
Yeah. Measner, Thorne, and Wheeler. Gravitation is one of those. Or another one is The Road to

02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:05.280
Reality by Roger Penrose, which is just incredibly deep. And it starts with like two plus two equals

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:14.080
four. And at the end, you're at the boundaries of physics. It's an amazing, amazing book.

02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.040
Let me ask you the big ridiculous question.

02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:17.600
Okay.

02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:23.280
Since you've pondered some big ridiculous questions in your work, what's the meaning of

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:26.080
this whole thing? What's the meaning of life?

02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:26.640
Wow.

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:29.680
What's the meaning of life, human life?

02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:39.200
Well, as far as I know, we're unique in the universe. There's no evidence that there's

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:43.120
anything else in the universe that's as complicated as what's between our ears.

02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:54.080
Might be. You can't rule it out. But so we appear to be pretty special. And so it's got to have

02:35:54.080 --> 02:36:00.400
something to do with that. And one of the reasons I like David Deutsch, in particular his book,

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:07.120
The Beginning of Infinity, is that he talks about the power of explanations and the fact that

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:16.320
most civilizations are static, that they've got a set of dogmas that they arrive at somehow,

02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:23.600
and they just pass those on from one generation to the next and nothing changes.

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:31.840
But that huge changes have happened when people sort of follow whatever you want to call it,

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:38.000
the scientific method or enlightenment. There's different ways of thinking about it,

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:46.240
but basically explanatory. It's about the power of explanations and being able to figure out why

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:53.840
things are the way they are. And that has created changes in our thinking and our way of life

02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:59.760
over the last few centuries that are explosive compared to anything that came before.

02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:06.320
David sort of verges on classifying this as like a force of nature

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:17.920
in its potential transformative power. If we keep going, if we figure out how to colonize the

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:25.440
universe like you were talking about earlier, how to spread to other star systems, then it is

02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:32.400
effectively a force of nature. This kind of drive to understand more and more and more,

02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:37.600
deeper and deeper and deeper, and to engineer stuff so that we can understand even more.

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:43.920
Yeah. Yeah. It's the, well, it's the old, the universe created us to understand itself. Maybe

02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:47.680
that's the whole purpose. Yeah.

02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.960
It is an interesting peculiar side effect of the way we've been created is we seem to be

02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:01.200
conscious beings. We seem to have little egos. We seem to be born and die pretty quickly.

02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.440
There's a bunch of drama. We're all within ourselves pretty unique and we fall in love

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.600
and start wars and there's hate and all the full interesting dynamic of it. So it's not just about

02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:21.360
the individual people. Yeah. Somehow like the concert that we played together. Yeah. Yeah.

02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:27.520
That's kind of interesting. There's a lot of peculiar aspects of that that I wonder if they're

02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:33.200
fundamental or just quirks of evolution, whether it's, whether it's death, whether it's love,

02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:40.240
whether all those things. I wonder if they're from an engineering perspective when we're trying to

02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:48.000
create that intelligent toaster that listens for the, for the slam door and this, and the smell of

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:55.840
burning toasts, whether that toaster should be afraid of death and should fall in love just like

02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:03.040
we do. Neil, you're a fascinating human being. You've impacted the lives of millions of people.

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:08.640
It's a huge honor that you would spend your valuable time with me today. Thank you so much.

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:15.040
Thank you for coming down to beautiful, hot Texas and thank you for talking today.

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.360
It was a pleasure. I'm glad I came and did it.

02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:22.880
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Neil Stephenson. To support this podcast,

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Neil

02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:34.800
Stephenson himself in his novel Snow Crash. The world is full of things more powerful than us,

02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:38.800
but if you know how to catch a ride, you can go places.

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.720
Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
