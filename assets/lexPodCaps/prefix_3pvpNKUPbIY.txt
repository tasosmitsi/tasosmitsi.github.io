00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
The following is a conversation with Kevin Systrom, co-founder and longtime CEO of

00:05.640 --> 00:09.880
Instagram, including for six years after Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.800
This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.280
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:16.640 --> 00:23.520
And now here's my conversation with Kevin Systrom at the risk of asking the

00:23.520 --> 00:25.720
Rolling Stones to play satisfaction.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.160
Let me ask you about the origin story of Instagram.

00:28.200 --> 00:28.520
Sure.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.200
So maybe some context, you, like we were talking about offline, grew up in

00:33.200 --> 00:37.880
Massachusetts, learned computer programming there, liked to play doom too.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.600
Uh, worked at a vinyl record store.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.080
Then you went to Stanford, turned down Mr.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.960
Uh, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook went to Florence to study photography.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.440
Those are just some random, beautiful, impossibly brief glimpses into a life.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.160
So let me ask again, can you take me through the origin story of Instagram?

00:58.320 --> 01:00.240
Given that context, you basically set it up.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.080
All right.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.080
So, uh, we have a fair amount of time, so I'll go into some detail, but

01:06.080 --> 01:12.400
basically what I'll say is, um, Instagram started out of a company actually called

01:12.400 --> 01:18.640
bourbon and it was spelled B U R B N and, uh, a couple of things were happening at

01:18.640 --> 01:19.000
the time.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.520
So if we zoom back to 2010, not a lot of people remember what was happening in

01:23.520 --> 01:28.880
the.com world then, uh, but check-in apps were all the rage.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.680
So what's the check-in app, four square hot potato.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.640
So I'm at a place I'm going to tell the world that I'm at this place.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.000
That's right.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.840
What's, what's the idea behind this kind of app, by the way?

01:41.200 --> 01:41.600
You know what?

01:41.600 --> 01:45.880
I'm going to answer that, but through what Instagram became and why I believe

01:45.880 --> 01:47.080
Instagram replaced them.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.040
So the whole idea was to share with the world what you were doing specifically

01:51.040 --> 01:52.080
with your friends, right?

01:52.640 --> 01:56.320
Um, but there were all the rage and four square was getting all the press.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.080
And I remember sitting around saying, Hey, I want to build something, but I

01:59.080 --> 02:00.200
don't know what I want to build.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.600
What if I built a better version of four square?

02:04.320 --> 02:08.520
And I asked myself, well, why don't I like four square or how could it be

02:08.520 --> 02:09.000
improved?

02:09.560 --> 02:15.760
Um, and basically I sat down and I said, I think that if you have a few extra

02:15.760 --> 02:17.320
features, it might be enough.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.720
One of which happened to be posting a photo of where you were.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.080
There were some others.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.960
It turns out that wasn't enough.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.040
My co-founder joined, we were going to attack, uh, you know, four square and

02:27.040 --> 02:29.120
the likes and try to build something interesting.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.120
Um, and no one used it.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.520
No one cared because it wasn't enough.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.680
It wasn't, it wasn't different enough.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.080
Right?

02:35.640 --> 02:39.360
So one day we were sitting down and we asked ourselves, okay, it's come to

02:39.360 --> 02:42.040
Jesus moment, are we going to do this startup?

02:43.080 --> 02:46.120
And if we're going to, we can't do what we're currently doing.

02:46.120 --> 02:46.960
We have to switch it up.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.320
So what do people love the most?

02:48.320 --> 02:53.400
So we sat down and we wrote out three things that we thought people uniquely

02:53.400 --> 02:56.440
loved about our product that weren't in other products.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.720
Photos happened to be the top one.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.600
So sharing a photo of what you were doing, where you were at the moment was not

03:03.600 --> 03:06.320
something products let you do really.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.080
Facebook was like, post an album of your vacation from two weeks ago, right?

03:11.400 --> 03:15.760
Twitter allowed you to post a photo, but their feed was primarily text and they

03:15.760 --> 03:17.320
didn't show the photo in line.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.040
Or at least I don't think they did it at the time.

03:19.640 --> 03:26.600
So even though it seems totally stupid and obvious to us now at the moment, then

03:27.240 --> 03:30.400
posting a photo of what you were doing at the moment was like not a thing.

03:31.960 --> 03:36.080
So we decided to go after that because we'd noticed that people who used our

03:36.080 --> 03:39.560
service, the one thing they happened to like the most was posting a photo.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.720
So that was the beginning of Instagram.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.720
And yes, like we went through and we added filters and there's a

03:44.720 --> 03:46.080
bunch of stories around that.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.920
But the origin of this was that we were trying to be a check-in app, realize

03:49.920 --> 03:51.560
that no one wanted another check-in app.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.800
It became a photo sharing app, but one that was much more about what

03:55.800 --> 03:57.000
you're doing and where you are.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.920
And that's why, when I say, I think we've replaced check-in apps, it became a

04:01.920 --> 04:07.560
check-in via a photo rather than saying your location and then optionally

04:07.560 --> 04:08.360
adding a photo.

04:08.680 --> 04:13.200
When you were thinking about what people like, from where did you get a sense

04:13.200 --> 04:14.440
that this is what people like?

04:14.480 --> 04:18.280
You said, we sat down, we wrote some stuff down on paper.

04:18.880 --> 04:25.120
Where is that intuition that seems fundamental to the success of an

04:25.120 --> 04:26.640
app like Instagram?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.840
Where does that idea, where does that list of three things come from?

04:30.240 --> 04:30.800
Exactly.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.760
Only after having studied machine learning now for a couple of years, I

04:35.760 --> 04:38.040
like, I have a, you have understood yourself.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.720
I've started to make connections.

04:40.720 --> 04:47.360
Like we can go into this later, but obviously the, the, um, the

04:47.360 --> 04:52.000
connections between machine learning and the human brain, I think are

04:52.000 --> 04:53.280
stretched sometimes, right?

04:53.720 --> 04:58.960
At the same time, being able to back prop and being able to like, look at

04:58.960 --> 05:04.360
the world, try something, figure out how you're wrong, how wrong you are, and

05:04.360 --> 05:09.480
then nudge your company in the right direction based on how wrong you are.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.880
It was like a fascinating concept, right?

05:12.280 --> 05:14.960
And I don't, we didn't know we were doing it at the time, but that's

05:14.960 --> 05:16.320
basically what we were doing, right?

05:17.080 --> 05:22.720
We put it out to call it a hundred people and you would look at their data.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.120
You would say, what are they sharing?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.120
What, like what resonates?

05:26.120 --> 05:26.920
What doesn't resonate?

05:26.920 --> 05:30.480
We think they're going to resonate with X, but it turns out they resonate with Y.

05:31.080 --> 05:31.480
Okay.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.160
Shift the company towards Y.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.120
And it turns out if you do that enough, quickly enough, you can get to a

05:37.120 --> 05:39.720
solution that has product market fit.

05:39.760 --> 05:44.000
Most companies fail because they sit there and they don't either their

05:44.000 --> 05:47.520
learning rates too slow, they sit there and they're just, they're adamant that

05:47.520 --> 05:52.120
they're right, even though the data is telling them they're not right, or they,

05:52.200 --> 05:55.320
their learning rates too high and they wildly chase different ideas and they

05:55.320 --> 05:59.040
never actually settle on one where, where they don't groove, right?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.320
And I think when we sat down and we wrote out those three ideas, what we were

06:02.360 --> 06:08.000
saying is what are the three possible, whether they're local or global maxima

06:08.240 --> 06:09.320
in our world, right?

06:10.400 --> 06:14.240
That users are telling us they like, because they're using the product that way.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.720
It was clear people liked the photos because that was the thing they were doing.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.160
And we just said, okay, like, what if we just cut out most of the other

06:22.160 --> 06:23.920
stuff and focus on that thing?

06:24.520 --> 06:27.440
Um, and then it happened to be a multi-billion dollar business.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.920
And it's that easy by the way.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.680
Yeah, I guess so.

06:31.720 --> 06:36.080
Um, well, nobody ever writes about neural networks that miserably failed.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.120
So this, this particular neural network succeeded this, this all the time, right?

06:40.200 --> 06:40.520
Yeah.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.840
But nobody writes about default state is failing.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.320
Yes.

06:43.760 --> 06:50.120
Um, when you said the way people are using the app, is that the loss function for

06:50.120 --> 06:52.880
this neural network, or is it also self-report?

06:52.960 --> 06:57.160
Like, do you ever ask people what they like, or do you have to track

06:57.160 --> 06:59.360
exactly what they're doing, not what they're saying?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.880
I once made a Thanksgiving dinner.

07:02.080 --> 07:02.480
Okay.

07:03.080 --> 07:08.000
And, uh, it was for relatives and I like to cook a lot.

07:09.040 --> 07:15.280
And I worked really hard on picking the specific, uh, dishes and, and, and I was

07:15.280 --> 07:19.240
really proud because I had planned it out using a Gantt chart and like it was ready

07:19.240 --> 07:21.000
on time and everything was hot.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.000
Like, I don't know if you're a big Thanksgiving guy, but like the worst

07:24.000 --> 07:28.160
thing about Thanksgiving is when the turkeys cold and some things are hot and

07:28.160 --> 07:30.000
something, anyway, you got a Gantt chart.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.240
Actually have a chart.

07:31.320 --> 07:31.760
Oh yeah.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.120
Yeah.

07:32.160 --> 07:37.280
Omni-plan fairly expensive, like Gantt chart thing that I think maybe 10 people

07:37.280 --> 07:42.240
have purchased in the world, but I'm one of them and I use it for recipe planning

07:42.240 --> 07:43.520
only around big holidays.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.120
That's brilliant.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.600
By the way, do people do this kind of, uh, over engineering?

07:48.920 --> 07:49.720
It's not over engineering.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.800
It's just engineering.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.440
It's planning.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.680
Like Thanksgiving is a complicated, uh, set of events with some uncertainty

07:55.680 --> 07:56.960
with a lot of things going on.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.720
You should be able, you should be planning in this way.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.680
There should be a chart.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.400
It's not over.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.680
I mean, so what's funny is, um, brief aside.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.160
Yes.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.200
Uh, I love cooking.

08:07.200 --> 08:07.720
I love food.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.600
I love coffee.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.880
And I've spent some time with some chefs who like know their stuff and they always

08:13.880 --> 08:17.840
just take out a piece of paper and just work backwards in rough order.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.080
Like it's never perfect, but rough order.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.840
It's just like, Oh, that makes sense.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.680
Why not just work backwards from, from the end goal, right.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.000
And put in some buffer time.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.280
And so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gantt chart, but the

08:30.280 --> 08:34.840
fact that you can do it, it's what professional kitchens roughly do.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.960
They just don't call it a Gantt chart, or at least I don't think they do.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.240
Um, anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.960
So here's, uh, here's the thing.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.280
I'm sitting down, we have the meal and then, um, you know, I got to know Ray

08:47.280 --> 08:54.120
Dalio fairly well over maybe the last year of Instagram, um, and one thing

08:54.120 --> 08:59.240
that he kept saying was like, feedback is really hard to get honestly from people.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.120
And I sat down at after dinner.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.600
I said, guys, I want feedback.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.360
What was good and what was bad.

09:05.640 --> 09:05.920
Yes.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.080
And what's funny is like, literally everyone just said everything was great.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.440
And I like personally knew I had screwed up a handful of things.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.600
Um, but no one would say it.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.680
And can you imagine now not something as high stakes as Thanksgiving dinner?

09:21.680 --> 09:22.000
Okay.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.720
Thanksgiving dinner.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.640
It's not that high stakes.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.360
But you're trying to build a product and everyone knows you left your job for it.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.400
And you're trying to build it out and you're trying to make something

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
wonderful and it's yours, right?

09:33.400 --> 09:34.360
You designed it.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.440
Now try asking for feedback and know that you're giving this to your

09:39.440 --> 09:40.920
friends and your family.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.520
People have trouble giving hard feedback.

09:45.560 --> 09:50.040
People have trouble saying, I don't like this or this isn't great, or

09:50.040 --> 09:51.400
this is how it's failed me.

09:51.960 --> 09:57.400
In fact, um, you usually have two classes of people, people who just

09:57.400 --> 10:01.480
won't say bad things, you can literally say to them, please tell me what you

10:01.480 --> 10:02.920
hate most about this and they won't do it.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.120
They'll try, but they won't.

10:05.560 --> 10:09.640
And then the other class of people are just negative period about everything.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.720
And it's hard to parse out like what is true and what isn't.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.640
So my rule of thumb with this is you should always ask people, but at the end

10:20.640 --> 10:22.760
of the day, it's amazing what data will tell you.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.880
And that's why with whatever project I work on, even now, collecting data

10:27.880 --> 10:30.080
from the beginning on usage patterns.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.680
So engagement, how many days of the week do they use it?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.920
How many, I don't know if we were to go back to Instagram, how many

10:36.920 --> 10:38.960
impressions per day, right?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.160
Is that growing?

10:40.160 --> 10:41.040
Is that shrinking?

10:41.080 --> 10:44.640
And don't be like overly scientific about it, right?

10:44.640 --> 10:49.960
Cause maybe you have 50 beta users or something, but what's fascinating is

10:49.960 --> 10:51.760
that data doesn't lie.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.920
People are very, uh, defensive about their time.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.200
They'll say, Oh, I'm so busy.

10:59.200 --> 10:59.560
I'm sorry.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.680
I didn't get to use the app.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.520
Like I'm just, you know, um, but I don't know, you're posting

11:04.520 --> 11:05.800
on Instagram the whole time.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.440
So I don't know at the end of the day, like at Facebook, there was, you know,

11:11.440 --> 11:18.080
before time spent became kind of this loaded term there, the idea that people,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.280
people's currency in their lives is time.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.800
And they only have a certain amount of time to give things, whether it's

11:23.800 --> 11:28.120
friends or family or apps or TV shows or whatever it's, there's no way of

11:28.120 --> 11:33.680
inventing more of it, at least not that I know of if they don't use it,

11:33.720 --> 11:34.800
it's because it's not great.

11:35.520 --> 11:40.120
So the moral of the story is you can ask all you want, but you just

11:40.120 --> 11:45.200
have to look at the data and data doesn't lie, right?

11:45.320 --> 11:46.640
I mean, there's metrics.

11:46.640 --> 11:53.960
There's, um, data can obscure the key insight if you're not careful.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.200
So, so time spent in the app.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.200
That's one, there's so many metrics you can put at this and they will

12:00.200 --> 12:03.480
give you totally different insights, especially when you're trying to

12:03.480 --> 12:06.800
create something that doesn't obviously exist yet.

12:07.560 --> 12:15.200
So, you know, um, measuring maybe why you left the app or measuring

12:15.240 --> 12:20.240
special moments of happiness that will make sure you return to the app or

12:20.240 --> 12:24.080
moments of happiness that are long lasting versus like dopamine, short

12:24.080 --> 12:25.920
term, all of those things.

12:26.360 --> 12:31.600
But I think I suppose in the beginning, you can just get away with just asking

12:31.600 --> 12:38.440
the question, which features are used a lot, let's do more of that and how

12:38.440 --> 12:43.120
hard was the decision and, uh, I mean, maybe you can tell me what Instagram

12:43.160 --> 12:47.040
looked in the beginning, but how hard was it to make pictures?

12:47.040 --> 12:48.160
The first-class citizen.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.880
That's a revolutionary idea.

12:50.440 --> 12:56.720
Like, um, it's a, whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
That's quite brilliant.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.160
Plus also don't know when this happened, but they're all shaped the same.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.920
It's like, uh, I have to tell you why that's the interesting part.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.880
So a couple of things.

13:11.880 --> 13:16.760
One is data data, like you're right.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.000
You can overinterpret data.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.320
Like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring at, I don't know,

13:23.360 --> 13:25.120
a single metric, like airspeed.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.040
You don't know if you're going up or down.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.880
I mean, it correlates with up or down, but you don't actually know.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.720
It will never help you land the plane.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.920
So don't stare at one metric.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.720
Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics to know where to go.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.840
Um, but it doesn't lie.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.960
Like if your airspeed is zero, unless it's not working, right.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.240
If it, if it's zero, you're probably going to fall out of the sky.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.120
So generally you look around and you have the scan going.

13:50.440 --> 13:50.760
Yes.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.640
And you're just asking yourself, is this working or is this not working?

13:55.200 --> 14:02.040
Um, but people have trouble explaining how they actually feel.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.000
So just, it's about synthesizing both of them.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.880
So then Instagram, right?

14:06.920 --> 14:11.120
Uh, uh, we were talking about revolutionary moment where, where the

14:11.120 --> 14:13.720
feed became square photos, basically.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.240
And photos first and then square photos.

14:16.240 --> 14:16.760
Yeah.

14:16.880 --> 14:25.480
Um, it was clear to me that the biggest, so I believe the biggest companies are

14:25.480 --> 14:32.080
founded when enormous technical shifts happen and the biggest technical shift

14:32.080 --> 14:36.480
that happened right before Instagram was founded was the advent of a phone that

14:36.480 --> 14:38.880
didn't suck the iPhone, right?

14:38.920 --> 14:42.160
Like in retrospect, we're like, oh my God, the first iPhone that almost

14:42.160 --> 14:46.720
had like, it wasn't that good, but compared to everything else at the time,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.200
it was amazing.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.800
And by the way, the first, uh, phone that had an incredible camera.

14:54.680 --> 14:58.240
That could, that could like do as well as the point and shoot you might carry

14:58.240 --> 15:02.840
around was the iPhone four, and that was right when Instagram launched.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.520
And we looked around and we said, what will change because everyone

15:06.520 --> 15:07.600
has a camera in their pocket.

15:08.560 --> 15:13.880
And it was so clear to me that the, the world of social networks before.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.920
It was based in the desktop and sitting there and having a

15:17.920 --> 15:19.800
link you could share, right?

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
And that wasn't going to be the case.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.200
So the question is, what would you share if you were out and about in the world?

15:26.880 --> 15:30.000
If not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket, but by the way,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.160
that camera had a network attached to it that allowed you to share instantly.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.040
That seemed revolutionary.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.680
And a bunch of people saw it at the same time.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.720
It wasn't just Instagram.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.120
There were a bunch of competitors.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.280
Um, the thing we did, I think was not only, well, we focused on two things.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.800
So we wrote down those things.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.400
We circled photos and we said, I think we should invest in this.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.960
But then we said, what sucks about photos.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.320
One, they look like crap, right?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.000
They just, at least back then.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.400
Now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?

16:00.840 --> 16:05.040
Um, back then they were blurry, not so great compressed, right?

16:06.080 --> 16:11.240
Two, uh, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.880
And I'll tell a fun story about that and explain to you why they're all

16:14.880 --> 16:16.800
the same size and square as well.

16:17.440 --> 16:23.280
Um, and three, and if you wanted to share a photo on different networks, you

16:23.280 --> 16:26.720
had to go to each of the individual apps and select all of them and

16:26.720 --> 16:27.800
upload individually.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.560
And so we're like, all right, those are the pain points.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.960
We're going to focus on that.

16:31.960 --> 16:36.480
So one, instead of, because they weren't beautiful, um, we were like, why

16:36.480 --> 16:38.400
don't we lean into the fact that they're not beautiful?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.240
And I remember studying in Florence, my photography teacher gave me this

16:42.240 --> 16:45.080
Holga camera and I'm not sure everyone knows what a Holga camera is, but

16:45.080 --> 16:47.000
they're these old school plastic cameras.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.640
I think they're produced in China at the time.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.560
And there, I want to say the original ones were like from the

16:54.560 --> 16:56.000
seventies or the eighties or something.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.640
They're supposed to be like $3 cameras for the every person.

16:59.960 --> 17:05.440
They took nice medium format films, large, large, uh, negatives, but they

17:05.440 --> 17:09.320
kind of blurred the, uh, the, the light and they kind of like light leaked

17:09.320 --> 17:13.480
into the side and there was this whole resurgence where people looked at that

17:13.480 --> 17:15.440
and said, oh my God, this is a style.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.080
Right.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.680
And I remember using that in Florence and just saying, well, why don't we

17:19.680 --> 17:23.880
just like lean into the fact that these photos suck and make them suck more,

17:24.240 --> 17:25.720
but in an artistic way.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.960
And it turns out that had product market fit.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.160
People really liked that.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.880
They were willing to share their not so great photos if they looked

17:33.320 --> 17:34.560
not so great on purpose.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.000
Okay.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.720
The second part.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.840
That's the, where the filters come into the picture.

17:40.240 --> 17:44.240
So computational modification of photos to make them look extra

17:44.240 --> 17:46.040
crappy to where it becomes art.

17:46.120 --> 17:46.560
Yeah.

17:46.680 --> 17:46.960
Yeah.

17:46.960 --> 17:52.120
And I mean, add light leaks, add like an overlay filter, make them more

17:52.160 --> 17:53.800
contrasty than they should be.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.760
Uh, the first filter we ever produced was called X pro two.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.720
And I designed it while I was in this small little bed and breakfast

18:01.720 --> 18:03.560
room in Toto Santos, Mexico.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.720
I was trying to take a break from the, the bourbon days.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.520
And I remember saying to my co-founder, I just need like a week to reset.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.680
And that was on that trip worked on the first filter because I said, you

18:15.680 --> 18:16.880
know, I think I can do this.

18:17.200 --> 18:22.880
And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values in the array that

18:22.880 --> 18:25.960
was the photo and just slightly shifted.

18:26.240 --> 18:31.000
Basically there was a function of our function of G function of B that

18:31.000 --> 18:32.080
just shifted them slightly.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.560
It was in rocket science.

18:33.960 --> 18:37.840
Um, and it turns out that actually made your photo look pretty cool.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.960
It just mapped from one color space to another color space.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.400
It was simple, but it was really slow.

18:44.400 --> 18:49.360
I mean, if you applied a filter, I think it used to take two or three seconds to

18:49.360 --> 18:54.320
render only eventually would I figure out how to do it on the GPU and I'm not even

18:54.320 --> 18:58.800
sure it was a GPU, but it was using open GL, but anyway, um, I would eventually

18:58.800 --> 19:02.720
figure that out and then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.400
By the way, anyone who's watching or listening, it's amazing what you can get

19:07.400 --> 19:14.000
away with in a startup, as long as the product outcome is right for the user.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.360
Like you can be slow.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.400
You can be terrible.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.240
You can be as long as you have product market fit.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.360
People will put up with a lot.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.600
And then the question is just about compressing, uh, making it more

19:26.600 --> 19:29.880
performant over time so that they get that product market fit instantly.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.680
So fascinating because there's some things where that those three seconds

19:34.680 --> 19:40.000
would make or break the app, but some things you're saying not, it's hard to

19:40.000 --> 19:44.800
know when, you know, it's what it's the problem Spotify solved, making

19:44.800 --> 19:52.480
streaming like work and, uh, like delays in listening to music is a huge negative,

19:52.960 --> 19:59.280
even like slight delays, but here you're saying, I mean, how do you know when

19:59.280 --> 20:03.520
those three seconds are okay, or are you just going to have to try it out?

20:03.720 --> 20:09.800
Because to me, my intuition would be those three seconds would kill the app.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.840
Like I would try to do the open GL thing.

20:12.120 --> 20:12.520
Right.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.920
So I wish I were that smart at the time.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.520
Um, I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.040
Right.

20:21.560 --> 20:27.120
And I decided, okay, like, why don't I just iterate over the values and change them?

20:27.120 --> 20:33.280
And what's interesting is that, um, compared to the alternatives, no

20:33.280 --> 20:35.160
one else used open GL, right?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.040
So everyone else was doing the dumb way.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.960
And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution now comes in the small

20:41.960 --> 20:48.080
resolution that we'll talk about in a second, um, by choosing 512 pixels by 512

20:48.080 --> 20:52.680
pixels, which I believe it was at the time, we iterated over a lot fewer

20:52.680 --> 20:57.680
pixels than our competitors who were trying to do these enormous output like images.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.640
So instead of taking 20 seconds, I mean, three seconds feels pretty good, right?

21:03.240 --> 21:05.600
So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot.

21:06.240 --> 21:06.720
Okay.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.000
So that's answer number one.

21:08.440 --> 21:13.040
Answer number two is, uh, we actually focused on latency in the right places.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.400
So we did this really wonderful thing, um, when you uploaded.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.240
So, uh, the way it would work is, you know, you'd take your phone, you'd take

21:21.240 --> 21:26.680
the photo and then you'd go to the, um, you'd go to the edit screen where you

21:26.680 --> 21:31.600
would caption it and on that caption screen and start typing and you think,

21:31.640 --> 21:33.480
okay, like, what's a clever caption.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.560
And, and I said to Mike, Hey, when I worked on the Gmail team, you know

21:36.560 --> 21:41.120
what they did when you typed in your username or your email address, even

21:41.120 --> 21:45.640
before you've entered in your password, like the chant probability, once you

21:45.640 --> 21:50.200
enter in your username that you're going to actually sign in is extremely high.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.160
So why not just start loading your account in the background?

21:53.200 --> 21:55.720
Not, not like sending it down to the desktop.

21:55.720 --> 22:01.080
That would be a security, uh, issue, but like loaded into memory on the

22:01.080 --> 22:03.160
server, like get it ready, prepare it.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.600
I always thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.880
And I was like, Mike, why don't we just do that?

22:08.880 --> 22:12.600
But like, we'll just upload the photo and like, assume you're

22:12.600 --> 22:13.720
going to upload the photo.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.440
And if you don't forget about it, we'll delete it.

22:16.480 --> 22:16.840
Right.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.880
So what ended up happening was people would caption their, uh, photo.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.320
They'd press done or upload and you'd see this little progress bar.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.040
Just go, it was lightning fast.

22:29.040 --> 22:29.440
Okay.

22:30.160 --> 22:36.040
We were no faster than anyone else at the time, but by choosing 512 by 512 and

22:36.040 --> 22:40.120
doing in the background, it almost guaranteed that it was done by the time

22:40.120 --> 22:45.080
you captioned and everyone, when they used it was like, how the hell is this

22:45.080 --> 22:47.680
thing so fast, but we were slow.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.320
We just hit the slowness.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.160
It wasn't like, these things are just like, it's a Shelley game.

22:52.160 --> 22:58.360
You're just hiding the latency that that mattered to people like a lot.

22:58.720 --> 23:02.640
And I think that, so you were willing to put up with a slow filter.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.680
If it meant you could share it immediately.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.080
And of course we added sharing options with which let you

23:07.080 --> 23:08.200
distribute it really quickly.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.200
That was the third part.

23:10.120 --> 23:16.800
Um, so latency matters, but relative to what, and then there's some like

23:16.800 --> 23:21.040
tricks you get around to just hiding the latency, um, like I don't know

23:21.040 --> 23:25.320
if Spotify starts downloading the next song eagerly, I'm assuming they do.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.920
There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science that, that really help.

23:31.680 --> 23:36.160
And all of that was stuff you were explicitly having a discussion about,

23:36.160 --> 23:40.480
like those designs and argument, you were having like arguments, discussions.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.520
Uh, I'm not sure it was arguments.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.080
I mean, I'm not sure if you've met my co-founder Mike, but he's a pretty

23:46.080 --> 23:48.400
nice guy and he's very reasonable.

23:48.400 --> 23:52.160
And, uh, and we both just saw eye to eye and we're like, yeah, it's like,

23:52.920 --> 23:55.280
make this fast or at least seem fast.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.080
It'll be great.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.960
I mean, honestly, I think the most contentious thing, and he would say

23:59.960 --> 24:07.760
this to initially was, um, I was on an iPhone three G so like the not so fast

24:07.760 --> 24:10.000
one and he had a brand new iPhone four.

24:10.160 --> 24:16.120
I was cheap and his feed loaded super smoothly, like when he would scroll

24:16.120 --> 24:19.880
from photo to photo, buttery smooth, right?

24:20.320 --> 24:23.680
But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo, it was like kachon,

24:23.840 --> 24:26.520
kachon, allocate memory, like all this stuff, right?

24:27.440 --> 24:28.880
I was like, Mike, that's unacceptable.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.240
He's like, Oh, come on, man.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.680
Just like upgrade your phone.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.320
Basically.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.040
You didn't actually say that he was nicer than that.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.920
Um, but I could tell he wished like, I would just stop being cheap

24:37.920 --> 24:38.800
and just get a new phone.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.960
But what's funny is we actually sat there working on that little detail

24:43.000 --> 24:49.520
for a few days before launch and that polished experience, plus the fact that

24:49.520 --> 24:54.400
uploading seemed fast for all these people who didn't have nice phones, I

24:54.400 --> 25:00.360
think meant a lot because far too often you see teams focused not on performance.

25:00.520 --> 25:05.560
They focus on what's the cool computer science problem they can solve, right?

25:05.920 --> 25:08.440
Can we scale this thing to a billion users?

25:08.440 --> 25:09.880
And they've got like a hundred, right?

25:11.000 --> 25:11.280
Yeah.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.000
You talked about loss function.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.240
So I want to come back to that.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.680
But like the loss function is like, do you provide a great, happy, magical,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.480
whatever experience for the consumer?

25:23.160 --> 25:26.720
And listen, if it happens to involve something complex and technical and

25:26.720 --> 25:33.280
great, but it turns out, I think most of the time those experiences are just

25:33.280 --> 25:37.600
sitting there waiting to be built with like not that complex solutions.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.400
Uh, but everyone is just like so stuck in their own head that they have to

25:41.400 --> 25:44.240
over-engineer everything and then they forget about the easy stuff.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.840
I mean, also maybe to flip the loss function there is you're trying to

25:48.840 --> 25:54.000
minimize the number of times you there's unpleasant experience, right?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.800
Like, uh, the one you mentioned where when you go to the next photo,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.040
it freezes for a little bit.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.920
So it's, it's almost as opposed to maximizing pleasure.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.440
It's probably easier to minimize the number of like the friction.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.320
Yeah.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.920
And as we all know, you just, you just, uh, you just make the pleasure

26:09.920 --> 26:11.840
negative and then minimize everything.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.880
So we're mapping this all back to neural networks.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.440
But actually, can I say one thing on that, which is, I don't know a

26:18.440 --> 26:22.360
lot about machine learning, but I feel like I've, I've tried studying a

26:22.360 --> 26:28.880
bunch that whole idea of reinforcement learning and planning out more than the

26:28.880 --> 26:36.040
greedy single experience I think is, is the closest you can get to like ideal

26:36.040 --> 26:41.440
product design thinking where you're not saying, Hey, like, can we have a great

26:41.440 --> 26:46.240
experience just this one time, but like, what is the right way to onboard someone?

26:46.280 --> 26:52.280
What series of experiences correlate most with them hanging on long-term, right?

26:52.600 --> 26:57.080
So not just saying, Oh, did the photo load slowly a couple of times, or did

26:57.080 --> 27:00.760
they get a great photo at the top of their feed, but like, what are the

27:00.760 --> 27:04.800
things that are going to make this person come back over the next week,

27:04.880 --> 27:08.800
over the next month, and as a product designer asking yourself, okay, I want

27:08.800 --> 27:12.880
to optimize, not just minimize bad experiences in the short run, but like,

27:14.280 --> 27:17.080
how do I get someone to engage over the next month?

27:17.880 --> 27:21.280
And I'm not going to claim at all that I thought that way at all at the

27:21.280 --> 27:22.560
time, because I certainly didn't.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.320
But if I were going back and giving myself any advice, it would be thinking,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.680
what are those, what are those second order effects that you can create?

27:30.360 --> 27:34.600
And it turns out having your friends on the service is an enormous win.

27:34.840 --> 27:38.720
So starting with a very small group of people that produce content that you

27:38.720 --> 27:42.480
wanted to see, which we did, we seeded the community very well.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.680
I think ended up mattering.

27:44.680 --> 27:49.560
And so, yeah, you said that community is one of the most important things.

27:49.600 --> 27:55.720
So it's from a metrics perspective, from maybe a philosophy perspective, building

27:55.720 --> 27:57.520
a certain kind of community within the app.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.240
See, I wasn't sure what exactly you meant by that.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.960
When, when I've heard you say that maybe you can elaborate, but as I understand

28:03.960 --> 28:09.160
now, it's can literally mean get your friends onto the app.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.280
Yeah.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.760
Think of it this way.

28:12.840 --> 28:17.120
You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever, right?

28:17.880 --> 28:21.400
But if you show up and you're the only one there, is it like, does it

28:21.400 --> 28:25.040
matter how good the food is the drinks, whatever?

28:25.120 --> 28:29.960
Um, no, um, these are inherently social experiences that we were working on.

28:30.440 --> 28:36.880
So the idea of having people there, like you needed to have that.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.200
Otherwise it was just a filter app.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.560
But by the way, part of the genius, I'm going to say genius, even though it

28:42.560 --> 28:49.560
wasn't really genius was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.280
The fact that you could, so we talk about single player mode a lot, which is

28:53.280 --> 28:55.160
like, can you play the game alone?

28:56.240 --> 28:57.920
And Instagram, you could totally play alone.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.320
You could filter your photos.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.440
And a lot of people would tell me, I didn't even realize that this

29:02.440 --> 29:05.840
thing was a social network until my friend showed up.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.080
It totally worked as a single player game.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.720
And then when your friends showed up, all of a sudden it was like, Oh, not

29:12.720 --> 29:17.000
only was this great alone, but now I actually have this trove of photos that

29:17.000 --> 29:19.320
people can look at and start liking.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.400
And then I can like theirs.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.840
And so it was this bootstrap method of how do you make the thing not

29:24.840 --> 29:26.440
suck when the restaurant is empty?

29:26.960 --> 29:27.120
Yeah.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.200
But the thing is, when you say friends, I mean, we're not necessarily referring

29:31.200 --> 29:32.640
to friends in the physical space.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.240
So you're not bringing your physical friends with you.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.680
You're also making new friends.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.160
So you're finding new community.

29:38.320 --> 29:42.600
So it's not immediately obvious to me that it's like, it's almost

29:42.600 --> 29:44.320
like building any kind of community.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.280
It was, it was both.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.320
And what we learned very early on was what made Instagram special and the

29:50.320 --> 29:53.520
reason why you would sign up for it versus say, just sit on Facebook and

29:53.520 --> 29:54.600
look at your friends' photos.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.640
Of course we were alive.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.320
And of course it was interesting to see what your friends were doing now.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.440
But the fact that you could connect with people who like took really

30:03.440 --> 30:06.440
beautiful photos in a certain style all around the world, whether they were

30:06.440 --> 30:10.640
travelers, it was the beginning or beginning of the influencer economy.

30:11.160 --> 30:14.440
There's these people who became professional Instagrammers way back when,

30:14.480 --> 30:14.760
right?

30:16.440 --> 30:20.880
But they took these amazing photos and some of them were photographers, right?

30:21.120 --> 30:23.160
Like professionally.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.080
And all of a sudden you had this moment in the day when you could open up this app

30:27.080 --> 30:29.800
and sure, you could see what your friends were doing, but also it was like,

30:29.800 --> 30:33.040
Oh my God, that's a beautiful waterfall or Oh my God.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.000
I didn't realize there was that corner of England or like really cool stuff.

30:37.760 --> 30:43.480
And the beauty about Instagram early on was that it was international by default.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.600
You didn't have to speak English to use it, right?

30:46.720 --> 30:47.920
You could just look at the photos.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.200
Works great.

30:49.720 --> 30:53.320
We did translate, we had some pretty bad translations, but we did translate the

30:53.320 --> 30:58.880
app and you know, even if our translations were pretty poor, the idea that you could

30:58.880 --> 31:02.080
just connect with other people through their images was pretty powerful.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.840
How much technical difficulty is there with the programming?

31:07.080 --> 31:09.040
Like what programming language are we talking about?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.120
Well, zero.

31:10.160 --> 31:16.720
I like, maybe it was hard for us, but I mean, we, there was nothing, the only

31:16.720 --> 31:22.480
thing that was complex about Instagram at the beginning, technically was making

31:22.480 --> 31:27.160
it scale and we were just plain old objective C for the client.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.320
So it was iPhone only iPhone only.

31:30.320 --> 31:30.640
Yep.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.600
As, as an Android person, I'm deeply offended, but go ahead.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.760
This was 2010.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.280
Oh, sure.

31:36.280 --> 31:36.560
Sure.

31:36.560 --> 31:36.920
Sorry.

31:36.920 --> 31:37.160
Sorry.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.000
Android is getting a lot better.

31:39.000 --> 31:39.560
Yeah.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.520
So, um, I take it back.

31:41.520 --> 31:41.760
You're right.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.440
If I were to do something today, I think it would be very different in

31:44.440 --> 31:46.560
terms of launch strategy, right?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.080
Android's enormous too.

31:48.160 --> 31:53.960
Uh, but anyway, um, back to that moment, it was objective C, uh, and then.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.840
We were Python based, uh, which is just like, this is before

31:58.840 --> 32:00.120
Python was really cool.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.160
Like now it's cool.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.120
Cause it's all these machine learning libraries, like support Python.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.080
And right now it's super, now it's like cool to be part of it.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.680
Back then it was like, Oh, Google uses Python.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.520
Like maybe you should use Python.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.320
Facebook was PHP.

32:14.320 --> 32:19.280
Like I had worked at a small startup of some ex Googlers that used Python.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.600
So we used it and we used a framework called Django, uh, still exists and people

32:23.600 --> 32:27.160
use, uh, for basically the backend.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.040
And then you threw a couple of interesting things in there.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.080
I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.840
It was a little bit like hipster database at the time, right?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.840
My SQL, like everyone used my SQL.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.840
So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision, right.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.760
Uh, but we used it because it had a bunch of, uh, geo features built in

32:45.760 --> 32:47.600
because we thought we were going to be a checking app.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.240
Remember it's also super cool now.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.240
So you were into Python before it was cool and you were into

32:52.240 --> 32:53.480
Postgres before it was cool.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.960
Yeah, we were basically like not only hipster, hipster photo company,

32:57.960 --> 32:59.360
hipster tech company, right.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.040
Uh, we also adopted Redis early and like loved it.

33:04.040 --> 33:08.800
I mean, it solves so many problems for us and turns out that's still pretty cool.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.240
But the programming was very easy.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.920
It was like, sign up a user or have a feed.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.480
There was nothing, no machine learning at all.

33:16.480 --> 33:16.960
Zero.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.680
Can you get some context, how many users at each of these stages?

33:20.760 --> 33:23.840
We're talking about a hundred users, a thousand users.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.920
So the stage I just described, I mean, that technical stack

33:26.920 --> 33:30.760
lasted through probably 50 million users.

33:31.400 --> 33:36.480
Um, I mean, seriously, like you can get away with a lot with,

33:36.520 --> 33:38.040
with a pretty basic stack.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.920
Um, like I think a lot of startups try to over-engineer their solutions

33:41.920 --> 33:45.120
from the beginning to like really scale and you can get away with a lot.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.040
That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram was literally

33:49.040 --> 33:51.000
just trying to make that stack scale.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.080
And it wasn't, it was, it was not a Python problem.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.000
It was like, literally just like, where do we put the data?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.840
Like it's all coming in too fast.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.960
Like, how do we store it?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.320
How do we make sure to be up?

34:02.320 --> 34:07.240
How do we like, how do we make sure we're on the right size boxes that

34:07.280 --> 34:08.640
they have enough memory?

34:08.680 --> 34:11.080
Um, those were the issues, but

34:11.160 --> 34:15.760
can you speak to the choices you make at that stage when you're growing so quickly?

34:16.160 --> 34:19.720
Do you use something like somebody else's computer infrastructure

34:20.400 --> 34:22.120
or do you build in-house?

34:22.680 --> 34:28.320
I'm only laughing because we, when we launched, we had a single computer

34:28.560 --> 34:32.120
that we had rented in some color space in LA.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.680
I don't even remember what it was called.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.840
Cause I thought that's what you did when I worked at a company

34:36.840 --> 34:38.400
called Odeo that became Twitter.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.120
I remember visiting our space in San Francisco.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.360
You walked in, you had to wear the ear things.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.880
It was cold and fans everywhere.

34:45.880 --> 34:46.200
Right.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.840
And we had to, you know, plug one out, replace one.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.760
And I was the intern.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.840
So I just like held things, but I thought to myself, oh, this is how it goes.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.240
And then I remember being in a VC's office.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.920
I think it was benchmark's office.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.640
And I think we ran into another entrepreneur and they were like,

35:02.640 --> 35:03.480
Oh, how are things going?

35:03.480 --> 35:06.240
We're like, ah, you know, try to scale this thing.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.920
And they were like, well, I mean, can't you just add more instances?

35:09.920 --> 35:10.840
And I was like, what do you mean?

35:11.520 --> 35:13.560
And they're like instances on Amazon.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.000
I was like, what are those?

35:15.480 --> 35:19.120
And it was this moment where we realized how deep in it we were

35:19.160 --> 35:24.360
because we had no idea that AWS, AWS existed, nor should we be using it.

35:24.400 --> 35:28.240
Anyway, that night we went back to the office and we got on AWS, but

35:28.240 --> 35:29.840
we, we did this really dumb thing.

35:29.840 --> 35:36.400
We're so sorry to people listening, but we brought up an instance, which

35:36.400 --> 35:40.120
was our, our database, it's going to be a replacement for our database.

35:40.880 --> 35:44.200
But we had it talking over the public internet to our little

35:44.200 --> 35:46.320
box in LA that was our app server.

35:47.080 --> 35:47.440
Yeah.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.960
Um, that's how sophisticated we were.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.800
And obviously that was very, very slow.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.720
Um, didn't work at all.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.400
I mean, it worked, but didn't work.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.600
Did we only like later that night, did we realize we had to have it all together?

36:00.120 --> 36:03.200
But at least like, if you're listening right now and you're thinking, you

36:03.200 --> 36:06.360
know, I have no chance, I'm going to start a startup, I have no chance.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.320
I don't know.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.320
We did it and we made a bunch of really dumb mistakes initially.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.480
I think the question is how quickly do you learn that you're making a mistake

36:13.560 --> 36:16.200
and do you do the right thing immediately right after?

36:16.320 --> 36:20.240
So you didn't pay for those mistakes by, you know, by failure.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.160
So yeah, how quickly did you fix it?

36:23.640 --> 36:26.760
I guess there's a lot of ways to sneak up to this question of how

36:26.760 --> 36:27.920
the hell do you scale the thing?

36:28.400 --> 36:31.320
Uh, other startups, if you have an idea, how do you scale the thing?

36:31.600 --> 36:39.840
Is it just AWS and, uh, you try to write the kind of code that's easy to spread

36:39.840 --> 36:45.000
across a large number of instances and then the rest is just put money into it.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.840
Basically, I would say a couple of things.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.240
First off, don't even ask the question, just find product market fit,

36:53.680 --> 36:55.440
duct tape it together, right?

36:55.440 --> 36:59.360
Like if you have to, I think there's a big caveat here, which I want to get to,

37:00.320 --> 37:03.200
but generally all that matters is product market fit.

37:03.720 --> 37:08.440
That's all that matters if people like your product, do not worry about when

37:08.440 --> 37:12.320
50,000 people use your product because you will be happy that you have that

37:12.320 --> 37:13.400
problem when you get there.

37:13.840 --> 37:21.400
I actually can't name many startups where they go from nothing to something

37:21.400 --> 37:23.760
overnight and they can't figure out how to scale it.

37:24.160 --> 37:29.520
There are some, but I think nowadays it's a, when I say a solved problem,

37:29.520 --> 37:31.920
like there are ways of solving it.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.560
The base case is typically that startups worry way too much about scaling way too

37:37.560 --> 37:40.360
early and forget that they actually have to make something that people like.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.840
That's the, that's the default mistake case.

37:43.600 --> 37:49.640
But what I'll say is, um, once you start scaling, I mean, hiring quickly,

37:49.720 --> 37:53.840
people who have seen the game before and just know how to do it, it becomes,

37:53.880 --> 37:58.440
um, it becomes a bit of like, yeah, just throw instances of the problem.

37:58.440 --> 37:58.760
Right.

37:59.240 --> 38:04.240
But the last thing I'll say on this that I think did save us, um, we were pretty

38:04.240 --> 38:10.800
rigorous about writing tests, uh, from the beginning that helped us move very,

38:10.800 --> 38:15.240
very quickly when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product and know that we

38:15.240 --> 38:16.720
weren't breaking something else.

38:17.200 --> 38:21.440
Tests are one of those things where it's like, you go slow to go fast and they

38:21.440 --> 38:24.080
suck when you have to write them because you have to figure it out.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.160
And there are always those ones that break when you don't want them to break

38:28.160 --> 38:30.360
and they're annoying and it feels like you spend all this time.

38:30.360 --> 38:35.640
But looking back, I think that like long-term optimal, even with a team of

38:35.640 --> 38:40.080
four, it allowed us to move very, very quickly because anyone could touch any

38:40.080 --> 38:43.440
part of the, the, the product and know that they weren't going to bring down

38:43.440 --> 38:45.520
the site or at least in general.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.600
At which point do you know product market fit?

38:48.600 --> 38:50.160
How many users would you say?

38:50.480 --> 38:53.720
Is it all it takes us like 10 people or is it a thousand?

38:53.720 --> 38:55.040
Is it 50,000?

38:55.760 --> 38:59.800
I don't think it is generally a question of absolute numbers.

38:59.800 --> 39:03.760
I think it's a question of cohorts and I think it's a question of trends.

39:03.800 --> 39:08.960
So, you know, it depends how big your business is trying to be.

39:08.960 --> 39:09.360
Right.

39:09.400 --> 39:14.280
But if I were signing up a thousand people a week and they all retain like

39:14.280 --> 39:19.880
the retention curves for those cohorts looked good, healthy, and even like, as

39:19.880 --> 39:23.440
you started getting more people on the service, maybe those earlier cohorts

39:23.440 --> 39:26.240
started curving up again, because now there are network effects and their

39:26.240 --> 39:29.840
friends are on the service or totally depends what type of business you're in.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.320
But I'm talking purely social, right?

39:32.320 --> 39:36.560
Um, I don't think it's an absolute, uh, number.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.640
I think it is a, I guess you could call it a marginal number.

39:39.640 --> 39:44.080
So I spent a lot of time when I worked with startups asking them like, okay,

39:44.360 --> 39:48.800
have you looked at that cohort versus this cohort, whether it's your clients or

39:48.840 --> 39:53.960
whether it's people signing up for the service, but a lot of people think you

39:53.960 --> 39:58.760
just have to hit some mark, like 10,000 people or 50,000 people, but really.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.800
Seven ish billion people in the world.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.040
Most people forever will not know about your product.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.520
There are always more people out there to sign up.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.000
It's just a question of how you turn on the spigot.

40:10.480 --> 40:17.040
So at that stage, early stage yourself, but also by way of advice, should you

40:17.040 --> 40:21.000
worry about money at all, how this thing's going to make money, or do you

40:21.000 --> 40:27.120
just try to find product market fit and, uh, get a lot of users to enjoy using

40:27.120 --> 40:27.640
your thing?

40:28.640 --> 40:30.000
I think it totally depends.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.680
And that's an unsatisfying answer.

40:31.800 --> 40:37.760
Um, I was talking with a friend today who he was one of our earlier

40:37.760 --> 40:41.240
investors and he was saying, Hey, like, have you been doing any angel investing

40:41.240 --> 40:42.440
lately? I said, not really.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.760
I'm just like focused on what I want to do next.

40:44.760 --> 40:51.280
And he said, the number of financings have just gone bonkers, like just bonk.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.320
Like people are throwing money everywhere right now.

40:54.560 --> 41:02.400
Um, and I think the question is, do you have an inkling of how you're going to

41:02.400 --> 41:07.160
make money or are you really just like waving your hands?

41:07.360 --> 41:13.040
I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position of, well, I have no idea

41:13.040 --> 41:14.360
how this will eventually make money.

41:14.360 --> 41:14.960
That's not fun.

41:15.360 --> 41:21.080
Um, if you are in an area, like, let's say you wanted to start a social

41:21.080 --> 41:22.200
network, right?

41:22.880 --> 41:27.080
Not saying this is a good idea, but if you did, there are only a handful of ways

41:27.080 --> 41:29.800
they've made money and really only one way they've made money in the past.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.680
And that's ads.

41:31.040 --> 41:38.480
Um, so, you know, if you have a service that's amenable to that, and then I

41:38.480 --> 41:41.120
wouldn't worry too much about that because if you get to the scale, you can

41:41.120 --> 41:42.760
hire some smart people and figure that out.

41:44.200 --> 41:49.480
I do think that is really healthy for a lot of startups these days, especially

41:49.480 --> 41:54.520
the ones doing like, uh, enterprise software, slacks of the world, et cetera,

41:54.800 --> 41:59.440
to be worried about money from the beginning, but mostly as a way of winning

41:59.440 --> 42:01.360
over clients and having stickiness.

42:01.960 --> 42:07.320
Um, I like, of course you need to be worried about money, but I'm going to

42:07.320 --> 42:11.600
also say this again, which is it's like long-term profitability.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.880
If you have a roadmap to that, then that's great.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.080
But if you're just like, I don't know, maybe never like we're working on this

42:19.080 --> 42:21.560
meta-first thing, I think maybe someday.

42:22.280 --> 42:22.760
I don't know.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.240
Like that seems harder to me.

42:24.280 --> 42:28.560
Um, so you have to be as big as Facebook to like finance that bet, right?

42:29.400 --> 42:30.360
Do you think it's possible?

42:30.360 --> 42:34.680
You said you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea to launch a social network.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.440
Do you think it's possible today?

42:38.960 --> 42:44.200
Maybe you can put yourself in those shoes to launch a social network that

42:44.200 --> 42:49.600
achieves the scale of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram and

42:49.600 --> 42:51.160
maybe even greater scale.

42:51.240 --> 42:51.920
Absolutely.

42:53.240 --> 42:53.960
How do you do it?

42:55.400 --> 42:56.280
Asking for a friend.

42:56.360 --> 42:56.600
Yeah.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.920
If I knew I probably doing it right now and not sitting here.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.600
So, I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question.

43:03.600 --> 43:09.120
One is create a totally new product, market fit, create a new market, create

43:09.160 --> 43:13.760
something like Instagram did, which is like create something kind of new or

43:13.960 --> 43:17.760
literally out-compete Facebook at its own thing or out-compete

43:17.760 --> 43:18.920
Twitter at its own thing.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.800
The only way to compete now, if you want to build a large social network

43:23.800 --> 43:26.680
is to look for the cracks, look for the openings.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.400
You know, no one competed.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.440
I mean, no one competed with the core business of Google.

43:33.440 --> 43:36.280
No one competed with the core business of Microsoft.

43:36.880 --> 43:41.000
You don't go at the big guys doing exactly what they're doing.

43:41.880 --> 43:46.960
Instagram didn't win quote unquote, because it tried to be a visual Twitter.

43:46.960 --> 43:51.920
Like we spotted things that either Twitter wasn't going to do or refuse to

43:52.800 --> 43:55.000
images and feed for the longest time.

43:55.000 --> 43:55.320
Right.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.880
Or that Facebook wasn't doing or not paying attention to you because they

43:58.880 --> 44:00.560
were mostly desktop at the time.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.520
And we were purely mobile, purely visual.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.200
Often there are opportunities sitting there.

44:07.560 --> 44:12.440
You just have to, you have to, you have to figure out like, uh, I think

44:12.440 --> 44:13.840
like there's a strategy book.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.640
I can't remember the name, but talk about motes and just like the best place to

44:18.640 --> 44:22.560
play is where your competitor, like literally can't pivot because

44:22.560 --> 44:25.320
structurally they're set up not to be there.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.160
And that's where you win.

44:27.200 --> 44:32.720
Um, and what's fascinating is like, do you know how many people are like images?

44:33.280 --> 44:35.120
Facebook does that Twitter does that.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.160
I mean, how wrong were they really wrong?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.320
And these are some of the smartest people in Silicon Valley.

44:39.320 --> 44:39.680
Right.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.360
But now Instagram exists for a while.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.120
How is it that Snapchat could then exist?

44:45.280 --> 44:46.520
It makes no sense.

44:47.200 --> 44:50.040
Like plenty of people would say, well, there's Facebook, no images.

44:50.080 --> 44:50.320
Okay.

44:50.320 --> 44:50.640
Okay.

44:50.640 --> 44:54.640
And then Instagram, I'll give you that one, but wait, now another image based

44:54.640 --> 44:56.160
social network is going to get really big.

44:57.080 --> 45:01.600
And then Tik TOK comes along like the prior.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.280
So you asked me, is it possible?

45:03.440 --> 45:08.040
The only answer and reason I'm answering yes is because my prior is that it's

45:08.040 --> 45:12.920
happened once every, I don't know, three, four or five years consistently.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.440
And I can't imagine there's anything structurally that would change that.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.920
Um, so that's why I answer that way.

45:18.920 --> 45:23.080
Not because I know how I just, when you see a pattern, you see a pattern and

45:23.320 --> 45:26.760
there's no reason to believe that's going to stop and it's subtle too, because

45:26.760 --> 45:31.760
like you said, uh, Snapchat and Tik TOK, they're all doing the same space of

45:31.760 --> 45:37.200
things, but there's something fundamentally different about like a three second

45:37.200 --> 45:41.040
video and a five second video and a 15 second video and a one minute video and

45:41.120 --> 45:44.920
one hour video, like fundamentally different, fundamentally different.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.160
I mean, I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists is because Instagram

45:49.160 --> 45:54.760
was so focused on posting great, beautiful manicured versions of

45:54.760 --> 45:56.280
yourself throughout time.

45:57.160 --> 46:00.680
And there was this enormous demand of like, Hey, I really like this behavior.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.160
I love using Instagram, but man, I just like, wish I could share

46:05.160 --> 46:06.560
something going on in my day.

46:07.920 --> 46:10.000
Do I really have to put it on my profile?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.880
Do I really have to make it last forever?

46:11.880 --> 46:14.640
Do I really, um, and that opened up a door.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.560
It created a market, right?

46:16.640 --> 46:20.160
And then what's fascinating is Instagram had an explore

46:20.160 --> 46:21.320
page for the longest time.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.600
It was image driven, right?

46:23.000 --> 46:26.920
Um, but there's absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram and you

46:26.920 --> 46:28.240
sit on the explore page all day.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.120
That is effectively Tik TOK, but obviously focused on videos.

46:32.520 --> 46:37.080
And it's not like you could just put the explore page in Tik TOK form and it works.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.040
It had to be video.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.040
It had to have music.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.680
These are the hard parts about product development that are very hard to predict,

46:44.120 --> 46:50.920
but, um, they're all versions of the same thing with varying, if you line them up

46:50.920 --> 46:55.960
in a bunch of dimensions, they're just like kind of on, they're different values

46:55.960 --> 46:59.800
of the same dimensions, which is like, I guess, easy to say in retrospect, but

46:59.800 --> 47:03.480
like, if I were an entrepreneur going after that area, I'd ask myself like,

47:03.480 --> 47:07.640
where's the opening, what needs to exist because Tik TOK exists now.

47:08.440 --> 47:14.680
So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist and can exist is in the space

47:14.680 --> 47:17.520
of algorithms in the space of recommender systems.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.240
So in the space of how the feed is generated.

47:21.600 --> 47:26.480
So we kind of talk about the actual elements of the, um, the content.

47:26.760 --> 47:30.360
That's what we've been talking to the difference between photos, between

47:30.600 --> 47:32.000
short videos, longer videos.

47:32.360 --> 47:36.640
I wonder how much disruption is possible in the way the algorithms work.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.080
Because a lot of the criticism towards social media is in the way

47:40.080 --> 47:41.480
the algorithms work currently.

47:41.920 --> 47:47.600
And it feels like, first of all, talking about product market fit, there's

47:47.600 --> 47:56.360
certainly a hunger for, um, social media algorithms that do something different.

47:56.840 --> 48:01.080
I don't think anyone, everyone's like complaining, this is not doing, this

48:01.080 --> 48:04.960
is, this is hurting me and this is hurting society, but I keep doing

48:04.960 --> 48:06.560
it because I'm addicted to it.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.800
And they say we want something different, but we don't know what it feels

48:11.800 --> 48:18.080
like, uh, just different, uh, it feels like there's a hunger for that, but

48:18.080 --> 48:19.280
that's in the space of algorithms.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.680
I wonder if it's possible to disrupt in that space.

48:22.000 --> 48:22.800
Absolutely.

48:23.320 --> 48:29.000
Um, I have this thesis that the worst part about social networks is

48:29.000 --> 48:32.720
that they're, uh, is the people.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.600
It's, it's, it's a line that sounds funny, right?

48:36.600 --> 48:38.560
Because like, that's why you call it a social network.

48:39.080 --> 48:42.240
Um, but what does social networks actually do for you?

48:42.360 --> 48:46.560
Like just think, you know, like imagine you were an alien and you landed and

48:46.800 --> 48:48.480
someone says, Hey, there's this site.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.400
It's a social network.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.440
We're not going to tell you what it is, but just what does it do?

48:51.800 --> 48:53.000
And you had to explain it to them.

48:53.080 --> 48:54.000
It does two things.

48:54.280 --> 49:00.960
One, uh, is that people, you know, and have social ties with, uh, distribute

49:01.040 --> 49:06.640
updates through, whether it's, uh, you know, photos or videos about their lives

49:06.640 --> 49:09.120
so that you don't have to physically be with them, but you can keep in touch

49:09.120 --> 49:09.400
with them.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.240
That's one that's like a big part of Instagram.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.520
That's a big part of snap.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.120
It is not part of Tik TOK at all.

49:16.280 --> 49:20.520
So there's another big part, which is there's all this content out in the

49:20.520 --> 49:24.680
world that's entertaining, whether you want to watch it or you want to read

49:24.680 --> 49:32.320
it, um, and matchmaking between content that exists in the world and, uh, people

49:32.320 --> 49:35.920
that want that content turns out to be like a really big business, right?

49:35.920 --> 49:36.840
Search and discovery.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.440
Would you search and discovery?

49:38.440 --> 49:39.920
But my point is it could be video.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.680
It could be text.

49:40.680 --> 49:41.560
It could be websites.

49:41.560 --> 49:46.520
It could be, I mean, think back to, um, think back to like dig, right.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.840
Or stumble upon or, right.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.160
Nice.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.760
But like, what did those do?

49:51.800 --> 49:55.280
Like they basically distributed interesting content to you, right?

49:55.960 --> 50:01.200
Um, I think the most interesting part are the, are the future of social

50:01.200 --> 50:05.720
networks is going to be making them less social because I think people are part

50:05.720 --> 50:06.920
of the root cause of the problem.

50:06.920 --> 50:11.480
So for instance, um, often in recommender systems, we talk about two stages.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.880
There's a candidate generation step, which is just like of our vast trove of

50:15.920 --> 50:17.520
stuff that you might want to see.

50:18.360 --> 50:22.120
What small subset should we pick for you?

50:22.480 --> 50:22.920
Okay.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.920
Typically that is grabbed from things your friends have shared, right?

50:28.320 --> 50:32.320
Then there's a ranking step, which says, okay, now given these hundred, 200

50:32.320 --> 50:33.880
things depends on the network, right?

50:34.240 --> 50:38.520
Let's like be really good about ranking them and generally rank the things up

50:38.520 --> 50:40.440
higher that get the most engagement, right?

50:40.800 --> 50:41.880
So what's the problem with that?

50:42.520 --> 50:47.400
Step one is we've limited everything you could possibly see to things that

50:47.400 --> 50:51.720
your friends have chosen to share, or maybe not friends, but influencers.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.560
What things do people generally want to share?

50:54.560 --> 50:56.520
They want to share things that are going to get likes that are

50:56.520 --> 50:57.960
going to show up broadly.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.720
So they tend to be more emotionally driven.

51:00.720 --> 51:03.480
They tend to be more risque or whatever.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.080
So why do we have this problem?

51:05.080 --> 51:09.840
It's because we show people things people have decided to share and those

51:09.840 --> 51:13.240
things self-select to being the things that are most divisive.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.360
So how do you fix that?

51:16.400 --> 51:21.320
Well, what if you just imagine for a second that why do you have to grab

51:21.320 --> 51:23.120
things from things your friends have shared?

51:23.120 --> 51:24.560
Why not just like grab things?

51:25.400 --> 51:26.960
That's really fascinating to me.

51:27.440 --> 51:32.160
And that's something I've been thinking a lot about and just like, you know, why

51:32.160 --> 51:37.120
is it that when you log onto Twitter, you're just sitting there looking at

51:37.400 --> 51:40.720
things from accounts that you followed for whatever reason.

51:42.280 --> 51:45.160
And TikTok I think has done a wonderful job here, which is like, you can

51:45.160 --> 51:50.720
literally be anyone and if you produce something fascinating, it'll go viral.

51:51.680 --> 51:54.760
But like, you don't have to be someone that anyone knows.

51:54.760 --> 51:57.280
You don't have to have built up a giant following.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.520
You don't have to have paid for followers.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.840
You don't have to try to maintain those followers.

52:01.840 --> 52:03.960
You literally just have to produce something interesting.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.960
That is, I think, the future of social networking.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.560
That's the direction things will head.

52:10.040 --> 52:14.960
And I think what you'll find is it's far less about people manipulating

52:14.960 --> 52:18.640
distribution and far more about what is like, is this content good?

52:19.640 --> 52:25.720
And good is obviously a vague definition that we spend hours on, but different

52:25.720 --> 52:29.280
networks, I think, will decide different value functions to decide what is good

52:29.280 --> 52:29.960
and what isn't good.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.920
And I think that's a fascinating direction.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.600
So that's almost like creating an internet.

52:33.600 --> 52:38.440
I mean, that's what Google did for web pages that did, you know, page rank

52:38.440 --> 52:40.360
search discovery.

52:40.360 --> 52:44.080
You don't, you don't follow anybody on Google when you use a search engine.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.200
You just discover web pages.

52:46.240 --> 52:51.240
And so what TikTok does is saying, let's start from scratch.

52:51.720 --> 52:56.080
That's like, like start a new internet and have people discover stuff in that

52:56.080 --> 52:59.360
new internet within a particular kind of pool of people.

52:59.760 --> 53:04.600
But what's so fascinating about this is like the, the field of information

53:04.600 --> 53:08.760
retrieval, like I always talks about, as I was studying this stuff, I've always

53:08.760 --> 53:10.240
used the word query and document.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.800
So I was like, why are they saying query and documents?

53:12.800 --> 53:17.120
Like they're literally imagine, like if you just stop thinking about query as

53:17.120 --> 53:20.400
like literally a search query and a query could be a person.

53:20.440 --> 53:24.120
I mean, a lot of the way I'm not going to claim to know how Instagram or Facebook

53:24.160 --> 53:29.800
machine learning works today, but you know, if you want to find a match for a

53:29.800 --> 53:34.320
query, the query is actually the attributes of the person, their age, their

53:34.320 --> 53:39.680
gender, where they're from, maybe some kind of summarization of their interests.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.880
And, and that's a query, right.

53:41.920 --> 53:43.400
And that matches against documents.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.040
And by the way, documents don't have to be texts.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.920
They can be videos.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.120
They're however long.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.080
I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days.

53:50.080 --> 53:50.800
They keep changing it.

53:51.320 --> 53:55.240
My point is just, you've got a query, which is someone in search of something

53:55.240 --> 53:58.880
that they want to match and you've got the document and it doesn't have to be

53:58.880 --> 54:02.760
text, it could be anything and how do you match make, and that's one of these.

54:02.760 --> 54:06.760
Like, I mean, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and I don't claim

54:06.760 --> 54:10.840
to have mastered it at all, but I think it's so fascinating about where that

54:10.840 --> 54:12.960
will go with new social networks.

54:13.240 --> 54:17.440
See, what I'm also fascinated by is metrics that are different than engagement.

54:18.080 --> 54:22.000
So the other thing from an alien perspective, what social networks are

54:22.000 --> 54:28.720
doing is they, um, they, in the short-term bring out different

54:28.720 --> 54:30.040
aspects of each human being.

54:30.040 --> 54:39.440
So first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network for each individual

54:39.440 --> 54:43.960
can bring out the best of that person or the worst of that person, or there's

54:44.000 --> 54:49.280
a bunch of different parts to us, parts we're proud of that we are, parts we're

54:49.280 --> 54:53.800
not so proud of when we look at the big picture of our lives, when we look back

54:53.800 --> 54:57.080
30 days from now, am I proud that I said those things or not?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.280
Am I proud that I felt those things?

54:59.280 --> 55:04.320
Am I proud that I experienced or read those things or thought about those

55:04.320 --> 55:07.400
things just in that kind of self-reflective kind of way?

55:08.080 --> 55:11.840
And so coupled with that, I wonder if it's possible to have different

55:11.840 --> 55:13.640
metrics that are not just about engagement.

55:14.080 --> 55:21.120
But are about long-term happiness, growth of a human being where they look back

55:21.120 --> 55:26.080
and say, I am a better human being for having spent 100 hours on that app.

55:26.840 --> 55:30.680
And that feels like it's actually strongly correlated with

55:30.680 --> 55:32.960
engagement in the long-term.

55:33.280 --> 55:37.000
In the short-term, it may not be, but in long-term, it's like the same kind of

55:37.000 --> 55:41.560
thing where you really fall in love with the product, you fall in love with an

55:41.560 --> 55:43.200
iPhone, you fall in love with a car.

55:43.720 --> 55:50.560
That's what makes you fall in love is like really being proud and just in a

55:50.560 --> 55:53.760
self-reflective way, understanding that you're a better human being for

55:53.760 --> 55:54.840
having used the thing.

55:55.080 --> 55:58.440
And that's like where, that's what great relationships are made from.

55:58.720 --> 56:04.240
It's not just like you're hot and we like being together or something like that.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.880
It's more like I'm a better human being because I'm with you.

56:07.520 --> 56:11.920
And that feels like a metric that could be optimized for by the algorithms.

56:12.560 --> 56:17.720
But, you know, anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody, they seem to say,

56:17.720 --> 56:22.000
yeah, okay, that's going to get outcompeted immediately by the engagement.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.960
If it's ad driven, especially, I just don't think so.

56:26.440 --> 56:30.280
I don't, I mean, a lot of it's just implementation.

56:30.600 --> 56:31.560
I'll say a couple of things.

56:31.560 --> 56:37.400
One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings inside of these

56:37.400 --> 56:38.920
large social media companies.

56:39.880 --> 56:44.800
A lot of what management or at least the people that are tweaking these

56:44.800 --> 56:46.880
algorithms, spend their time on our trade-offs.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.800
And there's these things called value functions, which are like, okay, we

56:51.800 --> 56:56.000
can predict the probability that you'll click on this thing or the probability

56:56.000 --> 57:00.880
that you'll share it, or the probability that you will leave a comment on it, or

57:00.880 --> 57:02.960
the probability you'll dwell on it.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.760
Individual actions, right?

57:06.080 --> 57:10.200
And you've got this neural network that basically has a bunch of heads at the end

57:10.200 --> 57:14.760
and all of them are between zero and one and great, they all have values, right?

57:14.800 --> 57:16.720
Or they all have probabilities.

57:18.440 --> 57:22.840
And then in these meetings, what they will do is say, well, how much do we

57:22.840 --> 57:28.760
value a comment versus a click versus a share versus a, and then maybe even some

57:28.760 --> 57:30.120
downstream thing, right?

57:30.440 --> 57:34.880
That has nothing to do with the item there, but like driving from one

57:35.200 --> 57:36.800
driving follows or something.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.760
And what typically happens is they will say, well, what are our

57:40.760 --> 57:42.720
goals for this quarter at the company?

57:42.720 --> 57:44.000
Oh, we want to drive sharing up.

57:44.040 --> 57:44.480
Okay.

57:44.720 --> 57:50.040
Well, let's turn down these metrics and turn up these metrics and they blend

57:50.040 --> 57:53.720
them right into a single scalar with which they're trying to optimize.

57:55.240 --> 57:59.720
That is really hard because invariably you think you're solving for, I don't

57:59.720 --> 58:02.200
know, something called meaningful interactions, right?

58:02.760 --> 58:04.160
This was the big Facebook pivot.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.680
And I don't actually have any internal knowledge.

58:06.680 --> 58:11.560
Like I wasn't in those meetings, but at least from what we've seen over

58:11.560 --> 58:17.080
the last month or so, it seems by actually trying to optimize for meaningful

58:17.080 --> 58:20.720
interactions, it had all these side effects of optimizing for these other

58:20.720 --> 58:25.600
things, and I don't claim to fully understand them, but what I will say

58:26.440 --> 58:31.880
is that trade-offs abound and as much as you'd like to solve for one thing, if

58:31.880 --> 58:35.600
you have a network of over a billion people, you're going to have unintended

58:35.600 --> 58:38.000
consequences either way, and it gets really hard.

58:38.840 --> 58:42.520
So what you're describing is effectively a value model that says, like, can

58:42.520 --> 58:45.600
we capture, this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about.

58:45.600 --> 58:51.920
Like, can you capture utility in a way that like actually measures

58:51.920 --> 58:56.600
someone's happiness that isn't just a, what do they call it?

58:56.600 --> 59:00.560
A surrogate problem where you say, well, kind of think like the more you use

59:00.560 --> 59:02.920
the product, the happier you are.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.720
That was always the argument at Facebook, by the way.

59:04.720 --> 59:08.600
It was like, well, people use it more, so they must be more happy.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.600
Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more that make you

59:11.600 --> 59:15.000
less happy in the world, not talking about Facebook, just, you know, let's

59:15.000 --> 59:18.800
think about whether it's gambling or whatever, like that you can do more

59:18.800 --> 59:20.720
of, but doesn't necessarily make you happier.

59:20.720 --> 59:24.760
So the idea that time equals happiness, obviously you can't map

59:24.760 --> 59:26.720
utility and time together easily.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.280
There are a lot of edge cases.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.200
So when you look around the world and you say, well, what are all

59:31.200 --> 59:32.680
the ways we can model utility?

59:32.680 --> 59:36.200
That is like one of the, please, if you know someone smart doing this,

59:36.240 --> 59:38.360
introduce me because I'm fascinated by it.

59:38.480 --> 59:40.160
And it seems really tough.

59:40.560 --> 59:44.680
But the idea that reinforcement learning, like everyone interesting I

59:44.680 --> 59:48.280
know in machine learning, like I was really interested in recommender

59:48.280 --> 59:49.800
systems and supervised learning.

59:49.800 --> 59:54.520
And, and the more I dug into it, I was like, oh, literally everyone smart is

59:54.520 --> 59:57.600
working on reinforcement learning, like literally everyone.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.280
You just made people at open AI and deep mind very happy.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:00.680
Yes.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.120
But I mean, but what's interesting is like, it's one thing to train a game.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.040
I'm like, I mean, that paper that where they just took Atari and they used a

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.000
ConvNet to basically just like train simple actions, mind blowing, right?

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080
Absolutely mind blowing, but it's a game.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:17.600
Great.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.000
So now what if you're constructing a feed for a person, right?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:30.760
Like how can you construct that feed in such a way that optimizes for a

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.640
diversity of experience, a long-term happiness, right?

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.480
But that reward function, it turns out in reinforcement learning again, as I've

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:48.120
learned, like reward design is really hard and I don't know, like how do you

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.280
design a scalar reward for someone's happiness over time?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.200
I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.000
Like, do you have to?

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.000
Well, you have to have a lot of, a lot more signals from the human being.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.480
Currently it feels like there's not enough signals coming from the

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.000
human being users of this algorithm.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.960
So for reinforcement learning to work well, it needs to have a lot more data.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.920
Needs to have a lot of data.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.480
And that actually is a challenge for anyone who wants to start something,

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.440
which is you don't have a lot of data.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.480
So how do you compete?

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.600
But I do think back to your original point, rethinking the algorithm,

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.360
rethinking reward functions, rethinking utility.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.720
That's fascinating.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:28.640
That's cool.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.440
And I think that's an open opportunity for, for a company that figures it out.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:41.600
I have to ask about April, 2012, when Instagram, along with its massive

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:47.240
employee base of 13 people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.240
What was the process like on a business level, engineering level,

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.240
human level, what was that process of selling to Facebook?

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.040
Like, what did it feel like?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.360
So I want to provide some context, which is I worked in corporate

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.080
development at Google, which not a lot of people know, but corporate

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.800
development is effectively the group that buys companies, right?

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.000
You sit there and you acquire companies.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.760
And I had sat through so many of these meetings with entrepreneurs.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.680
We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company when I

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.720
worked in corporate development.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.360
So I can't claim that I had like a lot of experience.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.560
Um, but I had enough experience to understand, okay, like what prices

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.240
are people getting and what's the process?

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:33.400
And, and as we started to grow, you know, we were trying to keep this thing

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.040
running and we were exhausted and we were 13 people and I mean, we were

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:46.800
trying to think back, it was probably 27, 37 now, um, so young and on a relative

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.640
basis, right?

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.600
And, uh, we're trying to keep the thing running and then, you know, we

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.840
go out to raise money and we're kind of like the hot startup at the time.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.320
And I remember going into a specific VC and saying, our terms we're looking

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.400
for are we're looking for a $500 million valuation, and I've never seen

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.680
so many jaws drop all in unison, right?

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.520
And I was like, thanked and walked out the door very kindly after, um, and

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.760
then I got a call the next day, uh, from someone who was connected to them and

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.360
said, they said, we just want to let you know that, like, uh, it was pretty

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.160
offensive that you asked for a $500 billion valuation and I can't tell if

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.680
that was, um, like just negotiating or what, but it's true, like no one offered

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.840
us more, right?

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.760
So we were, so can you clarify the number again?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.720
You said how many million 500, 500 million, 500 million.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.000
Yeah.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:40.600
Half a billion.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.080
Yeah.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.640
Um, so in my mind I'm anchored like, okay, well, literally no one's

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.480
biting at 500 million and eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock and

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.640
others together at 500 million, basically, uh, post, uh, it was 450 pre.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.120
I think we raised $50 million, but just like, no one was used to seeing

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.520
a $500 million companies then, like, I don't know if it was because we were

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.440
just coming out of the hangover 2008 and things were still on recovery, um, mode.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.680
Uh, but then along comes Facebook and after some negotiation, we've

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.200
two X to the number from a half a billion to a billion.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.600
Yeah, it seems pretty good, you know?

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.720
And, uh, I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye that this thing could be big.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.160
Um, we thought we could, their resources would help us scale it.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.840
And in a lot of ways it derisks, I mean, it derisks a lot of the employees

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.120
lives for the rest of their lives, including me, including Mike, right?

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.640
Um, I think I might've had like 10 grand in my bank account at the time, right?

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.440
Like we're working hard.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.320
We had nothing.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.320
Um, so on a relative basis, it seems very high.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.240
And then I think the last company to exit for anywhere close to a billion was

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.320
YouTube that I could think of and, uh, and thus began the giant long bull run

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.760
of 2012 to all the way, all the way to where we are now, where, um, I saw

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.160
some stat yesterday about like how many unicorns exist and it's absurd, but then

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.360
again, never underestimate technology and like the value it can provide and man,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.200
costs have dropped and man scale has increased and you can make businesses

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.040
make a lot of money now, but on a, on a fundamental level, I don't know, like,

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.640
how do you describe the decision to sell a company with 13 people for a billion

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.080
dollars?

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.880
First of all, like how did it take a lot of guts to sit at a table and say 500

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.760
million or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg?

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.240
It seems like a very large number with 13, like, especially like

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:51.600
it doesn't seem, it is, they're all large, especially like you said, before

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.040
the unicorn parade, I like that.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.960
I'm going to use that, the unicorn parade.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.240
Yeah.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.520
The, uh, the, the, you were at the head of the unicorn parade.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.400
It's the, uh, yeah, it's a massive unicorn parade.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.120
Um, okay.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.480
So no, I mean, we knew we were worth quote unquote a lot, but we didn't, I mean,

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.520
there was no market for Instagram.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.960
I mean, it's not, you couldn't mark, you couldn't mark to market this

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.000
thing in the public markets.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.280
You didn't quite understand what it would be worth or was worth at the time.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.360
So in a market, an illiquid market where you have one buyer and one seller and

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:31.560
you're going back and forth and, well, I guess there were like VC firms who were

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:37.720
willing to, you know, invest at a certain valuation, so I don't know, you just go

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:44.400
with your gut and, uh, and at the end of the day, I would say, um, the hardest

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:52.560
part of it was not realizing, uh, like when we sold, it was tough because like

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:58.280
literally everywhere I go, restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.080
after it was a lot of attention on the deal, a lot of attention on the product,

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080
a lot of attention.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.200
It was kind of miserable.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:05.880
All right.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.240
And you're like, wait, like I made a lot of money, but like, why is this not great?

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.880
And it's because it turns out, you know, you know, I don't, I don't know.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.640
Like I don't really keep in touch with Mark, but I've got to assume his job

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.000
right now is not exactly the most happy job in the world.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.760
It's really tough when you're on top.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.920
And it's really tough when you're in the limelight.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.880
So the decision itself was like, oh, cool.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.520
This is great.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.480
How lucky are we?

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.080
Right.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:29.720
So, okay.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.520
There's a million questions.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:37.520
I want to go first of all, first of all, why, why is it hard to be on top?

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.800
Why did you not feel good?

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.720
Like, can you dig into that?

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.040
It always, um, I've heard like Olympic athletes say after they win gold, they,

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.080
they get depressed.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:54.880
Um, is it something like that where it feels like it was kind of like a thing

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.840
you were working towards some, some loose definition of success.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.560
And this sure feels like, uh, at least according to other startups, this

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.840
is what success looks like.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.400
And now why don't I feel any better?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.160
I'm still human.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.520
I still have all the same problems.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.880
Is that the nature or is it just like negative attention of some kind?

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.360
What, what?

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.640
I think it's all of the above.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.400
Um, but to be clear, there was a lot of happiness in terms of like, oh

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.800
my God, this is great.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.320
Like we like won the Superbowl of startups, right?

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:30.760
Um, anyone who can get to a liquidity event of anything meaningful feels

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.880
like, wow, this is what we started out to do.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.800
Of course we want to create great things that people love, but, um,

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.760
like we won in a big way, but yeah, there's this big like, oh, if we

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.360
won, what is like, what's next?

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.160
I don't, so they call it the, we have arrived syndrome, um, which I need

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.480
to go back and look where I can quote that from, but I remember reading

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.360
about it at the time and I was like, oh yeah, that's that.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.360
And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on when

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.840
we got to Facebook and he said to me, um, I just don't believe I can

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.840
learn anything at this company anymore.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.960
It's like, it's hit its apex.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.480
We sold it great.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.160
I just don't have anything else to learn.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.400
So from 2012 all the way to the day I left in 2018, like the amount I learned

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.800
and the humility with which I realized, oh, we thought we won billion dollars

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.840
is cool, but like there are a hundred billion dollar companies.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.320
And by the way, on top of that, we had no revenue.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.360
We had, I mean, we had a cool product, but we didn't scale it yet.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.680
And there's so much to learn and then competitors and how fun

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.000
was it to fight Snapchat?

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:38.640
Oh my God.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.960
Like it was, it's like Yankees red socks.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.800
That's great.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.400
Like that's what you live for.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.960
Um, you know, you win some, you lose some, but, uh, the amount you can

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.880
learn through that process, uh, what I've realized in life is that there

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.200
is no, and there's always someone who has more, there's always more challenge

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.600
just at different scales and, uh, it sounds like a little Buddhist, but, um,

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.960
everything is super challenging, whether you're like a small business

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.560
or an enormous business, I say, like, choose the game you like to play, right?

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.560
You've got to imagine that if you're an amazing basketball player, you

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.400
enjoy to some extent, practicing basketball, it's got to be something

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.360
you love, it's going to suck, it's going to be hard, you're going to have

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.120
injuries, right, but you got to love it.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.920
And the same thing with Instagram, which is, um, we might've sold, but it was

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.880
like, great, there's one Superbowl title.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.240
Can we win five?

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.440
What else can we do now?

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.160
I imagine you didn't ask this, but okay.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.520
So I left, there's a little bit of like, what do you do next?

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:46.920
Right?

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.960
Like, what do you, how do you top that thing?

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.080
It's the wrong question.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.160
The question is like, when you wake up every day, what is the hardest, most

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.000
interesting thing you can go work on?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.240
Because like, at the end of the day, we all turn in dirt.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.400
Doesn't matter, right?

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.080
But what does matter is like, can we really enjoy this life?

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.440
Not in a hedonistic way, because that's, that's like the reinforcement

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.680
learning, learning like short-term versus long-term objectives.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:19.920
Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you're doing, um, knowing

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.040
that it's going to be painful, knowing that like, no matter what you choose,

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.000
it's going to be painful, um, whether you sit on a beach or whether you

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.920
manage a thousand people or 10,000, it's going to be painful.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.120
So choose something that's fun to have pain.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.520
Um, but yes, there was, uh, there was a lot of, we have arrived and, um,

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.280
it's a maturation process you just have to go through.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.320
So no matter how much success is there is how much money you make, you have

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.760
to wake up the next day and choose the hard life, whatever that means next.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.440
That's fun.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.960
The fun slash hard life, hard life.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.560
That's fun.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.000
I guess what I'm trying to say is slightly different, which is just

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.600
that no one realizes everything's going to be hard, even chilling out.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:07.760
It's hard.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.960
And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.520
Like, I don't know, like did so-and-so forget to paint the house today or

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.200
like, did the gardener come or whatever?

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.280
Like, or, oh, I'm so angry and my shipment of wine didn't show up and

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.160
I'm sitting here on the beach without my wine.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:22.560
I don't know.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.920
I'm making shit up now, but like,

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.680
it turns out that even chilling AKA meditation is hard work.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.120
Yeah.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.400
And at least meditation is like productive chilling where you're like

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.520
actually training yourself to calm down and be, but backing up for a moment.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.240
Everything's hard.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.960
You might as well be like playing the game you love to play.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:48.120
I just like playing and winning and, and I'm, I'm on the, on the, I'm still on

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.240
the, I think the first half of life knock on wood, um, and I've got a lot of years

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:53.960
and what am I going to do?

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.640
Sit around.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.920
And the other way of looking at this, by the way, um, imagine you made one movie

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.360
and it was great, would you just like stop making movies?

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.160
No, generally you're like, wow, I really like making movies.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:08.920
Let's make another one.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.920
A lot of times, by the way, the second one or the third one, not that great,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.360
but the fourth one, awesome.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.080
And no one forgets the sec or everyone forgets the second and the third one.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.160
So there's just this constant process of like, can I produce?

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.720
And is that fun?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.480
Is that exciting?

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.360
What else can I learn?

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.040
So this machine learning stuff for me has been this awesome new chapter of being

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.640
like, man, that's something I didn't understand at all.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.280
And now I feel like I'm one 10th of the way there.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.120
And that feels like a big mountain to climb.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.640
Uh, so I, I distracted us from the original question.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.080
No, and we'll return to the machine learning because I'd love to

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.200
explore your interest there.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.080
But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things,

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.640
is there a possible world?

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.320
Where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg with a $1 billion

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.360
deal, you turn it down.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.680
Yeah, of course.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.240
What does that world look like?

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.640
Why would you turn it down?

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640
Why did you take it?

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.640
What was the calculation that you were making?

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:12.720
Ah, that centers the world of counterfactuals and not really knowing.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.000
And if only we could run that experiment.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.440
Well, the universe exists.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.560
It's just running in parallel to our own.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.080
Yeah.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.880
It's so fascinating, right?

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.720
Um, I mean, we're talking a lot about money, but the real question

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:32.840
was, um, I'm not sure you'll believe me when I says, but could we strap our

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:38.200
little company on the side of a rocket ship and like get out to a lot of people

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.080
really, really quickly with the support, with the, the talent of a place like

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.320
Facebook, I mean, people often ask me what I would do differently, um, at

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:48.960
Instagram today.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.960
And I say, well, I'd probably hire more carefully cause we showed up just like

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.760
before I knew it, we had like a hundred people on the team and 200 then 300.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.520
I don't know where all these people were coming from.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.720
I never had to recruit them.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.320
I never had to screen them.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.560
They were just like internal transfers, right?

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.640
So it's like relying on the Facebook hiring machine, which is quite sort

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.280
of, I mean, it's an elaborate machine.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.840
It's great, by the way, they have really talented people there.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:22.040
But my point is, um, the choice was like, take this thing, put it on the side

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.760
of a rocket ship that you know, is growing very quickly.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.400
Like I had seen what had happened when I've sold blogger to Google

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.800
and then Google went public.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.560
Remember we sold before Facebook went public.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.040
There was a moment at which the stock price was $17, by the way,

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.080
Facebook stock price was $17.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.640
I remember thinking, what the did I just do?

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.120
Right.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.080
Uh, now at 320 ish, I don't know where we are today, but like, okay.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.680
Like the best thing by the way is like, when the stock is down, everyone

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.720
calls you dope and then when it's up, they also call you a dope, but

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.360
just for a different reason, right?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.480
Like you can't win less than in there somewhere, but you know, the choice

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.360
is to strap yourself to a rocket ship or to build your own, you know, Mr.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.560
Elon built his own literally with the rocket ship.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.960
That's a difficult choice because, um, there's a world.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.240
Actually, I would say something different, which is Elon and others

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.080
decided to sell PayPal for, not that much.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.840
I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.000
I can't remember something like that.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:28.280
Yeah.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.680
I mean, it was early and, um, but it's worth a lot more now to

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.080
then build a new rocket ship.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.480
So this is the cool part, right?

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.280
If you are an entrepreneur and you own a controlling stake in the company,

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.480
not only is it really hard to do something else with your life, because

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.640
all of the, you know, value is tied up in you as a personality attached

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.880
to this company, right?

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.840
But if you sell it and you're getting yourself enough capital and you like

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.920
have enough energy, you can do another thing or 10 other things, or in

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.680
Elon's case, like a bunch of other things.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.000
I don't know.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.240
Like I lost count at this point.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:06.080
Um, and it might've seemed silly at the time and sure.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.120
Like if you look back, man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right?

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.560
But I don't know.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.640
Like, do you think Elon like cares about like, are we going to buy Pinterest or

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:14.840
not?

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:21.560
Like I just, he is, he created a, a, a massive capital that allowed him to do

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.680
what he wants to do and that's awesome.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.320
That's more freeing than anything, because when you are an entrepreneur

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.240
attached to a company, you got to stay at that company for a really long time.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.040
It's really hard to remove yourself, but I'm not sure how much he loved

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.520
PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.840
I have a sense that you love Instagram.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:41.560
Yeah.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.720
I loved enough to like work for six years beyond the deal, which is rare,

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.640
which is very rare.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:52.120
You chose, but can I tell you why it's, um, please, there are not a lot of

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:58.240
companies that you can be part of where the Pope's like, I would like to sign

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.160
up for your product.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.960
Like I'm not a religious person at all.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.280
I'm really not.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.440
Um, but when you go to the Vatican and you're like walking among a giant

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.240
columns and you're hearing the music and everything and like the Pope walks

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.280
in and he wants to press the signup button on your product, it's a moment

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.120
in life, okay.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.800
Um, no matter what your persuasion.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.240
Okay.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.840
The number of doors and experiences that that opened up was, it was incredible.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.600
I mean, the people I got to meet, the places I got to go.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.520
Um, I assume maybe like a payments company is slightly different, right?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.680
But that's why, like, it was so fun.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.280
And plus I truly believed we were building such a great product and I loved,

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.520
loved the game.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.920
It wasn't about a money.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.160
It was about the game.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.320
Do you think, do you think he had the guts to say no?

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.400
Is that so here's, I often think about this, like, how hard is it for an

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:57.080
entrepreneur to say no, because the peer pressure, so every basically the sea of

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.320
entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are going to tell you, I mean, this is their

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.600
dream that the, the, the thing you were sitting before was, is a dream to walk

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:12.400
away from that is really, it seems like nearly impossible because Instagram

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.400
could in 10 years be, you know, you, you could talk about Google.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.520
You could be making self-driving cars and building rockets that go to

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.600
Mars and compete with SpaceX.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:31.440
And so that's an interesting decision to say, am I willing to risk it?

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.080
And the reason I also say it's an interesting decision, because it feels

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.240
like per our previous discussion, if you're launching a social, social

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.240
network company, there's, there's going to be that meeting, whatever that

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.840
number is, if you're successful, if you're on this rocket ship of success,

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.200
there's going to be a meeting with one of the social media, social network

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.600
companies that want to buy you, whether it's Facebook or Twitter, but it could

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:05.440
also very well be Google, who seems to have like a graveyard of failed social

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.920
networks and it's, I mean, I don't know.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.600
I think about that, how difficult it is for an entrepreneur to make that

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:17.960
decision, how many have successfully made that decision, I guess, is a big question.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.320
It's sad to me, to be honest, that too many make that decision, perhaps

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.160
for the wrong reason.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.640
Sorry, when you say make the decision, you mean to the affirmative.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.560
To the affirmative.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.000
Got it.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:28.400
Yeah.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.320
There are also companies that don't sell, right.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.800
And take the path and say, we're going to be independent.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.760
And then you've never heard of them again.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.360
Like I remember, path, right.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.160
It was one of our competitors early on.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.040
There's a big moment when they had, I can't remember what it was, like

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.920
a hundred and $10 million offer from Google or something.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.560
It might've been larger.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.000
I don't know.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.640
And I remember there was like this big TechCrunch article that was like, they

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.760
turned it down after talking deeply about their values and everything.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.480
And I don't, I don't know the inner workings of Foursquare, but like, I'm

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.960
certain there were many conversations over time where there were companies

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.320
that wanted Foursquare as well.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.960
Recently, like, I mean, what other companies, there's Clubhouse, right?

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.680
Like, I don't know.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.160
Maybe people were really interested in them too.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:26.880
Like there are plenty of moments where people say no, and we just

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.440
forget that those things happen.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.000
We only focus on the ones where like, uh, uh, they said yes.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.920
And like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent?

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:36.800
So I don't know.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.680
I like, I used to think a lot about this and now I just don't

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.000
because I'm like, whatever.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I, you know, like things have gone pretty well.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.920
Yeah, I'm ready for the next game.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:52.000
I mean, think about, um, an athlete where, I don't know, maybe they, they,

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.080
they do something wrong in the world series or whatever.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:58.760
I'm like, if you let it haunt you for the rest of your career, like, why not

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.560
just be like, I don't know, it was a game, next game, next shot, right?

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.360
If, if you just moved to that world, like at least I have a next shot, right?

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.600
No, that's, that's beautiful.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.280
But I mean, just in insights, uh, and it's funny you brought up Clubhouse.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.760
It is very true.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.840
It seems like Clubhouse is, um, you know, on the downward path and it's very

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:25.960
possible to see a billion plus dollar deal at some stage, maybe like a year

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.360
ago or half a year ago from Facebook, from Google, I think Facebook was

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.600
flirting with that idea too.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.200
And I think a lot of companies probably were, I wish it was more public.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:37.920
You know what?

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:43.120
There's not like a bad-ass public story about them making the decision to walk

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:43.480
away.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.000
We just don't hear about it.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.560
And then we get to see the results of that success or the failure more often

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.040
failure.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.440
So a couple of things.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.880
One is I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.560
They're young.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.520
They have plenty of money.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.360
They're run by really smart people.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.400
I'd give them like a very fighting chance to figure it out.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.120
There are a lot of times when people called Twitter down for the count and

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.240
they figure it out and they seem to be doing well, right?

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.800
Um, so just backing up like, and not knowing anything about their internals,

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.480
like there's a strong chance they will figure it out and that people are just

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.480
down because they like being down about companies.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.000
They like assuming that they're going to fail.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So who knows, right?

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.120
But let's take the ones in the past where like, we know how it played out.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:28.640
There are plenty of examples where people have turned down big offers and then

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.360
you've just never heard from them again, but we never focus on the companies

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:38.520
because you just forget that those were big, but inside your psyche, I think

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.120
they're, um, it's easy for someone with enough money to say money doesn't

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.560
matter, which I think is like, it's bullshit.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.360
Of course money matters to people.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:53.040
Um, but at the moment you just can't even grasp like the number of zeros

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:53.880
that you're talking about.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.120
It just doesn't make sense.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.160
Right.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.760
So to think rationally in that moment is not something many people are equipped

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.240
to do, especially not people where I think we had founded the company a year earlier,

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.480
maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:14.000
We were 13 people, but, um, I will say, I still don't know if it was the right

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.920
decision, cause I don't have that counterfactual.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.400
I don't know that other world.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.320
I'm just thankful that by and large, most people love Instagram still do.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.560
By and large, people are very happy with like the time we had there.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.600
Um, and I'm proud of what we built.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.320
So like, I'm cool.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.920
Like we're, you know, now it's next shot, right?

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:41.000
Well, if we could just linger on this, uh, Yankees versus Red Sox, the fun of it,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.840
the competition over, I would say over the space of features.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:52.960
So, um, there are a bunch of features, like there's photos, there's one minute

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.280
videos on Instagram, there's IDTV, there's stories, there's reels, there's live.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.280
So that sounds like it's like a long list of too much stuff, but it's, it's not

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:08.960
because it feels like they're, they're close together, but there's somehow, like

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.120
what we're saying, fundamentally distinct, like each of the things I mentioned,

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.520
maybe can you describe the philosophies that design philosophies behind some of

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:23.080
these, how you were thinking about it during the, uh, the historic war between

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:29.240
Snapchat and Instagram, or just in general, like this space of features that was

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:29.880
discovered.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.360
There's this, um, great book by Clay Christensen called competing against

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:35.760
luck.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:42.600
It's like a terrible, uh, title, but within it, there's, uh, effectively an

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.560
expression of this thing called jobs to be done theory.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.120
And it's unclear if like he came up with it or some of his colleagues, but

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.920
everyone, there are a bunch of places you can find with people claiming to have

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.480
come up with this jobs to be done theory.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.840
The idea is if you, if you like zoom out and you look at your product, you ask

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.920
yourself, why are people hiring your product?

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.120
Like imagine every product in your life is effectively an employee, you know,

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.800
you're CEO of your life and you hire products to be employees effectively.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.480
They all have roles and jobs, right?

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.280
Why are you hiring a product?

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.000
Why do you want that product to perform something in your life?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.480
And what, like, what are the hidden reasons why, uh, you're, you're in

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.440
love with this product.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.520
Instagram was about sharing your life with others visually period.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.240
Right.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.000
Why?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.760
Because you feel connected with them.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.600
You get to show off, you get to feel good and cared about, right.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:45.880
With likes and, um, and it turns out that that will, I think forever

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:51.880
define Instagram and any product that serves that job is going to do very well.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:52.760
Okay.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.640
Stories let's take it as an example is very much serving that job.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.960
In fact, it serves it better than the original product because when you're

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
large and have an enormous audience, you're worried about people seeing your stuff

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.640
or you're worried about being permanent so that a college admissions person is

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.440
going to see your photo of you doing something.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.400
So it turns out that that is a more efficient way of, of performing that job

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.800
than the original product was the original product still has its value.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.880
Um, but at scale, these two things together work really, really well.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.240
Now I will claim that other parts of the product over time didn't

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.720
perform that job as well.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.480
I think IGTV probably didn't.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.080
Right.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.720
Shopping is like completely unrelated to what I just described, but it might work.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.200
I don't know.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:41.600
Right.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.840
Um, products, I think products that succeed are products that all share

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.000
this parent node of like this job to be done that is in common.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.960
And then they're just like different ways of doing it.

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:54.800
Right.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.600
Apple, I think does a great job with this, right?

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.600
It's like managing your digital life and all the products just work together.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.600
They sink.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.800
They like it's beautiful.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.320
Right.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.240
Even if they require like silly specific cords to work, but they're all part of a

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.680
system, it's when you leave that system and you start doing something weird that

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.240
people start scratching their head.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.240
And I think you are less successful.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.960
So I think one of the challenges Facebook has had throughout its life is that it

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.400
has never fully, I think, appreciated the job to be done of the main product.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.400
And what it's done is said, Ooh, there's a shiny object over there.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.760
That starts getting some traction.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.000
Let's go copy that thing.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.480
And then they're confused why it doesn't work.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.920
Like, why doesn't it work?

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.240
It's because the people who show up for this don't want that.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.320
It's different.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.280
What's the purpose of Facebook?

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.800
So I remember I was a very early Facebook user.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:53.520
I was the reason I was personally excited about Facebook is because you can, first of

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.920
all, use your real name.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.080
Like I can exist in this world.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.560
It could be like formally exist.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.760
There's I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:11.280
But I wanted to also exist not anonymously so that that can connect with other friends

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.360
of mine, not anonymously.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.040
And there's a reliable way to know that I'm real and they're real and that we're

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.440
connecting. And it's kind of like I liked it for the for the reasons that people like

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:31.040
LinkedIn, I guess, but like without the form, like not everybody is dressed up and

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.840
being super polite, like more like with friends.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.080
But then it became something much bigger than that, I suppose.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:38.960
There's a feed.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.920
It became this.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:51.360
I mean, it became a place to get to discover content, to share content that's not just

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.760
about connecting directly with friends.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.800
I mean, it became something else.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.280
I don't even know what it is, really.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.400
So you said Instagram is a place where you visually share your life.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.040
What is Facebook?

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.920
Well, let's go back to the founding of Facebook and why it worked really well initially at

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.320
Harvard and then Dartmouth and Stanford.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.000
And I can't remember, probably MIT.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.880
There were like a handful of schools in that first tranche, right?

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:23.320
It worked because there are communities that exist in the world that want to transact.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.680
And when I say transact, I don't mean commercially, I just mean they want to share, they

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.400
want to coordinate, they want to communicate, they want a space for themselves.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:36.080
And Facebook at its best, I think, is that.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.040
And if actually you look at the most popular products that Facebook has built over time, if

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.600
you look at things like groups, marketplace, groups is enormous.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:51.800
And groups is effectively like everyone can found their own little Stanford or Dartmouth

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.720
or MIT, right?

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:59.320
And find each other and share and communicate about something that matters deeply to them.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.840
That is the core of what Facebook was built around.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.000
And I think today is where it stands most, most strongly.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:09.800
Yeah, it's brilliant.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.600
The groups, I wish, I wish groups were done better.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.560
It feels like it's not a first class citizen.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.560
I know I may be saying something without much knowledge, but it feels like it's it's kind

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.120
of bolted on while being used a lot.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.000
It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure in terms of discovery, in

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.600
terms of like, I mean, look at Reddit, like Reddit is basically groups of public and open

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.640
and a little bit crazy, right?

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.320
In a good way.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.840
But there's clear product market fit for that specific use case.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.360
And it doesn't have to be a college.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.080
It can be anything.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.480
It can be a small group, a big group.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.600
It can be group messaging.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.840
Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:32:00.040
I think when there are other companies that just seem exciting and now all of a sudden

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:04.840
the product shifts in some fundamental way to go try to compete with that other thing,

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.000
that's when I think consumers get confused.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.240
Even if you can be successful, like even if you can compete with that other company, even

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.720
if you can figure out how to bolt it on, eventually you come back and you look at the

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.520
app and you're like, I just don't know why I opened this app.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.160
Like, why, like too many things going on.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.560
And that was always a worry.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.560
I mean, you listed all the things that Instagram and that almost gave me a heart attack.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:30.880
Like way too many things, but I don't know.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.840
Entrepreneurs get bored.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.880
They want to add things.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.800
They want to like, right.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.160
I don't have a good answer for it, except for that.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.080
I think being true to your original use case and not even original use case, but sorry,

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.160
actually not use case, original job.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.640
There are many use cases under that job.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.280
Being true to that and like being really good at it over time and morphing as needs

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.480
change, I think that's how to make a company last forever.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:06.440
And I mean, honestly, I like my main thesis about why Facebook is in the position it is

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:15.280
today is if they have had a series of product launches that delighted people over time,

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.920
I think they'd be in a totally different world.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.400
So just like imagine for a moment.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.600
And by the way, Apple's entering this, but like Apple for so long, just like product

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.560
after product, you couldn't wait for it.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.880
You were stood in line for it.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.680
You talked about it.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:29.360
You got excited.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.760
Amazon makes your life so easy.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.160
It's like, wow, I needed this thing and it showed up at my door two days later.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.200
And like both of these companies, by the way, Amazon, Apple have issues, right?

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.360
There are labor issues, whether it's here in the U S or in China.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.360
There are environmental issues.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.200
There are, but like when's the last time you heard like a large chorus being like

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.480
these companies better pay for what they're doing on these things, right?

01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.400
I think Facebook's main issue today is like, uh, you need to produce a hit.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.320
If you don't produce hits, it's really hard to keep consumers on your side.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.640
Then people just start picking on you for a variety of reasons, whether it's right

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.320
or wrong, I'm not even going to place a judgment right here and right now.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.280
I'm just going to say that it is way better to be in a world where you're

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:22.680
producing hits and consumers love what you're doing because then they're on your

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.080
side.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.480
And I think that's it's the past 10 years for Facebook has been fairly

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.600
hard on this dimension.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.040
So, and by hits, it doesn't necessarily mean financial hits.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.400
It feels like to me, what you're saying is something that brings a joy, a

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.960
product that brings joy to some fraction of the population.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:40.320
Yeah.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:47.160
I mean, TikTok isn't just literally an algorithm in some ways, TikTok's

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:53.600
content, uh, and algorithm have more sway now over the American psyche than

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.880
Facebook's algorithm, right?

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.480
It's visual, it's video, by the way, it's not defined by who you follow.

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.720
It's defined by some magical thing that, by the way, if someone wanted to tweak

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.680
to show you a certain type of content for some reason, they could, right?

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.640
Um, people love it.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.400
So as a CEO, let me ask you a question because leadership matters.

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.880
It's a complicated question.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.280
Why is Mark Zuckerberg distrusted, disliked, and sometimes even hated

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.880
by many people in public?

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:28.480
Right?

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.720
That is a complicated question.

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.000
Um, well, the premise, I'm not sure I agree with the premise.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.480
Um, and I can, I can expand that to include even a more mysterious

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.640
question for me, Bill Gates.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.560
What is the Bill Gates version of the question?

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.760
Do you think people hate Bill Gates?

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.120
No distrust.

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.480
So, uh, takeaway one, it's a checklist.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.520
Uh, there is, I think Mark Zuckerberg's distrust is the primary one, but there's

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.080
also like a, like a dislike, maybe hate is too strong a word, but it's just, if

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:12.600
you look at like the articles that are being written and so on, there's a

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.280
dislike and it makes, it's confusing to me because it's like the public picks

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.920
certain individuals and they, and they attach certain kinds of emotions

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.880
to those individuals.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.280
Yeah.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:29.800
So someone once, uh, just recently said there's a strong case that founder

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.840
led companies have this problem and that a lot of Mark's issues, um, come today

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:41.520
come from the fact that he is a visible founder with this story that people have

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.200
watched in both a movie and they followed along and he's this boy wonder

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.600
kid who became one of the world's richest people and, and he's no longer

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.000
marked the person he's marked this, this image of, of a person with enormous

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.200
wealth and power and in today's world, we, we have issues with enormous wealth

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.240
and power for a variety of reasons.

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.560
One of which is we've been stuck inside, you know, for a year and a half, two

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.720
years, uh, one of which is a lot of people were really unhappy about not the last

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.440
election, but the last, last election.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.200
And where do you take out that anger?

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.240
Who do you blame?

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:22.360
But the people in charge, that's one example or one reason why I think, um, a

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:29.520
lot of people, uh, express anger or resentment or unhappiness with, with Mark

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.600
at the same time, I don't know.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.000
I pointed out to that person.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.360
I was like, well, I don't know.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.920
Like I think a lot of people really like Ilan, like Ilan arguably, like he kept his,

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.640
you know, factory open here throughout COVID protocols, which arguably a lot of

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.720
people would be against, um,

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.720
while saying a bunch of, uh, crazy offensive things on the internet, they

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:57.080
still like, basically, you know, gives the middle finger to the SEC, like on

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.040
Twitter and like, I don't know.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.240
I'm like, well, there's a founder and like people kind of like him.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.720
So I do think that the, so like the, the founder and slash CEO of a company

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.640
that's a social network company is like an extra level of difficulty.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.160
If, if life is a video game, you just chose the harder video game.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.080
So, I mean, that's why it's interesting to ask you because you were the founder

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.760
and CEO of a social network, right?

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.320
I challenge it because exactly.

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:33.800
So, but you're one of the rare examples, even Jack Dorsey's this light, not to

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:38.640
the degree, but it just seems harder when you're running a social media company.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.480
It's interesting.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.760
I never thought of Jack as just like, I think generally he's well respected.

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.360
Um,

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:45.840
Yeah, I think so.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.000
I think you're right.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.880
But like, he's, but he's not loved.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:50.840
Yeah.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.600
And I feel like you, I mean, to me, Twitter is an incredible thing.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.120
Yeah.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.320
And again, can I just come back to this point, which seems over simplistic, but

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:05.920
like, I really do think how a product makes someone feel, they ascribe that

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.560
feeling to the founder, uh, so, so make people feel good.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.800
So think about it like, let's just go with this thesis for a sec.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.040
Sure.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:15.840
I like it though.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.440
Um, Amazon's pretty utilitarian, right?

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.440
It delivers brown boxes to your front door.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:21.960
Sure.

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.960
You can have Alexa and you can have all these things, right?

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.360
But in general, it delivers stuff quickly to you at a reasonable price, right?

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.200
I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully wealthy, thoughtful, smart guy, right?

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.720
But like people kind of feel that way about them.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.200
They're like, wow, this is really big.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.000
We're impressed that this is really big.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.720
But they, he's doing the same space stuff Elon's doing, but they don't necessarily

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.000
ascribe the same sense of wonder, right?

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:50.840
Um, now let's take Elon.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.760
Uh, and again, this is pet theory.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.080
I don't have much proof other than my own intuition.

01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.960
Um, he is literally about living the future, Mars space.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:01.880
It's about wonder.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.120
It's about going back to that feeling as a kid, when you looked up to the stars

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.080
and asked, is there life out there?

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.640
People get behind that because it's a sense of hope and excitement and, and,

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.640
and innovation and like, you can say whatever you want, but we, we ascribe

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.160
that emotion to that person.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.000
Now, let's say you're on a social network and people make you kind of angry

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.120
because they disagree with you or they say something ridiculous or they're

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.080
living a FOMO type life where you're like, wow, I wish I was doing that thing.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.640
I think Instagram, if I were to think back by and large, when I was there,

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:40.680
was not about FOMO was not about this influencer economy, although it certainly

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.760
became that way closer to the end, it was about the sense of wonder and happiness

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.200
and beautiful things in the world.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.640
And I don't know.

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.200
I mean, I like, I don't want to have a blind spot, but I don't think anyone

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.360
had a strong opinion about the other for the longest time, the way people explain

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.080
to me, I mean, if you want to go for toxicity, you go to Facebook or Twitter.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.600
If you want to go to make feel good about life, you go to Instagram

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.960
to enjoy, celebrate life.

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.800
And my experience been talking to people is they gave me the benefit

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.040
of the doubt because of that.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.560
But if your experience of the product is kind of makes you angry,

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.720
it's where you argue.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.120
I mean, a big part of Jack might be that he wasn't actually the CEO for a very

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.200
long time and only became recently.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.960
So I'm not sure how much of the connection got made.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:29.240
Um, but in general, I mean, if you hate, you know, I'm just thinking about other

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.680
companies that aren't tech companies.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.840
If you hate like what a company is doing or, or it makes you not feel happy.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:36.720
I don't know.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.120
Like people are really angry about Comcast or whatever.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.640
Are they even called Comcast anymore?

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.080
It's like Xfinity or something, right?

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.000
They had to rebrand.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.520
They, they became meta, right?

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.280
Um, it's like, but my point is if it makes you, that's beautiful.

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:49.640
Yeah.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.840
But the thing is, this is me saying this.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.040
I think your thesis is very strong and correct has elements of correctness,

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.400
but I still personally put some blame on individuals.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.120
Of course.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.920
I think, uh, you said, Elon looking up, there's something about childlike

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.800
wander to him, like to, to his personality, his character, something

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.040
about, I think more so than others where people can trust them.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.880
And there's, uh, I don't know, son of a child is an example of somebody

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.960
who's like, there's some kind of, it's, it's hard to put into words, but there's

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:36.560
something about the human being where he's trustworthy is he's human in a way

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.720
that connects to us and the same with, uh, Saja Nadella.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:47.360
I mean, some of these folks, um, something about us is drawn to them,

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.200
even when they're flawed, even like, um, so like your thesis really holds up for

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.080
Steve jobs because I think people didn't like Steve jobs, but like he delivered

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.840
products that, and then they fell in love every time, um, I guess you could

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.080
say that the CEO, the leader is also a product and if they keep delivering a

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.040
product that people like by being in public and saying things that people

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.720
like, that's also a way to make people happy, but from a social network

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:21.000
perspective, it makes me wonder how difficult it is to explain to people why

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000
certain things happen, like to explain machine learning, to explain why certain,

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:35.400
uh, the, the woke mob effect happens or the certain kinds of like bullying

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:41.440
happens, which is like it's human nature combined with algorithm and it's very

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.160
difficult to control for how the spread of quote unquote misinformation happens.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.400
It's very difficult to control for that.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.520
And so you try to decelerate certain parts and you create more problems than

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.960
you solve and anything that looks at all like censorship can create huge amounts

01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.520
of problems as the slippery slope.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.120
And then you have to inject humans to oversee the machine learning algorithms.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.160
And anytime you inject humans into the system, it's going to create a huge

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:06.960
number of problems.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.800
And I feel like it's up to the leader to communicate that effectively, to be

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.120
transparent, uh, first of all, design products that don't have those problems.

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.520
And second of all, when they have those problems to be able to communicate with

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.360
them, I guess that's all going to, when you run a social network company, your

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.240
job is hard.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:25.440
Yeah.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:29.560
I will say the one element that you haven't named that I think you're getting

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:35.400
at is just bedside manner, which Steve jobs, I never worked for him.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.800
I never met him in person.

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:43.520
Um, had an, like an uncanny ability in public to have bedside manner.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.960
I mean, some of the best clips of Steve jobs from like, I would say maybe the

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.880
eighties when he's on these stage and getting questions from the audience about

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.720
life or, and he'll take this question that is like, how are you going to compete

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.400
with blah and it's super boring.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.960
And I don't even know the name of the company.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.800
And his answer is, is if you just asked like your grandfather, the meaning of

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.440
life, and you sit there and you're just like, what?

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.560
Like, and there's that bedside manner.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:17.520
Um, and if you lack that, or if that's just not intuitive to you, uh, I think

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.600
that it can be a lot harder to gain the trust of people and then add on top of

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.560
that, missteps of companies, right?

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.080
It's, I don't know if you have any friends from the past where like, maybe

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.320
they crossed you once or like, maybe you get back together and your friends again,

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.760
but you just never really forget that thing.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.440
It's human nature not to forget.

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:39.600
I'm Russian.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.520
You crossed me once.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.880
We solved the problem.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:48.840
So my point is it, there's humans don't forget.

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:51.720
And if there are times in the past where they feel like they don't trust the

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.960
company or the company hasn't had their back, that is really hard to earn back,

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.160
especially if you don't have that bedside manner.

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.160
Um, and again, like I'm not attributing this specifically to Mark, because I

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:10.000
think a lot of companies have this issue where one, you have to be trustworthy

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.520
as a company and live by it and live by those actions.

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:17.040
And then two, I think you need to be able to be really relatable in a way that's

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.280
very difficult if you're worth like what these people are, it's really hard.

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:22.360
Yeah.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.520
Jack does a pretty good job of this by being a monk.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.480
Like Jack issues attention.

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.000
Like he's not out there almost on purpose.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.960
He's just working hard, doing square.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.320
And right.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.000
Like I literally shared a desk like this with him at Odeo.

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.880
I mean, just normal guy who likes painting.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:45.080
I like, I remember he would leave early on like Wednesdays or something to

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.520
go to like a painting class and he's creative.

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.320
He's thoughtful.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.280
I mean, money makes people like more creative and more thoughtful, like

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.760
extreme versions of themselves.

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.000
Right.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.440
Um, and this was a long, long time ago.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:02.000
Uh, you mentioned that he, uh, he asked you to do some kind of JavaScript thing.

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.400
We were working on some JavaScript together.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.160
I like, that's hilarious.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.880
Like pre Twitter, early Twitter days, you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:15.560
talking about JavaScript, solving some kind of menial problem, terrible problems.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:15.840
Yeah.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.400
I mean, not terrible, just like boring, boring widget problem.

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:21.000
I think it was the audio widget we were working on at the time.

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.760
I'm surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.440
Cause I didn't really provide any value.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.400
I'm very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.160
Uh, it was very helpful.

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.480
So thank you for listening.

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.520
I mean, is there, um, the audio that's a precursor to Twitter?

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.560
First of all, did you have any anticipation that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.440
ahead of a major social network?

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.280
And, um, second, did you learn anything from the guy that like the, do you think

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.640
it's a coincidence that you two were in the room together and it's the coincidence

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.440
meaning like, why does the world play its game in a certain way where these two

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.000
founders of social networks?

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:04.600
I don't know.

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.720
It's so weird, right?

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:12.640
Like, I mean, it's also weird that Mark showed up, you know, in our fraternity,

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.000
my sophomore year, and we got to know each other then like long before Instagram.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:23.440
It's, it's a small world, but let me tell a fun story about Jack.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.160
Um, we're at audio and I don't know.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.800
I think Ev was feeling like people weren't working hard enough for something.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:38.280
And I can't remember exactly what he, he created this thing where every Friday.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.360
I don't know if it was every Friday.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:45.560
I only remember this happening once, but he had us like a, a statuette.

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.680
It's like a Mary and in the bottom it's, it's hollow, right?

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:57.480
And I remember on a Friday, he decided he was going to let everyone vote for who

01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.880
had worked the hardest that week.

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.080
We all voted.

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.320
Closed ballot, right?

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.000
We all put it in a bucket and he tallied the votes.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.160
And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall, got the statuette and in

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.800
the statue, it was a thousand bucks.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.280
Whereas I recall there was a thousand bucks now.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.160
It might've been a hundred bucks, but let's call it a thousand.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:16.960
It's more exciting that way.

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.840
It felt like a thousand.

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.320
It did to me for sure.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.480
I actually got two votes.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.160
I was very happy.

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:24.040
We were a small company, but I, as the intern, I got at least two votes.

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.160
So everybody knew how many votes they got individually.

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:26.600
Yeah.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:27.000
Yeah.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
And I think it was one of these self accountability things.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.960
Anyway, I remember Jack just getting like the vast majority of votes from everyone.

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.080
And I remember just thinking like, like, I couldn't imagine he would become what

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.720
he'd become and do what he would do.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:47.920
But I had a profound respect that the new guy who I really liked worked that

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.120
hard and you could see his dedication even then, and that people respected him.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:56.280
But that's the one story that I remember of him, like working with

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.840
him specifically from that summer.

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.440
Can take a small tangent on that.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:49:59.800
Of course.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.480
There's kind of a pushback in Silicon Valley, a little bit against hard work.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.840
Can you speak to the sort of the thing you admired to see the

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.000
new guy working so hard, that thing?

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.440
What is the value of that thing in a company?

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.640
See, this is like, just to be very frank, it drives me nuts.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.560
Like I saw this really funny video on TikTok.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.640
What's it on TikTok?

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.960
It was like, I'm taking a break from my mental health to work on my career.

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:26.920
Thought that was funny.

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.840
So it's like, oh, it is kind of phrased that way, the opposite often, right?

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:33.760
Okay.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.680
So a couple of things.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:43.640
I, I have worked so hard to do the things that I did.

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:49.080
Like Mike and I lost years off of our lives, staying up late, figuring things

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.680
out, the stress that comes with the job.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.080
I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then.

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:59.360
It requires an enormous amount of work and most people aren't successful, right?

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.400
But even the ones that do don't skate by.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.320
I am okay if people choose not to work hard because I don't actually think

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.840
there's anything in this world that says you have to work hard, but I do think

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.800
that great things require a lot of hard work, so there's no way you can expect to

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.640
change the world without working really hard.

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.960
And by the way, even changing the world, you know, the folks that I respect the

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:29.320
most have nudged the world in like a slight direction, slight, very, very slight.

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:35.200
Like even if Elon accomplishes all the things he wants to accomplish, we will

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.080
have nudged the world in a slight direction, but it requires an enormous amount.

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.960
There was an interview with him where he was just like, he was interviewed, I

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.480
think at the Tesla factory and he was like, work is really hard.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.800
This is actually unhealthy.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.720
And I can't recall the exact, but he was like visibly shaken about how hard he had

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.280
been working and he was like, this is bad.

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:58.880
And unfortunately, I think to have great outcomes, you actually do need to work

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.600
at like three standard deviations above the mean, but there's nothing saying

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:03.960
that people have to go for that.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.560
See, the thing is, but what I would argue, this is my personal opinion is nobody

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.840
has to do anything first of all, they certainly don't have to work hard, but I

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:22.720
think hard work in a company should be admired and you should not feel like.

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:28.440
You shouldn't feel good about yourself for not working hard.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.120
Like it's just, so for example, I don't have to work out.

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.880
I don't have to run.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:38.880
I hate running, but like, I certainly don't feel good if I don't run because

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:42.000
I know for my health, like there's certain values, I guess, is what I'm

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.520
trying to get at the certain values that you have in life.

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:47.320
It feels like there's certain values that companies should have and hard

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:51.360
work is one of the things I think that should be admired.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:56.120
I often ask this kind of silly question, uh, just, just to get a sense of people

01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:00.600
when that, like if I'm hiring and so on, and just ask if they, uh, think it's

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.440
better to work hard or work smart.

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:06.560
It was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that.

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:07.360
Good.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.680
Cause you think like the right both was that the answers, both the answers both.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.120
I usually try not to give them that, but I sometimes I'll say

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.600
both if that's an option.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:21.680
But a lot of people kind of a surprising number will say work smart.

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.640
And there are usually people who don't know how to work smart.

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:30.800
And, uh, they're, they're literally just lazy and not just, there's two,

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:36.240
there's two effects behind that is one is laziness and the other is ego.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.000
When you're younger and you say it's better to work smart, it means you

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.280
think you know what it means to work smart at this early stage.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.720
To me, people that say work hard or both, they have the humility to understand.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.520
Like I'm going to have to work my ass off because I'm too dumb to

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.840
know how to work smart and people who are self critical in this way.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:03.080
In some small amount, you have to have some confidence, but you have, if you

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:06.560
have humility, that means you're going to actually eventually figure out what

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.640
it means to work smart and then to actually be successful, you should do both.

01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:15.320
So I have a very particular take on this, which is that, um,

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:21.680
no one's forcing you to do anything, all choices of consequences.

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:27.960
So if you major in, I don't know, theoretical literature, I don't

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.840
even know if that's a major, I'm just making something up.

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.400
That's supposed to regular literature.

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.440
I like applied literature.

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:39.360
Think about like, like theoretical Spanish lit from the 14th century.

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.320
Like just make, make up your esoteric thing.

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.040
And then the number of people I went to Stanford with who get out in the world

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.280
and they're like, wait, what, I can't find a job.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.680
Like no one wants a theoretical, like there are plenty of counter examples

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:54.840
of people have majored in esoteric things and gone on to be very successful.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:55.800
So I just want to be clear.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.720
It's not about the major, but every choice you make, whether it's to

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:02.800
have kids, like I love my children.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.680
It's so awesome to have two kids and it is so hard to work really

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.080
hard and also have kids is really hard.

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:13.240
And there's a reason why certain very successful people like don't

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.440
have, are not successful, but people who run very, very large companies of

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:20.080
startups have chosen not to have kids for a while or chosen not to like

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.600
prioritize them, everything's a choice.

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.800
And like, I choose to prioritize my children because I want to do that.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.360
Right.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.240
So everything's a choice.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.760
Now, once you've made that choice, I think it's important that the

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.760
contract is clear, which is to say, let's imagine you were joining a new startup.

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.440
It's important that that startup communicate that, like the expectation

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.400
is like, we're all working really, really hard right now.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.680
You don't have to join the startup, but like, if you do just know, like

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:55.240
it's almost as if you join, I don't know, pick your, uh, pick your,

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.920
pick your like sports team.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.040
Like, let's go back to the Yankees for a second.

01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:02.600
You want to join the Yankees, but you don't really want to work that hard.

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:05.560
You don't really want to do batting practice or pitching practice or

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.560
whatever for your position.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:06.880
Right.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.400
That to me is wacko.

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.160
And that's actually the world that it feels like we live in in tech sometimes

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.880
where people both want to work for the Yankees because that pays a lot, but

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.280
like, don't actually want to work that hard that I don't fully understand.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.200
Because if you sign up for some of these things, just sign up for it, but

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.880
it's okay if you don't want to sign up for it.

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:31.040
There's so many wonderful careers in this world that don't require 80 hours a week.

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.000
But when I read about companies going to like four day work weeks and stuff, I just

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.240
like, I chuckle because I can't get enough done with a seven day week.

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.320
I don't know how, and people will say, oh, you're just not working smart.

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:43.080
And it's like, no, I work pretty smart.

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.600
I think in general, like I wouldn't have gotten to this point if I hadn't like

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.240
some amount of working smart and there is balance though.

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.240
So I used to be like a pretty big cyclist.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.040
I don't do it much anymore just because of kids and like prioritizing other things.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:56.280
Right.

01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:01.720
But one of the most important things to learn as a cyclist is to be able to

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.560
take a rest day.

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:08.240
But to me and to cyclists, like resting is a function of optimizing for the long

01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:12.160
run, it's not like a thing that you do for its own merits.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:15.760
It's actually like, if you don't rest, your muscles don't recover and then

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:18.240
you're just not as like, you're not training as efficiently.

01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.200
You should probably the successful people I've known in terms of athletes,

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.600
they hate rest days, but they know they have to do it for the long term.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.000
They, they think their opposition is getting stronger and stronger.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.640
And that's the feeling, but you know, it's the right thing and usually

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.840
you need a coach to help you.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.120
Yeah, totally.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:38.200
So, I mean, I use this thing called training peaks and it's interesting

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.400
because it actually mathematically shows like where you are on the

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.720
curve and all this stuff, but you have to, like, you have to have that rest,

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:48.680
but it's a function of going harder for longer.

01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:52.600
Again, it's this reinforcement learning, like planning the aggregate and along,

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.040
but a lot of people will hide behind laziness by saying that they're not

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.760
trying to optimize for the long run and they're not, they're just not working

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.400
very hard, but again, you don't have to sign up for it.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.080
It's totally cool.

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.280
Like, I don't think less of people for like not working super hard.

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:08.160
It's just like, don't sign up for things that require working super hard.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.480
And some of that requires for the leadership to have the guts, the

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:14.120
boldness to communicate effectively at the very beginning.

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.200
I mean, sometimes I think most of the problems arise in the fact that the

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.200
leadership is kind of hesitant to, to communicate the things that they're

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:31.240
hesitant to, to communicate this, the socially difficult truth of what it

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.520
takes to be at this company.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.480
And so they kind of say, Hey, come, come with us.

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.560
There's we have snacks, you know, but unlimited vacation.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.840
And, you know, Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating because, you know,

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:48.720
people it's been called like a cult on the outside or cult ish.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:52.760
And, but what's fascinating is like, they just don't give on their principles.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.160
They're like, listen, this is what it's like to work here.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.680
We record every meeting.

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.680
We're like brutally honest and that's not going to feel right to everyone.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.000
And if it doesn't feel right to you, totally cool.

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.600
Let's just go work somewhere else.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:07.200
But if you work here, you are signing up for this.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.920
And that's, that's been fascinating to me because it's honesty upfront.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.680
It's a system in which you operate.

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.480
And if it's not for you, like no one's forcing you to work there.

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:19.040
Right.

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.440
I actually did.

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:25.160
So I did a conversation with him at, uh, kind of got stuck in a funny moment,

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:29.000
which is, uh, uh, at the end, I asked them, you know, to give me honest

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.760
feedback of how I did on the interview.

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:34.480
And, um, I was, I don't think so.

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.680
He was super nice.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.280
He asked me, he's like, well, tell me, did you accomplish what

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.640
you were hoping to accomplish?

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.240
I was like, that's not, that's not, I'm asking you as an objective

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.600
observer of two people talking, how do we do today?

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.960
And then he's like, well, I'm, he gave me this politician.

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:57.800
He asked, well, I feel like we've accomplished successful

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:02.200
communication of like ideas, which is, I'd like, I'd love to spread some of

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:06.480
the ideas in that, uh, like in principles and so on.

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.120
Back to my original point, it's really hard to get even for Ray Dalio.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:13.360
It's really hard to give feedback.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:17.840
And one of the other things I learned from him and, and just people in that

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:24.920
world is like, man, humans really like to pretend like they've come to, uh, that

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.120
they've come to some kind of meeting of the minds, like if there's conflict, if

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.400
you and I have conflict, it's always better to meet face to face, right?

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.240
Or on the phone, Slack is not great, right?

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.880
Email's not great, but face to face.

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:41.240
What's crazy is you and I get together and we actively try to, even if we're

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.440
not actually solving the conflict, we actively try to paper over the conflict.

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:46.560
Oh yeah.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.600
It didn't really bother, bother me that much.

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:48.960
Oh yeah.

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.160
I'm sure you didn't mean it.

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:53.360
I'm sure, but like, no, in our minds, we're still there.

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:53.600
Yeah.

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:58.200
Um, so this is one of the things that as a leader, you always have to be digging,

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.400
especially as you would say straight to the conflict, as you ascend, no one

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.600
wants to tell you you're crazy.

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.080
No one wants to tell you your, your idea is bad and you can, you're like, oh,

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.200
I'm going to be a leader.

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.040
And the idea is, well, I'm just going to ask people, no one tells you.

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:18.240
So like, you have to look for the markers knowing that literally just people

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:21.280
aren't going to tell you along the way and be paranoid.

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.960
I mean, you asked about selling, you know, the company.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.600
I think one of the biggest differences between me and a lot of other

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.240
entrepreneurs is like, I wasn't completely confident we could do it.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.560
Like we could be alone and, and, and, and actually be great.

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.840
And if any entrepreneur is honest with you, they also feel that way.

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.160
But a lot of people are like, well, I have to be cocky and just say,

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:43.640
I can do this on my own.

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:44.840
I w we're going to be fine.

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.160
We're going to crush everyone.

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.200
Some people do say that and then it's not right.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.400
And they, and they fail, but, um,

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:57.120
Being honest in that moment with yourself, with those close to you.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.120
And also, uh, you talked about the personality of leaders and,

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.800
and who resonates and who doesn't.

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:08.480
It's rare that I see, uh, leaders be vulnerable, rare.

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.720
And one thing I tried to do at Instagram, at least internally was like,

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.400
say when I screwed up and like point out how I was wrong about things

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.320
and point out where my judgment was off.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.320
Everyone thinks they have to bat a thousand, right?

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.920
Like that's crazy.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:30.360
The best quant hedge funds in the world, bat 50.001%.

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.920
They just take a lot of it.

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:32.440
Right.

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:35.880
Renaissance, they might, they might bat 51%.

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:36.240
Right.

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.720
But holy hell, like the question isn't, are you right every single time?

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.200
And do you have to seem invincible?

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.640
The question is how many at bats do you get?

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.200
And on average, are you, are you better on average?

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:51.760
Right.

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.760
With enough bats and enough at bats that your aggregate can be very high.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.640
I mean, Steve jobs was wrong at a lot of stuff.

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:02.280
The Newton too early, right next, not quite right.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:06.840
Um, there was even a time where he said like, no one will ever want to watch

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:13.680
video on the iPod, totally wrong, but who cares if you come around and

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:17.480
realize your mistake and fix it, it becomes just like you said, harder and

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:20.680
harder when your ego grows and the number of people around you that say

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.040
positive things towards you grows.

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:27.440
And I actually think it's really valuable that like, let's say, you

02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:33.000
and a counterfactual where Instagram became worth like $300 billion or

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:33.680
something crazy, right.

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.640
I kind of liked that my life is relatively normal.

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.680
Now, when I say relatively, you get what I mean.

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.000
I'm not making a claim that I live a normal life, but like, I certainly

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.480
don't live in a world where there are like 15 Sherpas following me, like

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:50.400
fetching me water or whatever, like that's not how it works.

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:51.360
I actually like that.

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:56.360
I have a sense of humility of like, I may not find myself that way, but

02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:00.360
I may not found another thing that's nearly as big, so I have to work twice as hard.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.160
Or I have to learn twice as much. We haven't talked about machine learning yet,

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:14.840
but my favorite thing is all these famous tech guys who have worked in the industry

02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.360
pontificating about the future of machine learning and how it's going to kill us all.

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.280
And I'm pretty sure they've never tried to build anything with machine learning themselves.

02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:30.040
Yes. So there's a nice line between people that actually build stuff with machine like

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.280
actually program something or at least understand some of those fundamentals and the people that

02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:40.680
are just saying philosophical stuff for journalists and so on. It's an interesting line to walk

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:45.720
because the people who program are often not philosophers. Or don't have the attention.

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:48.680
They can't write an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. It doesn't work.

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:52.680
It's nice to be both a little bit, to have elements of both.

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.960
My point is the fact that I have to learn stuff from scratch or that I choose to or like-

02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:58.520
It's humbling.

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:06.840
Yeah. I mean, again, I have a lot of advantages, but my point is it's awesome to be

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.760
back in a game where you have to fight. That's fun. So being humble, being vulnerable,

02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.480
it's an important aspect of a leader and I hope it serves me well, but like

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:23.080
I can't fast forward 10 years to now. That's my game plan.

02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:27.000
Before I forget, I have to ask you one last thing on Instagram.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.640
What do you think about the whistleblower, Francis Haugen, recently coming out and saying

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:41.720
that Facebook is aware of Instagram's harmful effect on teenage girls as per their own internal

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:45.960
research studies and the matter? What do you think about this baby of yours,

02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:51.720
Instagram, being under fire now as we've been talking about under the leadership of Facebook?

02:05:54.360 --> 02:06:04.280
I often question where does the blame lie? Is the blame at the people that originated the network

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:13.160
me? Is the blame at the decision to combine the network with another network with a certain set

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:22.360
of values? Is the blame at how it gets run after I left? Is it the driver or is it the car?

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:30.360
Is it that someone enabled these devices in the first place if you go to an extreme?

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:37.640
Or is it the users themselves, just human nature? Is it just the way of human nature?

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:42.120
Sure. The idea that we're going to find a mutually exclusive answer here is crazy. There's

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.080
not one place. It's a combination of a lot of these things. Then the question is, is it true

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:54.440
at all? I'm not actually saying that's not true or that it's true, but there's always more nuance

02:06:54.440 --> 02:07:01.320
here. Do I believe that social media has an effect on young people? Well, it's got to. They use it

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:05.640
a lot. I bet you there are a lot of positive effects and I bet you there are negative effects,

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:11.480
just like any technology. Where I've come to in my thinking on this is that I think

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:16.120
any technology has negative side effects. The question is, as a leader, what do you do about

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:19.800
them? Are you actively working on them or do you just not really believe in them?

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:24.040
If you're a leader that sits there and says, well, we're going to put an enormous amount of

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:30.120
resources against this, we're going to acknowledge when there are true criticisms, we're going to be

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.440
vulnerable and that we're not perfect and we're going to go fix them and we're going to be held

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:39.640
accountable along the way. I think that people generally really respect that,

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:46.040
but I think that where Facebook I think has had issues in the past is where they say things like,

02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:50.200
I can't remember what Mark said about misinformation during the election. There was

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:54.920
that famous quote where he was like, it's pretty crazy to think that Facebook had anything to do

02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:58.680
with this election. That was something like that quote and I don't remember what stage he was on.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:07.800
And yeah, but that did not age well. You have to be willing to say, well, maybe there's something

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:13.720
there and wow, I want to go look into it and truly believe it in your gut. But if people look at you

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:19.400
and how you act and what you say and don't believe you truly feel that way. It's not just the words

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:24.120
you say, but how you say them and that people believe that you actually feel the pain of having

02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:31.320
caused any suffering. So to me, it's much more about your actions and your posture post-event

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:37.320
than it is about debugging the why. Because I don't know this research. It was written well

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:44.040
after I left. Is it the algorithm? Is it the explorer page? Is it the people you might know

02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:52.280
unit connecting you to ideas that are dangerous? I really don't know. So we'd have to have a much

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:58.520
deeper, I think dive to understand where the blame lies. What's very unpleasant to me to consider.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:05.080
Now, I don't know if this is true, but to consider the very fact that there might be some complicated

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:12.600
games being played here. For example, as somebody, I really love psychology and I love it enough to

02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:16.760
know that the field is pretty broken in the following way. It's very difficult to study

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:23.720
human beings well at scale because the questions you ask affect the results. You can basically get

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:29.000
any results you want. And so you have an internal Facebook study that asks some question of which

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.880
we don't know the full details and there's some kind of analysis, but that's just the one little

02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:40.840
tiny slice into some much bigger picture. And so you can have thousands of employees at Facebook.

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:47.000
One of them comes out and picks whatever narrative knowing that they become famous couple with the

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.080
other really uncomfortable thing I see in the world, which is journalists seem to understand

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.360
they get a lot of click bait attention from saying something negative about social networks.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:05.240
Certain companies, like they even get some, some click bait stuff about Tesla or about,

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.920
especially when it's like when there's a public famous CEO type of person,

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:15.880
if they get a lot of views on the negative, not the positive, the positive, they'll get,

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:20.040
I mean, it actually goes to the thing you were saying before, if there's a hot sexy new product

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:26.200
that's great to look forward to, they get positive on that, but absent a product, it's nice to have

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:33.480
like the CEO messing up with some kind of way. And so a couple of that with the whistleblower

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:41.080
and with this whole dynamic of journalism and so on, with social dilemma being really popular

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:48.760
documentary, it's like, all right, my concern is there's deep flaws in human nature here in

02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.920
terms of things we need to deal with, like the nature of hate, of bullying, all those kinds of

02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:02.040
things. And then there's people who are trying to use that potentially to become famous and make

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:08.040
money off of, off of blaming others for causing more of the problem as opposed to helping solve

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.760
the problem. So I don't know what to think. I'm not saying this is like, I'm just uncomfortable

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:18.200
with, I guess, not knowing what to think about any of this because a bunch of folks I know that work

02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.560
at Facebook on the machine learning side, so Yann LeCun, I mean, they, they're quite upset

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:28.200
by what's happening because there's a lot of really brilliant, good people inside Facebook.

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.800
They're trying to do good. And so like all of this press, Yann is one of them. And he has an

02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:38.760
amazing team of the machine learning researchers. Like he's really upset with the fact that people

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:44.280
don't seem to understand that this, this is not, the portrayal does not represent the, the full

02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.120
nature of efforts is going on at Facebook. So I don't know what to think about that.

02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:54.760
Well, you just, I think very helpfully explained the nuance of the situation and why it's so hard

02:11:54.760 --> 02:12:07.160
to understand, but a couple of things. One is, I think I have been surprised at the scale with

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:15.800
which some product manager can do an enormous amount of harm to a very, very large company

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:21.720
by releasing a trove of documents. Like I think I read a couple of them when they got published

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:25.960
and I haven't even spent any time going deep. Part of it's like, I don't really feel like reliving

02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:34.520
a previous life, but wow. Like talk about challenging the idea of open culture and like

02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:41.560
what that does to Facebook internally. If Facebook was built, like I remember like my office,

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:46.920
we had this like no visitors rule around my office because we always had like confidential

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:51.400
stuff up on the walls and everyone was super angry because they're like, that goes against

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:56.120
our culture of transparency and like marks in the fish cube or whatever they call it, the aquarium,

02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:00.600
I think they called it. We're like, literally anyone could see what he was doing at any point.

02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.480
And I don't know. I mean, other companies like Apple have been quiet slash locked down.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:14.680
Snapchat's the same way for a reason. And I don't know what this does to transparency on the inside

02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:20.360
of startups that value that. I think that it's a seminal moment and you can say, well,

02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.240
you should have nothing to hide, right? But to your point, you can pick out documents that show

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:31.240
anything, right? But I don't know. So what happens to transparency inside of startups

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:37.800
and the culture that startups or companies in the future will grow? Like the startup of the future

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:43.000
that becomes the next Facebook, what will it be locked down and what does that do? Right? So that's

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:50.120
part one. Part two. Like I don't think that you could design a more like

02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:57.080
well-orchestrated handful of events from the like 60 minutes to

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.600
releasing the documents in the way that they were released at the right time.

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:09.160
That takes a lot of planning and partnership. And it seems like she has a partner at some firm,

02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:16.200
right? That probably helped a lot with this. But man, at a personal level, if you're her,

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:22.920
you'd have to really believe in what you are doing. Really believe in it because you are

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:29.960
personally putting your ass on the line, right? Like you've got a very large company that doesn't

02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:39.480
like enemies, right? It takes a lot of guts. And I don't love these conspiracy theories about like,

02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:43.560
oh, she's being financed from some person or people. Like I don't love them because that's

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:49.480
like the easy thing to say. I think the Occam's razor here is like someone thought they were

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:57.000
doing something wrong and was like very, very courageous. And I don't know if courageous is

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:03.080
the word, but like, so without getting into like, is she a martyr? Is she courageous? Is she, right?

02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.120
Like let's put that aside for a second. Then there are the documents themselves. They say what they

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:14.440
say. To your point, a lot of the things that like people have been worried about already in the

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:22.360
documents or they're already been said externally. And I don't know. I'm just like, I'm thankful that

02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:28.120
I am focused on new things with my life. Well, let me just say, I just think it's a really hard

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:33.560
problem that probably Facebook and Twitter are trying to solve. I'm actually just fascinated by

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.960
how hard this problem is. There are fundamental issues at Facebook in tone and in an approach

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:47.160
of how product gets built and the objective functions. And since people, organizations are

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.440
not people. So yawn and fair, right? Like there are a lot of really great people who like literally

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:57.880
just want to push reinforcement learning forward. They literally just want to teach a robot to touch,

02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:05.240
feel, lift, right? Like they're not thinking about political misinformation, right? But there's a

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:10.360
strong connection between what funds that research and an enormously profitable machine

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:19.800
that has trade-offs. And one cannot, one cannot separate the two. You are not completely separate

02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:26.520
from the system. So I agree. It can feel really frustrating to feel if you're internally internal

02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:31.000
there, that you're working on something completely unrelated and you feel like your group's good.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I can understand that. But there's some responsibility still. You have to acknowledge,

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.840
it's like the Ray Dalio thing. You have to look in the mirror and see if there's problems and

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:46.600
you have to fix those problems. You've mentioned machine learning reinforcement quite a bit.

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.400
I mean, to me, social networks is one of the exciting places, the recommender systems where

02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.840
machine learning is applied. Where else in the world in the space of possibilities over the next

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:03.080
five, 10, 20 years, do you think we're going to see impact of machine learning? When you try it

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:08.600
on a philosophical level, on a technical level, what do you think? Or when the social networks

02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:17.640
themselves? Well, I think the obvious answers are climate change, right? Like think about

02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:27.400
how much fuel or just waste there is in energy consumption today because we don't plan accordingly

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:32.520
because we take the least efficient route or the logistics and stuff, the supply chain,

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:36.680
all that kind of stuff. Yeah. I mean, listen, if we're going to fight climate change, like

02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:43.160
one really way, one awesome way to do it is figure out how to optimize how we operate as a species

02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:50.360
and minimize the amount of energy we consume to maximize whatever economic impact we want to have

02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:56.200
because right now those two are very much tied together and I don't believe that has to be the

02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:01.240
case. There's this really interesting, you've read it, for people who are listening, there's

02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.280
really interesting paper on reinforcement learning and energy consumption inside buildings. It's like

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:11.480
one of the seminal ones, right? But imagine that at massive scale. That's super interesting. I mean,

02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:17.880
they've done resource planning for servers for peak load using reinforcement learning. I don't

02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.720
know if that was at Google or somewhere else, but like, okay, great. You do it for servers,

02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.680
but what if you could do it for just capacity in general, energy capacity for cities and planning

02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:33.000
for traffic? And of course, there's all the self-driving cars and I don't know. I'm not

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:39.880
going to pontificate like crazy ideas using reinforcement learning or machine learning.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:44.840
It's just so clear to me that humans don't think quickly enough. So it's interesting to think about

02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:51.880
machine learning helping a little bit at scale. So a little bit to a large number of people,

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:57.720
that has a huge impact. So if you optimize, say Google Maps, something like that, trajectory

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.760
planning or what a map quest first. Yeah, getting here, I looked and it was like,

02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:06.360
here's the most energy efficient route. And I was like, I'm going to be late. I need to take the

02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:13.080
fastest route. As opposed to unrolling the map. And that's going to be very inefficient no matter

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:18.920
what. I was definitely the other day, like part of the Epsilon of Epsilon greedy with ways where

02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:24.200
I was sent on like a weird route that I could tell they're like, we just need to collect data of this

02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:31.960
road. Kevin's definitely going to be the guinea pig and great. Now we have-

02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:33.960
Did you at least feel pride?

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:37.720
Oh, going through it, I was like, oh, this is fun. Like now they get data about this weird

02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:41.080
shortcut. And actually I hit all the green lights and it worked. I'm like, this is a problem.

02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:42.600
Bad data.

02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:44.520
Bad data. They're just going to imagine-

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:48.440
I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light just to give them the right kind of

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:53.800
data. But to answer your question, like, I feel like that was fairly unsatisfying and it's easy

02:19:53.800 --> 02:20:00.360
to say climate change. But what I would say is at Instagram, everything we applied machining

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:05.960
learning to got better for users and it got better for the company. And I saw the power.

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:09.880
I didn't fully understand it as an executive. And I think that's actually one of the issues

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:14.840
that- and when I say understand, I mean the mathematics of it. Like I understand what it

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:21.800
does. I understand that it helps. But there are a lot of executives now that talk about it and the

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.400
way that they talk about the internet, or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago,

02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:28.120
they're like, we're going to build mobile. And you're like, what does that mean? They're like,

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:33.320
we're just going to do mobile. And you're like, okay. So my sense is the next generation of

02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:39.000
leaders will have grown up having had classes in reinforcement learning, supervised learning,

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.600
whatever. And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it to their companies and the places it

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:49.640
is needed most. And that's really cool. Cause I mean, talk about efficiency gains.

02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:57.080
That's what excites me the most about it. Yeah. So there's, it's interesting just to get a

02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:01.080
fundamental first principles, understanding of certain concepts of machine learning. So

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:06.440
supervised learning from an executive perspective, supervised learning, you have to have a lot of

02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:12.200
humans label a lot of data. So the question there is, okay, can we gather a large amount of data

02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:17.640
that can be labeled well? And that's the question Tesla asked. Like, can we create a data engine

02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:24.280
that keeps sending an imperfect machine learning system out there? Whenever it fails, it gives us

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:29.320
data back. We label it by human and we send it back and forth. So this way, then there is,

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:35.960
Yann LeCun's excited about the self-supervised learning where you do much less human labeling.

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:42.120
And there's some kind of mechanism for the system to learn it by itself on a human-generated

02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:47.560
data. And then there's the reinforcement learning, which is like basically allowing,

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:55.080
it's applying the alpha zero technology that allow through self-play to learn how to

02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:00.760
solve the game of go and achieve incredible levels at the game of chess.

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:06.760
Can you formulate the problem you're trying to solve in a way that's amenable to reinforcement

02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.720
learning? And can you get the right kind of signal at scale? Cause you need a lot, a lot of signal.

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:18.360
That's kind of fascinating to see which part of a social network can you convert into a reinforcement

02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:24.840
learning problem. The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning, I think, is that we now

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:36.040
have learned to apply neural networks to guess the Q function, basically the values for any

02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:40.840
state in action. And that is fascinating because we used to just like, I don't know,

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:44.280
have like a linear regression, like hope it worked. And that was the fanciest version of it.

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:48.280
But now you look at it, I'm like trying to learn this stuff. And I look at it, I'm like,

02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:52.680
there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways you can try to apply this.

02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:57.400
No one quite agrees like what's the best. Generally, if you're trying to like build

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:04.040
a neural network, they're pretty well-trodden ways of doing that. You use Adam, you use ReLU.

02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:10.040
There's just like general good ideas. And in reinforcement learning, I feel like the consensus

02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:17.320
is like it totally depends. And by the way, it's really hard to get it to converge and it's noisy.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:21.880
So there are all these really interesting ideas around building simulators.

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:30.200
For instance, in self-driving, you don't want to actually have someone get in an accident to

02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:34.840
learn that an accident is bad. So you start simulating accidents, simulating aggressive

02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:40.520
drivers, just simulating crazy dogs that run into the street and wow, fascinating.

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:45.800
My mind starts racing. And then the question is, okay, forget about self-driving cars,

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:52.920
let's talk about social networks. How can you produce a better, more thoughtful experience

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:58.520
using these types of algorithms? And honestly, in talking to some of the people that work at

02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:03.960
Facebook and old Instagrammers, most people are like, yeah, we tried a lot of things,

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:08.200
didn't quite ever make it work. I mean, for the longest time, Facebook ads was effectively

02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:12.920
a logistic regression, okay? I don't know what it is now, but if you look at this paper

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:16.120
that they published back in the day, it was literally just a logistic regression. It made

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:23.320
a lot of money. So even at these extremely large scales, if we are not yet touching what

02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.760
reinforcement learning can truly do, imagine what the next 10 years looks like. How cool is that?

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:32.600
It's amazing. So I really like the use of reinforcement learning as part of the

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:38.280
simulation, for example, like with self-driving cars, it's modeling pedestrians. So the nice

02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:44.200
thing about reinforcement learning, it can be used to learn agents within the world,

02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.960
so they can learn to behave properly. You can teach pedestrians, you don't hard

02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:55.080
code the way they behave, they learn how to behave. In that same way, I do have a hope,

02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:01.000
was it Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations. You talked about meaningful interactions,

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:09.400
I believe, like simulating interactions. So you can learn how to manage that. It's fascinating.

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:15.480
So where most of your algorithm development happens in virtual worlds, and then you can

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.600
really learn how to design the interface, how you design much of aspects of the experience

02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:26.760
in terms of how you select what's shown in the feed, all those kinds of things. It feels like

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:29.960
if you can connect reinforcement learning to that, that's super exciting.

02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:36.680
And I think if you have a company and leadership that believe in doing the right things and can

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:43.160
apply this technology in the right way, some really special stuff can happen. It is mostly likely

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:50.520
going to be a group of people we've never heard about start up from scratch. And you asked if

02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:56.680
new social networks could be built, I've got to imagine they will be. And whoever starts it,

02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:01.160
it might be some kids in a garage that took these classes from these people, you, right?

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:07.080
And they're building all of these things with this tech at the core. So I'm trying not to be

02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:13.560
someone who just throws around reinforcement learning as a buzzword. I truly believe that it

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:19.800
is the most cutting edge in what can happen in social networks. And I also believe it's super

02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:24.760
hard. It's super hard to make it work. It's super hard to do it at scale. It's super hard to find

02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:31.000
people that truly understand it. So I'm not going to say that I think it'll be applied in

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.240
social networks before we have true self-driving. Let me put it that way.

02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.080
We could argue about this for a long time, but yes, I agree with you. I think self-driving is

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:41.080
way harder than people realize. Oh, absolutely.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:45.480
Let me ask you in terms of that kid in the garage or those couple of kids in the garage,

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:50.840
what advice would you give to them if they want to start a new social network or a business? What

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.440
advice would you give to somebody with a big dream and a young startup?

02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:05.880
To me, you have to choose to do something that even if it fails, it was so fun. We never started

02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:10.360
Instagram knowing it was going to be big. We started Instagram because we loved photography.

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.840
We loved social networks. I had seen what other social networks had done and I thought,

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:22.840
hmm, maybe we did a spin on this, but nowhere was our fate predestined. It wasn't written

02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:27.000
out anywhere that everything was going to go great. I often think the counterfactual,

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.760
what if it had not gone well? I would have been like, I don't know, that was fun. We raised some

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:36.600
money. We learned some stuff and does it position you well for the next experience?

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:41.640
That's the advice that I would give to anyone wanting to start something today, which is like,

02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:47.400
does this meet with your ultimate goals? Not wealth, not fame, none of that, because all of

02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:54.600
that, by the way, is bullshit. You can get super famous and super wealthy. I think generally those

02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:01.080
are not things that, again, it's easy to say with a lot of money that somehow it's not good to have

02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:06.120
a lot of money. I think that complicates life enormously in a way that people don't fully

02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.000
comprehend. I think it is way more interesting to shoot for, can I make something that people love?

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:16.280
That provides value in the world, that I love building, that I love working on.

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:23.160
That's what I would do if I were starting from scratch. By the way, in some ways,

02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.480
I will do that personally, which is choose the thing that you get up every morning and you're

02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:35.400
like, I love this, even when it's painful. Even when it's painful. What about a social

02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:40.120
network specifically? If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind-

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.320
I don't want to compete against myself. I can't give out ideas.

02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:47.160
Okay, I got you. No, but it's like high level. You focus on community.

02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:57.240
I said that as a half joke. In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to build that

02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:04.680
ideas are a dime a dozen. You have to talk about keeping it simple, which is a liberating idea.

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:11.160
My model is three circles and they overlap. One circle is what do I have experience at

02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:15.240
slash what am I good at? I don't like saying what am I good at because it just seems like,

02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.480
what do I have experience in? What can I bring to the table?

02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:25.320
What am I excited about is the other circle. What's just super cool that I want to work on?

02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:30.600
Because even when this is hard, I think it's so cool, I want to stick with it.

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:36.040
And the last circle is like, what does the world need? And if that circle ain't there,

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:40.120
it doesn't matter what you work on because there are a lot of startups that exist that just no one

02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:46.760
needs or very small markets need. But if you want to be successful, I think if you're good at it,

02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:51.720
if you're good at it, you're passionate about it and the world needs it. I mean,

02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:56.200
this sounds simple, but not enough people sit down and just think about those circles and think,

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.960
do these things overlap and then can I get that middle section? It's small,

02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:04.120
but can I get that middle section? I think a lot about that personally.

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:09.720
And then you have to be really honest about the circle that you're good at

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:19.400
and really honest about the circle that the world needs. And I suppose really honest about the

02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:24.200
passion. Like what do you actually love? Yeah. As opposed to like some kind of dream of making

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:29.000
money, all those kinds of stuff. Like literally love doing. I had a former engineer who decided

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.840
to start a startup and I was like, are you sure you want to start a company versus like join

02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:40.360
something else? Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing basketball are two very, very

02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:46.440
different things. And like not everyone fully understands the difference. I think you can kind

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:53.640
of do it both. And I don't know, jury's out on that one because like they're in the middle of it

02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:59.800
now. But it's really important to figure out what you're good at, not be full of yourself,

02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:07.000
like truly look at your track record. What's the saying? Like it ain't bragging if you can do it.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:15.320
But too many people are delusional and like think they're better at things than they actually are

02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:19.720
or think there's a bigger market than there actually is. When you confuse your passion

02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:24.680
for things with a big market, that's really scary, right? Like just because you think it's

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:28.680
cool doesn't mean that it's a big business opportunity. So like what evidence do you have?

02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:35.160
Again, I'm a strict rationalist on this. And like sometimes people don't like working with me because

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:43.000
I'm pretty pragmatic about things. Like I'm not Elon. Like I don't sit and make bold proclamations

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.880
about visiting Mars. Like that's just not how I work. I'm like, okay, I want to build this really

02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:52.200
cool thing that's fairly practical. And I think we could do it and it's in this way.

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:55.480
And what's cool though is like, that's just my sweet spot. I'm not like,

02:31:56.360 --> 02:32:01.000
I just, I can't, I can't with a straight face talk about the metaverse. I can't. I just, it's not me.

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:05.240
What do you think about the Facebook renaming itself?

02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:08.520
I didn't mean that as a dig. I just literally mean like I'm fairly,

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.800
I like to live in the next five years and like what things can I get out in a year that people

02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:20.360
will use at scale. And so it's just, again, those circles, I think are different for

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:25.400
different people, but it's important to realize that like market matters, you being good at it

02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:28.680
matters and having passion for it matters. Your question, sorry.

02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:35.880
Well, on that last, on this topic in terms of funding, is there, by way of advice,

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:43.240
was funding in your own journey, helpful, unhelpful? Like, is there a right time to get funding,

02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:48.040
venture funding or anything, borrow some money from your parents? I don't know.

02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:54.360
But any, like, is money getting in the way? Does it help? Is the timing important? Is there some

02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:59.320
kind of wisdom you can give there because you were exceptionally successful very quickly?

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:04.280
Funding helps as long as it's from the right people. That includes yourself. And I'll talk

02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:09.560
about myself, funding myself in a second, which is like, because I can fund myself doing whatever

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:14.840
projects I can do, I don't really have another person putting pressure on me except for myself.

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:20.280
And that creates strange dynamics, right? But let's like talk about people getting funding

02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:26.440
from a venture capitalist initially. What's the best way to do that? What's the best way to do

02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:31.720
getting funding from a venture capitalist initially? We raised money from Matt Koehler

02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:39.320
at Benchmark. He's a brilliant, amazing guy, very thoughtful. And he was very helpful early on.

02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:43.400
But I have stories from entrepreneurs where they raised money from the wrong person or the wrong

02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:50.440
firm where incentives weren't aligned. They didn't think in the same way. And bad things

02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.520
happened because of that. The boardroom was always noisy. There were fights. Like,

02:33:54.520 --> 02:34:01.320
we just never had that. Matt was great. Capital these days is kind of a dime a dozen,

02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:06.200
right? As long as you're fundable, it seems like there's money out there is what I'm hearing.

02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:12.840
It's really important that you are aligned and that you think of raising money as hiring someone

02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:19.400
for your team rather than taking money if capital is plentiful, right? It provides a certain amount

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:25.000
of pressure to do the right thing that I think is healthy for any startup. And it keeps you real

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.760
and honest because they don't want to lose their money. They're paid to not lose their money.

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:36.360
The problem, maybe I could depersonalize it, but I remember having lunch with Elon. It only happened

02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:43.320
once. I was trying to figure out what I was doing after Instagram, right? And I asked him something

02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.640
about angel investing. And he looked at me with a straight face and was like, why the F would I do

02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:55.000
that? I was like, I don't know. You're connected. He's like, I only invested myself. And I was like,

02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:03.160
okay. Not the confidence. I was just like, what a novel idea. It's like, yeah, if you have money,

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:11.560
why not just put it against your bag and enable you're visiting Mars or something, right? That's

02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:16.920
awesome. Great. But I had never really thought of it that way. But also with that comes an interesting

02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.720
dynamic where you don't actually have people who are going to lose that money and telling you,

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:28.840
hey, don't do this or, hey, you need to face this reality. So you need to create other versions

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:36.520
of that truth teller. And whatever I do next, that's going to be one of the interesting challenges

02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:41.800
is how do you create that truth telling situation? And that's part of why, by the way, I think

02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:46.600
someone like Jack, when you start Square, you have money, but you still bring on partners

02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:51.960
because I think it creates a truth telling type environment. I'm still trying to figure

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:58.920
this out. It's an interesting dynamic. So you're thinking of perhaps launching

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:03.480
some kind of venture where you're investing in yourself? Is that in the books potentially?

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:09.160
I'm 37 going on 38 next month. I have a long life to live. I'm definitely not going to sit on the

02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:18.040
beach. So I'm going to do something at some point and I got to imagine I will help fund it.

02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:22.200
So the other way of thinking about this is you could park your money in the S&P and this is bad

02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:27.640
because the S&P has done wonderfully well over the last year. Or you can invest in yourself and

02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:32.360
if you're not going to invest in yourself, you probably shouldn't do a startup. It's kind of

02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:39.000
the way of thinking about it. And you can invest in yourself in the way Elon does, which is basically

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.480
go all in on this investment. Maybe that's one way to achieve accountability is like,

02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:51.480
you're kind of screwed if you fail. I personally like that. I like burning

02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:58.440
bridges behind me so that I'm fucked if it fails. It's really important though.

02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:05.480
One of the things I think Mark said to me early on that sticks with me that I think is true,

02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:11.240
we were talking about people who had left operating roles and started doing venture

02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:14.440
or something and it was like a lot of people convinced themselves they work really hard.

02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:19.240
They think they work really hard and they put on the show and in their minds they work really hard,

02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:25.320
but they don't work very hard. There is something about lighting a fire underneath you and burning

02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:31.160
bridges such that you can't turn back that I think, we didn't talk about this specifically,

02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:37.480
but I think you're right. You need to have that because there's the self-delusion at a certain

02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:43.320
scale. Oh, I have so many board calls. Oh, we have all these things to figure out. It's like,

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:50.120
this is one of the hard parts about it being an operator. It's like, there are so many people

02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:54.760
that have made a lot of money not operating, but operating is just one of the hardest things on

02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:02.040
earth. It is just so hard. It is stressful. You're dealing with real humans, not just

02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:07.080
throwing capital in and hoping it grows. I'm not undermining the VC mindset. I think it's a

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:14.200
wonderful thing and needed and so many wonderful VCs I've worked with, but yeah, when your ass is

02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:20.280
on the line and it's your money, talk to me in 10 years. We'll see how it goes.

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:24.520
Yeah, but like you were saying, that is a source when you wake up in the morning

02:38:26.040 --> 02:38:30.920
and you look forward to the day full of challenges, that's also where you can find happiness.

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:36.680
Let me ask you about love and friendship. What's the role in this heck of a difficult journey you

02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:43.480
have been on of love, of friendship? What's the role of love in the human condition?

02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:50.440
Well, first things first, the woman I married, my wife, Nicole, there's no way I could do what I do

02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:56.520
if we weren't together. She had the filter idea. Yeah, exactly. We didn't go over that story.

02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:03.560
Everything is a partnership, right? And to achieve great things, it's not about someone pulling their

02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:09.640
weight in places. It's not like someone supporting you so that you could do this other thing. It's

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:16.600
literally like Mike and I and our partnership as co-founders is fascinating because I don't think

02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:21.800
Instagram would have happened without that partnership, like either him or me alone,

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:28.600
no way. We pushed and pulled each other in a way that allowed us to build a better thing because

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.120
of it. Nicole, sure, she pushed me to work on the filters early on. And yes, that's exciting. It's

02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:41.000
a fun story, right? But the truth of it is being able to level with someone about how hard the

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:47.480
process is and have someone see you for who you are before Instagram and know that there's a

02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.520
constant you throughout all of this and be able to call you when you're drifting from that,

02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:59.720
but also support you when you're trying to stick with that. That's true friendship slash love,

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:07.000
that's true friendship slash love, whatever you want to call it. But also for someone not to care,

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.200
I remember Nicole saying, hey, I know you're going to do this Instagram thing. I guess it was bourbon

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:18.600
at the time. You should do it because even if it doesn't work, we can move to a smaller apartment

02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:23.400
and it'll be fine. We'll make it work. How beautiful is that, right?

02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:28.520
Yeah. That's almost like a superpower. It gives you permission to fail and somehow that actually

02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:33.800
leads to success. But also she's like the least impressed about Instagram of anyone. She's like,

02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.800
yeah, it's great, but I love you for you. I like that you're a decent cook.

02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:42.600
That's beautiful. That's beautiful with the Gantt chart and Thanksgiving,

02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.160
which I still think is a brilliant idea. Thank you.

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:54.760
Big ridiculous question. You're old and wise at the stage, so have you discovered meaning to this

02:40:54.760 --> 02:41:00.520
whole thing? Why the hell are we descendants of apes here on earth? What's the meaning of it?

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:07.080
What's the meaning of life? I haven't. So the best learning

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:14.360
for me has been no matter what level of success you achieve, you're still worried about similar

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:18.760
things, just maybe on a slightly different scale. You're still concerned about the same thing.

02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:26.040
You're still self-conscious about the same things. Actually that moment going through that

02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:31.480
is what makes you believe there's got to be more machinery to life or purpose to life.

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:39.240
We're all chasing these materialistic things, but you start realizing it's almost like the Truman

02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:45.400
show when he gets the edge and he knocks against it. He's like, what? There's this awakening that

02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:50.680
happens when you get to that edge that you realize, oh, sure, it's great that we all chase

02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:57.640
money and fame and success, but you hit the edge. I'm not even claiming I hit an edge like Elon's

02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:03.320
hit an edge. There's clearly larger scales, but what's cool is you learn that it doesn't actually

02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:08.520
matter and that there are all these other things that truly matter. That's not a case for working

02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:13.160
less hard. That's not a case for taking it easy. That's not a case for the four-day work week.

02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:19.000
What that is a case for is designing your life exactly the way you want to design it because

02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:25.480
I don't know. I think we go around the sun a certain number of times and then we die and

02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:32.280
then that's it. That's me. Are you afraid of that moment? No, not at all. In fact, or at least not

02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:43.560
yet. Listen, I'm like a pilot. I do crazy things and if anything, I'm like, oh,

02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:53.400
I got to choose mindfully and purposefully the thing I am doing right now and not just fall into

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:57.080
it because you're going to wake up one day and ask yourself why the hell you spent the last 10 years

02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:06.920
doing X, Y, or Z. I guess my shorter answer to this is doing things on purpose because you choose

02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:13.560
to do them is so important in life and not just floating down the river of life, hitting branches

02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:20.040
along the way because you will hit branches, but rather literally plotting a course and not having

02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:28.760
a 10-year plan, but just choosing every day to opt in. That I think has been more like I haven't

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:32.680
figured out the meaning of life by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly isn't money and

02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:38.200
it certainly isn't fame and it certainly isn't travel and it's way more of opting into the game

02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:45.400
you love playing. Every day opting in. Just opting in and don't let it happen. You opt in.

02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:53.400
Kevin, it's great to end on love and the meaning of life. This was an amazing conversation.

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:54.280
It was a lot of fun. Thank you.

02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:00.760
You gave me a light into some fascinating aspects of this technical world and I can't

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.600
honestly wait to see what you do next. Thank you so much.

02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:05.640
Thanks for having me.

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:11.480
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Systrom. To support this podcast,
