00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
If Scientology was just getting auditing when you wanted,

00:07.760 --> 00:10.000
about the subjects you wanted, and you

00:10.000 --> 00:12.760
could take it or leave it, that would be fine.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.040
It's the fact that it's part and parcel

00:15.040 --> 00:20.320
to this entire organization and this entire experience that

00:20.320 --> 00:23.120
has, as a part of that experience,

00:23.120 --> 00:26.760
taking everything from you, demanding everything from you,

00:26.760 --> 00:29.240
controlling who you can speak with,

00:29.240 --> 00:31.400
controlling who you can have relationships with,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.760
who you have to erase from your life.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.960
And it's hard to place one pinpoint on this

00:37.960 --> 00:39.440
is where Scientology goes wrong.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.520
It's really hard to do that, because the good parts

00:41.520 --> 00:44.240
of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology

00:44.240 --> 00:47.920
are all just Scientology.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.720
The following is a conversation with Aaron Smith, 11,

00:50.720 --> 00:53.640
a former Scientologist raised in Scientology

00:53.640 --> 00:55.200
and have worked in the organization

00:56.040 --> 01:00.600
for many years as a staff member and a C-ORG member,

01:00.600 --> 01:03.960
including the job of training Scientology auditors.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.760
Today, he educates the public about Scientology

01:06.760 --> 01:11.080
on his YouTube channel called Growing Up in Scientology.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.960
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.960
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:14.960 --> 01:16.160
in the description.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.040
And now, dear friends, here's Aaron Smith, 11.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.400
Let's do a full overview of Scientology, its ideas,

01:24.440 --> 01:27.880
how it operates, how it wields its power and influence.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.400
And let's start at the very basics.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.080
What is Scientology?

01:31.080 --> 01:36.360
Scientology is a belief system created by L. Ron Hubbard

01:36.360 --> 01:39.560
that does fundamentally believe

01:39.560 --> 01:42.800
that we are all immortal spiritual beings called Thetans,

01:43.800 --> 01:48.800
that we have native godlike potential,

01:48.800 --> 01:51.320
that there is nothing more powerful in the universe

01:51.320 --> 01:52.600
than a Thetan.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.600
So godlike is quite literal here.

01:55.640 --> 02:00.640
And that through various decisions Thetans have made,

02:01.040 --> 02:04.040
they have fallen away from their native godlike power

02:04.920 --> 02:07.880
to falling down to a state

02:07.880 --> 02:10.920
where most Thetans aren't even aware that they are Thetans,

02:10.920 --> 02:14.240
aren't even aware that they ever have lived before

02:14.240 --> 02:15.800
or have these powers.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.760
And that Thetans are now in a state

02:17.760 --> 02:21.040
where they're trapped in bodies, trapped here on earth,

02:21.040 --> 02:23.080
trapped in this prison of a physical universe,

02:23.080 --> 02:25.480
trapped on this prison of a planet.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.160
And that only Scientology can restore a Thetan

02:29.160 --> 02:31.960
to its native state.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.360
Are these multiple beings?

02:33.360 --> 02:36.080
Like, is there one Thetan inside of me

02:36.080 --> 02:38.000
that's trapped in this prison?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.440
Well, the thing would be you.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
The thing would be me.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.960
The Thetan is you.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.320
But I'm presumably limited in some fundamental way.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.920
So this Thetan that is me is limited.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.840
So there's like eight billion Thetans on the planet.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.240
There's one primary Thetan animating each body.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.000
Later in Scientology, you learn there's actually

02:59.000 --> 03:01.120
like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands

03:01.120 --> 03:05.760
of like sick, unconscious, half dead Thetans

03:05.760 --> 03:09.160
stuck to you that are now an additional cause

03:09.160 --> 03:10.720
of problems for you.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.240
But fundamentally at the lower levels,

03:13.240 --> 03:14.720
the non-confidential levels,

03:14.720 --> 03:16.440
there's just one Thetan per body.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.880
Well, I mean, it's an interesting idea.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.280
I just would like to kind of explore

03:21.280 --> 03:23.040
the philosophy of that.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.640
So there's a being that's all powerful, that's immortal.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.840
And its projection, its manifestation on this Earth

03:29.840 --> 03:32.680
is fundamentally limited.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.240
And you're trying to, the process of Scientology

03:36.240 --> 03:39.760
is the process of letting go of those limitations.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.200
You know, that's an interesting idea.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.440
I mean, a lot of religions have this kind of idea

03:43.440 --> 03:45.760
that there's not just religions,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.240
but like we have the capacity as human beings

03:49.240 --> 03:52.480
to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.920
And that's the question we have

03:53.920 --> 03:55.080
with our cognitive abilities.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.280
We start with an embryo and build up into this organism

03:58.280 --> 04:00.520
and like this world of opportunities before us.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.400
What are we capable of?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.000
And the idea that we're capable of almost anything

04:05.000 --> 04:05.960
is a really powerful one.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.480
And there's a lot of religions,

04:07.480 --> 04:08.560
there's a lot of philosophies,

04:08.560 --> 04:11.840
there's a lot of advice, self-help

04:11.840 --> 04:13.400
that kind of explore those ideas.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.560
And so it seems like with Scientology,

04:16.560 --> 04:19.520
the application of this religious philosophy means

04:19.520 --> 04:21.440
that there's, we're limited

04:21.440 --> 04:23.520
and we have to break through those limitations.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.880
And there's a process to break through those limitations.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.120
That would be correct.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.480
So what can make it challenging to adequately

04:31.480 --> 04:35.200
and completely describe Scientology in the beginning

04:35.200 --> 04:38.320
is what Scientologists believe actually changes

04:38.320 --> 04:43.320
as they progress further into or further up in Scientology.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.520
So the explanation is that I've given it

04:46.520 --> 04:47.920
is pretty consistent with what you would get

04:47.920 --> 04:49.520
at the lowest levels, right?

04:49.520 --> 04:53.520
You're a thetan, I'm a thetan, everyone's a thetan.

04:53.520 --> 04:57.360
And we have a reactive mind.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.560
L. Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind

04:59.560 --> 05:03.760
is a collection of these recordings, mental recordings

05:03.760 --> 05:06.160
of any moments of pain and unconsciousness

05:06.160 --> 05:07.360
you've ever had in your life.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.680
It's like the subconscious mind.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.800
It's always recording in moments of pain

05:13.800 --> 05:16.520
and unconsciousness and that these are called,

05:16.520 --> 05:19.400
these recordings are L. Ron Hubbard called them engrams.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.080
Now, when L. Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.040
this was before Scientology came along

05:24.040 --> 05:25.320
a couple of years later, right?

05:25.320 --> 05:28.080
So in 1950, when he wrote Dianetics,

05:28.080 --> 05:31.160
it wasn't a spiritual endeavor.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.000
It was supposed to be a mental health,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.920
a science of mental health.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.000
So as of that time, the earliest engram

05:39.000 --> 05:43.480
you could have was the incident of birth, being born,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.240
was an engram.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.400
And technically in Dianetics, he said

05:47.400 --> 05:49.200
you could have prenatal engrams,

05:49.200 --> 05:50.840
like when you're still in the womb.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.040
But there was no concept of past lives

05:53.040 --> 05:55.600
as of 1950 version of Dianetics, right?

05:56.720 --> 06:01.720
And so the idea there was that the reactive mind

06:02.440 --> 06:04.760
is essentially a stimulus response mechanism

06:05.760 --> 06:08.000
created through evolution millions of years ago

06:08.040 --> 06:10.680
to protect the individual from things that would harm them.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.760
In other words, things that would bring about

06:11.760 --> 06:13.680
pain and unconsciousness.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.120
So you have these recordings of things that hurt you,

06:16.120 --> 06:17.280
created pain and unconsciousness.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.280
And in present time, these things will react upon you

06:20.280 --> 06:25.200
in a way to cause you to avoid similar things

06:25.200 --> 06:28.640
reacting upon you in a subconscious unconscious way.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.240
So the reactive mind protects you

06:31.320 --> 06:34.200
from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.400
Yes, and the idea is we've now,

06:37.400 --> 06:39.080
as human beings evolved to a state

06:39.080 --> 06:41.760
where it no longer serves us beneficially,

06:41.760 --> 06:43.400
it only serves us negatively.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.120
This was Hubbard's theory.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.320
And he said, so you can get rid of these engrams

06:48.320 --> 06:50.760
by basically recalling them and going over them

06:50.760 --> 06:53.080
again and again using Dianetics auditing therapy.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.240
And if you get back to the moment of birth

06:55.240 --> 06:57.080
and erase the earliest engram,

06:57.080 --> 07:01.480
all the other subsequent engrams on the chain would vanish.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.000
Oh, nice, so there's a change.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.360
Earlier, similar, earlier, similar,

07:04.360 --> 07:07.000
earlier, similar, earlier, similar, okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.120
So that gives you a pretty good understanding

07:08.120 --> 07:12.360
of how Elrond Hubbard thought of the mind

07:12.360 --> 07:13.800
because that carries on,

07:13.800 --> 07:16.120
has applicability later on in Scientology.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.440
I mean, that's a pretty powerful model of the mind.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.000
I mean, Freud had similar conceptions

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
that a lot of our traumas are grounded in sort of

07:29.000 --> 07:30.880
poor formulation of sexuality

07:30.880 --> 07:32.960
or imperfect formulation of sexuality

07:32.960 --> 07:35.080
in our childhood, something like this.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.120
And then we're trying to figure out the puzzle

07:37.120 --> 07:39.000
of whatever we formed in early childhood.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.240
I mean, it's similar, similar kind of-

07:40.240 --> 07:41.080
It is similar.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.080
That's probably what Hubbard took it from.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.320
In the early days of Dianetics,

07:45.320 --> 07:47.920
before he decided psychiatry was evil,

07:47.920 --> 07:49.920
he actually credited Sigmund Freud

07:49.920 --> 07:52.880
with some of the shoulders he was standing on

07:52.880 --> 07:54.080
in writing Dianetics.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.280
So he still admired psychiatry at that time.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.880
So that's an interesting moment of Dianetics.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.720
So what else?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.960
You mentioned Dianetics, auditing was there too.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.000
So if we just, before Scientology,

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
what are the ideas that formed what we know as Dianetics?

08:09.600 --> 08:12.000
As I've just described, that is the fundamental.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.040
That is pretty much the nuts and bolts of Dianetics.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.080
Was it applied?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.720
Was it applied often?

08:16.720 --> 08:17.960
Oh yeah, no, that's what Dianetics

08:17.960 --> 08:19.760
in the early days was all about, was just auditing.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.040
Auditing is the process of the one-on-one counseling.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.640
Recall a moment of pain and unconsciousness,

08:23.640 --> 08:25.360
run through the anagram over and over and over again,

08:25.360 --> 08:26.440
find something earlier, similar.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.040
That is Dianetics auditing.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.120
One of the main things that changed with Scientology

08:30.120 --> 08:32.400
is that birth or prenatal anagrams

08:32.400 --> 08:35.360
were no longer the earliest anagrams on the chain.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.880
The idea is you have to get the earliest anagram

08:36.880 --> 08:39.840
on the chain for the later ones to blow, which is a race.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.720
But all of a sudden now, with the addition

08:45.720 --> 08:48.240
of an immortal spiritual being into the equation,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.200
well now the earliest incident could be trillions

08:50.200 --> 08:52.560
of years ago in other galaxies and universes.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.840
Other universes, so before the evolution of this universe.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.000
Is there a model of physics integrated in any of this?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.800
The model is you have the physical universe

09:02.960 --> 09:05.120
and then above that you have the theta universe.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.200
So we used the word Thetan earlier.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
So in Scientology we'll just use the word theta.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.600
Theta is just basically Thetan power, Thetans collectively.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.440
So Hubbard would say you have the theta universe,

09:18.440 --> 09:20.680
which is senior to the physical universe

09:20.680 --> 09:22.360
and creates the physical universe.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.400
And remember I said native god-like potentials.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.840
So we're not talking about the god who created the earth.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.920
Scientologists don't believe in a god,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.080
but we'll get into that later.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.960
We're talking about just creating universes.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.760
Just think of like Matrix.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.840
When I say creating a universe,

09:37.840 --> 09:40.480
essentially just creating different Thetan simulations.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.080
But it sounds like a little bit more like the ideas of Plato,

09:44.080 --> 09:46.240
which is there's these platonic forms,

09:46.240 --> 09:49.080
there's abstract forms that are bigger,

09:49.080 --> 09:53.400
more general than our particular reality here.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.120
And those forms are used to construct the reality.

09:56.120 --> 09:56.960
Well, I grew up in a cult,

09:56.960 --> 09:58.760
so I'm not familiar with the works of Plato.

09:58.760 --> 10:03.760
You can't use that as an excuse for everything.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.800
I would like to non-jokingly steel man the case

10:07.800 --> 10:11.120
because a lot of philosophies, a lot of religions,

10:11.120 --> 10:13.640
a lot of even scientific endeavors

10:13.640 --> 10:17.720
are a little bit full of uncertainty.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.520
You can call it bullshit,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.440
but you're on sturdy ground

10:21.440 --> 10:23.200
because we're surrounded by mystery.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.120
And you have to take these ideas somewhat seriously

10:27.120 --> 10:29.400
and see where those ideas go wrong.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.080
This happens with communism.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.680
This happens with capitalism.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.120
These ideas sound beautiful in their ideal forms,

10:36.120 --> 10:37.640
and then they somehow go wrong

10:37.640 --> 10:39.360
and some go more wrong than others.

10:39.360 --> 10:44.360
And so I don't think sort of it's easy to sort of caricature

10:46.000 --> 10:47.520
and make fun of the ideas.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
I think if we take them seriously,

10:49.520 --> 10:51.960
you'll start to understand like when you're in it,

10:51.960 --> 10:53.440
it was serious.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.000
It can be very convincing.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.960
It's the devil is going to be a charismatic person.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.560
He's not going to be a caricature of ridiculous person.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.200
So that helps us understand

11:02.200 --> 11:05.320
which ideas will sound appealing,

11:05.320 --> 11:06.520
but will become dangerous.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.360
I totally agree.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.360
In fact, it's one of the thrusts I have on my channel

11:12.760 --> 11:15.200
is wanting to talk about Scientology in a way

11:15.200 --> 11:19.480
that would actually resonate with current Scientologists,

11:19.480 --> 11:21.840
not just resonate with former Scientologists.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.040
I want people who are still in

11:24.040 --> 11:26.080
to be able to hear how I talk about it and go,

11:26.080 --> 11:29.520
wow, he's being really fair and really accurate.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.680
He's not just a hater.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.520
You know what I mean?

11:31.520 --> 11:32.840
If you look at the, you know,

11:32.840 --> 11:36.680
let's take one of the worst places on earth is North Korea.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.440
You have Kim Jong-un.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.200
And the reality is there's a lot of citizens of that nation

11:42.200 --> 11:44.840
that deeply love the leader

11:45.560 --> 11:47.560
because they've grew up in that way.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.960
And you, I mean, through fear,

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
through all kinds of manipulation,

11:49.960 --> 11:51.080
through propaganda and so on,

11:51.440 --> 11:52.400
members of their own family,

11:52.400 --> 11:53.760
they're not allowed to have romantic love.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.840
They're only allowed to have love for the leader.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.280
And to reach those people,

11:57.280 --> 12:00.880
you have to empathize with the fact that in their eyes,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.920
in some sense, this is a great man.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.280
This is a God, a messianic figure.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.280
You can't just make fun of

12:07.280 --> 12:09.040
the ridiculousness of the situation

12:09.040 --> 12:11.920
that there's this pudgy person waltzing around,

12:11.920 --> 12:13.120
creating propaganda.

12:13.120 --> 12:13.960
Like, how's this?

12:13.960 --> 12:14.800
With a funny haircut.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.640
With a funny haircut.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.200
Like, it's so easy, and Hitler too, to make fun of,

12:19.200 --> 12:20.960
to make a caricature of the person,

12:21.800 --> 12:22.840
but this is a real person,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.600
a real person that influenced the minds

12:25.600 --> 12:26.800
of millions of people.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.080
In the case of Hitler, you know,

12:29.080 --> 12:30.600
tens of millions of people,

12:30.600 --> 12:33.160
and created a huge amount of suffering,

12:33.160 --> 12:37.480
not because of the caricature version,

12:37.480 --> 12:39.080
but because he was a charismatic leader.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.360
He was somebody that people deeply, deeply loved.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.720
And that just over time,

12:42.720 --> 12:46.400
I mean, with the abuse of any kind of ideology,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
this happens over and over.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.240
So yeah, it's interesting because Scientology

12:52.240 --> 12:57.200
is so close to the core of what is America,

12:57.200 --> 12:59.000
because so many Americans are involved with it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.080
So it's interesting to study the beauty

13:02.080 --> 13:04.240
and the power of the ideas that underlie it,

13:04.240 --> 13:05.640
and where things go wrong.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.760
Yeah.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.360
And I'll just say, it's interesting to note,

13:08.360 --> 13:10.360
you would never get a representative

13:10.360 --> 13:12.080
of the Church of Scientology to sit down

13:12.080 --> 13:14.000
and have a conversation with you,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.160
and even be as fair and accurate about Scientology

13:17.200 --> 13:20.120
as I'm going to be, which is noteworthy.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.080
Do you honestly deeply believe that's the case?

13:22.080 --> 13:25.280
There's not going to be a high-level official

13:25.280 --> 13:28.440
that would sit down for a conversation?

13:29.360 --> 13:30.200
No.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.400
I disagree with you.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
I hope you're right.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.120
Because I think that given the current dynamics

13:35.120 --> 13:37.840
of what's happening, I think in order to say,

13:37.840 --> 13:38.920
from their perspective,

13:38.920 --> 13:41.240
in order to save the Church of Scientology,

13:41.240 --> 13:45.000
they have to be transparent and authentic,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.360
basically still mend their case, but better.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.040
You would think so.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.440
Well, we'll talk about the other ways you could do that,

13:51.440 --> 13:53.160
which is the manipulation through propaganda,

13:53.160 --> 13:54.840
through control of media, and all that kind of stuff.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.680
They paint themselves into a corner

13:56.680 --> 13:59.280
of not being able to send a representative out

13:59.280 --> 14:00.800
into the world to speak honestly about it,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.920
because you're literally not allowed to.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.440
So when faced, if you're just sitting down

14:06.440 --> 14:08.240
with an entertainment journalist,

14:08.240 --> 14:09.880
a representative might be able to fudge their way

14:09.880 --> 14:12.360
through an interview, but sitting down

14:12.400 --> 14:16.720
for a long-form format interview with someone

14:16.720 --> 14:21.120
who is gonna ask them about Xenu and the body Phaetans

14:21.120 --> 14:25.800
and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson, that's a no-go zone.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.200
So I'm representing why it will never happen,

14:28.200 --> 14:30.080
but shit, I would tune in for that interview.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.680
I mean, I hope you do get someone.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.880
You don't think David Miscavige

14:32.880 --> 14:34.480
would sit down for an interview?

14:34.480 --> 14:35.920
I would love to be wrong.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.960
In general, journalists in these kinds of situations

14:37.960 --> 14:42.960
can attack in a way that doesn't empathize

14:43.600 --> 14:45.680
and doesn't come from a place of deep knowledge

14:45.680 --> 14:47.600
and understanding, and I think it's possible

14:47.600 --> 14:51.440
to have serious conversations with people like that

14:51.440 --> 14:54.200
in an empathetic way, but it's also in a challenging way.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.720
I think there's a huge amount of trust required,

14:56.720 --> 15:00.840
and obviously for us, a very secretive organization,

15:00.840 --> 15:04.640
the amount of trust, yes, might be too much required.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.040
Anyone over there, if they've done their homework,

15:06.080 --> 15:08.040
who knows, you're gonna be as fair

15:08.040 --> 15:10.240
as anyone in the world's going to be.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.240
And yet, there's simply things

15:12.240 --> 15:13.920
they're not allowed to talk about,

15:13.920 --> 15:14.960
and they're not even allowed to say

15:14.960 --> 15:16.320
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.200
So that's a fundamental part

15:18.200 --> 15:20.360
of the Church of Scientology is the secrecy.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.440
Yeah.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.400
So that's where you're trained

15:22.400 --> 15:25.160
as you go up through the ranks of secrecy, secrecy.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.160
It's not even a matter of training.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.000
It's that there's an entire,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.120
the entire upper half of Scientology's bridge

15:30.120 --> 15:31.720
is simply confidential.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.400
I mean, and I never even did those levels

15:33.400 --> 15:34.520
when I was in Scientology.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.720
I didn't learn what Scientologists actually believe

15:37.720 --> 15:40.440
on those upper levels until after I got out of Scientology

15:40.440 --> 15:42.560
and I was frickin' born and raised in it.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.400
Let's go there.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.440
Let's go to your personal story.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.400
So you've spent 30 years in Scientology.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.240
Yeah, I was four years old when my mom got in.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.640
And then about seven years ago, got out,

15:53.640 --> 15:56.160
and you're on what YouTube channel now,

15:56.160 --> 15:57.440
and you're an educator.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.400
So I was four years old

15:58.400 --> 16:00.560
when my mom got introduced to Scientology,

16:00.560 --> 16:03.440
and she got in really fast, really quick.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.760
So I was 12 years old when I was taken out of school

16:06.760 --> 16:09.640
and started officially full-time working for Scientology.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.040
Okay, so in various capacities,

16:12.040 --> 16:16.160
I worked for them from the ages of 12 to the age of 26.

16:16.160 --> 16:20.040
Okay, so, and then I was 34

16:20.040 --> 16:24.080
when I officially parted ways with Scientology,

16:24.080 --> 16:26.240
which was really more them officially parting ways with me,

16:26.240 --> 16:27.840
but we can get into all that later.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.440
That's just kinda how Scientology does it.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.520
And what do you do now in terms of Scientology?

16:32.520 --> 16:34.440
So now I run, growing up in Scientology,

16:34.440 --> 16:36.960
the YouTube channel, but what I primarily do

16:36.960 --> 16:38.920
is I help run an organization

16:38.920 --> 16:41.160
that helps people who are escaping from Scientology.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.320
I'm the vice president of the Aftermath Foundation.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.960
And we created the foundation after the television show,

16:47.960 --> 16:50.920
Leah Remini, Scientology and the Aftermath.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.560
And there was such an outpouring of support

16:53.560 --> 16:56.040
from non-Scientologists all over the world.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.520
What can we do to help people leave Scientology?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.960
That we decided to create a foundation,

17:02.440 --> 17:04.200
and it's been incredibly successful.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.920
We've helped people escape from all regions

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
and echelons of Scientology.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.840
We've accomplished, what we've accomplished

17:11.840 --> 17:15.360
is far beyond what we actually envisioned would be possible.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.680
It's been a huge success.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.840
So we'll talk about the negative aspect,

17:18.840 --> 17:21.320
the abuses of power, but let's just explore the ideas

17:21.320 --> 17:22.960
a little bit more.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.280
So the public facing three fundamental truths

17:26.280 --> 17:30.280
of Scientology, maybe correct me if I'm wrong,

17:30.280 --> 17:32.040
a man is an immortal spiritual being,

17:32.040 --> 17:34.000
like we said with Thaytans,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.880
his experience extends well beyond a single lifetime,

17:36.880 --> 17:39.000
so infinite memory backwards.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.640
His capabilities are unlimited,

17:40.640 --> 17:43.320
even if not presently realized.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.080
The capabilities are unlimited.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.760
Yeah, so that when I say godlike,

17:46.760 --> 17:51.520
I really just mean, you know, Thanos, like unlimited.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.480
Scientologists don't believe in a god.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.840
So when I say godlike, I just mean the most powerful entity,

17:57.840 --> 18:00.000
the creator, the prime mover unmoved,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.440
except we are all that.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.520
You know, a Thayton in definition, in Scientology,

18:04.520 --> 18:07.000
a Thayton has no position in space or time.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.040
A Thayton does not actually exist in the physical universe.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.560
It might choose to locate itself

18:12.560 --> 18:14.520
in the physical universe, right?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.200
And then forget that it made that decision

18:16.200 --> 18:17.680
and then sort of get caught and trapped

18:17.680 --> 18:18.960
in the physical universe,

18:18.960 --> 18:23.960
but that once the Thayton is restored to its native powers,

18:25.520 --> 18:27.080
everything you see here in the physical universe

18:27.080 --> 18:29.560
is just a Thayton playing a game.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.400
We are in a simulation right now of some Thayton.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.440
So like physics doesn't have to make sense

18:34.440 --> 18:35.680
when we're talking about it this way.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.400
Like technically you're a Thayton, I'm a Thayton, we're here,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.000
but this could also all just be another Thayton's game.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.440
So Thayton's all the way down.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.120
Yeah, it's just Thayton's everywhere,

18:44.120 --> 18:46.280
Thayton's all comes down to the Thayton.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.400
Is there an idea of a god?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.080
Because I read there's a kind of,

18:50.080 --> 18:52.360
there is a sense of a supreme being.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.360
Is that basically the Thayton that's at the core,

18:55.360 --> 18:59.960
at the bottom of it all, not defined, undefined.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.800
Correct.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.040
Scientology has this concept of the dynamics

19:03.040 --> 19:05.760
how Ron Hubbard breaks life into eight different dynamics

19:05.760 --> 19:09.800
and a dynamic meaning a thrust towards survival.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.880
So he would say, the first dynamic is you yourself,

19:12.880 --> 19:14.240
second dynamic is your family,

19:14.240 --> 19:16.800
third dynamic is any other group that you're a part of

19:16.800 --> 19:17.920
other than your family.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.320
Fourth dynamic is all humankind.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.040
The fifth dynamic is plant and animal life,

19:22.040 --> 19:24.080
all non-human life.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.480
Sixth dynamic is the physical world.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.560
Seventh dynamic is sort of like spirituality collectively,

19:29.560 --> 19:31.800
Thayton's, us as Thayton's.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.480
And the eighth dynamic, Ron Hubbard says,

19:34.480 --> 19:36.320
Scientology doesn't deal with the eighth dynamic,

19:36.320 --> 19:38.800
but we recognize that people have this idea

19:38.800 --> 19:40.440
of a supreme being.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.040
And so Scientology says, you can call the eighth dynamic

19:43.040 --> 19:46.440
the supreme being dynamic, but we call it infinity.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.560
Just the allness of everything without having to define it.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.040
And then they sort of do a little dance and they're like,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.640
the purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point

19:55.640 --> 19:58.280
where you have your own understandings or realizations

19:58.280 --> 20:00.080
about the nature of the eighth dynamic.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.440
We don't tell you what you have to believe about that.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.120
And technically speaking, that is true.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.560
Technically speaking, that is true.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.440
There's no point in Scientology where they sit you down

20:08.440 --> 20:10.360
and say, you're now required to revoke your belief

20:10.360 --> 20:11.560
in a supreme being.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.120
It's just that everything in Scientology is inconsistent

20:15.120 --> 20:17.280
with a belief in the supreme being.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.360
You can still find Scientologists who through

20:19.360 --> 20:20.960
cognitive dissonance will tell you they believe

20:20.960 --> 20:21.880
in a supreme being.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.600
Mostly they're lying to you.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.360
How's this inconsistent with the supreme being?

20:25.360 --> 20:26.440
Cause like, thetans-

20:26.440 --> 20:29.000
Because thetans have created everything, not God.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.040
Okay, so thetans created, they're also creative force.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.880
They're not just the force that runs everything.

20:34.880 --> 20:35.720
Right.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.240
But can't those be just the fingertips of a God?

20:38.240 --> 20:43.240
Sure, the only way you could reconcile a supreme being

20:43.560 --> 20:48.560
is if you say a single supreme being created all theta.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.320
Yeah.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.400
That's a spiritual big bang.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.600
But that's not what most people think

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
when they talk about God.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.600
They're talking about a creator of-

20:58.600 --> 20:59.560
The physical universe.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.400
Yes.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
That there's no theta.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.800
Right.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.440
I mean, even as I've described Scientology so far,

21:05.440 --> 21:07.760
none of what I've said is something I even subject

21:07.760 --> 21:08.600
to ridicule.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.160
This is pretty common sense stuff actually.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.120
I mean, if you believe in spirituality or spirits at all,

21:13.120 --> 21:15.680
there's nothing I've described so far that's crazy.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.880
Yeah.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.200
Believing in past lives isn't particularly unique

21:19.200 --> 21:20.120
or special.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.520
Right.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.000
The fact that Scientology does this little dance

21:24.000 --> 21:26.120
of pretending to believe in a God,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.640
I mean, it's even like a PR line.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.720
Scientology representatives will tell you,

21:29.720 --> 21:32.040
you can be a Christian and be a Scientologist.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.120
Well, let me tell you what.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.240
Christians don't believe in past lives

21:35.240 --> 21:38.800
and lives on other galaxies and planets and universes.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.760
And Scientology knows that.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.360
Scientology knows you can't be a Christian

21:42.360 --> 21:44.080
and be a Scientologist, but they will say that.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.520
It's just an example of sort of the fundamental

21:45.520 --> 21:46.600
baked in dishonesty.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.320
Because it's so important to Scientology

21:48.360 --> 21:52.440
on the organization level to have tax exempt status.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.800
I wonder, do you know the process of what it takes

21:55.800 --> 21:58.680
to prove that an organization is a religion?

21:58.680 --> 22:01.040
While going through that process with the IRS

22:01.040 --> 22:02.360
for the second time, by the way,

22:02.360 --> 22:04.640
Scientology actually had tax exemption in the early days

22:04.640 --> 22:08.320
and the IRS pulled it and then they got it back in 1993.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.280
While going through that process again,

22:10.280 --> 22:13.520
the IRS actually took issue with the fact

22:13.520 --> 22:16.440
that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist

22:16.440 --> 22:17.600
and a member of another religion.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.840
The IRS actually said, pump the brakes there.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.840
If you're gonna say that,

22:22.840 --> 22:24.960
we're gonna say you're not a religion.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.800
And they actually put in writing to the IRS,

22:27.800 --> 22:29.000
no, no, no, no, no, that's not what we meant,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.200
that's not what we meant.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.520
We meant in the beginning you can be both,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.320
but eventually you just have to be a Scientologist.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.840
So you mentioned the eight dynamics,

22:40.840 --> 22:42.640
but you also mentioned survival.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.720
So that seems to be a core principle

22:44.720 --> 22:48.200
that human existence is about survival.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.560
Can you elaborate what is meant by survival?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.720
Are we talking about the survival of the human species,

22:52.720 --> 22:54.760
survival of the individual humans,

22:54.760 --> 22:59.760
survival of the manifestation of thetans in human form?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.680
What's survival?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.240
So it would be all of that because survival

23:04.240 --> 23:08.000
is the dominant force across all the dynamics.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.720
That, I mean, L. Ron Hubbard,

23:09.720 --> 23:12.200
it was either Dianetics or Science of Survival.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.360
He says he discovered the principle

23:16.360 --> 23:18.480
upon which all life exists,

23:18.480 --> 23:22.280
and that is all life, no matter what it is trying to do.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.680
Are you ready, Lex?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.400
It's trying to survive.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.440
That's pretty powerful, that's pretty powerful.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.280
See, here's the thing.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.720
No, I gotta tell you, I gotta-

23:30.720 --> 23:32.160
You might get me back in, Lex.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.840
No, I'm not trying to get you back in.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.880
I'm trying to get you to take seriously

23:36.880 --> 23:39.280
the power of the ideas behind Scientology,

23:39.280 --> 23:43.760
because I think those ideas are not bad ideas.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.480
They resonate with a lot of ideas throughout philosophy,

23:46.480 --> 23:47.320
throughout religions,

23:47.320 --> 23:49.680
throughout the history of human civilization.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.200
The interesting aspect is how it goes wrong.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.480
But here's the thing, Lex, here's the thing.

23:53.480 --> 23:58.160
It is consistent with prior efforts or studies.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.720
It's just that L. Ron Hubbard said

23:59.720 --> 24:01.160
this was a watershed breakthrough

24:01.160 --> 24:02.840
that was being discovered for the first time.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.640
That's kind of what I'm mocking, really.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.960
Yeah, but you can mock Nietzsche for saying

24:06.960 --> 24:08.320
man is will to power.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.000
But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.160
Well, Nietzsche, he's had a bit of an ego.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.680
And he's full of contradictions,

24:15.680 --> 24:18.920
but I'm pretty sure the implied thing

24:18.920 --> 24:22.360
is that he was the first to say it.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.840
There's a lot of scientists.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.320
One of the people I really admire is Stephen Wolfram,

24:26.320 --> 24:31.120
who wrote a book called A New Kind of Science

24:31.120 --> 24:34.560
that explores complex systems in cellular automata

24:34.560 --> 24:35.760
and these mathematical systems

24:35.760 --> 24:37.480
that have been explored before.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.480
But he boldly kind of defined,

24:39.480 --> 24:42.640
I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.640
And if you just set a little bit of the ego

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
behind that aside,

24:46.640 --> 24:48.480
there's actually beautiful ideas in there.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.000
They have, of course, been done before

24:50.000 --> 24:51.040
and explored before.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.160
But sometimes people declare this is the coolest.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.960
That's the only thing I'm really mocking is

24:55.960 --> 24:58.360
this discovery that life is trying to survive

24:58.360 --> 25:00.240
is greater than the discovery of fire.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.320
Okay, I mean, it gets a little silly, but that's fine.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.440
We can agree that the fact that life is trying to survive

25:05.440 --> 25:07.880
has meaning and is meaningful and is valuable.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.040
And it's true.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.680
I mean, life is trying to survive.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.200
Also, there's a non-trivial definition

25:12.200 --> 25:14.120
of what is life here.

25:14.120 --> 25:18.640
So this idea of a thing that permeates through lifetimes,

25:18.640 --> 25:21.240
through people, there's some fabric

25:21.240 --> 25:25.320
that is bigger than individual biological bags of meat.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.120
That's a philosophically-initiating idea.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.480
Of course, if it's not grounded

25:29.480 --> 25:33.160
in a little bit more physical reality,

25:33.160 --> 25:35.400
then it becomes a little too woo-woo.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.840
And the way L. Ron Hubbard in Scientology defines survival

25:38.840 --> 25:41.200
is very much intertwined with how they define ethics.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.120
Ethics, anything to be ethical is pro-survival.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.840
To be unethical is counter-survival.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.040
But we were talking about just the concept of the dynamics.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.520
Like, what does survival refer to?

25:51.520 --> 25:53.280
And it actually does refer to all of them,

25:53.280 --> 25:55.880
but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh dynamic,

25:55.880 --> 25:59.320
Thetans collectively, involved in here is the idea

25:59.320 --> 26:01.920
that a Thetan cannot die.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.720
There's no such thing as killing a Thetan.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.880
He can only survive.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.160
And so anyway, this concept of the dynamics

26:10.160 --> 26:11.640
is one of the most fundamental

26:11.640 --> 26:14.120
and important concepts in Scientology.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.080
But because I mentioned that it also gets tied up

26:16.080 --> 26:18.640
with ethics, and this probably speaks

26:18.640 --> 26:19.560
to what you were just talking about

26:19.560 --> 26:21.400
is you can have the ideas and the concepts

26:21.400 --> 26:23.640
and you can have how do they go wrong

26:23.640 --> 26:28.640
because they hold that Scientology, applying Scientology,

26:29.040 --> 26:32.600
getting people into Scientology is the key

26:32.600 --> 26:36.320
to basically saving every spiritual being in existence.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.960
When you're analyzing what is ethical,

26:39.960 --> 26:43.080
it becomes whatever's good for Scientology

26:44.080 --> 26:46.200
becomes by definition ethical

26:46.200 --> 26:48.360
because anything that's good for Scientology,

26:48.360 --> 26:50.040
which is a third dynamic,

26:50.040 --> 26:52.400
is inherently good for all the dynamics.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.720
So that's where you get the ends justifying the means

26:55.720 --> 26:59.120
to do anything possible and use any means necessary

26:59.120 --> 27:00.520
to forward the aims of Scientology.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.560
That's kind of where a lot of Soviet implementation

27:03.560 --> 27:07.160
of communism went wrong is the ends justify the means,

27:07.160 --> 27:10.520
the equality, the justice for the workers.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.120
If we have to kill, murder, and prison,

27:13.120 --> 27:15.800
censor in the name of that,

27:15.800 --> 27:18.640
then it's for the greater good in the long term

27:18.640 --> 27:21.120
to achieve the ideal of communism.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.680
In some respects, Scientology created

27:22.680 --> 27:24.360
a near perfect communist experiment

27:24.360 --> 27:26.440
in its organization.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.280
What is it?

27:27.280 --> 27:28.200
From everyone according to their ability

27:28.200 --> 27:31.040
to each according to their need or something like that,

27:31.040 --> 27:33.280
Scientology C organization is damn near

27:33.280 --> 27:34.800
a perfect communist experiment.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.440
Coming from someone who doesn't necessarily know

27:37.440 --> 27:39.080
what the perfect communist experiment really is

27:39.080 --> 27:40.440
because I grew up in a cult, Lex.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.800
You can't keep using that as an excuse.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.280
It's a funny tagline I use in my videos.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.120
I like it.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.000
It is interesting that an organization

27:48.000 --> 27:51.040
that is so hyper capitalist and so money hungry

27:51.040 --> 27:52.520
and is known to be very wealthy,

27:52.520 --> 27:55.120
at its core is run by these group of C org members

27:55.120 --> 27:58.280
that live a communist lifestyle.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
We're gonna jump around.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.520
Let's go, what is C org?

28:00.520 --> 28:01.480
What is C organization?

28:01.480 --> 28:02.320
What is this organization?

28:02.320 --> 28:04.800
The C organization is the most dedicated version,

28:04.800 --> 28:06.920
the most dedicated brand of Scientologists.

28:06.920 --> 28:11.920
So there's three like echelons of Scientologists.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.320
There's public who just live normal lives

28:14.320 --> 28:15.560
in the real world and they pay

28:15.560 --> 28:17.800
to do Scientology courses and auditing.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.920
Then there's staff members who also live in the real world,

28:21.920 --> 28:24.080
but work on two and a half year contracts

28:24.120 --> 28:26.680
or five year contracts at their local Scientology organization.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.040
And then once they finished their contract,

28:28.040 --> 28:29.960
their debt is paid or whatever.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.200
And then there's the C org members.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.360
These are the guys who signed the billion year contracts.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.960
They don't have lives in the outside world.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.080
They don't own property.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.000
They live in Scientology provided housing.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.920
They eat Scientology run cafeterias.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.400
Is there an actual contract that says a billion years?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.120
It's symbolic, but yes.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.600
Like no, it's not a legally enforceable contract.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.560
They haven't succeeded in enforcing it

28:51.560 --> 28:54.040
in any subsequent lifetimes yet.

28:55.000 --> 28:55.840
Marriage contracts should be like that.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.640
A billion year, not till death do us part,

28:58.640 --> 29:01.640
but a billion years, it really makes it very concrete

29:01.640 --> 29:02.720
of what you're signing up for.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.760
Yeah, those are the billion year guys.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.360
You hear a lot about the billion year contract,

29:06.360 --> 29:07.240
the billion year contract.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.440
That's the C org.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.800
And all of Scientology management,

29:11.800 --> 29:13.400
international management, middle management,

29:13.400 --> 29:15.000
continental management,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.920
and even some lower level service orgs

29:16.920 --> 29:20.560
are one composed 100% of C org members.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.760
You're not allowed to marry or date someone

29:22.760 --> 29:24.280
who's not in the C org.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.080
You're also not allowed to have children

29:26.960 --> 29:28.640
with anybody outside the C org in general.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.600
You're not allowed to have children.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.240
C org members are not allowed to have children

29:31.240 --> 29:32.400
unless they leave the C org.

29:32.400 --> 29:36.000
If you're expected to have an abortion

29:36.000 --> 29:36.840
and stay in the C org,

29:36.840 --> 29:38.760
because it's the greatest good for Scientology

29:38.760 --> 29:40.440
if you accidentally get pregnant.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.640
Interesting, because it distracts

29:41.640 --> 29:42.920
from the focus of the work.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.760
Yeah.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.360
What about sexual relations?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.520
Only once married,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.720
but that's why people get married after like three days.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.040
You're like, hey you, you look all right.

29:51.040 --> 29:51.860
Let's get married.

29:51.860 --> 29:53.420
You're allowed to have divorce?

29:53.420 --> 29:55.420
Yeah, you get divorced a lot in the C org.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.900
I've known people who get married and divorced

29:56.900 --> 29:59.540
three times by like, by the age of 25.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.380
Oh wow.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.620
Because in the C org getting married

30:01.620 --> 30:03.380
is practically like dating.

30:03.380 --> 30:04.220
Right.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.620
Also, unless you're married,

30:05.620 --> 30:07.820
you're living in dorms with a bunch of other people.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.140
So in order to get your own room,

30:09.140 --> 30:10.700
you also have to get married.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.500
So there's many benefits.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.900
Oh wow, okay.

30:13.900 --> 30:17.820
So you mentioned communism in which way,

30:17.820 --> 30:20.980
cause there is there a hierarchy inside C org?

30:20.980 --> 30:24.220
Is there a redistribution of influence,

30:24.220 --> 30:28.140
position, money, power inside C org?

30:28.140 --> 30:30.940
Everyone in the C org makes $50 a week.

30:30.940 --> 30:31.780
Everybody.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.980
Except David Miscavige, but.

30:32.980 --> 30:33.820
Right.

30:33.820 --> 30:37.540
And some, some posts might have a cash bonus

30:37.540 --> 30:38.600
incentive structure,

30:38.600 --> 30:41.300
but fundamentally their pay is $50 a week.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.220
So, so even the head of a big Scientology organization

30:46.740 --> 30:48.140
is getting 50 bucks a week.

30:48.980 --> 30:52.220
Are celebrities also part of C org or not usually?

30:52.220 --> 30:54.180
So this is really the management layer.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.980
So what's the idea behind $50 a week?

30:57.980 --> 31:00.660
Is that basically live a humble life?

31:00.660 --> 31:02.060
They don't have to give you anything at all.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.220
It's just, oh, you mean like,

31:03.220 --> 31:04.940
what's the idea behind not paying?

31:04.940 --> 31:06.340
Yeah, basically not paying.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.420
Everything you need is already being provided for you.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.420
You're not here for the money.

31:11.420 --> 31:12.540
You're working all the time anyway.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.100
It's not like you don't have days off.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.940
I mean, you're, you're, you're working all the time.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.380
There's, there's not, it's,

31:17.420 --> 31:18.860
there's no concept of the weekends.

31:18.860 --> 31:20.740
There's no, oh, thank God it's Friday.

31:20.740 --> 31:21.980
Friday is just another day.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.500
And how are the position, the tasks,

31:23.500 --> 31:26.660
the jobs allocated within the C org?

31:26.660 --> 31:27.500
What do you mean?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.060
Like, like what kind of tasks you're doing?

31:29.060 --> 31:30.660
What kind of stuff you're doing?

31:30.660 --> 31:33.740
It's very similar to just any other business

31:33.740 --> 31:35.500
as far as you can have your human resources,

31:35.500 --> 31:37.140
you can have your sales, you can have your accounting,

31:37.140 --> 31:39.260
your operations, your quality control.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.260
It's just that in Scientology,

31:40.260 --> 31:43.820
your operations is delivering courses and auditing.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.140
So your operations and your quality control

31:47.820 --> 31:49.340
is where most of the activity occurs

31:49.340 --> 31:52.260
as far as delivering Scientology.

31:52.260 --> 31:55.060
And then you've got your, you call it business development,

31:55.060 --> 31:57.380
but that's just bringing in new members, right?

31:57.380 --> 32:01.620
So the, the, the function of a Scientology organization

32:01.620 --> 32:06.300
is very, very comparable to a normal business

32:06.300 --> 32:07.980
in the normal world.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.820
So let's talk about the products of this business,

32:10.820 --> 32:11.940
auditing and courses.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.340
So what's auditing?

32:13.340 --> 32:15.620
So auditing is, so we described earlier,

32:15.620 --> 32:17.300
Dianetics auditing.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.900
Scientology auditing is very similar to that.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.660
So at first glance, it looks like psychotherapy,

32:23.660 --> 32:24.900
a kind of therapy.

32:24.900 --> 32:28.660
All Scientology auditing is going to look like that.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.180
It's one-on-one talk therapy.

32:32.260 --> 32:35.700
You're in a room by yourselves, no distraction, no noise.

32:35.700 --> 32:36.540
One-on-one?

32:36.540 --> 32:37.460
Yeah.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.300
So like this?

32:38.300 --> 32:39.700
Yeah, but, and in Scientology,

32:39.700 --> 32:41.940
they have what's called an e-meter.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.780
Who writes?

32:42.780 --> 32:45.100
Almost all auditing employs the use of an e-meter.

32:45.100 --> 32:46.620
What's an e-meter?

32:46.620 --> 32:50.980
So an e-meter is a device that just measures

32:50.980 --> 32:53.420
the resistance to a small electrical flow,

32:53.420 --> 32:55.500
except Scientologists believe that this e-meter

32:55.500 --> 32:57.940
can be used to simply direct the progress

32:57.940 --> 32:59.940
of an auditing session to determine whether

33:02.100 --> 33:07.100
the auditing has reached a good satisfactory conclusion.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.460
All auditing sessions have to end

33:11.460 --> 33:13.660
on a satisfactory conclusion.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.020
Like that's the job of the auditor.

33:15.940 --> 33:17.980
It's not like, sorry, the session sucked, see you next week.

33:17.980 --> 33:18.940
It's not like that.

33:18.940 --> 33:23.500
Every auditing session has to end on a positive note.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.740
And if it doesn't, there's corrections to be made.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.660
So the e-meter.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.020
What does it look like visually?

33:30.020 --> 33:31.220
Oh, you can pull it up.

33:32.300 --> 33:35.060
Pull up mark eight, e-meter mark eight.

33:35.060 --> 33:36.900
So there's a few dials.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.020
Yeah.

33:38.020 --> 33:41.740
There's basic information about time and duration,

33:41.740 --> 33:43.100
and I'm presuming that a dial

33:43.100 --> 33:45.140
that just goes zero to something.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.820
Okay, so let's say that the meter's in front of me

33:47.820 --> 33:49.740
and you're the one holding the cans.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.580
I'm holding the cans, so you're doing the auditing of me.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.420
Yeah.

33:53.420 --> 33:54.740
Okay, I'm holding the cans.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.460
No, literally in the beginning of an auditing session

33:56.460 --> 33:59.140
when you're calibrating the sensitivity of the e-meter,

33:59.140 --> 34:00.420
you do a can squeeze.

34:00.420 --> 34:01.780
So I gotta squeeze the cans, please.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.340
Okay, so I'm just like squeezing the cans.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.700
And I'm just changing the sensitivity

34:04.700 --> 34:05.660
because when you squeeze the cans,

34:05.660 --> 34:08.220
I wanna get about a one-third of a dial drop on the needle.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.820
The idea is you don't want, if the needle's too sensitive,

34:10.820 --> 34:12.620
then every time you shift around in your chair,

34:12.620 --> 34:13.940
the needle's gonna bounce all over the place.

34:13.940 --> 34:16.220
So you're trying to set the sensitivity of this thing.

34:16.220 --> 34:20.020
And that's all, the knob there on the bottom to the left,

34:20.020 --> 34:21.980
that's the sensitivity knob,

34:21.980 --> 34:24.900
and that determines just how sensitive

34:24.900 --> 34:26.100
the needle's gonna be.

34:26.100 --> 34:30.220
And the bigger dial is called the tone arm,

34:30.220 --> 34:34.380
and that is changing, I wanna say voltage or current,

34:34.380 --> 34:35.660
but I'm not intending, I'm gonna get

34:35.660 --> 34:36.820
one of those words is wrong, right?

34:36.820 --> 34:38.220
But it is a real device.

34:38.220 --> 34:39.060
It's a real device.

34:39.060 --> 34:43.740
So you can actually calibrate to probably

34:45.060 --> 34:46.860
get an outcome that you want.

34:46.860 --> 34:49.260
Yeah, so here's even just how a Scientology auditor

34:49.260 --> 34:50.380
believes it works.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.180
You're holding the cans, there's a tiny little battery

34:53.180 --> 34:54.380
in that emitter that's sending,

34:54.380 --> 34:56.260
you're completing the circuit when you pick up the cans,

34:56.260 --> 34:58.580
right, so you got a little thing going there.

34:58.580 --> 35:02.140
And that needle will respond to your physical movement,

35:02.140 --> 35:03.180
but that's not what we want.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.420
We want you to sit the hell still

35:04.420 --> 35:05.660
so that we can read this thing

35:05.660 --> 35:07.340
when I'm asking you questions.

35:07.860 --> 35:10.380
So you're sitting there still, very still.

35:10.380 --> 35:12.860
As still as you can, comfortable, right?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.020
And I'm gonna go, is there something

35:14.020 --> 35:15.300
you're withholding from me?

35:15.300 --> 35:17.220
And what I'm looking for is right when I say

35:17.220 --> 35:18.860
at the end of me, I'm looking for the needle

35:18.860 --> 35:19.900
to dip to the right.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.300
Having a needle, even if it's kind of random,

35:23.180 --> 35:27.060
can really be like a catalyst for a conversation.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.860
That's what it's used for,

35:28.860 --> 35:30.780
except it's an enforced conversation.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.060
So I'll give you a really good example of this.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.860
So you're holding the cans, say is there anything

35:36.860 --> 35:38.780
you're withholding from me?

35:38.780 --> 35:40.900
And I get an instant read.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.060
And I go, is there anything you're withholding from me?

35:43.060 --> 35:44.660
You're gonna go, I don't think so.

35:44.660 --> 35:45.900
And I don't see the needle.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.780
No, you don't see the needle.

35:47.780 --> 35:49.700
I go, well, what did you think of

35:49.700 --> 35:50.820
when I asked you the question?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.140
Now, if you've already had a lot of auditing,

35:52.140 --> 35:53.100
you know how this goes.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.300
It means I got an instant read

35:54.300 --> 35:56.740
and we're not going to move on

35:56.740 --> 35:58.580
until this question gets resolved.

35:58.580 --> 35:59.540
Okay, so you're gonna go, I don't know

35:59.540 --> 36:00.860
what I was thinking of.

36:00.860 --> 36:02.820
And then I'm gonna be like, you know, take a look

36:02.820 --> 36:03.700
and I'll help you out here.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.180
I'll try to steer you.

36:05.180 --> 36:07.060
Okay, so I'm looking to get roughly the same read

36:07.060 --> 36:09.060
while you're thinking about whatever.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.340
I mean, what was that?

36:10.340 --> 36:11.460
What was that right there?

36:11.460 --> 36:13.620
And you can start digging to what?

36:13.620 --> 36:14.460
You can start.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.340
I just want an answer to the question.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.180
Okay.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.260
And I can go to memory.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.220
Yeah, and you can give me any answer you want.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.100
There's no way for me to know

36:21.100 --> 36:22.380
if you're giving me the right answer,

36:22.380 --> 36:24.260
but I want you to give me something.

36:24.260 --> 36:25.540
If you say you can't give me anything,

36:25.540 --> 36:26.620
I'm gonna keep using the email

36:26.620 --> 36:28.060
until you give me something.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.740
Okay, so let's say you give me something.

36:30.740 --> 36:32.900
I'm gonna get all the details about that.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.620
And until like time, place, form, and event,

36:35.620 --> 36:36.500
I wanna know everything that happened.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.500
I wanna know all the details.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.620
And by the way, I'm writing all this down.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.060
So I'm taking notes of everything you're telling me

36:40.060 --> 36:41.340
that it's a bad thing that you did

36:41.340 --> 36:43.020
that you haven't told me about.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.700
Okay, so I'm keeping notes.

36:44.700 --> 36:45.620
When you represent to me

36:45.620 --> 36:47.460
that you've told me everything there is to tell,

36:47.460 --> 36:49.700
I'm looking for the needle

36:49.700 --> 36:53.140
to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this.

36:53.140 --> 36:55.340
And Scientology calls that a floating needle.

36:55.340 --> 36:59.620
That means in Scientology land, we're done with that.

36:59.620 --> 37:01.260
So now I might go back to check the question.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.340
Okay, good, I'll check the question again.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.220
Is there anything you're withholding from me?

37:04.220 --> 37:05.180
Ooh, if I get another read,

37:05.180 --> 37:06.820
we gotta go through the process again.

37:06.820 --> 37:09.580
Okay, if you tell me I've told you everything

37:09.580 --> 37:10.860
and I don't get a floating needle,

37:10.860 --> 37:15.860
I've gotta go, okay, is there an earlier similar thing?

37:16.020 --> 37:17.580
Have you basically done an earlier similar thing?

37:17.580 --> 37:18.660
Is there an earlier similar time

37:18.660 --> 37:19.660
you haven't told someone something

37:19.660 --> 37:21.100
or is there an earlier similar thing

37:21.100 --> 37:23.580
that you did the thing that you just told me?

37:23.580 --> 37:25.820
We're gonna keep going earlier similar,

37:25.820 --> 37:27.220
earlier similar, earlier similar

37:27.220 --> 37:28.940
until I get a floating needle.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.420
And that's where I'm explaining it this way.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.020
You can see how no matter

37:33.020 --> 37:36.380
what the specific auditing session happens to be about,

37:36.380 --> 37:38.140
there's still the potential in any auditing session

37:38.140 --> 37:40.300
that you're going into past lives.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.740
Just because you have to go earlier similar

37:42.740 --> 37:44.100
until you get a floating needle.

37:44.100 --> 37:47.780
Okay, now here's how Scientologists think

37:47.780 --> 37:48.980
the emitter actually works,

37:48.980 --> 37:50.940
meaning why does the emitter work?

37:50.940 --> 37:55.220
So we talked before about these mental pictures,

37:55.220 --> 37:56.980
these recordings.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.460
Well, we spoke about engrams,

37:58.460 --> 38:01.220
just recordings of pain and unconsciousness.

38:01.220 --> 38:05.380
Well, Scientology would hold the bad recordings

38:05.380 --> 38:07.620
aren't the only recordings that you have.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.780
Those are just the recordings in your reactive mind.

38:09.780 --> 38:11.500
You also have an analytical mind,

38:11.500 --> 38:13.980
which is just your conscious memory,

38:13.980 --> 38:15.780
conscious recording of everything from present time

38:15.780 --> 38:17.940
to the last 76 trillion years.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.740
And Hubbard would say that these memories

38:20.740 --> 38:23.620
are actually a perfectly detailed recording.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.140
And he says like 56 perceptions or something.

38:26.140 --> 38:28.020
And that it's perfect.

38:28.020 --> 38:31.580
And you can access that information,

38:31.580 --> 38:33.140
you just have trouble doing so.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.420
Okay, so he says that these recordings,

38:35.420 --> 38:38.740
these mental pictures have actual electrical charge in mass.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.460
Now you asked before,

38:40.460 --> 38:42.060
is there any actual physics in this?

38:42.060 --> 38:44.300
I don't know, where are you supposed to store the pictures

38:44.300 --> 38:47.860
of your last 76 trillion years that have charge in mass?

38:47.860 --> 38:50.100
I don't see it, but Hubbard says it's there.

38:50.100 --> 38:54.580
Okay, so he says that these things have mass.

38:54.580 --> 38:58.180
And when you recall them or put attention on them,

38:58.180 --> 39:00.380
you create an electrical flow,

39:00.380 --> 39:02.940
which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever,

39:02.940 --> 39:07.940
impinges upon the electrical flow of the E-meter.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.020
And it shows up as a read on the needle.

39:10.020 --> 39:12.540
That's how Scientologists believe

39:12.540 --> 39:15.500
that's why the needle reads.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.940
Now, Cynics would say the needle only reads

39:17.940 --> 39:20.620
on palm sweat and movement.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.300
Well, I know that's not true, right?

39:23.540 --> 39:26.660
I can't tell you everything the needle does read on,

39:26.660 --> 39:29.180
but I can tell you it's not just

39:29.180 --> 39:31.140
moving your hands and sweaty hands.

39:31.140 --> 39:33.620
It does correlate to thoughts, probably.

39:33.620 --> 39:35.100
Some way, somehow.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.420
Because if it didn't correlate to thoughts,

39:36.420 --> 39:39.780
that this process would be way too inefficient.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.780
Because there's going to be a bunch of people

39:43.780 --> 39:46.180
who are just not, you're not gonna get the,

39:46.180 --> 39:48.340
what is it called, the floating needle,

39:48.340 --> 39:49.740
like no matter what.

39:49.740 --> 39:52.340
I can't explain to you how you get a floating needle,

39:52.340 --> 39:54.180
but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat,

39:54.180 --> 39:55.980
and it sure as hell isn't squeezing the cans.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.180
Right, so you eventually,

39:57.180 --> 39:59.340
most people will get to the floating needle.

39:59.340 --> 40:00.780
And somehow- You get floating needles.

40:00.780 --> 40:01.620
There's like a feed,

40:01.620 --> 40:03.300
there probably is a feedback mechanism

40:03.300 --> 40:08.300
that each person realizes how their mind and body,

40:08.540 --> 40:10.260
because you want a resolution, right?

40:10.260 --> 40:11.780
It's probably- You want your needle to float.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.860
For both people.

40:12.860 --> 40:13.700
Yes.

40:13.700 --> 40:14.940
And it's probably a great experience

40:14.940 --> 40:17.620
when you're like, yes, it's a gamified feeling, right?

40:17.620 --> 40:19.500
Well, when you're training on how to use the E-meter,

40:19.500 --> 40:22.140
there are drills where you practice,

40:22.660 --> 40:25.220
generating with your mind various needle reactions.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.180
So there is a drill where you sit there

40:27.180 --> 40:29.140
and you consciously try to create a floating needle

40:29.140 --> 40:31.140
by recalling happy thoughts.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.020
Go to your happy place.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.420
And at the end of every auditing session,

40:34.420 --> 40:36.980
you actually have to go to a third party,

40:36.980 --> 40:38.140
sit down in front of an E-meter

40:38.140 --> 40:39.540
and verify that your needle's floating.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.380
Nice.

40:40.380 --> 40:41.660
Every single auditing session

40:41.660 --> 40:42.980
not only has to end on a floating needle,

40:42.980 --> 40:44.220
but then you have to go to someone else

40:44.220 --> 40:45.940
and have the floating needle verified.

40:45.940 --> 40:50.700
Any Scientologist who's a seasoned recipient of auditing

40:50.700 --> 40:52.780
knows how to make their needle float at the examiner.

40:52.780 --> 40:57.100
But I got to be honest though, this process, again,

40:57.100 --> 40:58.540
sorry to be sort of going there,

40:58.540 --> 41:03.540
but it feels like this is a very rigorous talk therapy session.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.300
Is there good aspects to this?

41:08.300 --> 41:09.140
Sure.

41:09.140 --> 41:10.860
A lot of people find auditing very helpful.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.260
I mean, I've heard some describe it

41:12.260 --> 41:14.420
as quite thoroughly addictive.

41:14.420 --> 41:16.980
Me personally, I never enjoyed getting auditing.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.740
That's probably more a function of having been raised in it.

41:19.740 --> 41:21.300
And it was never something I wanted to do.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.100
It was something that was forced on me as a child.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.340
And also I was never,

41:24.340 --> 41:26.420
I don't like talking about private secret stuff.

41:26.420 --> 41:30.820
You kind of have to want to be an open book

41:30.820 --> 41:33.580
to honestly and thoroughly participate

41:33.580 --> 41:34.540
in an auditing session.

41:34.540 --> 41:36.540
Because there's not necessarily a belief

41:36.540 --> 41:37.980
that this is going to be private.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.860
There's no expectation of privacy,

41:39.860 --> 41:41.460
but there's no expectation

41:41.460 --> 41:44.100
that your stuff's going to be leaked for blackmail either.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.420
You kind of-

41:45.420 --> 41:47.860
You trust the people in the organization.

41:47.860 --> 41:49.700
Even despite rumors and stuff like that.

41:50.660 --> 41:52.340
But the rumors are coming from people

41:52.340 --> 41:54.780
that are lying to you, essentially.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.460
If you're a Scientologist

41:56.460 --> 42:00.220
and you're participating in an auditing session,

42:00.220 --> 42:02.580
you know that anyone in the organization

42:02.580 --> 42:05.980
has the ability to know the stuff that you talk.

42:05.980 --> 42:07.780
It's not like, oh my God, I'm only telling my auditor

42:07.780 --> 42:09.060
because I think no one's ever going to know.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.460
You know that people know,

42:10.460 --> 42:12.580
but you also trust the organization.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.100
How quickly does it go to past memories?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.300
For people who are seasoned,

42:17.340 --> 42:19.380
going past life.

42:19.380 --> 42:20.500
I hated it.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.620
I would make sure,

42:21.620 --> 42:23.260
I was really good at making my needle float.

42:23.260 --> 42:24.620
I didn't want to have some auditor,

42:24.620 --> 42:27.060
because I never believed in the past life memories.

42:27.060 --> 42:29.540
So I didn't want to be in that impassable,

42:29.540 --> 42:30.980
reach an impasse in an auditing session

42:30.980 --> 42:32.820
where I was being asked for something I couldn't provide.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.460
Because I knew this auditing session

42:34.460 --> 42:36.060
has to end on a good point.

42:36.060 --> 42:39.380
But Scientologists enjoy, for the most part,

42:39.380 --> 42:40.220
they call it whole track.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.740
Whole track is past life.

42:41.740 --> 42:42.780
Going whole track.

42:42.780 --> 42:44.540
Your time track, they call it the time track,

42:44.540 --> 42:45.700
is your whole memory.

42:45.860 --> 42:48.540
But whole track refers to anything past life.

42:48.540 --> 42:50.860
So going whole track or deep whole track

42:50.860 --> 42:52.020
with high reality.

42:52.020 --> 42:52.860
Meaning, it's not like,

42:52.860 --> 42:55.260
oh, I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not sure if it's real.

42:55.260 --> 42:57.900
Like your real seasoned Scientologists are like,

42:57.900 --> 43:00.340
oh yeah, I was on this planet at this time,

43:00.340 --> 43:01.180
circling this garden.

43:01.180 --> 43:02.220
This is what I was eating for breakfast.

43:02.220 --> 43:03.060
Fascinating.

43:03.060 --> 43:05.340
Before the origin of life on earth.

43:05.340 --> 43:08.460
So billions of years ago,

43:08.460 --> 43:11.220
on a distant planet where you were eating for breakfast.

43:11.220 --> 43:12.500
Or other universes.

43:12.500 --> 43:15.220
I wonder if there's a nice shortcut

43:16.260 --> 43:18.780
to sneak up to actual trauma that happened to you

43:18.780 --> 43:20.300
as a therapy device.

43:20.300 --> 43:23.220
I just, so putting Scientology aside is just,

43:23.220 --> 43:26.020
I'm thinking about as a technique for therapy.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.340
Discussing, basically, you know,

43:28.340 --> 43:29.500
some people have trauma.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.060
And one of the things you do with therapy

43:31.060 --> 43:32.620
is like bring the trauma to the surface.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.660
That's the stuff that happened to your childhood.

43:34.660 --> 43:37.260
Maybe it's a more convenient thing to do.

43:37.260 --> 43:42.260
To kind of map that indirectly onto a fictitious telling

43:42.340 --> 43:44.260
of what happened to you.

43:44.260 --> 43:47.620
Something like that trauma on a distant planet elsewhere.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.500
Could be a nice way to sneak up to it.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.340
Yeah.

43:50.340 --> 43:51.180
And it goes both flows there.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.220
Not just things that have happened to you,

43:52.220 --> 43:53.980
but things that you've done.

43:53.980 --> 43:56.780
So, you know, you could be being asked for it.

43:56.780 --> 43:57.900
You know, you'd be going back to,

43:57.900 --> 43:59.940
I wiped out a civilization.

43:59.940 --> 44:03.220
I committed genocide on this race on this planet.

44:03.220 --> 44:04.060
Oh wow.

44:04.060 --> 44:05.180
Oh yeah.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.900
But so you can actually take on a whole new guilt.

44:07.900 --> 44:08.740
Oh yeah.

44:08.740 --> 44:10.100
So, okay.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.100
All right, you might actually take on a lot more guilt

44:12.940 --> 44:13.940
than I go off.

44:13.940 --> 44:17.540
Because if you feel like that self-critical aspect

44:17.540 --> 44:20.220
of the brain, boy.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.500
Because my brain is really self-critical.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
So I could see myself manufacturing

44:24.500 --> 44:26.220
if I was forced to over time.

44:26.220 --> 44:28.340
Some kind of story where I did genocide

44:28.340 --> 44:30.300
a whole population of like Pluto or something

44:30.300 --> 44:33.020
at a distant and somewhere in Alpha Centauri.

44:33.020 --> 44:35.820
Yeah, so I mean, now I walk around with that guilt.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.700
Wait, am I actually a horrible person?

44:37.700 --> 44:40.380
So imagine though, if you had not only are you looking at,

44:40.700 --> 44:42.180
if someone's being self-critical,

44:42.180 --> 44:44.540
trying to identify destructive patterns of behavior

44:44.540 --> 44:45.380
in your present life.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.780
But what if you really internalize the fact that

44:47.780 --> 44:51.220
I haven't only been this way for 40 years.

44:51.220 --> 44:53.180
I've been this way for 40 trillion years.

44:53.180 --> 44:54.620
Yeah.

44:54.620 --> 44:59.620
But Scientology would argue that as a Thetan

44:59.660 --> 45:01.900
you're inherently good.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.580
All Thetans are basically good.

45:03.580 --> 45:06.100
So the goal of the auditing procedure there

45:06.100 --> 45:08.700
would be essentially to figure out, find the moment,

45:08.700 --> 45:12.820
find what it was that caused you to make that shift

45:12.820 --> 45:16.620
as a being, to dramatize, you know,

45:16.620 --> 45:18.380
evil intentions and stuff like that.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.980
So even if you're going whole track,

45:20.980 --> 45:23.180
looking at all the horrible things you've done,

45:23.180 --> 45:24.980
the goal is to find like,

45:24.980 --> 45:26.420
well, what happened just prior to that?

45:26.420 --> 45:28.060
What was like the prior confusion?

45:28.060 --> 45:29.700
And what did you misunderstand

45:29.700 --> 45:31.180
just before that and whatnot?

45:31.180 --> 45:32.820
So the goal is basically,

45:32.820 --> 45:34.700
so Scientologists after a lot of auditing

45:34.700 --> 45:39.460
are also convinced that they have fixed the reason

45:39.460 --> 45:42.380
for any non-optimum conduct.

45:42.380 --> 45:44.340
And underlying this as a belief that

45:44.340 --> 45:46.620
at the core we're all good.

45:46.620 --> 45:47.460
Yes.

45:47.460 --> 45:49.860
There's a lot of really powerful ideas in Scientology,

45:49.860 --> 45:53.020
which is so interesting that it goes wrong.

45:53.020 --> 45:55.500
Okay, what about the training you mentioned,

45:55.500 --> 45:56.780
the training of the auditor?

45:56.780 --> 45:57.860
That's really interesting.

45:57.860 --> 46:00.020
So what's, how lengthy is that process?

46:00.020 --> 46:01.820
It can take years.

46:01.820 --> 46:03.980
I mean, one of that question I want to ask is,

46:03.980 --> 46:06.500
are people in C-Org, like as an auditor,

46:06.500 --> 46:08.060
do you believe everything?

46:08.060 --> 46:12.980
How much is there a crisis of faith that creeps in?

46:12.980 --> 46:14.540
In religion, you have a crisis of faith

46:14.540 --> 46:17.860
when you start to wonder like, does God even exist?

46:17.860 --> 46:21.580
So in this case, how often do you start to doubt

46:21.580 --> 46:25.180
that some of the core beliefs of Scientology are false?

46:26.020 --> 46:28.700
Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs.

46:28.700 --> 46:31.780
It's about application of the techniques

46:31.780 --> 46:35.020
of Scientology auditing to improve someone's spiritual

46:35.020 --> 46:36.900
awareness and ability.

46:36.900 --> 46:40.900
So the belief level of Scientology is pretty much

46:40.900 --> 46:42.100
the stuff we've already discussed.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.780
The effectiveness of the auditing process.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.900
So the effectiveness of the auditing process,

46:45.900 --> 46:47.140
this is one of the things Hubbard says,

46:47.140 --> 46:50.820
is that standard tech, standard Scientology,

46:50.820 --> 46:52.180
they call it the tech, the technology

46:52.180 --> 46:54.140
of how to deliver auditing, standard tech,

46:54.140 --> 46:59.140
works 100% of the time when applied 100% correctly.

47:00.140 --> 47:01.860
Well, that's kind of unfalsifiable, right?

47:01.860 --> 47:02.700
Yeah.

47:02.700 --> 47:03.540
Because anytime it doesn't work-

47:03.540 --> 47:04.620
It wasn't applied correctly.

47:04.620 --> 47:05.940
Exactly.

47:05.940 --> 47:08.260
That's a nice little escape hatch

47:08.260 --> 47:10.540
to pull on having a crisis of faith.

47:10.540 --> 47:11.380
But it didn't work.

47:11.380 --> 47:14.540
Well, then obviously it wasn't applied correctly.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.500
That's where quality control comes in.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.540
Their job is to nitpick.

47:18.540 --> 47:20.900
You can always find one thing that wasn't done correctly.

47:20.900 --> 47:25.300
Communism didn't work because it wasn't implemented correctly.

47:25.420 --> 47:29.580
That's the, it's always an escape hatch with ideologies.

47:29.580 --> 47:30.420
That's right.

47:30.420 --> 47:31.260
That's right.

47:31.260 --> 47:34.740
I would probably argue that auditors are not

47:34.740 --> 47:36.900
in a position of having many crises of faith

47:36.900 --> 47:39.300
because actually they're usually seeing people,

47:39.300 --> 47:43.260
for the most part, improve in some ways

47:43.260 --> 47:44.660
through the process of auditing.

47:44.660 --> 47:48.420
Now, auditing can create a somewhat of a euphoric state.

47:48.420 --> 47:49.940
You feel great.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.220
You're just blown out of your head.

47:52.220 --> 47:54.100
You feel on top of the world.

47:54.100 --> 47:56.300
I've had that in some of my auditing.

47:56.300 --> 47:57.340
As an auditor, sorry?

47:57.340 --> 47:59.180
No, as a person receiving auditing.

47:59.180 --> 48:00.740
And so my point is that as an auditor

48:00.740 --> 48:02.300
doing a lot of auditing,

48:02.300 --> 48:03.540
you're gonna have someone in front of you

48:03.540 --> 48:05.700
called the pre-clear is the person in front of you

48:05.700 --> 48:08.660
who's getting the auditing, called the PC or the pre-clear.

48:08.660 --> 48:10.580
They see over and over and over again,

48:10.580 --> 48:12.780
these PCs having these sort of euphoric states

48:12.780 --> 48:15.060
and floating needles and I feel great and fantastic.

48:15.060 --> 48:18.180
Oh, thanks, you saved my life and da da da da da.

48:18.180 --> 48:21.420
I've always said, if people didn't find Scientology helpful,

48:21.420 --> 48:23.380
nobody would ever stay in Scientology.

48:24.380 --> 48:26.420
And so auditors are pretty much the ones

48:26.420 --> 48:28.100
doing the heavy lifting of what it even means

48:28.100 --> 48:29.660
to be a Scientologist.

48:29.660 --> 48:30.500
Those guys aren't the ones

48:30.500 --> 48:33.060
that you end up having crisis of faith.

48:33.060 --> 48:34.860
I mean, doing Scientology, auditing,

48:34.860 --> 48:38.580
it doesn't require that you just have faith

48:38.580 --> 48:40.060
that you believe something.

48:40.060 --> 48:41.740
You just have to go through these motions.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.660
And Scientologists, one of the reasons Scientologists think

48:43.660 --> 48:45.860
this is all scientific is because it's like,

48:45.860 --> 48:48.460
I don't care if you believe why this works.

48:48.460 --> 48:51.060
I care how you feel at the end of an auditing session.

48:51.060 --> 48:55.140
And empirically speaking, anecdotal data is,

48:55.140 --> 48:57.060
it actually seems to improve people's lives

48:57.060 --> 48:58.740
within the context.

48:58.740 --> 49:01.260
So taking the outside world out of it,

49:01.260 --> 49:03.820
within this particular organization,

49:03.820 --> 49:06.940
you're actually measurably seeing improvement.

49:06.940 --> 49:07.780
Yes.

49:07.780 --> 49:10.220
Is that to some degree real?

49:10.220 --> 49:13.380
Because if you look at a book like Animal Farm,

49:13.380 --> 49:16.860
where the pigs start to rule the other animals

49:16.860 --> 49:18.820
and over time, the life of the animals

49:18.820 --> 49:19.980
gets worse and worse and worse

49:20.020 --> 49:21.260
while the pigs keep saying

49:21.260 --> 49:22.820
that it's actually getting better and better and better.

49:22.820 --> 49:24.580
Again, communism, same thing.

49:24.580 --> 49:26.860
The rationing is getting worse and worse and worse,

49:26.860 --> 49:28.180
less and less food.

49:28.180 --> 49:29.780
But there's constant reporting

49:30.660 --> 49:31.900
that there's more and more food.

49:31.900 --> 49:34.300
We're winning, hashtag.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.900
I would argue that what you've just described

49:36.900 --> 49:40.220
could be an identical description of what it feels like

49:40.220 --> 49:41.860
and what it means to go up Scientology's bridge

49:41.860 --> 49:43.460
to total freedom.

49:43.460 --> 49:45.300
You are reinforcing to yourself

49:45.300 --> 49:46.900
that everything's getting better and better and better.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.260
And you'd be like,

49:49.220 --> 49:51.500
you don't spend time with your family anymore.

49:51.500 --> 49:54.860
You're broke, even though you make a lot of money.

49:54.860 --> 49:56.820
You're always stressed.

49:56.820 --> 49:59.060
You're at the beck and call of these people

49:59.060 --> 50:01.620
who seem to run your lives.

50:01.620 --> 50:04.260
How a Scientologist feels about their own life

50:04.260 --> 50:07.460
is it's very interesting to compare that

50:07.460 --> 50:10.340
to how that person's life looks

50:10.340 --> 50:12.500
to their non-Scientology family members.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.380
I get contacted by a lot of people

50:14.380 --> 50:16.580
who've never been in Scientology,

50:16.620 --> 50:18.860
but they're like, I got a family member who's really deep

50:18.860 --> 50:20.860
and I just, can you help me understand some things?

50:20.860 --> 50:22.420
Why is this person's life like this?

50:22.420 --> 50:24.940
Why is this person's life like this?

50:24.940 --> 50:29.940
So I don't wanna say that Scientologists do not actually,

50:31.500 --> 50:32.820
I don't wanna say, oh, it's all in their heads.

50:32.820 --> 50:34.540
They think they're being helped, but they're really not.

50:34.540 --> 50:36.980
That doesn't feel honest, you know?

50:36.980 --> 50:39.700
But it's this thing where if Scientology

50:39.700 --> 50:44.700
was just getting auditing when you wanted

50:45.220 --> 50:48.380
about the subjects you wanted

50:48.380 --> 50:51.420
and you could take it or leave it, that would be fine.

50:51.420 --> 50:53.620
It's the fact that it's part and parcel

50:53.620 --> 50:57.700
to this entire organization and this entire experience

50:57.700 --> 51:01.740
that has, as a part of that experience,

51:01.740 --> 51:05.340
taking everything from you, demanding everything from you,

51:05.340 --> 51:07.860
controlling who you can speak with,

51:07.860 --> 51:10.020
controlling who you can have relationships with,

51:10.020 --> 51:11.860
who you have to erase from your life.

51:11.900 --> 51:15.780
This is where, and it's hard to place one pinpoint

51:15.780 --> 51:18.060
on this is where Scientology goes wrong.

51:18.060 --> 51:19.420
It's really hard to do that

51:19.420 --> 51:20.780
because the good parts of Scientology

51:20.780 --> 51:24.540
and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.740
Yeah, so there's definition of what's bad for you

51:26.740 --> 51:29.220
and it's probably in the beginning is bad for you.

51:30.540 --> 51:32.460
This almost just sounds like a template

51:32.460 --> 51:34.260
of a toxic relationship.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.020
You know, there's a bunch of stuff in this world

51:36.020 --> 51:37.420
that are just not good for you.

51:37.420 --> 51:41.500
So the authoritarian says like,

51:41.500 --> 51:44.260
I'm just protecting you by blocking you off

51:44.260 --> 51:45.100
from those negative things.

51:45.100 --> 51:47.700
And they're probably, they are probably negative things.

51:47.700 --> 51:51.980
But then this like, this freedom starts closing in

51:51.980 --> 51:54.580
to where you can't no longer speak freely,

51:54.580 --> 51:56.740
think freely, act freely.

51:56.740 --> 51:57.980
And then there's some, I mean,

51:57.980 --> 51:59.980
that's why sort of power corrupts

51:59.980 --> 52:01.940
and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

52:01.940 --> 52:04.500
That person doing the controlling

52:04.500 --> 52:08.340
actually starts getting that like dopamine rush

52:08.340 --> 52:10.140
of the controller that's exciting.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.620
It's a vicious negative cycle.

52:12.620 --> 52:16.460
So you start out as a, it starts out good

52:16.460 --> 52:19.180
because you're trying to do good for the person,

52:19.180 --> 52:21.860
but then it somehow goes to shit.

52:21.860 --> 52:24.380
So what are the aspects that just,

52:24.380 --> 52:27.740
that are often controlled about a person

52:27.740 --> 52:29.660
who's in Scientology, especially Sea Org?

52:29.660 --> 52:32.980
Well, information control, access to the internet,

52:32.980 --> 52:35.700
access to any information critical of Scientology.

52:35.700 --> 52:37.940
Is some internet access allowed?

52:38.860 --> 52:41.980
Public Scientologist has no restrictions

52:41.980 --> 52:43.700
to their access to the internet.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.500
They're just not allowed

52:45.500 --> 52:48.900
to read anything critical of Scientology.

52:48.900 --> 52:52.620
Oh, okay, so they're supposed to self control

52:52.620 --> 52:54.020
what they read or not.

52:54.020 --> 52:56.220
And what's the explanation?

52:56.220 --> 52:58.460
Is it always assumed that anything critical

52:58.460 --> 52:59.780
of Scientology is a lie?

53:00.660 --> 53:05.660
They really push this thing that unless you've been

53:06.260 --> 53:08.620
in a Scientology organization yourself,

53:08.620 --> 53:11.660
or unless you've actually been a Scientologist,

53:11.660 --> 53:14.020
you couldn't possibly know the truth about Scientology.

53:14.020 --> 53:15.580
If you're only getting information

53:15.580 --> 53:17.580
from people who aren't members or former members,

53:17.580 --> 53:19.340
then you couldn't possibly be getting

53:19.340 --> 53:20.740
the correct information.

53:20.740 --> 53:23.860
Now they don't realize the math there doesn't make sense.

53:23.860 --> 53:26.140
If you can find out the true information

53:26.140 --> 53:28.580
by becoming and being a Scientologist,

53:28.580 --> 53:31.260
then that means you can get the correct information

53:31.260 --> 53:32.340
from a former Scientologist

53:32.340 --> 53:33.420
because they traveled that path

53:33.420 --> 53:34.900
and they got the correct information.

53:34.900 --> 53:36.260
So they still create this,

53:36.260 --> 53:38.020
they try to create this unfalsifiable loop

53:38.020 --> 53:41.820
where unless you are personally doing it,

53:41.820 --> 53:44.100
you don't have correct information.

53:44.100 --> 53:44.940
And you go, well, what about people

53:44.940 --> 53:46.980
who did personally do it,

53:46.980 --> 53:50.500
got the correct information, left,

53:50.500 --> 53:51.740
and are now sharing that with others?

53:51.740 --> 53:52.740
Well, no, those are lies.

53:52.740 --> 53:56.020
Well, okay, so just anything you don't like is a lie then.

53:56.020 --> 53:56.940
You go, yeah, pretty much.

53:56.940 --> 53:58.620
That's kind of how it works.

53:58.620 --> 53:59.980
So what about the control

53:59.980 --> 54:02.180
of negative information on the internet?

54:02.180 --> 54:03.780
What like the actual operations?

54:04.460 --> 54:06.300
I've, you know, preparing,

54:06.300 --> 54:09.020
I should admit I don't know too much about Scientology.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.620
I was doing a bunch of reading

54:10.620 --> 54:13.780
and the Wikipedia page on Scientology,

54:13.780 --> 54:14.700
interestingly enough,

54:14.700 --> 54:17.340
is not that negative about Scientology.

54:18.260 --> 54:19.700
So like it made me ask,

54:20.540 --> 54:21.980
you know, you have to be a little bit careful

54:21.980 --> 54:23.580
how you consume stuff from Wikipedia.

54:23.580 --> 54:26.540
You have to consider because money can buy things there.

54:26.540 --> 54:28.940
There's certain special interests and so on.

54:28.940 --> 54:30.820
But like it made me wonder like,

54:30.860 --> 54:33.100
like with a lot of controversial topics,

54:33.100 --> 54:35.220
what is true and where do I look,

54:35.220 --> 54:36.340
where do I go for truth?

54:36.340 --> 54:39.780
So like how much sort of deliberate action is there

54:39.780 --> 54:43.140
to control what is true on the internet by Scientology?

54:43.140 --> 54:44.460
Well, these days they've pretty much,

54:44.460 --> 54:45.540
I think, thrown in the towel.

54:45.540 --> 54:48.620
But the Scientology middle management

54:48.620 --> 54:52.620
was editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses

54:52.620 --> 54:54.420
that were traced back to the Scientology buildings

54:54.420 --> 54:56.940
that Wikipedia locked them out

54:56.940 --> 54:59.220
from any IP addresses associated with Scientology

54:59.220 --> 55:00.540
from being able to edit it.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.460
Scientology was so infatuated

55:03.460 --> 55:05.580
with trying to control the information.

55:05.580 --> 55:06.700
And in the early days of the internet,

55:06.700 --> 55:08.820
they had a certain degree of success with that.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.180
It's just hopeless these days.

55:10.180 --> 55:11.420
It's the scale, the scale is not there.

55:11.420 --> 55:15.380
But actually I'm very surprised how bot farms,

55:15.380 --> 55:17.580
how effective that can be at a very small scale.

55:17.580 --> 55:22.580
If you just pay 100 people, just spread narratives.

55:22.660 --> 55:26.340
But the reason that's effective

55:26.340 --> 55:30.540
is you can kind of create conspiracy theories

55:30.540 --> 55:33.660
that create chaos and nobody knows what is true,

55:33.660 --> 55:35.300
that bot farms can do.

55:35.300 --> 55:38.940
But actually really nicely control a narrative is hard.

55:38.940 --> 55:42.020
So to create chaos, it's easier to do.

55:42.020 --> 55:47.020
To basically say like, do PR control is very hard.

55:47.740 --> 55:49.340
Yeah, so especially on the internet,

55:49.340 --> 55:53.180
especially when the critical eye is there.

55:53.180 --> 55:54.940
The internet can smell bullshit,

55:54.940 --> 55:56.540
which is one of the really, really powerful thing

55:56.540 --> 55:57.380
about the internet.

55:57.380 --> 55:59.060
And I gotta tell you, it's one of the reasons

55:59.060 --> 56:00.660
I do my YouTube channel.

56:00.660 --> 56:02.540
It's one of the reasons I decided to upload every day.

56:02.540 --> 56:04.740
I've uploaded every day for the last six months.

56:04.740 --> 56:09.740
I just wanted there to be a nonstop flow of information

56:10.540 --> 56:12.620
of any kind and any variety,

56:12.620 --> 56:17.020
as long as it's fair and balanced, intelligent, interesting,

56:17.020 --> 56:20.060
that Scientologists who stumble upon the internet,

56:20.060 --> 56:23.100
will go, oh look, someone's talking about my thing.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.180
Let's see what they got going on.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.380
And I know this guy.

56:27.380 --> 56:30.380
The fact that Scientology crushes so much information.

56:30.380 --> 56:35.140
Before YouTube, I have the only big Scientology channel

56:35.140 --> 56:37.060
and that only got big in the last six months.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.500
Okay, so before that, there were channels, there was things,

56:39.500 --> 56:42.780
but it's almost like it took a lot of,

56:42.780 --> 56:45.100
people felt like it took a lot of bravery and courage

56:45.100 --> 56:49.020
to say something on the internet about Scientology.

56:49.020 --> 56:51.380
And so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices

56:51.380 --> 56:53.300
and I was like, I want this to be prolific.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.460
I want, I want to be prolific.

56:55.460 --> 56:58.180
I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific

56:58.180 --> 57:01.340
so that Scientology couldn't possibly

57:01.340 --> 57:04.020
successfully control the narrative about it.

57:04.020 --> 57:05.340
Have you been personally attacked?

57:05.340 --> 57:08.020
AaronSmithLevin.com is a website created

57:08.020 --> 57:09.540
by the Church of Scientology.

57:09.540 --> 57:10.380
Have you seen it?

57:10.380 --> 57:12.460
No, what kind of content is on there?

57:12.460 --> 57:16.100
Oh, Aaron's an abusive father and a horrible husband

57:16.100 --> 57:18.020
and the worst staff member we've ever had.

57:18.020 --> 57:21.260
And oh, I openly talk about it because I think the fact

57:22.140 --> 57:23.420
that Scientology even does things like that

57:23.420 --> 57:25.740
is fucking hilarious.

57:25.740 --> 57:28.900
And anything they try to do to me,

57:28.900 --> 57:30.380
the way I think about it is,

57:30.380 --> 57:32.260
you know you're just giving me an opportunity

57:32.260 --> 57:33.620
to turn the mirror back on you

57:33.620 --> 57:35.260
and show everyone how horrible you are.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.620
Does it stick?

57:36.620 --> 57:37.460
No.

57:37.460 --> 57:39.660
So you find that there is ineffective.

57:39.660 --> 57:41.140
It's completely ineffective.

57:41.140 --> 57:42.980
They're so over the top.

57:42.980 --> 57:45.700
And well, I'll tell you how the website even came into being.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.660
So I was on the first season of Leah Remini

57:47.660 --> 57:49.700
Scientology in the aftermath.

57:49.740 --> 57:52.700
Every single person who participated in that show

57:52.700 --> 57:53.540
got a website.

57:54.900 --> 57:57.260
It's just that everyone else's website is like,

57:57.260 --> 58:01.900
whoismarkhedley.com, whoismikerender.com.

58:01.900 --> 58:03.940
Well, I bought whoismithlevin.com,

58:03.940 --> 58:05.500
but I was too stupid to buy Aaron,

58:05.500 --> 58:07.340
I didn't buy aaronsmithlevin.com.

58:07.340 --> 58:10.300
So I'm actually the only one who has a website

58:10.300 --> 58:11.340
in their name.

58:11.340 --> 58:12.180
Oh, nice.

58:12.180 --> 58:13.020
Yeah.

58:13.020 --> 58:14.500
And I'm like, I could probably get a lawyer

58:14.500 --> 58:16.380
to get it back for me, but I'm like, why?

58:16.380 --> 58:20.420
I want everyone to see what a nasty, petty,

58:20.420 --> 58:22.500
disgusting organization that this is.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.860
And nobody believes anything Scientology says anyway.

58:24.860 --> 58:26.060
Does the general public know

58:26.060 --> 58:27.220
that it comes from Scientology?

58:27.220 --> 58:28.060
Hold it up.

58:28.060 --> 58:31.020
It says right on the bottom, copyright 2000 whatever,

58:31.020 --> 58:32.460
Church of Scientology International.

58:32.460 --> 58:34.580
Like they didn't even try to hide it.

58:34.580 --> 58:36.180
aaronsmithlevin.com.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.020
Yeah.

58:37.020 --> 58:39.100
A man with no moral compass.

58:39.100 --> 58:41.740
Aaron Smith, who is he really?

58:41.740 --> 58:44.820
Aaron Smith Levin, a man with no moral compass.

58:44.860 --> 58:46.380
Read about Aaron Smith Levin's,

58:46.380 --> 58:51.380
an angry man spreading hate from the internet's shadows.

58:51.500 --> 58:53.660
Open mouth shot.

58:53.660 --> 58:56.660
And you're saying like, wow, there's testimonies.

58:56.660 --> 58:59.220
Oh, there's videos from former coworkers.

58:59.220 --> 59:01.740
The slightest thing just sets him off

59:01.740 --> 59:03.620
and he just goes totally nuts.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.500
Well, that one is true.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.900
I didn't understand why you slapped me

59:05.900 --> 59:07.220
before the interview.

59:07.220 --> 59:08.060
I felt that.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.380
Got links to everyone else's website on the bottom.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.540
It's so funny.

59:11.540 --> 59:12.380
Okay.

59:13.060 --> 59:15.660
2021 Church of Scientology International,

59:15.660 --> 59:16.820
all rights reserved.

59:16.820 --> 59:18.460
Here's an example of just Scientology's

59:18.460 --> 59:20.300
complete lack of self-awareness.

59:20.300 --> 59:21.140
So me and Mike Rinder,

59:21.140 --> 59:23.580
we went and have these on like a house flip project, right?

59:23.580 --> 59:25.060
Wait, Mike Rinder?

59:25.060 --> 59:26.100
You know Mike Rinder.

59:26.100 --> 59:26.940
Do I?

59:26.940 --> 59:29.380
He gave me a bobble head of the guy.

59:30.780 --> 59:31.620
I don't know him.

59:31.620 --> 59:33.540
I was just, I would like to talk to him about him,

59:33.540 --> 59:38.540
but there's a very fine gentleman here with a bobble head.

59:38.900 --> 59:40.460
The reason we created the bobble heads

59:40.460 --> 59:43.300
is because on Mike Rinder's hate site,

59:43.300 --> 59:45.340
Scientology created a GIF or a GIF.

59:45.340 --> 59:46.180
How do you say it?

59:46.180 --> 59:47.020
What's the right way to say it?

59:47.020 --> 59:48.060
The correct way is GIF.

59:48.060 --> 59:48.900
GIF, good.

59:48.900 --> 59:51.780
Scientology created a GIF of Mike Rinder as a bobble head.

59:51.780 --> 59:52.620
It was an insult like,

59:52.620 --> 59:54.540
oh, all he does is sit next to Leah Remini

59:54.540 --> 59:56.100
and go, yes, Leah, yes, Leah.

59:56.100 --> 59:58.500
And so they made a GIF of him with a bobble head.

59:58.500 --> 59:59.860
So we were like,

59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.700
we're gonna make Mike Rinder bobble heads

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.300
and we're gonna sell them on the spshop.com

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.860
to raise money for the Aftermath Foundation.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.700
I love it.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.540
Yeah.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.380
And now that I-

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.220
So go out and buy.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.780
Yeah, go to the spshop.com

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.300
and get yourself a Mike Rinder bobble head.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.340
Now look, now that my profile is getting a little higher,

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.980
this head was made to bobble.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.620
Like this smooth shiny head needs its own bobble head now.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.580
It does, 100% does.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.820
I can't believe it doesn't exist.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.660
So, but let me show you.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.020
So here's what's happening here.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.620
We just hired some day laborers off of what?

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.940
Like Craigslist or something.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.500
So what Scientology did

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.300
was they had a private investigator

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.900
stake out the house flip project.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.860
They were clearly running license plates

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.940
of anyone who visited the property

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.380
because otherwise how would they find out

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.540
the laborer's names, look, do background checks on them

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.180
to find out they had criminal records.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.580
And they published this

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.460
as if it's gonna reflect negatively on me.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.220
Oh, we hired someone to do work who had a criminal record?

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.020
Who gives a shit?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.140
Do you know one of the biggest problems

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.620
people with records have is finding employment.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.300
There's nothing bad about hiring someone

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.820
who's got a criminal record.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.740
It doesn't reflect negatively on me,

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.020
but it shows you what they think about those people.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.500
It shows you what they think about people

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.060
who are trying to put their lives back together

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.620
and maybe actually work for a living.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.740
And it also shows that they're surveilling us.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740
They don't realize that putting this up,

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.740
they're publishing information that they could only have

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.940
if they're surveilling me and Mike

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.300
and it doesn't occur to them,

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.820
maybe we shouldn't put that up.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.700
Just the general process, sad to say, of journalism

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.940
where they're looking for any kind of dirt

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:40.220
and they're trying to conjure up a story

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.500
and there's something about drama and negative stories

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.780
that get clicks and so on.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.700
So this is a general process.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.060
The more, especially the more of celebrity you become,

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.580
the more these kinds of attacks come

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.300
and they look for any kind of thing that could be,

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.780
it doesn't even have to be facts.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.340
It could be just asking who is he really?

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.380
Seems to have traction on the internet.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:04.020
What is the actual truth of the man

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.580
you keep claiming you are,

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.100
of the good man you keep claiming you are?

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.540
It's fascinating.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.540
But sometimes that can be effective.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.220
But I think if you're being transparent and authentic

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.940
and just putting yourself out there completely

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.020
in their story completely,

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.340
then that's the best way to fight it.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.340
That's the other reason to be prolific on the internet.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.660
The reason Joe Rogan can't get canceled

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.260
is because anyone can watch thousands of hours

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.540
of the authentic Joe Rogan.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.740
You can't misrepresent him

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.940
because he spent thousands of hours

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.580
representing himself genuinely.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.420
Yeah.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.900
The nice thing when you're representing yourself genuinely,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.820
you should be a good person.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.060
So if you're a good person, then the internet will know.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.940
They can smell out the bullshit.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.420
Who is David Miscavige?

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.060
It's even like, because you said

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.740
L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.260
Yeah.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.700
Let's go to the story of how we transition

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.020
from that to David Miscavige.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.460
The current leader of Scientology.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.580
He was actually not selected

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.020
by L. Ron Hubbard to take over,

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.340
but ended up usurping power and taking over.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.220
It sounds like Stalin and Trotsky and communism.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.140
Similar story.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.620
It's the person oftentimes in the situation,

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:18.260
it's not the natural successor to power.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.700
It's the one that takes power.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.540
Right.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.100
I think the quote, sometimes it gets attributed

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.940
to David Miscavige is power is not given, it is assumed.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.780
Yeah.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.700
Something like that.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.380
The last six years of L. Ron Hubbard's life,

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.740
he was off into seclusion,

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.820
essentially hiding from lawsuits.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.380
Now, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion,

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.060
Miscavige had sort of already risen up

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.980
through the ranks of the C organization.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.500
Now Miscavige was like a teenager,

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.820
either like 11, 12, 13, or something like that.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.740
Miscavige was not born into Scientology,

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.620
but he was a young boy when his father got into Scientology.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.460
Okay.

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.300
So Miscavige did start working as a C org member.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.620
So there's one organization that existed

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.180
to essentially serve Hubbard directly

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.300
and to represent his interests.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.380
And that was called the Commodore.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.220
He was the Commodore of the C organization.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.700
The Commodore's messengers organization,

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.260
we're gonna call it the CMO.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.420
Miscavige started working for the CMO pretty early on

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.220
in his C org career, by the way, as did Mike Rinder.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.300
Mini Mike.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.140
Okay.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:22.020
And so he just became known as a doer,

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.900
like a guy who'll get it done.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.300
No excuses, no stops, get it done.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.860
So he had made a name for himself in the CMO

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.620
around the time, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.700
Now, when he went off into seclusion,

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.380
he took two other CMO,

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.500
or I'm gonna call them messengers, right?

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.460
Commodore's messengers.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.620
He took two other messengers with him, Pat and Annie Broker.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.260
Now it has been said by people, Mike,

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.460
Mike Rinder has told me, he goes,

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.620
the reason Pat and Annie went off with LRH

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.020
isn't necessarily because he desperately wanted them to,

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.700
but partly because we could afford to let them go.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.820
We didn't necessarily need them.

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.660
Okay.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.580
And between the two of them, Annie was the one

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.220
who was like a really compassionate person,

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.700
intelligent person, caring person.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.980
Was there a possible trajectory of this world

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.580
where she was the one that took over?

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.420
Yes.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.060
In fact, Pat and Annie Broker were the two people

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.820
that were supposed to take over.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.660
Okay.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:23.540
But because Pat and Annie were with Hubbard in seclusion,

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.540
Miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.380
without any oversight from Hubbard.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.500
The only way any information would get

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.220
from Scientology World to Hubbard is Miscavige

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:40.420
and Pat Broker would meet at a confidential location

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:43.420
and Miscavige would give Broker any information

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.820
he wanted to go to LRH.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.100
So if Miscavige wanted to get rid of somebody,

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.260
all he had to do was feed LRH false information

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.700
that this person had been caught doing something treasonous

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.300
and then he would get in response some order

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.180
from LRH to get rid of this person.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.740
So are there so many similarities

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.780
between various communist regimes and fascist regimes?

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.060
Well, Hitler did the same thing

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.060
when he became the Supreme Leader.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.580
He had to take power.

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.140
Yeah, he had to wait for the president to die,

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.780
but the whole time there's a control of information

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.100
and a slow aggregation of power.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.740
Of course, with nations it's different

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.140
because if you control the military,

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.820
you have to control a lot.

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.580
So you have to also get the generals on your side

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.540
and so on, but I'm sure in this situation

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.300
there is similar kind of dynamics.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.980
You have to get certain people on your side,

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.420
control the flow of information,

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.140
let the original founder, the original leader die off

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.700
and make sure that you are the one

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:39.780
that's left with the power.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.900
Right.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.860
So whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH,

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.500
all of Scientology's attorneys and accountants

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.620
and lobbyists and whatever, they all know Dave.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.420
Dave's the one they deal with.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.460
So LRH passes away, Pat and Annie make this appearance.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.940
Nobody knows Pat and Annie.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.100
Everybody knows Dave.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.300
And so he ended up getting rid of Pat and Annie.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.060
This is a very short, perhaps slightly bastardized version

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.580
of it, of Miscavige basically.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:13.580
They had been ushering just suitcases of cash

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.780
to L. Ron Hubbard during this time.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.140
And so you have Miscavige handing boatloads

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.820
of cash to Pat Broker.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.860
Pat would do crazy things like hide the money

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.580
in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.420
So Miscavige basically threatened to turn Pat Broker

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.180
over to the IRS for tax evasion.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.780
That's part, Pat Broker is still alive.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.100
Is he a Scientologist or no?

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.380
No, he basically went away and kept his mouth shut.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.940
She died a handful of years ago.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.900
She stayed a loyal Sea Org member until the very end.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.060
But literally like Miscavige put her on menial tasks

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.980
like she had no authority whatsoever.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:57.180
She was just put on menial tasks, washing dishes

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.340
but not really groundskeeper,

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.620
just stupid low level assistant paper pusher stuff.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.660
She never operated with any actual authority

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.660
even though she was supposed to be the one

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.620
to take over her and Pat.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.180
So on David Miscavige, difficult question

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.860
but can you make both the case that he is a good man

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.780
who's misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man?

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.300
First of all, I believe that Miscavige

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.660
is a true believer in Scientology.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:25.500
I do believe that.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.020
That's a really important question.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.340
Do you think he believes in all the things and all of that?

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.300
He definitely believes in that.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.380
I think he believes in Scientology

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.820
but in a different way than all other Scientologists

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.260
because he's aware of a lot more information,

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.540
damaging information about L. Ron Hubbard

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.420
and the true story of Scientology than most people.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.660
So his version of belief is different.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.020
I'll give you one example here.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.180
So Scientology's bridge to total freedom goes up

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.660
to what they call OT8, operating thing level eight, okay?

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.940
Scientologists have all been told that L. Ron Hubbard

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.420
before he passed, finished, completed,

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:03.820
putting together OT9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.540
It's just sitting in the vault waiting to be released.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.220
This is part of the Scientology belief system

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.340
because remember I said going up Scientology's bridge

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.740
to total freedom is how you're supposed to get back

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.820
to your native godlike state.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.220
While all the Scientologists in the world

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.980
who've already done OT8 know that they haven't gotten there

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.300
but they still believe in Scientology

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.380
because they're told there's more.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.060
But wait, there's more.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.660
Miscavige knows there is no more.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.100
So Miscavige knows the fundamental promise

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.100
of being able to achieve full operating Theaton is a lie.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.940
He knows L. Ron Hubbard didn't accomplish that.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.700
So therefore no one else is going

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.100
to accomplish it as well.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.780
If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it,

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.620
Miscavige knows, well, he didn't write it up.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.420
He didn't leave instructions

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.420
for how anyone else would accomplish it.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.780
So no matter what, Miscavige knows

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:57.420
that the fundamental promise that what Scientology is saying

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.420
they will be able to deliver to mankind is a lie.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.580
Now it's gonna sound like I'm contradicting myself

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.420
because it sounds like I'm saying,

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.860
well, he knows it's bullshit.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:11.940
I think he believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.860
to finish his work and he's kind of hoping

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.100
L. Ron Hubbard is gonna come back to finish the job

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.740
because L. Ron Hubbard did tell the people

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.780
at the international management base,

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.180
at least a core of them, that he was coming back.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.980
Now we know that David Miscavige believed this

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.740
because right around the 21 year mark,

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.140
he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.900
Right around the 21 year mark,

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.460
David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.220
in place that had to get done

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.420
in case L. Ron Hubbard came back.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.020
So we know he at least believed to that level.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.220
Can you believe that L. Ron Hubbard

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.100
can sort of enter his own body?

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.460
No, that's not how it works in Scientology.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.820
Okay, so you can't have a transfer of satans.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.020
If you were full OT, you could.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.740
Can you describe the OT again?

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.260
So OT levels, OT one, two, three, four, five to the eight.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.140
What are they?

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.540
How do you get to level one?

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.380
I'm gonna answer this question

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.460
by first connecting some dots.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.300
Yes.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.740
Okay, we spoke earlier in the interview

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.780
about achieving your native godlike state.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.380
That in Scientology is called native state.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:22.420
Okay, native state and full operating Thetan

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.220
mean the exact same thing.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.860
Okay, because that native state,

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.620
you are a fully operating Thetan.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.180
Operating meaning operating in your full capacity.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:35.220
So OT means operating Thetan.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.580
So the upper confidential half of Scientology's bridge

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.140
are called the OT levels, the operating Thetan levels.

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.500
And these, and remember they're confidential.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.420
So most Scientologists have not done these levels.

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.100
They don't know what's on them.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.820
It is on these levels that you learn

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.940
about the Xenu and the body Thetan story.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.500
Can you describe Xenu, please?

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.980
We spoke earlier about how

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.060
at the lower non-confidential levels of Scientology's bridge,

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.100
Hubbard is saying that what's wrong with you

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.260
is your reactive mind.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.140
Yes. Okay.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.380
Well, in Scientology,

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.300
once you've gotten rid of your reactive mind,

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.220
that is what's called the state of clear.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.060
Okay, so after you finish state of clear,

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.500
the next thing on the bridge is the OT levels.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.220
Well, if you've already gotten rid of your active mind,

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.660
what the heck are you supposed to do now?

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.460
Well, now L. Ron Hubbard says,

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.020
okay, first what was wrong with you

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.980
was just your reactive mind.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.100
But now the next thing you have to resolve,

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.580
the next thing that's wrong with you

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:29.060
is you actually have tens of thousands of Thetans

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.620
stuck to your body

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.020
and they all have their own reactive minds.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.260
You have to audit the Thetans.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.860
How do you audit the Thetans?

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.260
Are these like different shades of your inner mind

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.900
and you just have to try to access them somehow?

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.180
You use the emitter, just like we spoke about,

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.060
except now you've got a divider that separates the cans

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.020
so they don't short circuit

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.500
and you hold both cans in one hand

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.900
and you have the emitter in front of you.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.500
So now you're auditing yourself.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.060
You're telepathically talking

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.220
to the Thetans that are stuck to you.

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.300
You are thinking the commands

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.260
instead of saying them out loud

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.060
and you sort of do drills where you practice

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.220
looking for emitter reads

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.020
at the instant you have a thought.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.340
You're telepathically auditing spirits

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.100
that L. Ron Hubbard says are stuck to your body.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.740
Does this sound like a recipe for a mental breakdown

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.340
or a heck of a mental journey?

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.900
Wherever that leads, it could lead anywhere.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.620
It probably lead to a very bad place, right?

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.860
Very often does.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.620
And you combine that with the fact

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.620
that Scientology is against any forms of mental help

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.700
or health outside of Scientology

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.500
and you have a recipe for disaster.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.380
Now you might go, where did all these spirits come from

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.740
that are stuck to your body?

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.700
This is where Xenu comes into play.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.540
So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago,

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.620
Xenu was basically a dictator at,

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.020
the Galactic Confederation is like 70 something

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.500
or 80 something planets somewhere in the Milky Way.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.900
And Xenu was like a dictator, an overlord

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.340
for either one of these planets or the whole system.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.820
And they had a population problem.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.860
And Xenu was like, we need to get rid of like half the people.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.780
So we called them all in for tax audits.

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.060
L. Ron Hubbard didn't like the IRS.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.460
So of course the story has to do with tax audits, okay?

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.580
Called them all in for tax audits, said,

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.140
psych bitches, froze them in glycol,

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.580
loaded them up on space planes, flew them to earth.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.900
Remember the story has to be earth

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.300
because the story is what's wrong with us.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.140
Flew them to earth, dropped them in volcanoes,

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.580
blew them up with hydrogen bombs

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.460
and then captured them with like spirit magnets.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.180
I'm making up words because okay.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.860
And these disembodied spirits of these people

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.620
that got blown up have just been blown in the wind

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.100
here on earth and they attach themselves to things

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.460
and they can be in the environment

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.300
and they stick to bodies and everything.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.860
And so, and they all have reactive minds.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.700
So at Scientology's upper levels, if you get sick

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.460
or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you,

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.660
Scientology will say, that's one of your body things.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.460
You need to get some auditing to fix the body thing.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:15.340
So this story, you do it with a kind of bit of a chuckle

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.420
but when done seriously,

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.660
so it's just told in a serious way,

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.260
like to like, or written down.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.100
It's written down.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.940
When you read it.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.460
By most accounts, Scientologists struggle

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.700
when they read this for the first time

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.260
because this is not consistent

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.540
with what Scientologists are hoping for

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.540
is on the OT levels.

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.160
They're hoping for some real life changing magic.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.620
The way these things are described and sold,

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.020
they're, remember they're hoping that these OT levels

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.940
are gonna make them, give them the ability

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.900
to go like completely independent of their body at will.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.260
Exteriors from your body, go back into your body.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.220
You know, like I have some real spirit powers.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.700
So first is kind of a shock.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:55.780
This is, but then you still probably believe you hope

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.740
and you might turn into on yourself self-critical

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.580
that this is, I'm just not strong enough yet.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.180
Yeah, cause also part of the Scientology,

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.020
remember it works 100% of the time

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.100
when used 100% correctly.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.980
And if it doesn't, it could be

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.340
because something's not being done right.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.260
But it also could be because you're doing bad things

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.060
that you're not telling people about.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.540
Like if you're committing present time over its crimes,

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.460
sins, Scientologists would be like,

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:26.180
that's part of the reason auditing isn't working on you

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.180
is because you're committing criminal behavior

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.700
that you're not being honest about.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.740
So every Scientologist is sort of incentivized

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.740
to make auditing work on them, okay?

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.740
Now Lex, this is where it gets a little crazy.

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.540
On OT3, you learn about the OT,

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.860
the body things for the first time.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.900
When you finish OT3, you attest to having achieved

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.140
the state of having no more body things.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:52.100
And then you start OT4 and he's like, psych,

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.660
you got more, you got more BTs,

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.340
except those other BTs, they had drug problems

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.020
and that's why you couldn't find them the first time.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.740
So we're gonna do something a little different here,

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.980
do something a little different there.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.900
Gotta get rid of these BTs that were addicted to drugs, okay?

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.900
Then you finish OT4 and you're thinking,

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.900
man, I hope we get to the good stuff soon.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.380
And then you get to OT5 and he's like,

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.820
you got more BTs.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.020
You couldn't find these BTs

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.620
because they were all bunched up together in clusters

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.100
and first you have to break up the clusters

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.460
and then you can get rid of the BTs

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.780
and you're like, okay, gotta do that.

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.420
And this was all L. Ron Hubbard approved.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.060
Yeah, this is from L. Ron Hubbard.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.340
And then after you finish OT5,

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.100
you get rid of all the BT clusters.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.500
OT6 is just a training course to teach you how to auto OT7.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.260
Well, OT7 is now more BTs,

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.420
except it's in the environment and stuff.

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.660
You're trying to locate BTs,

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.540
you can find them on your body, but it's just more BTs.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.700
Okay, and then OT8 is, remember we talked about

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.980
in all these auditing sessions

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.380
throughout the entire Scientology bridge.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.100
You have people who've run hundreds or thousands

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.620
of past life whole track incidents.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.220
These memories have become part of their self identity

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.460
of who they even think they are.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.420
OT8, you go through all these past life recalls

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.820
and essentially I'm oversimplifying this a little bit.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:08.900
And he goes, psych, all those past life memories

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.860
weren't yours, they were your BTs.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.900
And he goes, now that you've discovered this,

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.220
now you know who you are not

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.380
and you are ready to find out who you really are.

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.460
Well, now you're supposed to find out

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:28.160
who you really are on OT9 and 10, those don't exist.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.460
Do we know they don't exist?

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:34.180
Yes, in fact, the whole story of how that became known

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.660
is part of how David Miscavige was able to get rid

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.820
of Pat Broker and take over power

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:42.860
because it was believed that Pat Broker

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.660
was in possession of the upper unreleased OT levels.

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.620
And when Miscavige determined that he was not

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.420
and there weren't in fact any levels,

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.460
that was a bad day to be David Miscavige

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.340
because he now knew he had something on his hands

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.660
he could not get himself out of.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.500
He's like, oh.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.860
So there's no gap for faith to seep in

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.060
that there is a level nine and 10, 11 and 12.

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.740
Oh, the faith is there.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.140
Scientologists believe that these things do exist.

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.460
Yeah.

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.060
L. Ron Hubbard didn't leave anything behind.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.400
Does David Miscavige believe they exist?

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.780
Oh no, he knows they don't exist.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:17.620
No, but.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.980
When I say exist, oh, I don't mean

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.460
do advanced levels of spiritual awareness exist.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:27.420
When I said did L. Ron Hubbard write down

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.140
what anyone is supposed to do that's called OT9,

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:31.980
that doesn't exist.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.620
So you're saying David Miscavige believes

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.900
that they can be written down,

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.860
so they exist sort of in a platonic sense

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.580
and L. Ron Hubbard is the only one that can write it down.

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.380
So his faith is really deep.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.740
Oh, you mean his faith that only L. Ron Hubbard

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.740
could have ever been the one to do it?

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.580
Yeah.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.140
The full principles, beliefs of Scientology,

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.660
he is, are you sure he believes?

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.220
That what exactly?

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:01.260
Everything about Scientology that is true.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.700
To the best of my ability to know

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.480
that I believe it to be true.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.220
Like I'll give you small, even stupid examples.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.780
Like Mike Rinder's told a story

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.060
where at the international base,

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.220
Miscavige actually had like a copper,

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.420
a contraption built into the ground,

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.700
like grounded into the ground to come out

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.900
where you could hold it and here's something

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.980
he sort of came up with to your BT,

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.660
it could ground your BTs,

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.180
you could get your BTs that if you were feeling

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.780
over-restimulated or something,

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.180
I'm probably slightly bastardizing this story,

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.420
but he came up with this as a great idea,

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.420
something to help someone de-stimulate

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.380
if their BTs were getting a little too overactive.

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.180
Now, so that's a stupid story that's sort of like,

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.060
well, it shows you he believes in the concept of BTs

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.740
if he's creating little rods to get rid of them,

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.980
to ground them into the earth.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.660
Well, he could be conjuring up the stories

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.580
because he understands the power of myth and narrative

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.180
and so on to inspire.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.020
Sure.

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740
But also if we look at history,

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.860
both with, this is the interesting thing

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.740
because I've been reading a lot about Hitler and Stalin

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.060
and it seems like both of them in different ways

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:10.260
believed in the stories they were telling.

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.260
Even when the stories, this is the fascinating,

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.300
especially with Hitler and propaganda,

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.060
where they were literally conjured up at first,

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:19.860
but then you start to believe you're in propaganda.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.980
With Stalin, I think what he always believed

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.940
is the bigger ideal of pure communism

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.420
and anything justifies the journey to communism

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.820
because it will ultimately be good for humanity

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:34.980
to achieve the state of pure communism.

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.540
And then he's a godlike figure

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.860
that can bring humanity there.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.940
But with Hitler, it's interesting

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:47.940
because this constant propaganda that he knows is not true,

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.940
a little bit, there's gotta be doubt,

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.460
but then all doubt is removed very quickly.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.580
Yeah.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.900
I guess humans are just, this is how they operate.

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.020
Yeah, the conversation about David Miscavige

01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.860
gets really interesting

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.500
because I could give you a,

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.100
if I wanted to make the argument that he didn't believe,

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:07.060
I could give you a dozen examples to make that argument.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:12.060
I just happen to think that he believes in a different way,

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.340
whereas your average Scientologist

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.260
believes that Alvaron Hubbard was practically infallible,

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.020
that he thought of everything in advance,

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.580
he took care of everything before he left,

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.700
and Miscavige still believes

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.060
in the main structure of this thing,

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.860
but he's like, oh shit, it's falling to me

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:33.340
to figure out how to actually make this thing happen.

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.460
I think Miscavige sees himself as someone

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.580
who has, to a certain degree,

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.060
had to go back and fix Alvaron Hubbard's mistakes.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.460
Do you think he sees himself as doing good for the world?

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.540
I do.

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.540
What about for the people of Scientology?

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.740
I think in his own way, he does.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.140
I don't think he wakes up thinking

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:54.380
he's screwing Scientologists.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.700
I think he sees everyone else as screwing him.

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:02.540
I think he sees that it is his job to expand Scientology

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.420
throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology,

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.580
and he sees that it's not happening,

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.420
and he thinks if everyone else would just stop,

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.820
if everyone else would get out of his way

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.180
and stop creating problems for him, it would happen.

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.980
I do think he sees himself as someone

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.300
who is doing good.

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300
I think that's fair to say.

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.820
I think the evidence shows that.

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:26.140
What about the effects of, clearly,

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.100
power and influence that he's had, and money?

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.300
Yeah, without question, that has served as a corrupting force.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.140
It has.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.020
Without question.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.460
Have you seen evidence of that,

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.900
that he's changed over time?

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:41.900
After the 1993 IRS exemption that Scientology won back,

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.540
and this information comes from Mike Rinder,

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.300
that's when David Miscavige,

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.820
as soon as the checks on his power were removed,

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:54.140
Miscavige's behavior changed markedly.

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.140
Can you tell the story of Shelley Miscavige

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.580
and the mystery surrounding her?

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.500
I saw that there is quite a bit of mystery.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:04.340
Yeah, so Shelley Miscavige, for many years,

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.500
held the job of her post in the C organization,

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.500
was David Miscavige's assistant.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.900
That was her post.

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.820
It's important to truly understand that,

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.740
and what that means,

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:20.740
because the fact that she was Miscavige's wife

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.660
is meaningless, and this is something that's hard to,

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.060
for regular people in the regular world,

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.780
to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:32.460
For Sea Org members who are spouses, it means nothing.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.900
Your role matters more within Sea Org.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.780
Your role's the only thing that matters.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.500
So let's say, let's say if Shelley was married to Dave,

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.700
but she worked in a different organization,

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.500
she would never be seen with him ever, publicly ever.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.580
Wouldn't travel with him,

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.300
wouldn't go to events with him, nothing.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.340
Sometime around 2006, 2007,

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.180
and I'm very oversimplifying this, okay?

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.940
Shelley basically pissed off Dave to the point

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:01.860
where he's like, okay, I'm done with you.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.540
I'm gonna take you off of your post, okay?

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.220
At that point, she was reassigned

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.020
to another confidential Scientology base

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.700
up in Twin Peaks, California.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:16.900
Why am I, the reason I'm providing this type of detail

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.700
is because we hear that Shelley's missing.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.540
Yeah.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.020
Okay, well, you realize the same people who report

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.580
that Shelley's missing are also the same people

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.780
who will tell you exactly where she is.

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:29.180
Okay, she works at this secretive CST,

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.700
Church of Spiritual Technology base

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.700
out in Twin Peaks, California.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.020
I have personal confirmation that she was seen

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.300
and spoken with by someone who knew her well

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.940
in, I'll say 2019.

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:47.060
Shelley Miscavige is missing in the sense that

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:52.220
she hasn't been seen with David Miscavige since about 2006.

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.500
But because she's no longer his assistant,

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.660
you would never see her with him.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:00.100
As opposed to like the mystery of a person

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.340
that might be murdered,

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.740
this is more of a reallocation within the organization.

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.020
Certain people who cover Scientology,

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.180
who have published stories

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.420
where Shelley Miscavige's family member

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.220
told a story to another family member,

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:19.420
who told the story to a friend,

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.300
who told the story to a former Scientologist,

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.820
who told the story to a journalist, who published the story,

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.860
has created the impression

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.660
that some of Shelley Miscavige's family members

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.540
are actually talking to the press,

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.900
when in fact that has never occurred.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.020
And so the very people who are publishing

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.220
about Shelley Miscavige missing have contributed

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.380
to the fact that Shelley Miscavige

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.220
does no longer speak to those family members

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.300
because she thinks they're talking to the press

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.780
when they never have.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:44.900
It's pretty messed up.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.060
It's sad that she,

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.660
because those family members,

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.380
what would be a way for her to recover,

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.100
to flourish as a human being, to escape?

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.340
Yeah.

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.220
So I believe the information that I have,

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.540
that I verified, I'm putting out,

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.740
I'm the one representing it's true

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.820
without revealing my sources.

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:04.740
Sure.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.980
That Shelley was still actively in touch,

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.420
regularly with family members outside of the C organization

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.220
since about, until about 2014.

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.260
So I mean, regularly, okay.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:18.820
So there's no question about her safety during that period.

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:22.220
And then someone else who knew Shelley very well

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.260
did see her and actually have a conversation with her

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.780
in a public place in 2019 or 2020.

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.020
Now somebody could still come along and be like,

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:31.940
how do we know she's okay?

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.780
It's been three years.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.060
Yeah, okay, you could say that about anybody.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.380
The nature of working in the highest levels

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.900
of Scientology management at these super secretive bases,

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:45.100
it's a very weird and unique situation.

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.820
It has isolation baked in.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.860
How is secrecy enforced?

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.860
Why is everybody holding on to their stories so intensely?

01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:56.900
People that are within the organization,

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.740
like it's hard to leak information.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.780
Oh, they wouldn't want to leak, they're true believers.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.660
They see, like there's sort of a conspiracy theory

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.700
that runs right through all of Scientology,

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:12.340
which is that Scientology represents like

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:14.980
an existential threat to the powers

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.220
that really control this planet.

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.860
Do they have a face to the powers that really control?

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.700
Do they have names to it?

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.660
Like who's controlling?

01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.020
It's Xenu's homies.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.620
Well, I'm sure that's not what they say.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:28.780
Xeno embodied in-

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.660
It's actually sort of a multifaceted conspiracy

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.020
in that on the one hand,

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.380
L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:38.180
at like the international bankers,

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.820
which has shades of anti-Semitism too.

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:44.500
And then the IRS is going to be quickly baked in or no?

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.980
The IRS, no, the IRS is so low on the totem pole

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.820
as far as the, I mean, the international bankers,

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.020
he would say runs everything.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.860
Got it.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.140
But used that these bankers also use big pharma

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.500
and big psych to control the population.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:04.460
And Scientology is famously against pharma and psych.

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.860
And so this is sort of how L. Ron Hubbard characterizes

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.300
like this big war between Scientology

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.220
that's trying to set everyone free

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.580
and big pharma and big psych

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.700
that's trying to enslave everyone on the planet.

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.860
Yeah, controlling their mind,

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.980
controlling their body through chemicals and-

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.940
And who controls the press?

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.420
Big pharma and big psych.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.500
So there's a lot of correlation

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.100
to other kinds of conspiracy theories.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:26.940
Yeah.

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:29.300
Oh, that's fascinating.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.060
But you asked the question

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.740
where why would all of these people hold onto their stories?

01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.060
They would never want to leak.

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.660
Like by even anyone who would want to leak

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.900
would not even want to be a Scientologist anymore.

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.540
Like if you truly believe in Scientology

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.580
and you got your shoulder to the wheel

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.980
and you're a CERC member,

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.220
you think Scientology is literally the only thing

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.620
that can save every being on this planet

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.700
from a fate of eternal amnesia and slavery.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.580
Yeah.

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:00.420
Right?

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.740
And so it's like, I mean, you've seen the matrix, right?

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.020
So you've got everyone,

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.860
once you're unplugged from the matrix

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.460
and you realize, yeah, you can get plugged back in

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.420
and live your nice life, but you're a slave.

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.420
That's how Scientologists see this planet.

01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.940
They actually, they refer to Earth as a prison planet.

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.700
Just at an individual level,

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.900
how's it possible to reach a person like that?

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.540
Is there something you could say to that?

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.980
Like what's the journey of reaching a person like that?

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:32.980
I personally, because when I was in those shoes,

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.060
I say there's nothing anybody could have said to me

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:39.940
to get me to change how I felt and thought about Scientology.

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.180
It's almost foolproof that the more evidence

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.060
you try to present that there's something wrong

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.940
with what Scientology is doing,

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.300
the more you're just working for the psychs.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500
It's very, very difficult.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.020
I mean, most people who leave Scientology leave

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:00.340
because they have had some personal experience

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.300
that was just such a grave injustice

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.380
that it just pushed them beyond the point

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.220
of what they were willing to experience.

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:11.380
Very rare, I'm not sure I've really ever heard a story

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.420
of someone going, yeah, I just woke up,

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.300
I just gradually realized it was all BS and drifted away.

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:21.260
It's usually like, no, I really believed

01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:24.700
and they treated me so horribly,

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:28.220
I almost had no choice but to leave.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.460
And then the stories get pretty crazy.

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:32.180
Meaning you don't care what's true anymore,

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.060
you just have to leave with the unpleasant feeling,

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:35.900
the suffering.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:39.620
Yeah, and this sort of goes back to the conversation

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.460
we're having about like,

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.820
well, does Miscavige really believe?

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.180
And I said, I could make an argument

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.020
for the fact that he doesn't, right?

01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.260
Because I go, it wouldn't be that hard

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.700
to change the way Scientology treats people

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:56.260
just a little bit and you'd probably stop losing anyone

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.140
because Scientologists already believe

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:00.060
to such a strong degree,

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.980
you have to be pretty fricking horrible to people

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.060
to make them leave.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.420
And that's where you go,

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.300
well, does Miscavige even want Scientology to expand?

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.860
Because if he was really being clever about it,

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.020
it seems like he could at least stop the bleeding

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.380
and yet he doesn't.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.580
So that's where you make the argument,

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.780
well, if he doesn't, then he must not want to.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.700
So his mind is corrupted to the point

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.820
where he's not able to actually

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.780
be a good businessman essentially.

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:22.740
It seems that way.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.220
The numbers of Scientologists have been going down

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.980
and down and down since the early 90s.

01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:32.100
Is there a good, I mean, it's very difficult

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.500
to get to this number,

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.980
but is there a good estimate

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.380
of what the current number of Scientologists

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:39.100
or practicing Scientologists is?

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.580
Oh yeah, I did a video about this.

01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.300
It's actually quite easy to get some of the number.

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.900
It's not more than 35,000 in the entire world.

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.980
And that's being very generous and charitable.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.660
I was intentionally generous.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.180
I broke it all down in a spreadsheet and everything.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:52.540
Can you give like some insights

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.620
of how you get that info?

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.740
Sure, there's about 175 to 200

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:58.140
Scientology organizations in the world.

01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.260
Anybody who's ever worked at these organizations know

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.700
there's not more than 35 to 50 staff members per org.

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.620
There's not more than one to 200

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.900
public Scientologists per org.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.700
I broke down the number of Sea Org members

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.940
who'd be working at every continental management unit,

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:15.340
middle management, international management.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:18.340
I broke it on the Mission Network and I was generous.

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.580
I mean, my numbers were like,

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:24.220
if L. Ron Hubbard came back and they were doing an event,

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:27.780
L. Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing OT9 and 10.

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.740
How many Scientologists could we scrape together

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.660
in every city to come to this event?

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.340
It wasn't more than 35,000.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:35.420
Now contrast that to what Scientology says.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:40.500
Millions, 10 million people.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.660
Is this less people than there used to be?

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.100
At its peak, it was about 100,000 active members.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.660
But never the millions.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.740
Never, no.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.500
Has David Miscavige used violence?

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.860
Has there, in your understanding of it,

01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:00.780
in your estimation, sort of harassment, assault,

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.220
and actual, I don't know how to define assault, but violence.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:08.340
Oh yeah, dozens of former Sea Org members

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.460
from the international base have told stories

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.740
of being assaulted by Miscavige.

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:15.020
In fact, Mike Rinder is probably the one person

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:18.260
who's been assaulted by Miscavige more than anyone else.

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.940
He's personally probably been assaulted dozens of times.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.660
Who is Mike Rinder, the man here?

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.660
One of the highest ranking executives in Scientology.

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.900
The author.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.700
There you go, a billion years.

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.340
Of a billion years.

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.220
It really is a fantastic book,

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.260
because the guy was born and raised in Scientology

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.820
and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard

01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.380
and worked personally with David Miscavige for decades.

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.380
He doesn't get much more insider than that.

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.140
A candid and deeply felt memoir of a life lost

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.220
to false belief and courageously regained.

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:51.860
Lawrence Wright, a billion years,

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.140
my escape from a life in the highest ranks

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.140
of Scientology, Mike Rinder.

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.540
It's a fantastic book.

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.140
He also narrates his own audiobook too.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.620
I know you like the audiobooks, that's how I listen to it.

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:06.060
So Mike, famously, I just said a moment ago,

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.740
someone who's treated so horribly,

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.420
even though he still believes in Scientology,

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.220
he had no choice but to leave.

01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.540
And he tells the story in that book,

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.540
and he still believed in Scientology for years

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:18.180
after he escaped, for years.

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.220
Because there's this thing called

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.740
the Independent Scientology Movement

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.580
or the Free Zone or whatever.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.780
There are people who do Scientology

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.140
outside of the Church of Scientology.

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.420
There's just not many of them.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.140
But Mike was one of those people

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.620
who was actually doing Scientology even after he left.

01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.940
Now he no longer believes in that anymore

01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.780
and he doesn't do it.

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.020
But even though he still believed,

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.980
even though everything he knew

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:39.900
was what he was leaving behind,

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.660
he still had to leave it behind.

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.220
And by the way, I just opened a random page and he says,

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.940
"'When I signed on for C-ORG in Adelaide in 1973,

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.660
"'the recruiter promised I would train

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:53.340
"'as a Scientology executive under the direct tutelage

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.820
"'of Hubbard on the Apollo.'"

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.740
So this is another thing I should probably ask you about.

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.900
Oh, we could go for days.

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.820
I was also told that after I learned

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.460
all I needed to learn at the foot of the master,

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.940
I would return to Australia

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.300
to help expand Scientology in my home country.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:14.420
So what was the thing that really broke him?

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:19.060
The final thing is when he got to a point

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.340
where he was no longer being forced

01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:23.740
to lie to protect L. Ron Hubbard,

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.660
he was now being forced to lie to protect David Miscavige.

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.780
And specifically, it was about the allegations

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.260
of having been assaulted by Miscavige.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:36.780
Mike Rinder was at some event

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:37.740
that might've been a grand opening

01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.340
for a building, a Scientology building in London.

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.980
And I believe it was John Sweeney,

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.580
at that time a BBC journalist,

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.900
who stuck a camera and a microphone in Mike's face.

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.420
"'Is it true David Miscavige assaulted you?

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.340
"'Is it true?'

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.500
And Mike denied it on camera.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.980
And then turned around and to himself is like,

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:58.060
"'This is what my life has been reduced to?

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.020
"'Lying to protect David Miscavige?

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.140
"'This used to be about L. Ron Hubbard.

01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.020
"'This used to be about Scientology.

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.740
"'Now it's about protecting this douchebag?'

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.860
And Miscavige had just issued orders

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.060
that was gonna send Mike off to Australia.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:17.460
Miscavige is sadistic.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.660
That is without question.

01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:20.900
Sadistic meaning?

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.580
He enjoys inflicting pain upon others.

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.620
So he very specifically was gonna tell Mike,

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.180
tell Rinder or tell that cocksucker,

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.620
we're shipping him off to Australia.

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.220
He's never gonna see his wife and his kids again,

01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:33.380
essentially.

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.140
And that's when Mike was like,

01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.540
they were the only reason I hadn't already left.

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.020
So if I follow the orders, I'm gonna lose them.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.820
If I leave Scientology, I'm gonna lose them.

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.460
At least if I leave Scientology,

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.180
I'll be free of something.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.220
It's fucking sad.

01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.500
And he still believed Scientology

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.900
to some degree after he left, is what you're saying.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.740
Has he spoken about what it took to let go

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.660
of believing in Scientology?

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.820
He does a very good job talking about all of this

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.660
in the book.

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.580
And it took him like four or five years

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.420
to get that book done.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.660
Like it's a polished version.

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.220
It's a polished version of his story.

01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.300
And I think Mike's about getting ready

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.420
to start his own YouTube channel.

01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.300
So that'll be a lot of fun.

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.060
Actually, Mike comes on my channel all the time.

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.900
Yeah, you guys do a thing together, right?

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.860
Yeah, we do three amigos with me

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.980
and Mike Rinder and Mark Hadley.

01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.660
That's why I gave you Mark's books.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:31.260
I thought maybe you would know him

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.500
from our little three amigos,

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.540
our Mondays with Mike and Mark videos.

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:38.180
Mark Hadley, blown for good

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:40.340
behind the iron curtain of Scientology.

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.900
So he escaped from the international base

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:42.740
on a motorcycle.

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:43.980
It's a wild story.

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.540
I won't even try to do it justice.

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.380
Who's a better writer of the two of them?

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.500
You're not gonna get me there.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
I'm trying to be investigative journalist for once.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.380
Mike and Mark are both on the board

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.860
of the Aftermath Foundation with me.

01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:58.780
Who's better looking?

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:00.220
No, I'm just kidding.

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.900
It's one of my justifications

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.300
for just putting up content every day

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.580
is every video is just an excuse to

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.580
in some little way promote the Aftermath Foundation.

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.140
And I do that again,

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:11.180
one, to genuinely help people escape

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.820
and two, because I know it drives David Miscavige crazy.

01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:16.420
If you look in your own heart, is there anger there?

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.300
I don't think it's anger.

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.460
I don't hate Scientology.

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.940
I don't hate David Miscavige.

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:25.860
I don't even hate my experience in Scientology.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.500
Do you able to accept the good from your experience?

01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.100
Yeah, absolutely.

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.380
But it's also the only path that I traveled.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.740
So I tend, okay, a little less so these days,

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.500
but earlier in life, I tended to attribute

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.380
all positive characteristics in me to Scientology

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.140
because in my simplistic way of thinking,

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.780
I was like, what else could it possibly be attributed to?

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.220
That's a very black and white way of seeing.

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.700
That's a beautiful way to see life.

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.860
No matter what happens to you,

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.700
you attribute, like you focus on the positive

01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:00.260
and sometimes people have traumatic experiences

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.620
with parents and so on.

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.820
And if you focus on the positive,

01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.300
it's a good way to let go of the trauma associated with it.

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.380
True, but like another example would be like,

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.220
I didn't go to school.

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:12.340
Like I stopped going to school in the seventh grade,

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.780
but people go, but you sound so smart.

01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.620
And what am I supposed to do?

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.540
Am I supposed to say, well, it's because of Scientology?

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.580
Like, how do I answer that question?

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.820
Like if it's the only path I traveled,

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.020
how do I answer that question?

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:24.860
I don't necessarily want to give Scientology credit,

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:26.260
but what the hell am I supposed to point to?

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:31.260
Sure, I mean, you said you kind of enjoy,

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.500
as you joking and trolling,

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.380
that you enjoy knowing that your YouTube channel

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.340
drives David Miscavige crazy.

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.620
I mean, what, that means you still,

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.860
I mean, there is a joy you have.

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.740
There is a joy, I'm not gonna deny that.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:46.980
I don't know what to make of that,

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.780
because I suppose there's an intimacy

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.980
when you're part of a tribe of that kind.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:56.580
It's almost like, let me try to frame it.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.300
I wasn't trying to get kicked out of Scientology.

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:02.180
I was trying to not get kicked out of Scientology.

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.980
So what happened, first my mom got kicked out

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:09.500
for basically talking some smack about David Miscavige.

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.660
And then they go to me and they go,

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.700
okay, you've got to disconnect from your mom

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.380
or you're gonna get kicked out.

01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:15.380
And I lied about that.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:16.740
I was like, okay, I'll disconnect.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.020
But I never did, for a couple of years,

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:19.460
I lied my ass off about it.

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:20.540
Eventually they were like,

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.300
this guy's gonna keep lying to us, right?

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.180
And they're like, yeah, like, all right, you're out.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.100
So then they go to my wife,

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:26.140
so you got to divorce your husband

01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:27.220
or you're gonna get kicked out.

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:28.100
And she goes, no.

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.140
Okay.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.380
That's a hell of a statement from her.

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.620
It's gonna get harder from here.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:42.060
So I'm not quite sure how to...

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.900
Okay, so I'll try to do my best.

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:46.540
You don't seem like a man who's afraid of hard things.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.020
Okay, so she's like, no.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.740
So then they go to her parents

01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:58.820
and they say, you've got to disconnect from your daughter

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.300
and your three granddaughters

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.140
or you're gonna get kicked out.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:08.580
But they have three other kids who are Scientologists,

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.340
who have spouses who are Scientologists,

01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:11.500
who have grandkids.

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.020
So I feel like up until that point,

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.820
everybody was sort of making a decision for themselves

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.260
and what would be best for themselves

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.340
until they get to her parents.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:24.420
And then they're like,

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:26.860
which grandkids are we gonna lose?

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.300
Okay.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.660
At the part where they were trying to get me

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.300
to disconnect from my mom,

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.180
there were hours that I spent talking to them going,

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.460
you know, guys, there's another way.

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.700
It doesn't have to go this way.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.420
There's another way that ends well for all of us.

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.220
And that wasn't even considered.

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.100
And I go, like, they created this monster.

01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.020
And that's a fact.

01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:58.460
And that's why I take joy in it.

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:02.140
When people ask me, is Scientology a destructive cult?

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:04.900
I don't even have to get into all the academic discussions

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:06.140
of what's a religion and what's a cult

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:06.980
and what's the difference.

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.940
I go, as long as they destroy families like that,

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.780
they're a cult.

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.380
So they cut people off deliberately, one by one.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:22.660
And it doesn't have to be that way.

01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:23.620
Right.

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.700
And why is it that way?

01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:27.860
I mean, it started with L. Ron Hubbard

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.140
laying out a policy framework, a policy structure

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:36.140
that if interpreted and applied in the worst possible way

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.500
with the worst possible judgment,

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.220
can be abused in that way.

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.300
I would make the argument

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.500
that if an anti-broker had taken over,

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:51.500
that Scientology policy does have enough little caveats

01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:54.820
baked into it that even the policies about disconnection

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.420
could be interpreted and implemented

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.540
in a non-destructive way.

01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.820
There is room for judgment and discretion.

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.660
And Miscavige has just created

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:09.380
the worst possible version of Scientology.

01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.860
And that's where you sort of get that argument of,

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:14.420
does he even want Scientology to succeed?

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:16.820
Because he seems to be hell bent

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.420
on making sure that he doesn't.

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.260
Yeah.

01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:23.340
And I don't want to see him make it succeed,

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.820
but it does bring that question up of like,

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.900
what are his motivations?

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.020
Can he not see that he's destroying the thing

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.140
he's supposed to be expanding?

01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:35.860
That's also, you know, there's ways to measure cost.

01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:41.420
And that would probably be the most costly aspect

01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:44.540
of Scientology is the suffering associated

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.220
with the separating of families.

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.060
Yeah.

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.220
I mean, that's actually just puts,

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:52.380
makes it very concrete what we value in human life

01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:54.580
is the connection to our loved ones.

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.740
Like everything else doesn't matter.

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.060
Like getting 50 bucks a week,

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:05.100
like that, like getting money stolen from you,

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:09.020
getting the truth stolen from you, none of that compares.

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.740
You can even frame that as the good,

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:15.220
there could be a lot of positives, whatever, in the tribe,

01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.420
but separating families, separating loved ones,

01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.820
that's the destructive thing.

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.780
So no hate though.

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.220
No, I genuinely don't hate them.

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:25.540
Do you forgive them?

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:26.860
100%.

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.940
There's no one I look at in Scientology that I go,

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.780
how dare you?

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:34.500
If I was in their shoes having to operate

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:35.580
under David Miscavige's orders,

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.380
I would have done the same thing

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:39.020
and I would have loved it.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.580
Truthfully, I don't blame any of them.

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.460
I mean, I take the opposite approach.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:47.100
If they knew what I knew, they'd be doing what I'm doing.

01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.740
If they knew what I knew and believed it,

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.980
they'd be doing what I'm doing.

01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:53.940
They're not dumb, it's not dumb people in Scientology.

01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:59.700
They're ambitious, they're dreamers, they got hope,

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.460
they're driven, all that kind of stuff.

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:04.500
Yeah, and it's one of the reasons I like

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.860
putting up content on my channel so they can see,

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.180
hey, like if you're a Scientologist,

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.660
you look at that and you go, hey,

01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:13.100
he seems like he's doing well, he's happy,

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.220
he's a positive guy, he's a good communicator,

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.300
he knows what he's talking about, he's not lying,

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:18.540
he's not exaggerating.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.500
I don't exaggerate anything on my channel.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.540
I don't make up anything.

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.580
And this actually comes from an experience I had

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.100
from 1998 to 2000.

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.820
I was living in LA, I sort of had a two-year period

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.700
of my life where I actually had almost no contact

01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.540
with Scientology.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:38.460
And during that time, I found my way onto the internet

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.900
and there was a website, it might've been ESMB,

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.860
ex-Scientology message, but whatever it was,

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.740
it was, at that time, the main source of critical

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:47.820
information about Scientology on the internet.

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.220
And I looked at it, and remember, I was still

01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:51.660
a true believer, and I looked at this,

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:56.660
and it was so offensive, insulting, hyperbolic,

01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.660
exaggerated, I was like, oh, just a bunch of bullshit.

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:06.100
I was in Scientology for 16 more years.

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:11.260
If what I had seen on the internet about critical

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:13.860
Scientology, if what I had seen when I had seen it

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.700
was something that actually resonated with me,

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:20.020
that I was like, oh, that I believed was true,

01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.060
that seemed credible, I would've gotten out of

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.340
Scientology 16 years earlier.

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.140
So I was like, how can I help create an experience

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:32.740
on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it,

01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:36.140
it will resonate with them instead of repelling them?

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.860
And that is exactly what I have set out to do,

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:40.540
and what I believe I've accomplished.

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:43.900
There's the content, the message, but also just showing

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.900
that you can be happy outside of Scientology.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.740
Exactly.

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.740
You can have a fulfilling life, you can be a good man.

01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:49.580
Yeah.

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.400
All that.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.180
What benefit do you think Tom Cruise gets from Scientology?

01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.780
So why is he still in Scientology?

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.500
He genuinely loves it.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.580
And also Miscavige does, there's one celebrity

01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:03.900
who does have the most unique experience in Scientology,

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.260
and that is Tom.

01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:08.060
Scientology hires all of Tom's staff.

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:11.820
There are no, all of Tom's staff are subject

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:15.180
to interrogations by Scientology, not only in the hiring

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.980
process, but during the employment.

01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:21.620
David Miscavige in Scientology runs Tom Cruise's life

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.900
and his production company and his household staff.

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:25.740
Do you imagine there's some personal connection there

01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.820
where they're just, they like each other a lot?

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.540
Best friends.

01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:33.940
I mean, it's them against the world is how they see it.

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.460
I think it's pretty easy to see how that works

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.580
between the two of them.

01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:40.140
I think this idea of them against the world,

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.960
us against the world, is a really powerful, intimate,

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:46.400
like I kind of see like friendships and relationships

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.800
that way, that I'm not in a dark sense,

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.320
but it's like the world is full of cruelty and absurdity

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.280
and unfairness and so on, and it's nice to huddle together

01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.400
like the penguins in March of the Penguins

01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.360
against the cold.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.200
100%.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:04.560
And they're just like, and so, especially with the ideology

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:09.560
of Scientology, this idea that you can be anything,

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.520
you can be anything, and you can essentially,

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.240
I mean, you can manifest it, essentially,

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.880
through like believing it.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.920
I mean, you don't really put it into those words,

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.720
but believing that you're a god

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.600
is a really like inspiring, positive thing to think.

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.480
If they could figure out how to do all that

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.360
without destroying families and bankrupting its members,

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.280
they might actually have a future.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.360
That's why, like it's funny,

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.480
because sometimes I feel like it's like I'm rooting

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.880
for them to like succeed and do it right, and I'm not,

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.160
but it's an interesting academic discussion to have

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.120
of like, we can all see how much people will sacrifice

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:49.720
in the names of belief and religion.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.360
We can see how much Scientologists sacrifice

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.160
based on what they already believe.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.280
If you would just start treating people less horribly,

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.120
you know what I'm saying?

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.000
It might actually have a future.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.440
Not that I want it to.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.840
It seems like this dark lesson of human nature

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.320
that like, there's something about,

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.520
to use the word cults,

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.320
that you just stop seeing reality for what it is.

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.880
There's a lot of things that could make this

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.920
a better organization that's actually helping people flourish

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:28.040
and be a little bit more like loose about membership,

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.240
not dividing families, not causing suffering,

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.560
not causing financial harm,

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.200
but actually inspiring people and helping people,

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.120
but then maybe it fundamentally changes

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.640
what the organization is,

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.800
and maybe that means somebody like David Miscavige

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.320
loses power too, which might be very difficult,

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.280
or people that are close to him lose power

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.920
and people hold onto power, so.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:49.240
Yeah.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.280
Whatever the human force is here,

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:55.360
it seems to become worse and worse over time.

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.240
What about, oh, let me ask a conspiracy question.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.440
Is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed,

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.760
that there's information from auditing?

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.040
No.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.320
So that kind of stuff is not, that's very conspiratorial.

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.520
I've actually come out and said definitively,

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:13.200
I do not know of a single person who stays in Scientology

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.640
because they're afraid of being blackmailed.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.840
It's just not a thing.

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.520
It's just not a thing.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.400
Does Scientology have enough information

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.600
to blackmail someone if they wanted to?

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:23.840
Well, sure.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.320
I mean, and it doesn't even have to be true.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.560
It could just be lies, who cares?

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.400
Who knows?

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.720
Scientology can say whatever the hell they want.

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.960
So that's the thing, it doesn't even have to be true.

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.280
And actually that would be the argument against blackmailing.

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.960
Like in order for Scientology to blackmail you

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:35.800
with that information,

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.280
they'd actually have to represent that,

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.880
yes, he really did tell us this.

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.400
And it's like, well, then why are you spilling secrets

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.240
of members, right?

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.560
Like it sets a bad precedent.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.760
What are some of the sins according to Scientology?

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:49.360
Most of the sins from a Scientology perspective

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.520
are just doing or saying anything

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:54.560
that brings disrepute to Scientology itself, right?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.600
Remember, it's not like Christianity where there's rules.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.680
If you break this rule, you're not getting into heaven.

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.920
Because Scientologists didn't think about things that way.

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.960
Oh, well, there's the drug.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960
You can't do drugs, right?

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.400
You can't do drugs.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:11.560
And you can't take any psychotropic medications.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.280
And no medications almost at all?

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.520
You're allowed to take medications.

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:17.720
It's just, there's no rules expressly prohibiting it.

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:20.000
It's just most Scientologists tend not to.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.360
You can take Advil, but many Scientologists won't.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.200
Okay.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.720
You just can't take anything prescribed by a psychiatrist,

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:31.280
a psychologist, or any drugs that are psychotropic drugs.

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.120
I mean, SSRIs are considered probably the closest thing

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:37.560
to pure evil in the world of Scientology.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.080
What about, weird question, what about sex?

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.920
Is there boundaries on what's?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.240
There used to not be.

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.960
It's become very puritanical in the last many decades.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.960
For a reason I can't actually explain.

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:52.800
Like Miscavige does seem to be infatuated

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.040
with controlling sex.

01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:57.800
Like that is one thing about Miscavige version

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:00.400
of Scientology that's gotten very strange.

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.640
L. Ron Hubbard even specifically wrote a policy

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.640
that says we are no longer going to regulate

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.520
in any way the bedroom activities of people.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.200
He literally said, from this point on,

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.800
no one is allowed to be subject to any justice actions

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.400
of any kind whatsoever for anything they do

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.160
in their sexual lives.

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.400
But that still did not give permission

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.360
for gay relationships.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.880
That was still referring to straight stuff.

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.840
And monogamous only.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:30.320
Can you do open marriages and open relationships?

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.720
According to that L. Ron Hubbard policy, you can.

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.600
I think he wrote that policy before he created

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.080
the C organization.

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.400
And then what happened is,

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.840
this is actually how this came into effect.

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.400
He created the C organization.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.800
You had a lot of people on a ship

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.160
and everybody was just banging each other.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:49.080
And it created just a nightmare of personal relationship.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.640
It was making production impossible.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.560
Not because everybody was spending so much time banging,

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.520
but because everybody was so upset

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.080
about who was banging who.

01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.960
I mean, sex and that kind of dynamic is really,

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.800
I mean, humans do what humans do.

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.480
And then there's drama and all of that.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.880
It's understandable, because everybody's so intimate.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.080
It's a closed tribe.

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.760
It makes sense to limit sex, otherwise everyone's,

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.800
but otherwise it becomes a sex cult,

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.160
which a lot of them end up becoming.

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.680
On that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult?

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.040
100%.

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.360
But not because I'm fully conversant

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.880
with the academic differentiations

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.400
between what's a religion and what's a cult.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.240
I mean, Scientology would say,

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.920
well, all small new religions are cults.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.440
And I don't know, that's probably true.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.160
Some people would say, all religions are cults.

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.080
And I'd be like, depends on how you define religion

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.720
and it depends on how you define cult.

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.760
But I just fall back on my thing of,

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.800
if you're destroying families

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.320
and bankrupting your members, you're a cult.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.280
That's how I look at it.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.280
It's us versus them.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:53.320
And the them could be your family,

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.200
could be your loved ones that's deeply destructive.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.680
And one of the things you would probably

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.120
throw into the definition of a cult

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.840
is something that's actually destructive.

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.680
Because I do a lot of stuff that's cult-like, like Jiu-Jitsu.

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.920
There's a lot of really close-knit tribes,

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.480
but there's no negative toxicity to it.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.000
There's no divide, there's no divisions.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Or if there is, it's more, boy.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.400
Try being a fan of a certain soccer team

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.120
and then becoming a fan of another soccer team.

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.080
That's hardcore.

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.280
And like, whew.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.120
Start.

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.880
But I'll tell you, I trained Jiu-Jitsu as well.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:34.200
And I have found that community of people

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.280
to be one of the most loving

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.720
and helpful group of people ever.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.640
Shout out to John Keller, Gracie Baja Clearwater.

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.960
No, but seriously, it's one of the reasons

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.880
I continue to do it, despite my back, my hip, my shoulder.

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.520
It's like, it's just such a cool group of guys.

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.840
This goes on.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.560
Used to not, I think it was much more divisive

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:01.640
in the beginning, from its Brazilian roots.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.040
One of the things that's really hard

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.920
is the team-oriented, like, if you're this team,

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.720
you're out to die with this team.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.200
And there's no, there's the Criancias,

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.200
they go to another team.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.280
And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.560
for me in the beginning, that the toxicity of that.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.520
Because I understand that a little bit for the elites,

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:23.440
for the highest of the highest.

01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:25.680
That there's, I like the brotherhood and the loyalty

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.600
of the people, like the Olympic gold medalists,

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.560
the best in the world, yes.

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.240
But for recreational fun, it's like,

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.200
this is ultimately about the camaraderie

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.400
of all human beings together,

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.800
not some whatever label you put on yourself.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.720
I don't think we actually talked

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.080
about the organization itself.

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.640
We talked about tax-exempt status,

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.360
which is really important.

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.720
We talked about some of the control,

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.400
like through the propaganda control of what's out there.

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.560
It's actually interesting that you said that, like,

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.920
Scientology has pretty much lost the battle

01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.240
with the internet at this point.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:01.280
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.440
Which is kind of inspiring

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.240
that it's hard to defeat the internet.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:08.480
But then there's like bots there.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.040
I think if you're sophisticated, I'm not sure that's true.

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:11.880
But if you're not sophisticated.

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.040
It's kind of remarkable they haven't been able

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.400
to capitalize on these bot armies.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.520
Because there's one thing that they have,

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.440
tax-free money that they got nothing else better to do.

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.160
Yeah, right, you can invest.

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.880
They should give you a call.

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.120
They just don't have the right people, apparently.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.560
But that said, how do they wield influence

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.360
with government agencies?

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.000
You've talked about the local police enforcement,

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.640
also federal agencies, anything.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.400
That is the one way they effectively put their money to use

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:42.480
is lobbyists and attorneys, judges.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.800
Very rarely have they ever been able

01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.680
just to get a politician on their side.

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.720
It's the behind the scenes people.

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:49.200
Greta Van Susteren is a very high level

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.680
long-term Scientologist.

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.240
And her husband, I always get it wrong.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.480
It's either Jim Cole or John Cole.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.240
I always get it wrong.

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.760
He's a very powerful attorney

01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.400
who wields a lot of influence behind the scenes.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.400
And that's just one example.

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.120
The reason why that's an interesting example

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.480
is because he's actually a Scientologist

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.240
and he travels in those circles.

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.800
Scientology though, its money goes to good use

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:15.480
by hiring non-Scientologists, retired judges,

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.640
attorneys, lobbyists.

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:19.720
It really is how they get almost anything done.

01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.560
Like Miscavige himself is not hobnobbing and glad-hanging

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:23.920
and shaking hands and meeting these folks.

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.320
It's the non-Scientologist professionals

01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.760
who work behind the scenes on Scientology's behalf.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.080
Can you describe the dynamics of how that actually happens?

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.040
Like why would the police department work

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.280
on behalf of Scientology?

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.720
I meant more the courts and regulators,

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:42.680
not the police department.

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.040
For example, it can come down to something as simple as this.

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:49.200
In Clearwater, Scientology hires Clearwater police

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.880
to do off-duty work for them.

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:53.640
They pay like three times the normal off-duty rate.

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:56.800
So they will, even though I'm not aware of anyone

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.520
on the Clearwater PD who's actually a Scientologist,

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.760
they basically end up with,

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.360
they would call them allies or safe points.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:08.360
People who will literally operate as Scientology spies.

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.440
Someone comes in and follows a report

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.520
about some child sex case.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.200
Someone in the Clearwater PD is calling Sarah Heller

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.400
at the Office of Special Affairs

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.840
at the Flank-Ladin base to let her know,

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:20.000
hey, heads up, we got a thing coming in.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.760
And then Scientology can run around

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.440
and go talk to all the Scientologists

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.400
who have knowledge about this

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.080
and either get them out of Clearwater, you know.

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:30.320
So it's not like a direct explicit corruption,

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:34.960
but more just friends and coworkers

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.200
integrated deeply in the community.

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.320
Yeah, I call it soft corruption.

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.720
So another example,

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:44.680
you have the mayor of Clearwater, Frank Hibbard.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:50.000
Well, he used to, when he won his recent election,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.480
he stepped down from some of these nonprofits

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:52.480
that he served on.

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.760
But the nonprofits that he served on

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.360
also gets millions of dollars of donations

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:59.880
from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater members.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:04.240
You have one of the mayor's best friends, Joe Burdett,

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:06.840
literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology.

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:10.760
So that creates a chilling effect

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:14.760
on anyone who's gonna be talking smack about Scientology

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:19.640
because his friends are on their damn payroll.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:22.000
So I call it soft corruption.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.440
It's not illegal.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.320
It's not illegal.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:28.000
But it's how Scientology wields influence.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.840
And what's ironic is that a lot of these people

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.120
who work on Scientology's behalf

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.520
actually secretly hate Scientology.

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.160
They kind of see through it,

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:37.200
but it's part of the community.

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.600
I mean, it's deeply integrated in the community.

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.160
And there's financial leverage.

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.840
Are you ever afraid?

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.400
I mean, afraid for your wellbeing,

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.680
afraid for your ability to function in society

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.800
because of the pressures from Scientology?

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:52.640
No.

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.480
Is that because you're genetically malfunctioning

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.680
or mentally, or is there speaking out

02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:00.360
as a kind of protection?

02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.320
I think it's one of those things

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.040
that once you've seen behind the curtain

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:05.760
and you see the Wizard of Oz is just a silly man,

02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:07.920
you just don't have any fear.

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920
Now it's one of these things like people say,

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.000
oh, you're so brave.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.480
And I go, what's that quote?

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:14.680
Bravery is being a soldier and being afraid

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.360
and going in any way.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.880
It's not brave to run in if you don't think

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:19.400
nothing's gonna happen to you.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.960
So I'm just trying to,

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:23.480
I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery

02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.360
because it's not like, oh, they could destroy me,

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.200
but I don't care.

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:29.280
No, there's not a damn thing they can do to me.

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.720
And that's one of the reasons

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:33.720
I continue to put out content every day.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.600
To just basically go, hey, still here.

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.560
I dare you to try to do something about it,

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.400
but you can't and hope that that also serves

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.480
as kind of an example for other people to go,

02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.280
if this schmo can do it

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.520
and they can't do anything else to him,

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.400
then maybe I can do it too.

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.240
Cause I would love it.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.840
I would love there to be a 20 channels

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:55.720
where former Scientologists talk about their experience.

02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.320
I mean, that is bravery because what happens

02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.640
is fear seeps in even if it's not grounded in reality.

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.280
But at the same time,

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:08.280
like my grandfather who fought in World War II,

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.920
I mean, the story is,

02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.800
I mean, he was very convinced and sure.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:16.600
Most of the people he fought alongside would died.

02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.120
He was a machine gunner,

02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:20.600
but he believed that bullets can't hit him.

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:21.440
Right?

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:25.280
Well, you know, he was right.

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:27.520
Right?

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.360
Cause he survived.

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.360
So there's some sense like you're-

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:31.200
I'm biased.

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.040
That he's like, just like you are.

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:34.080
I was like, I'm not brave.

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:35.680
I just, the bullets can't hit me.

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.880
I mean, there's a dark kind of truth to that.

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.760
There's some, you know, it's like a,

02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:45.520
it's a feedback loop where if you have the confidence

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.360
and you push on forward and you're brave in that way

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.800
to not let fear seep in and affect you,

02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:54.000
it actually gives you less things to be scared about.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And I mean, but that initial few steps might be for people,

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.280
it might be a very difficult step to take

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:02.400
to talk about publicly.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.400
The fear was knowing how the family was gonna be destroyed

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.000
and trying to prevent that.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.320
I was terrified of that happening, but it happened.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.360
There's nothing left to be afraid of.

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.200
And that's kind of the thing.

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:18.800
Like they created this beast

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.080
and the same is true for Mark Headley.

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.240
The same is true for Mike Reinder.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:23.360
I said they've essentially created

02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.360
a Scientology proof virus, Scientology resistant strain

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:32.400
by throwing everything they have at us for so many years.

02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.400
They have just through natural selection created people

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.960
who just do not give a damn

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.680
about anything they could or would do.

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.240
And maybe there is something a little wrong with me.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.160
Cause when I get a phone call from someone like,

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.600
I just got this phone call about you.

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.560
And it's clear that at Scientology PIs

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.840
doing work behind the scenes, I get really excited.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:51.840
I get really excited.

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.800
I don't get nervous.

02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.000
I'm like, oh no, it's happening.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.640
I'm like, oh yeah, this is gonna be exciting.

02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:00.880
I'm like, okay, because everything they try to do to me,

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:03.840
I'm gonna figure out how to reflect it back on them

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.040
and make them look ridiculous.

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:07.720
And that pales in comparison to the separating from family.

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720
Exactly.

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:11.160
What is there, is there parts of your family

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:13.840
that you've lost because of Scientology?

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:18.960
Just, yeah.

02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.040
If you,

02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:26.800
most of my episode on the Lee Remini in the Aftermath show

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.120
was talking about me and my twin brother.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.960
It's just a pretty horrible story.

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.200
It's just a pretty horrible story.

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.560
So I do have a younger brother who's still in Scientology

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.760
and disconnected from me,

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.920
but I never had much of a relationship with that brother

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.400
really to begin with.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.720
But my twin brother died when I was like 23 or 24.

02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.560
And that was without any question,

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:00.560
a direct result of our Scientology experience.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.200
He died in a car accident

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:04.800
that wasn't technically his fault or anything.

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:06.360
He wasn't even the one driving.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:11.360
But the specific fact of his death was not,

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:14.240
meaning like the fact, and not the fact of his death,

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.760
but the fact of his death was not,

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:19.960
meaning like the fact and the manner of his death

02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:22.760
wasn't like specifically because of Scientology.

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:27.760
But our story and how, where our relationship got to,

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.400
and how he was even in a position

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.960
of having something like that happen to him

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:35.600
is directly attributable to Scientology.

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.120
Do you think about him, miss him?

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:44.240
Is part of what you're doing in memory of him?

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.480
Yeah, for sure.

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:48.520
Man, this is such a-

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.160
I mean, we were identical twins.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.760
Can you imagine two of me?

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.280
I could barely handle one.

02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.640
I love it.

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.560
Losing him, would that be the darkest moment

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:03.600
in this whole journey of Scientology for you?

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:07.320
Two moments would equal the darkest moment.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:12.320
It would be that and also just the period of, you know,

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:15.400
six, nine, 12 months of impending doom,

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:20.680
knowing that my wife's whole family

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.120
was gonna be obliterated

02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.720
and that there's nothing we could do about it.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:32.200
And kind of telling ourselves every step of the way

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:35.000
it wasn't really gonna happen, you know?

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:40.520
And I really felt like, you ever watch the Ozarks?

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:41.360
Mm-hmm.

02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.200
I felt like Marty Bird.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:45.760
Now, this was happening before the Ozarks,

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.280
but when I watched the Ozarks and I see that character,

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.640
the entire world is crumbling down around him

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:55.760
and all he can, all he did like,

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:57.800
all right, what's the next step?

02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:00.120
I watch Marty Bird and I go,

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:01.720
that's my fucking spirit animal.

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:06.160
Because you can only control what you can control.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:10.440
And you can't keep Scientology from destroying your family.

02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:12.840
And literally, like, it's funny,

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.920
I mentioned this show a lot because I watched that

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.680
and I go like, that's exactly how I felt, you know?

02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.680
I talk about this six months or nine, 12 months,

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:22.400
whatever it was of impending doom.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.840
It's not like I was an emotional wreck during that time.

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.120
You know, in private I was,

02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:29.200
but it's not like I was just freaking out.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:32.200
It was like, the sun's gonna come up tomorrow,

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.800
the world's gonna keep spinning.

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:35.360
I can't control it, this is hard.

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.280
I can't believe this is happening.

02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:39.600
But tomorrow's a new day.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:45.080
I've never personally, even at the darkest times,

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:47.080
I've never experienced anything

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:48.760
that I would characterize as depression.

02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:51.840
Certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything.

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.120
Even in the darkest of times,

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:55.160
and again, this one thing I go,

02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:57.440
is it because of Scientology or is it just me?

02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:59.480
There really is an emotional detachment.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:03.240
There almost has to be.

02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:04.760
And it's a cold calculation.

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.480
What are my options?

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.280
What do I do here?

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:12.000
And then once I figure out the answer to that question,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.320
I'm actually quite chipper and happy.

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:16.240
You know, like that's sort of my default.

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:18.560
Like, you could give me six horrible options.

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:20.520
Once I figure out the best of those six,

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.000
I'm gonna feel like I just had a pretty good day.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.240
That's brilliant.

02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:27.520
Because just watching Ozarks is so stressful.

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.360
It is, right?

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.680
So stressful watching it.

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.200
And he usually finds a way.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.560
And usually it is a set of really bad options,

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.440
and it's one of the bad options,

02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.280
but it's the best of the bad options.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.560
And he almost gets pissed off at everyone around him

02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.200
for being so pouty about it.

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:49.960
Oh, I'm gonna watch that show again,

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:51.480
and the same way again.

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.320
Oh, that's beautiful.

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.400
But you know, it's still simmering there

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.480
right under the surface,

02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:57.560
like pretty damn close to the surface.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:58.400
Do you know what I mean?

02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.480
Yeah, yeah.

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.440
And people sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot,

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.360
and like, what does that look like and what does that mean?

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.680
And sort of goes back to kind of the emotional detachment

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:10.960
is I go, what the fuck does recovery even mean?

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.960
If you're an alcoholic and you're recovering,

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:13.800
you know what that means.

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:15.560
I used to drink, I don't drink now.

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.920
Well, I used to be in a cult and I'm not in a cult now.

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:19.720
How else am I supposed to feel about this

02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:22.240
for someone to be like, it seems like you've recovered.

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.040
What the fuck does that even mean?

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.280
Like, I'm sure some academic has an answer to that question.

02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.320
I'm not someone who particularly,

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.200
I don't spend any time thinking about that.

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.360
My recovery is success

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.320
and a little bit of trolling and revenge,

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:35.880
but mostly success.

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.120
You know, what does it mean to be a recovered

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:38.960
former cult member?

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.080
What, you don't cry when people ask you about your brother?

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.880
I don't know what it means.

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.040
I've never had therapy,

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:48.240
but not because I'm still like against it from Scientology.

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:52.160
I just like, I'm not gonna pay to talk to someone.

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.160
Do you know where else I could do that?

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:54.280
Scientology.

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.640
Now I know there's a lot of people going like, oh boy.

02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:59.080
I know there's a lot, I'm not shitting on therapy.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.240
I would rather have a beer with my friend

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.720
than talk to a professional for $200 an hour.

02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.640
That's the kind of therapy, yeah.

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:10.760
Yeah, listen, part of the reason I do this podcast

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.240
is talking to people that you care about,

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.880
that you're close with,

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.760
it's a really powerful, powerful thing.

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.440
But yeah, I don't know what recovery looks like.

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.840
And success to you is defined,

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:23.600
just be, find happiness.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.160
Find happiness outside the closed bubble

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.400
that defines what happiness looks like on Scientology.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.600
If I can make my kids happy, that's success to me.

02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:36.520
What advice would you give to your kids on how to live?

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.360
Travel the world.

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.840
A life they can be proud of, travel the world.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.840
Travel the world.

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:44.120
Get rid of friends who don't push you up

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.880
and don't celebrate your success.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.160
It's hard to give that advice to young children

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.720
because kids are always so catty.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:55.320
But honestly, it's like, when I see,

02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.800
that really is, I just think not just advice to my kids,

02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.440
but some of the best advice to anybody.

02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:02.440
If you've got anyone around you

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.400
who doesn't celebrate your success,

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.600
just spend less time with those people.

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.640
Surround yourself with people who actually

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.680
want to celebrate your success and push you to succeed.

02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.640
I think that's true.

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:15.120
I think it's even more important at a young age

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.520
because if at a young age,

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.640
you get used to being around people

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.680
who kind of take joy in tearing you down,

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:22.240
then that's what you become accustomed to.

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:23.640
Yeah.

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.760
And I just think having friends who love you

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.360
and support you is just about the closest thing

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:33.520
to the true meaning of life.

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.600
And who believe in you, who believe in your potential.

02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:39.040
And some of those ideas underlie

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.960
the good parts of Scientology.

02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.800
Yeah.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:46.000
And except there's a lot of dark parts of Scientology

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.520
that separate you from the people

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.520
that believe in you and that love you.

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.800
Well, this was a beautiful conversation.

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.200
You're a beautiful human being

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:57.760
who came full of gifts.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:01.400
And I mean, I genuinely,

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.400
first of all, you're an inspiring human being.

02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.760
But most importantly, I can't wait

02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:09.720
until I can purchase a bobblehead on the store.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.680
So I can keep that inspiration on my desktop.

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:15.000
Aaron, thank you so much for talking to me.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.200
Thank you for being you, for being brave.

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.440
I know you said you're not,

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:21.440
but thank you for being brave, for talking about this.

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.280
You're an inspiration and you help a lot of people.

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.160
Thank you, brother.

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:26.760
Thanks for having me.

02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:28.200
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:29.480
with Aaron Smith Levin.

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.640

And now let me leave you with some words

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.640
from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:40.640
Be not the slave of your own past.

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.800
Plunge into the sublime seas,

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:45.160
dive deep and swim far,

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.920
so you will come back with new self-respect,

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.200
with new power and with an advanced experience

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:54.320
that will explain and overlook the old.

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:58.200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
