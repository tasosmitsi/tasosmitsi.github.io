00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
It's not our business to change the Russian government. Anybody who thinks it's a good idea

00:05.920 --> 00:13.360
to do regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think,

00:13.360 --> 00:20.880
irresponsible. Vladimir Putin himself has said, we will not live in a world without Russia.

00:21.440 --> 00:28.800
It was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself. He has his hand on a button.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.680
That could bring Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job

00:35.680 --> 00:41.680
to change that regime. And we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating

00:41.680 --> 00:46.480
them as an enemy. Now we've pushed them into the camp with China. That's not a good thing

00:46.480 --> 00:53.680
for our country. And by the way, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.360
The following is a conversation with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., candidate for the president

00:59.360 --> 01:05.200
of the United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer, and author who

01:05.200 --> 01:09.920
has challenged some of the world's most powerful corporations, seeking to hold them accountable

01:09.920 --> 01:16.640
for the harm they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me,

01:16.640 --> 01:22.640
the most beautiful and powerful in the history of human civilization. Science is our way of

01:22.640 --> 01:28.640
living. Science is our journey, our fight for uncovering the laws of nature and leveraging

01:28.640 --> 01:34.240
them to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world. Some of the

01:34.240 --> 01:40.000
greatest human beings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and

01:40.000 --> 01:47.920
engineers. Again, I love science. But science cannot flourish without epistemic humility,

01:47.920 --> 01:54.160
without debate, both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square, in good faith,

01:54.160 --> 01:59.920
long-form conversations. Agree or disagree, I believe Robert's voice should be part of the

01:59.920 --> 02:05.760
debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he says

02:05.760 --> 02:12.160
without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process. At the same time,

02:12.240 --> 02:18.080
dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial topics like the pandemic

02:18.080 --> 02:25.280
is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen to Robert

02:25.280 --> 02:32.400
F. Kennedy, Jr., his arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation,

02:32.400 --> 02:38.560
that people read and listen to Vincent Racanello from This Week in Virology, Dan Wilson from

02:38.560 --> 02:46.640
Debunk the Funk, and the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are

02:46.640 --> 02:53.440
outspoken in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the

02:53.440 --> 03:00.640
long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has

03:00.640 --> 03:06.800
a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it and to learn from it.

03:07.760 --> 03:12.800
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:12.800 --> 03:20.000
And now, dear friends, here's Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. It's the Fourth of July, Independence Day,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.520
so simple question, simple big question. What do you love about this country, the United States

03:25.520 --> 03:33.360
of America? I would say there's so many things that I love about the country, on the landscapes

03:33.760 --> 03:41.040
and the waterways and the people, et cetera, but on the higher level, people argue about whether

03:41.040 --> 03:50.240
we're an exemplary nation. And that term has been given a bad name, particularly by the neocons,

03:50.240 --> 04:00.080
the actions of the neocons in recent decades who have turned that phrase into a justification

04:00.960 --> 04:06.400
for forcing people to adopt American systems or values at the barrel of a gun.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.520
But my father and uncle used it in a very different way, and they were very proud of it.

04:11.520 --> 04:17.920
I grew up very proud of this country because we were the exemplary nation in the sense that

04:17.920 --> 04:25.920
we were an example of democracy all over the world. When we first launched our democracy in 1780,

04:26.880 --> 04:34.080
we were the only democracy on earth. And by the Civil War, by 1865, there were six democracies.

04:35.360 --> 04:43.520
Today, there's probably 190. And all of them in one way or another are modeled on the American

04:43.520 --> 04:52.000
experience. And it's kind of extraordinary because our first contact with, our first serious and

04:52.000 --> 05:02.400
contact with the European culture and continent was in 1608, when John Winthrop came over with

05:02.400 --> 05:09.040
his Puritans in the Sloop Art Belt and Winthrop gave this famous speech where he said, this is

05:09.040 --> 05:14.800
going to be a city on a hill. This is going to be an example for all the other nations in the world.

05:14.880 --> 05:22.640
And he warned his fellow Puritans, they were sitting at this great expanse of land. And he

05:22.640 --> 05:34.640
said, we can't be seduced by the lure of real estate or by the carnal opportunities of this land.

05:34.640 --> 05:43.920
We have to take this country as a gift from God and then turn it into an example for the rest of

05:43.920 --> 05:55.280
the world of God's love, of God's will and wisdom. And then 200 years later, 250 years later,

05:57.200 --> 06:05.600
a different generation, they were mainly deists. They were people who had a belief in God, but not

06:06.560 --> 06:14.080
so much a love of particularly religious cosmologies. You know, the framers of the

06:14.080 --> 06:21.360
constitution believed that we were creating something that would be replicated around the

06:21.360 --> 06:28.880
world and that it was an example. In democracy, there would be this kind of wisdom from the

06:28.880 --> 06:36.720
collective. And the word wisdom means a knowledge of God's will. And that somehow God would speak

06:36.720 --> 06:45.360
through the collective in a way that he or she could not speak through totalitarian regimes.

06:47.520 --> 06:54.880
I think that that's something that even though Winthrop was a white man and a Protestant,

06:54.880 --> 07:02.240
that every immigrant group who came after them kind of adopted that belief. And I know my family

07:02.240 --> 07:08.080
when my family came over, all of my grandparents came over in 1848 during the potato famine.

07:09.200 --> 07:19.280
And they saw this country as unique in history as something that was part of a broader spiritual

07:19.280 --> 07:30.320
mission. And so I'd say that from a 30,000 foot level, I grew up so proud of this country

07:30.320 --> 07:34.240
and believing that it was the greatest country in the world. And for those reasons.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.880
Well, I immigrated to this country. And one of the things that really embodies

07:38.880 --> 07:44.240
America to me is the ideal of freedom. Hunter Thompson said freedom is something that dies

07:44.240 --> 07:50.400
unless it's used. What does freedom mean to you? To me, freedom does not mean chaos.

07:51.520 --> 07:58.640
And it does not mean anarchy. It means that it has to be accompanied by restraint if it's going to

08:00.480 --> 08:06.640
live up to its promise in self-restraint. What it means is the capacity for

08:07.520 --> 08:16.480
human beings to exercise and to fulfill their creative energies

08:17.520 --> 08:20.480
unrestrained as much as possible by government.

08:20.480 --> 08:26.560
So this point that Hunter Thompson made is dies unless it's used. Do you agree with that?

08:26.560 --> 08:34.320
Yeah, I do agree with that. And he was not unique in saying that. Thomas Jefferson said

08:34.320 --> 08:40.480
that the tree of liberty had to be watered with the blood of each generation. And what he meant

08:40.480 --> 08:50.960
by that is that we can't live off the laurels of the American Revolution. We had a generation

08:50.960 --> 08:57.520
where between 25,000 and 70,000 Americans died. They gave their lives. They gave their livelihoods.

08:57.520 --> 09:03.760
They gave their status. They gave their property. They put it all on the line to give us our Bill

09:03.760 --> 09:11.280
of Rights. But those Bill of Rights, the moment that we signed them, there were forces within our

09:11.280 --> 09:20.240
society that began trying to chip away at them. And that happens in every generation. And it is

09:20.240 --> 09:26.000
the obligation of every generation to safeguard and protect those freedoms.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.760
The blood of each generation. You mentioned your interest, your admiration of Albert Camus,

09:31.840 --> 09:37.120
of Stoicism, perhaps your interest in existentialism. Camus said,

09:38.080 --> 09:43.680
I believe in myth of Sisyphus, the only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely

09:43.680 --> 09:48.240
free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. What do you think he means by that?

09:48.960 --> 09:56.160
I suppose the way that Camus viewed the world and the way that the Stoics did and a lot of

09:56.160 --> 10:05.440
the existentialists was that it was so absurd and that the problems and the tasks that were

10:05.440 --> 10:12.800
given just to live a life are so insurmountable that the only way that we can kind of get back

10:12.800 --> 10:25.280
to the gods for giving us this impossible task of living life was to embrace it and to enjoy it and

10:25.280 --> 10:36.160
to do our best at it. To me, I read Camus and particularly in the myth of Sisyphus as a parable

10:37.840 --> 10:45.360
and it's the same lesson that I think he writes about in The Plague where we're all given these

10:45.360 --> 10:54.160
insurmountable tasks in our lives but that by doing our duty, by being of service to others,

10:55.280 --> 11:01.280
we can bring meaning to a meaningless chaos and we can bring order to the universe.

11:03.120 --> 11:13.520
Sisyphus was kind of the iconic hero of the Stoics and he was a man because he did something good,

11:13.520 --> 11:20.080
he delivered a gift to humanity. He angered the gods and they condemned him to push a rock up the

11:20.080 --> 11:25.120
hill every day and then it would roll down. When he got to the top, it would roll down and he'd

11:25.120 --> 11:30.000
spend the night going back down the hill to collect it and then rolling it back up the hill again.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.920
The task was absurd, it was insurmountable, he could never win but the last line of that book

11:37.920 --> 11:45.680
is one of the great lines which is something to the extent that I can picture Sisyphus smiling

11:46.480 --> 11:54.000
because Camus' belief was that even though his task was insurmountable, that he was a happy man

11:54.800 --> 12:00.720
and he was a happy man because he put his shoulder to the stone. He took his duty,

12:00.720 --> 12:08.640
he embraced the task and the absurdity of life and he pushed the stone up the hill.

12:09.760 --> 12:16.400
If we do that and if we find ways of being of service to others, that is the ultimate,

12:17.360 --> 12:21.280
that's the key to the lock, that's the solution to the puzzle.

12:21.280 --> 12:26.800
Each individual person in that way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning to this

12:26.800 --> 12:33.440
whole messy thing. We can bring meaning not only to our own lives but we can bring meaning

12:33.440 --> 12:43.040
to the universe as well. We can bring some kind of order to life. The embrace of those tasks

12:43.040 --> 12:50.240
and the commitment to service resonates out from us to the rest of humanity in some way.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.680
So you mentioned The Plague by Camus. There's a lot of different ways to read that book but

12:55.680 --> 13:04.560
one of them, especially given how it was written, is that The Plague symbolizes Nazi Germany

13:05.360 --> 13:14.400
and the Hitler regime. What do you learn about human nature from a figure like Adolf Hitler,

13:14.400 --> 13:22.320
that he's able to captivate the minds of millions, rise to power and take on pulling the whole world

13:22.320 --> 13:29.440
into a global war? I was born nine years after the end of World War II and I grew up in a

13:29.440 --> 13:38.000
generation that was with my parents who were fixated on that, on what happened and my father.

13:39.440 --> 13:46.560
At that time, the resolution in the minds of most Americans and I think people around the world

13:47.520 --> 13:54.080
is that there had been something wrong with the German people, that the Germans had been

13:54.080 --> 14:01.280
particularly susceptible to this kind of demagoguery and to following a powerful leader

14:01.280 --> 14:13.360
and to industrializing cruelty and murder. My father always differed with that. My father

14:13.360 --> 14:19.600
said, this is not a German problem. This could happen to all of us. We're all just inches away

14:19.600 --> 14:24.640
from barbarity and the thing that keeps us safe in this country are the institutions of our

14:24.640 --> 14:37.520
democracy, our constitution. It's not our nature. Our nature has to be restrained and that comes

14:37.520 --> 14:45.200
through self-restraint, but also the beauty of our country is that we devise these institutions

14:45.200 --> 14:53.200
that are designed to allow us to flourish, but at the same time, not to give us enough freedom to

14:53.200 --> 15:00.000
flourish, but also create enough order to keep us from collapsing into barbarity.

15:00.640 --> 15:08.080
One of the other things that my father talked about from when I was little, he would ask us

15:08.080 --> 15:17.040
this question, if you were the family and Anne Frank came to your door and asked you to hide her,

15:17.040 --> 15:22.400
would you be one of the people who hid her at risk to your own life or would you be one of the people

15:22.400 --> 15:28.480
who turned her in? Of course, we would all say, well, of course, we would hide Anne Frank and

15:28.480 --> 15:38.720
take the risk, but that's been something, a lesson, a challenge that has always been near

15:38.720 --> 15:45.520
the forefront of my mind that if a totalitarian system ever occurs in the United States, which

15:45.520 --> 15:52.320
my father thought was quite possible, he was conscious about how fragile democracy actually

15:52.320 --> 15:59.920
is. Would I be one of the ones who would resist the totalitarianism or would I be one of the

15:59.920 --> 16:06.080
people who went along with it? Would I be one of the people who was at the train station in

16:06.720 --> 16:20.880
Krakow or even Berlin and saw people being shipped off to camps and just put my head down and pretend

16:20.880 --> 16:27.120
I didn't see it because talking about it would be destructive to my career and maybe my freedom

16:27.120 --> 16:34.400
and even my life. So, that has been a challenge that my father gave to me and all of my brothers

16:34.400 --> 16:41.280
and sisters and it's something that I've never forgotten. A lot of us would like to believe who

16:41.280 --> 16:48.480
would resist in that situation, but the reality is most of us wouldn't and that's a good thing

16:48.480 --> 16:55.600
to think about, that human nature is such that we're selfish even when there's an atrocity going

16:55.600 --> 17:00.640
on all around us. And we also, you know, we have the capacity to deceive ourselves

17:01.920 --> 17:06.480
and all of us tend to kind of judge ourselves by our intentions and our actions.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.160
What have you learned about life from your father, Robert F. Kennedy?

17:12.160 --> 17:16.480
First of all, I'll say this about my uncle because, you know, I'm going to apply that

17:16.480 --> 17:22.080
question to my uncle and my father. My uncle was asked when he first met Jackie Bouvier,

17:22.080 --> 17:30.400
who later became Jackie Kennedy, she was a reporter for a newspaper and she had a kind of column where

17:30.400 --> 17:39.920
she'd do these kind of pithy interviews with both famous people and kind of man in the street

17:39.920 --> 17:48.800
interviews. She was interviewing him and she asked him what he believed his best

17:48.800 --> 17:53.520
quality was, his strongest virtue, and she thought that he would say courage because

17:54.960 --> 18:01.680
he had been a war hero. He was the only president, and this one he was senator by the way,

18:01.840 --> 18:10.480
who received the Purple Heart and, you know, he had a very kind of famous story of him as a hero

18:10.480 --> 18:14.960
in World War II and then he had come home and he'd written a book on moral courage among American

18:14.960 --> 18:23.280
politicians and won the Pulitzer Prize. That book profiles in courage, which was a series of incidents

18:23.280 --> 18:32.560
where American political leaders made decisions to embrace principle even though their careers

18:32.560 --> 18:38.960
were at stake and in most cases were destroyed by their choice. She thought he was going to say

18:38.960 --> 18:46.880
courage, but he didn't. He said curiosity, and I think, you know, looking back at his life that the

18:46.880 --> 18:54.880
best that that was true and that was the quality that allowed him to put himself in the shoes of

18:54.880 --> 19:01.600
his adversaries. He always said that if the only way that we're going to have peace is if we're

19:01.600 --> 19:06.240
able to put ourselves in the shoes of our adversaries, understand their behavior and

19:06.240 --> 19:16.400
their context, that context, and that's why he was able to, you know, during the, he was able

19:16.400 --> 19:22.320
to resist the intelligence apparatus and the military during the Bay of Pigs when they said

19:22.320 --> 19:27.040
you've got to send in the Essex, the aircraft carrier, and he said no, even though he'd only

19:27.040 --> 19:34.640
been in two months in office, he was able to stand up to them because he was able to put himself

19:34.640 --> 19:40.160
in the shoes of both Castro and Khrushchev and understand there's got to be another solution

19:40.160 --> 19:47.840
to this. And then during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was able to, and the narrative was, okay,

19:47.840 --> 19:56.320
Khrushchev acted in a way as an aggressor to put missiles in our hemisphere. How dare he do that?

19:57.600 --> 20:03.120
And Jack and my father were able to say, well, wait a minute, he's doing that because we put

20:03.120 --> 20:08.560
missiles in Turkey and Italy that were right on, you know, the Turkish ones right on the Russian

20:08.560 --> 20:15.280
border. And they then made a secret deal with Delbrannon, with Ambassador Delbrannon, and,

20:15.280 --> 20:24.880
you know, with Khrushchev to remove the missiles in Turkey if he moved the Jupiter missiles from

20:24.880 --> 20:34.800
Turkey. So long as Khrushchev removed them from Cuba, there were 13 men on the executive,

20:34.800 --> 20:40.000
on the, what they call the Ankon Committee, which was the group of people who were deciding,

20:40.640 --> 20:45.360
you know, what the action was, what they were going to do to end the Cuban Missile Crisis.

20:45.360 --> 20:52.000
And virtually, of those men, 11 of them wanted to invade and wanted to bomb and invade.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.560
And it was Jack and then later on my father and Bob McNamara who were the only people who were with

21:00.560 --> 21:07.920
him. But because he was able to see the world from Khrushchev's point of view, he believed that there

21:07.920 --> 21:15.360
was another solution. And then he also had the moral courage. So my father, you know, to get back

21:15.440 --> 21:22.480
to your question, famously said that moral courage is the most important quality and it's more,

21:22.480 --> 21:28.800
it's more rare than courage on the football field or courage in battle than physical courage. It's

21:28.800 --> 21:33.280
much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important quality in a human being.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.120
And you think that kind of empathy that you referred to, that requires moral courage?

21:38.080 --> 21:46.480
It certainly requires moral courage to act on it. You know, and particularly, you know, in,

21:47.680 --> 21:54.480
you know, anytime that a nation is at war, there's kind of a momentum or an inertia that says,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.520
okay, let's not look at this from the other person's point of view.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.400
And that's the time we really need to do that.

22:02.880 --> 22:09.920
Well, if we can apply that style of empathy, style of curiosity to the current war in Ukraine,

22:10.960 --> 22:15.440
what is your understanding of why Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022?

22:16.080 --> 22:22.480
Vladimir Putin could have avoided the war in the Ukraine. His invasion was illegal. It was

22:22.480 --> 22:32.480
unnecessary and it was brutal. But I think it's important for us to move beyond these kind of

22:32.480 --> 22:45.520
comic book depictions of this insane, avaricious Russian leader who wants to restore the Soviet

22:45.520 --> 22:54.800
Empire and that that's why, and it was I who made it an unfoked, unprovoked invasion of the Ukraine.

22:54.800 --> 23:01.840
He was provoked and we were provoking him and we were provoking him since 1997.

23:03.040 --> 23:09.680
And it's not just me that's saying that. I mean, when, and before Putin ever came in,

23:10.480 --> 23:17.600
we were provoking Russians in this way unnecessarily. And to go back that time in 1992

23:17.600 --> 23:21.280
when the Russians moved out of, when the Soviet Union was collapsing,

23:22.400 --> 23:27.600
the Russians moved out of East Germany and they did that, which was a huge concession to them.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.080
They had 400,000 troops in East Germany at that time and they were facing NATO troops on the

23:32.080 --> 23:38.240
other side of the wall. Gorbachev made this huge concession where he said to George Bush,

23:39.200 --> 23:44.320
I'm going to move all of our troops out and you can then reunify Germany under NATO,

23:44.320 --> 23:48.960
which was a hostile army to the, to the Soviet. It was created to, you know,

23:50.240 --> 23:55.600
with hostile intent toward the Soviet Union. And he said, you can take Germany,

23:55.600 --> 23:59.840
but I want your promise that you will not move NATO to the East. And James Baker,

23:59.840 --> 24:06.160
who was the secretary of state famously said, I will not move NATO. We will not move NATO one

24:06.320 --> 24:13.360
inch to the East. So then five years later in 1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was kind of the

24:13.360 --> 24:20.400
father of the neocons, who was a Democrat at that time served in the Carter administration,

24:21.520 --> 24:29.600
he said he published a paper, a blueprint for moving NATO right up to the Russian border,

24:29.600 --> 24:38.480
a thousand miles to the East and taking over 14 nations. And at that time, George Kennan,

24:38.480 --> 24:44.720
who was the kind of the deity of American diplomats, he was probably arguably, arguably

24:44.720 --> 24:51.520
the most important diplomat in American history. He was the architect of the containment policy

24:51.520 --> 24:58.480
during World War II. And he said, this is insane and it's unnecessary. And if you do this,

24:59.120 --> 25:05.040
it's going to provoke the Soviet, the Russians to a violent response. And we should be making

25:05.040 --> 25:09.840
friends with the Russians. They lost the Cold War. We should be treating them the way that we

25:09.840 --> 25:14.960
treated our adversaries after World War II, like with a Marshall Plan to try to help them

25:14.960 --> 25:20.400
incorporate into Europe and to be part of the brotherhood of, you know, of man and of Western

25:20.400 --> 25:24.960
nations. We shouldn't continue to be treating them as an enemy and particularly surrounding them at

25:24.960 --> 25:33.360
their borders. William Perry, who was then the secretary of defense under Bill Clinton threatened

25:33.360 --> 25:39.760
to resign. He was so upset by this plan to move NATO to the East. And William Burns, who was then

25:39.760 --> 25:45.680
the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, who's now at this moment, the head of the CIA said at

25:45.680 --> 25:51.760
that time the same thing. If you do this, it is going to provoke the Russians toward a military

25:51.760 --> 26:00.240
response. And we moved all around Russia. We moved to 14 nations, a thousand miles to the East,

26:00.240 --> 26:07.440
and we put Aegis missile systems in two nations, Romania and Poland. So we did what the Russians

26:07.440 --> 26:15.280
had done to us in 1962 that would have provoked an invasion of Cuba. We put those missile systems

26:15.280 --> 26:22.000
back there and then we'd walk away unilaterally, walk away from the two nuclear missile treaties,

26:22.000 --> 26:28.080
the intermediate nuclear missile treaties that we had with Russia. Neither of us would put

26:28.720 --> 26:34.160
those missile systems on the borders. We walk away from that and we put Aegis missile systems,

26:34.160 --> 26:38.880
which are nuclear capable. They can carry the Tomahawk missiles, which have nuclear warheads.

26:39.440 --> 26:45.680
So the last country that they didn't take was the Ukraine. And the Russians said, and in fact,

26:45.680 --> 26:53.200
Bill Perry said this, or William Burns said it, so now the head of the CIA, it is a red line.

26:53.200 --> 26:58.560
If we go into, if we bring NATO into Ukraine, that is a red line for the Russians. They cannot

26:58.560 --> 27:04.000
live with it. They cannot live with it. Russia has been invaded three times through the Ukraine.

27:04.800 --> 27:09.600
The last time it was invaded, we killed, or the Germans killed one out of every seven Russians.

27:10.320 --> 27:16.800
They destroyed, my uncle described what happened to Russia in his famous American university

27:16.800 --> 27:28.000
speech in 1963, 60 years ago this month, or last month, 60 years ago in June, June 10th, 1963.

27:28.800 --> 27:34.080
He told that speech was telling American people, put yourself in the shoes of the Russians.

27:35.120 --> 27:41.600
We need to do that if we're going to make peace. And he said, all of us have been taught that we

27:41.600 --> 27:46.320
won the war, but we didn't win the war. The Russians, if anybody won the war against Hitler,

27:46.320 --> 27:54.160
it was the Russians. Their country was destroyed. All of their cities, and he said, imagine if all

27:54.160 --> 28:00.960
of the cities on the east coast of Chicago were reduced to rubble and all of the fields burns,

28:00.960 --> 28:06.160
all of the forest burns. That's what happened to Russia. That's what they gave so that we could get

28:06.160 --> 28:12.960
rid of Adolf Hitler. And he had them put themselves in their position. And today there's none of that

28:12.960 --> 28:19.600
happening. We have refused repeatedly to talk to the Russians. We've broken up. There are two

28:19.600 --> 28:24.560
treaties, the Minsk agreements, which the Russians were willing to sign. And they said,

28:24.560 --> 28:32.480
we will stay. The Russians didn't want the Ukraine. They showed that when the Dombass region voted 90

28:32.480 --> 28:40.320
to 10 to leave and go to Russia, Putin said, no, we want Ukraine to stay intact, but we want you

28:40.320 --> 28:48.240
to sign the Minsk Accords. The Russians were very worried because of the US involvement in the coup

28:48.240 --> 28:58.000
in Ukraine in 2014. And then the oppression and the killing of 14,000 ethnic Russians.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.200
And Russia hasn't had the same reason, the same way that if Mexico would ageist missile systems

29:05.200 --> 29:12.160
from China or Russia on our border and then killed 14,000 expats American, we would go in there.

29:12.560 --> 29:20.320
Oh, he does have a national security interest in the Ukraine. He has an interest in protecting

29:20.320 --> 29:27.520
the Russian speaking people of the Ukraine. Yeah, I think Russians and the Minsk Accords did that.

29:27.520 --> 29:33.680
It left Ukraine as part of Russia. It left them as a semi-autonomous region that could continue

29:33.680 --> 29:38.640
to use their own language, which is essentially banned by the coup, by the government we put in

29:38.640 --> 29:50.960
in 2014. And we sabotaged that agreement. And we now know in April of 2022, Zelensky and Putin

29:50.960 --> 29:56.960
had inked a deal already to another peace agreement, and that the United States sent

29:56.960 --> 30:02.800
Boris Johnson, the neocons in the White House sent Boris Johnson over to the Ukraine to sabotage

30:02.800 --> 30:09.920
that agreement. So what do I think? I think this is a proxy war. I think this is a war that the

30:09.920 --> 30:16.720
neocons in the White House wanted. They've said for two decades they wanted this war and that

30:16.720 --> 30:23.440
they wanted to use Ukraine as a pawn in a proxy war between United States and Russia, the same

30:23.440 --> 30:29.680
as we used Afghanistan. And in fact, they say it, this is the model. Let's use the Afghanistan

30:29.680 --> 30:35.440
model. That was said again and again, and to get the Russians to overextend their troops and then

30:35.440 --> 30:43.120
fight them using local fighters and US weapons. And when President Biden was asked, why are we

30:43.120 --> 30:49.280
in the Ukraine, he was honest. He says to depose Vladimir Putin, regime change for Vladimir Putin.

30:49.280 --> 30:57.600
And when his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, in April 2022 was asked, why are we there, he said

30:57.600 --> 31:02.640
to degrade the Russian's capacity to fight anywhere, to exhaust the Russian army and degrade

31:02.640 --> 31:08.240
its capacity to fight elsewhere in the world. That's not a humanitarian mission. That's not

31:08.240 --> 31:16.080
what we were told. We were told this was an unprovoked invasion and that we're there to

31:16.080 --> 31:21.360
bring humanitarian relief to the Ukrainians. But that is the opposite. That is a war of attrition

31:21.360 --> 31:28.000
that is designed to chew up, to turn this little nation into an abattoir of death for the flower

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
of Ukrainian youth in order to advance a geopolitical ambition of certain people within

31:34.000 --> 31:40.960
the White House. And I think that's wrong. We should be talking to the Russians the way that

31:41.600 --> 31:48.640
Nixon talked to Brezhnev, the way that Bush talked to Gorbachev, the way that my uncle talked to

31:48.640 --> 31:54.240
Khrushchev. We need to be talking with the Russians, we should, and negotiating. And we

31:54.240 --> 32:00.160
need to be looking about how do we end this and preserve peace in Europe. Would you, as president,

32:00.160 --> 32:06.400
sit down and have a conversation with Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky separately and together

32:06.400 --> 32:13.840
to negotiate peace? Absolutely. What about Vladimir Putin? He's been in power since 2000.

32:14.240 --> 32:19.200
So, as the old adage goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

32:19.840 --> 32:26.160
Do you think he has been corrupted by being in power for so long? If you think of the man,

32:26.160 --> 32:34.240
if you look at his mind? Listen, I don't know exactly. I can't say because I just,

32:34.240 --> 32:40.000
I don't know enough about him or about, you know, the evidence that I've seen

32:40.960 --> 32:47.040
is that he is homicidal. He kills his enemies or poisons them.

32:48.160 --> 32:55.040
And, you know, the reaction I've seen to that, to those accusations from him have not been to deny

32:55.040 --> 33:01.440
that, but to kind of laugh it off. I think he's a dangerous man and that, of course, you know,

33:02.240 --> 33:08.720
there's probably corruption in his regime. But having said that, it's not our business

33:09.680 --> 33:14.800
to change the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a good idea to do regime change in

33:14.800 --> 33:23.120
Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible. And, you know,

33:23.120 --> 33:29.360
Vladimir Putin himself has said, you know, we will not live in a world without Russia. And it was

33:29.360 --> 33:36.400
clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself. And he has his hand on a button

33:36.400 --> 33:43.280
that could bring Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job

33:43.280 --> 33:49.280
to change that regime. And we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating

33:49.280 --> 33:54.400
them as an enemy. Now we've pushed them into the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our

33:54.400 --> 34:00.880
country. And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin

34:00.880 --> 34:07.520
at all. Putin now, you know, if you believe that the polls that are coming out of Russia,

34:08.400 --> 34:15.200
they show him, you know, the most recent polls that I've seen show him with an 89% popularity

34:15.200 --> 34:23.120
that people in Russia support the war in Ukraine. And they support him as an individual.

34:25.120 --> 34:29.280
And I understand there's problems with polling and, you know, you don't know what to believe.

34:29.280 --> 34:36.880
But the polls consistently show that. And, you know, it's not America's business to be the

34:36.880 --> 34:41.760
policeman of the world and to be changing regimes in the world. That's illegal. We shouldn't be

34:41.760 --> 34:50.800
breaking international laws. You know, we should actually be looking for ways to improve relationships

34:50.800 --> 34:56.720
with Russia, not to, you know, not to destroy Russia, not to destroy and not to choose its

34:56.720 --> 34:59.920
leadership for them. That's up to the Russian people, not us.

34:59.920 --> 35:05.360
So step one is to sit down and empathize with the leaders of both nations to understand

35:05.360 --> 35:11.520
their history, their concerns, their hopes, just to open the door for conversation so they're not

35:11.520 --> 35:14.560
back to the corner. Yeah. And I think the U.S. can play

35:15.920 --> 35:21.680
a really important role. And a U.S. president can play a really important role by reassuring

35:21.680 --> 35:25.760
the Russians that we're not going to consider them an enemy anymore, that we want to be friends.

35:26.720 --> 35:31.360
And it doesn't mean that you have to let down your guard completely. The way that you do it,

35:31.360 --> 35:36.080
which was the way President Kennedy did it, is you do it one step at a time. You take baby steps.

35:36.080 --> 35:45.440
We do a unilateral move to reduce our, you know, our hostility and aggression and see if the

35:45.440 --> 35:51.600
Russians reciprocate. And that's the way that we should be doing it. And, you know, we should be

35:51.600 --> 35:58.560
easing our way into a positive relationship with Russia. We have a lot in common with Russia and

35:58.560 --> 36:03.600
we should be friends with Russia and with the Russian people. And, you know, apparently there's

36:03.600 --> 36:15.440
been 350,000 Ukrainians who have died at least in this war. And there's probably been 60 or 80,000

36:15.440 --> 36:21.200
Russians. And that should not give us any joy. It should not give us any, you know, I saw

36:22.960 --> 36:29.360
Lindsey Graham on TV saying, you know, something to the extent that anything we can do to kill

36:29.360 --> 36:36.240
Russians is a good use of our money. It is not. You know, those are somebody's children.

36:38.480 --> 36:44.160
We should have compassion for them. This war is an unnecessary war. We should settle it through

36:44.160 --> 36:50.000
negotiation, through diplomacy, through statecraft and not through weapons.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.600
Do you think this war can come to an end purely through military operations?

36:55.600 --> 37:00.080
No, I mean, I don't think there's any way in the world that the Ukrainians can be the Russians.

37:00.080 --> 37:06.560
I don't think there's any appetite in Europe. I think Europe is now, you know, in having severe

37:06.560 --> 37:11.200
problems in Germany, Italy, France. You're seeing these riots. There's internal problems in those

37:11.200 --> 37:20.480
countries. There is no appetite in Europe for sending men to die in Ukraine. And the Ukrainians

37:20.480 --> 37:26.880
do not have anybody left. The Ukrainians are using press gangs to, you know, to fill the ranks of

37:26.880 --> 37:33.760
their armies. Military age men are trying as hard as they can to get out of the Ukraine right now,

37:33.760 --> 37:39.840
to avoid going to the front. The Russians apparently have been killing Ukrainians at a

37:39.840 --> 37:46.400
7 to 1 ratio. My son fought over there and he told me, you know, he had

37:49.040 --> 37:54.880
firefights with the Russians mainly at night, but he said most of the battles were artillery wars

37:54.880 --> 38:04.880
during the day. And the Russians now outgun the NATO forces 10 to 1 in artillery. They're killing

38:05.680 --> 38:10.080
at a horrendous rate. Now, you know, my interpretation of what's happened so far

38:10.080 --> 38:19.120
is that Putin actually went in early on with a small force because he expected to meet somebody

38:19.120 --> 38:27.280
on the other end of a negotiating table once he went in. And when that didn't happen, they

38:27.280 --> 38:33.840
did not have a large enough force to be able to mount an offensive. And so they've been building

38:33.840 --> 38:39.840
up that force up to now and they now have that force. And even against this small original force,

38:39.840 --> 38:47.040
the Ukrainians have been helpless. All of their offenses have died. They've now killed, you know,

38:47.040 --> 38:55.200
the head of the Ukrainian special forces, which was probably arguably by many accounts,

38:56.080 --> 39:05.920
the best elite military unit in all of Europe. The commandant, the commander of that special

39:05.920 --> 39:15.600
forces group gave a speech about four months ago saying that 86% of his men are dead or wounded

39:15.600 --> 39:24.880
and cannot return to the front. He cannot rebuild that force. And you know, the troops that are now

39:24.880 --> 39:30.000
headed, that are now filling the gaps of all those 350,000 men who have been lost

39:31.120 --> 39:38.240
are scantily trained and they're arriving green at the front. Many of them do not want to be there.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.080
Many of them are giving up and going over the Russian side. We've seen this again and again,

39:44.080 --> 39:47.440
including platoon size groups that are defecting to the Russians.

39:48.400 --> 39:55.840
And I don't think it's possible to win. And anybody, you know, I saw it. Of course,

39:55.840 --> 40:04.240
I've studied World War II history exhaustively, but I saw a, there's a new, I think it's a Netflix

40:04.240 --> 40:09.680
series of documentaries that I highly recommend to people. They're colorized versions of the black

40:09.680 --> 40:16.080
and white films from the battles of World War II, but it's all the battles of World War II.

40:16.160 --> 40:23.920
So I watched Stalingrad the other night and, you know, the willingness of the Russians to

40:25.360 --> 40:34.320
fight on against any kind of allies and to make huge sacrifices of Russians, the Russians themselves

40:34.320 --> 40:38.080
who are making the sacrifice with their lives, the willingness of them to do that for their

40:38.080 --> 40:45.680
motherland is almost inexhaustible. It is incomprehensible to think that Ukraine

40:46.640 --> 40:52.160
can beat Russia in a war. It would be like Mexico beating the United States. It's just,

40:52.160 --> 40:56.400
it's impossible to think that it can happen. And, you know, Russia has deployed

40:57.600 --> 41:05.040
a tiny, tiny fraction of its military so far. And, you know, now it has China with its mass

41:05.040 --> 41:12.080
production capacity supporting its war effort. It's just, it's a hopeless situation and we've

41:12.080 --> 41:18.800
been lied to. You know, the press in our country and our government are just, you know, promoting

41:18.800 --> 41:23.680
this lie that the Ukrainians are about to win and that everything's going great and that

41:24.880 --> 41:30.720
Putin's on the run and there's all this wishful thinking because of the Wagner group, you know,

41:31.440 --> 41:37.120
the Prigozhin and the Wagner group that this was an internal coup and it showed dissent and weakness

41:37.120 --> 41:44.480
of Putin. And none of that is true. That insurgency, which wasn't even an insurgency,

41:44.480 --> 41:51.200
only got 4,000 of his men to follow him out of 20,000. And they were quickly stopped and nobody

41:51.200 --> 41:55.840
in the Russian military, the oligarchy, the political system, nobody supported it, you know.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.680
And by we're being told, oh yeah, it's the beginning at the end for Putin,

42:00.720 --> 42:05.920
he's weakened, he's wounded, he's on his way out. And all of these things are just lies that we are

42:05.920 --> 42:11.600
being fed. So to push back on a small aspect of this that you kind of implied, so I've traveled

42:11.600 --> 42:18.640
to Ukraine and one thing that I should say, similar to the Battle of Stalingrad, it is just not,

42:19.200 --> 42:23.520
it is not only the Russians that fight to the end. I think the Ukrainians are very

42:23.840 --> 42:29.920
to fight to the end. And the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody,

42:29.920 --> 42:35.680
this was a year ago in August with Khursan, everybody was proud to fight and die for their

42:35.680 --> 42:41.600
country. And there's some aspect where this war unified the people to give them a reason

42:41.600 --> 42:45.680
and an understanding that this is what it means to be Ukrainian and I will fight to the death.

42:47.360 --> 42:51.600
I would agree with that. And I should have said that myself at the beginning,

42:52.080 --> 42:58.240
that's one of the reasons my son went over there to fight because he was inspired by the valor of

42:58.240 --> 43:03.200
the Ukrainian people and this extraordinary willingness of them. And I think Putin thought

43:03.200 --> 43:09.520
it would be much easier to sweep into Ukraine and he found a stone wall of Ukrainians where they're

43:09.520 --> 43:15.920
ready to put their lives and their bodies on the line. But that to me makes the whole episode even

43:15.920 --> 43:30.480
more tragic. I think that the US role in this has been that there were many opportunities

43:31.280 --> 43:36.800
to settle this war and the Ukrainians wanted to settle it. Vladimir Zelensky, when he ran in 2019,

43:36.800 --> 43:44.800
here's a guy who's a comedian, he's an actor. He had no political experience and yet he won

43:44.800 --> 43:51.360
this election with 70% of the vote. Why? He won on a peace platform. Anyone promising to sign

43:51.360 --> 43:57.680
the Minsk Accords? And yet something happened when he got in there that made him suddenly pivot.

43:57.680 --> 44:05.200
And I think it's a good guess what happened. I think he came under threat by

44:05.200 --> 44:12.480
ultra-nationalist nationalists within his own administration and the insistence of

44:12.560 --> 44:19.040
neocons like Victoria Nuland in the White House that we don't want peace with Putin, we want a war.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.920
Do you worry about a nuclear war?

44:22.560 --> 44:29.440
Yeah, I worry about it. It seems like a silly question, but it's not. It's a serious question.

44:29.440 --> 44:39.200
Well, the reason it's not is just because people seem to be in this kind of dream state about that

44:39.200 --> 44:47.680
it'll never happen. And yet it can happen very easily and it can happen at any time.

44:48.240 --> 44:56.160
And if we push the Russians too far, I don't doubt that Putin, if he felt like his regime

44:57.120 --> 45:02.640
or his nation was in danger, that the United States was going to be able to

45:03.600 --> 45:12.880
place a quizzling into the Kremlin that he would use nuclear torpedoes

45:15.520 --> 45:22.320
and these strategic weapons that they have. And once you do that,

45:22.320 --> 45:28.720
nobody controls the trajectory. By the way, I have very strong memories of the

45:29.360 --> 45:36.320
Cuban Missile Crisis and those 13 days when we came closer to nuclear war,

45:36.320 --> 45:39.600
and particularly I think it was when the U-2 got shut down over

45:41.280 --> 45:48.320
Cuba and nobody in this country, there's a lot of people in Washington, DC who at that point thought

45:48.320 --> 45:56.560
that they very well may wake up dead, that the world may end at night. 30 million Americans killed,

45:56.560 --> 46:03.360
130 million Russians. This is what our military brass wanted. They saw a war with Russia,

46:03.360 --> 46:09.040
a nuclear exchange with Russia as not only inevitable, but also desirable because they

46:09.040 --> 46:15.200
wanted to do it now while we still had the superiority. Can you actually go through the

46:15.200 --> 46:20.160
feelings you've had about the Cuban Missile Crisis? What are your memories of it? What are some

46:20.960 --> 46:29.360
in the middle? I was going to school in Washington, DC to our Lady of Victory,

46:29.360 --> 46:36.000
which is in Washington, DC. I lived in Virginia across the Potomac and we would cross the bridge

46:36.000 --> 46:43.920
every day into DC. And during the crisis, US Marshals came to my house to take us,

46:43.920 --> 46:48.320
I think around day eight. My father was spending the night at the White House.

46:48.320 --> 46:53.200
He wasn't coming home. He was staying with the XCOM committee and sleeping there and they were

46:53.200 --> 46:57.840
up 24 hours a day. They were debating and trying to figure out what was happening.

47:00.480 --> 47:05.600
But we had US Marshals come to our house to take us down. They were going to take us down to

47:07.520 --> 47:17.840
White Sulphur Springs in southern Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountains where there was an

47:17.840 --> 47:24.000
underground city, essentially a bunker that was like a city and apparently it had McDonald's in

47:24.000 --> 47:30.400
it and a lot of other, it was a full city for the US government and their families. US Marshals came

47:30.400 --> 47:35.600
to our house to take us down there and I was very excited about doing that. And this was at a time

47:35.600 --> 47:41.200
when we were doing the drills, we were doing the duck and cover drills once a week at our school

47:42.160 --> 47:49.280
where they would tell you when the alarms go off, then you put your head onto the table,

47:50.080 --> 47:55.920
remove the sharps from your desk, put them inside your desk, you put your head onto the table and

47:55.920 --> 48:00.800
you wait and the initial blast will take the windows out of the school and then we all stand

48:00.800 --> 48:06.320
up and file in an orderly fashion into the basement where we're going to be for the next six or eight

48:06.320 --> 48:14.160
months or whatever. But in the basement where we went occasionally in those corridors were lined

48:14.160 --> 48:18.880
with freeze-dried food canisters up to the ceiling from floor to ceiling. So people were,

48:19.600 --> 48:27.200
we were all preparing for this and it was Bob McNamara who was a friend of mine and was my

48:27.200 --> 48:32.880
father, one of my father's closest friends as Secretary of Defense. He later called it mass

48:32.880 --> 48:37.920
psychosis and my father deeply regretted participating in the bomb shelter program

48:37.920 --> 48:47.600
because he said it was part of a psychological psyop trick to teach Americans that nuclear war

48:47.600 --> 48:55.280
was acceptable, that it was survivable. Anyway, when the marshals came to our house, take me

48:55.280 --> 49:02.800
and my brother Joe away and we were the ones who were home at that time, my father called

49:03.440 --> 49:08.480
and he talked to us on the phone and he said, I don't want you going down there because

49:11.120 --> 49:17.600
if you disappear from school people are going to panic and I need you to be a good soldier

49:17.600 --> 49:24.320
and go to school. And he said something to me during that period which was that if the

49:24.320 --> 49:29.840
nuclear war happened it would be better to be among the dead than the living, which I did not

49:29.840 --> 49:39.600
believe. I had already prepared myself for the dystopian future and I spent every day in the

49:39.600 --> 49:46.320
woods. I knew that I could survive by catching crawfish and cooking mud puppies and doing

49:46.320 --> 49:54.160
whatever I had to do, but I felt like, okay, I can handle this. And I really wanted to see the

49:54.160 --> 50:02.640
setup down in this underground city. But anyway, that was part of it for me. My father was away

50:02.640 --> 50:09.680
and the last days of it, my father got this idea because Khrushchev had sent two letters.

50:10.560 --> 50:18.320
He sent one letter that was conciliatory and then he sent a letter that after his joint chiefs

50:18.320 --> 50:22.400
and the warmongers around him saw that letter and they disapproved of it. They sent another letter

50:22.400 --> 50:29.360
that was extremely belligerent. And my father had the idea, let's just pretend we didn't get

50:29.360 --> 50:38.560
the second letter and reply to the first one. And then he went down to Dobrynin and he met Dobrynin

50:38.560 --> 50:45.760
in the justice department and Dobrynin was the Soviet ambassador and they proposed this

50:45.760 --> 50:52.720
settlement, which was a secret settlement where Khrushchev would withdraw the missiles from Cuba.

50:52.720 --> 50:57.920
Khrushchev had put the missiles in Cuba because we had put missiles, nuclear missiles in Turkey and

50:59.120 --> 51:06.320
Italy. And my uncle's secret deal was that if Khrushchev removed the missiles from Cuba,

51:06.320 --> 51:12.320
within six months he would get rid of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey. But if Khrushchev told anybody

51:12.320 --> 51:20.480
about the deal, it was off. So if news got out about that secret deal, it was off. That was the

51:20.480 --> 51:25.040
actual deal and Khrushchev complied with it and then my uncle complied with it.

51:25.680 --> 51:29.840
How much of that part of human history turned on the decisions of one person?

51:31.360 --> 51:35.200
I think that's one of the, you know, because that of course is the perennial question,

51:35.200 --> 51:43.440
right? But it is history kind of on an automatic pilot and, you know, human decisions and the

51:43.440 --> 51:50.960
decisions of leaders really only have, you know, a marginal or incremental bearing on what is going

51:50.960 --> 51:55.920
to happen anyway. But I think that is the, and historians argue about that all the time,

51:57.040 --> 52:03.360
I think that that is a really good example of a place in human history that

52:04.320 --> 52:08.560
literally the world could have ended if we had a different leader in the White House.

52:08.560 --> 52:15.040
And the reason for that is that there were, as I recall, 64 gun emplacements,

52:15.040 --> 52:22.480
you know, missile emplacements. Each one of those missile emplacements had a crew of about 100 men

52:22.480 --> 52:38.480
and they were Soviets. We had a couple of questions that my uncle asked the CIA and he

52:38.480 --> 52:45.040
asked, Dulles was already gone, but he asked the CIA and he asked his military brass because they

52:45.040 --> 52:50.480
all wanted to go in. Everybody wanted to go in and my uncle said, my uncle asked to see the aerial

52:50.480 --> 52:55.680
photos and he examined those personally and that is why it is important to have a leader in the

52:55.680 --> 53:04.160
White House who can push back on their bureaucracies. And then he asked them, you know,

53:04.800 --> 53:10.720
are those, who is manning those missile sites and are they Russians? And if they are Russians and

53:10.720 --> 53:18.640
we bomb them, isn't it going to force Khrushchev to then go into Berlin?

53:20.640 --> 53:24.400
And that would be the beginning of a cascade of facts that would,

53:24.400 --> 53:27.040
you know, highly likely to end a nuclear confrontation.

53:28.480 --> 53:37.200
And the military brass said to my uncle, oh, we don't think he'll have the guts to do that.

53:37.840 --> 53:45.520
So my uncle was like, that's what you're betting on? And, you know, they all wanted him to go in.

53:45.520 --> 53:51.120
They wanted him to bomb the sites and then invade Cuba. And he said, if we bomb those sites,

53:51.120 --> 53:56.160
we're going to be killing Russians and it's going to force, it's going to provoke Russia

53:56.160 --> 54:00.080
into some response and the obvious response is for them to go into Berlin.

54:00.880 --> 54:08.240
Oh, but the thing that we didn't know then, that we didn't find out until I think, you know,

54:08.240 --> 54:13.280
there was like a 30-year anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Havana.

54:14.560 --> 54:23.200
And what we learned then was that from the Russians who came to that event, it was like a symposium

54:23.200 --> 54:28.640
where everybody on both sides talked about it. And we learned a lot of stuff that nobody knew

54:28.640 --> 54:35.760
before. One of the insane things, the most insane thing that we learned was that the weapons were

54:35.760 --> 54:42.320
already, the nuclear warheads were already in place. They were ready to fire and that the

54:42.320 --> 54:52.320
authorization to fire was made, was delegated to each of the gun crew commanders. So there were

54:52.320 --> 54:58.080
60 people who had all had authorization to fire if they felt themselves under attack.

54:59.440 --> 55:04.000
So you have to believe that at least one of them would have launched and that would have been the

55:04.000 --> 55:10.080
beginning of the end. And, you know, if anybody had launched, you know, we knew what would happen.

55:10.080 --> 55:15.760
My uncle knew what would happen because he asked again and again, what's going to happen? And they

55:15.760 --> 55:24.400
said 30 million Americans will be killed, but we will kill 130 million Russians. So we will win.

55:25.280 --> 55:33.280
And that was a victory for them. And my uncle later said, he told Arthur Slesinger and Kenny

55:33.280 --> 55:37.760
O'Donnell, he said, those guys, he called them the salad brass, the guys with all of this stuff on

55:37.760 --> 55:45.920
their chest. And he said, those guys, they don't care because they know that if it happens,

55:45.920 --> 55:49.120
that they're going to be in the charge of everything. They're the ones who are going

55:49.120 --> 55:53.920
to be running the world after that. So for them, you know, it was, there was an incentive to,

55:53.920 --> 55:58.400
to kill 130 million Russians and 30 million Americans by my uncle.

55:58.400 --> 56:04.160
He had this correspondence with Khrushchev. They were secretly corresponding with each other.

56:04.160 --> 56:09.040
And that is what saved the world is that they had that both of them had been men of war.

56:10.080 --> 56:16.160
Eisenhower famously said, it will, it will not be a man of war. It will not be a soldier who starts

56:16.160 --> 56:21.440
World War III because a guy who's actually seen it knows how bad it is. And my uncle, you know,

56:21.440 --> 56:28.080
had been in the heat of the South Pacific. His boat had been cut in two by a Japanese destroyer.

56:30.240 --> 56:35.120
Three of his crewmen had been killed, one of them badly burned. He pulled that guy with a lanyard

56:35.120 --> 56:40.880
in his teeth, six miles to an island in the middle of the night. And then they hid out there for

56:40.880 --> 56:46.640
10 days, you know, and, and, you know, he came back. Like I said, he was the only

56:46.640 --> 56:51.680
president of the United States that are in the Purple Heart. Meanwhile, Khrushchev had been at

56:51.680 --> 56:58.160
Stalingrad, which was the worst place to be on the planet, you know, probably in the 20th century,

56:58.880 --> 57:05.440
other than, you know, in Auschwitz or one of the death camps. It was, you know, it was, it was the

57:05.440 --> 57:10.800
most ferocious, horrific war with people starving, people, you know, committing cannibalism,

57:11.440 --> 57:17.920
you know, eating the dogs, the cats, eating their shoe leather, freezing to death by the thousands,

57:17.920 --> 57:23.200
et cetera. Khrushchev did not want, the last thing he wanted was a war and the last thing my uncle

57:23.200 --> 57:29.600
wanted was a war. And they, but the CIA did not know anything about Khrushchev. And the reason for

57:29.600 --> 57:40.640
that is there was a mole in Langley so that every time the CIA got a spy in the Kremlin,

57:40.640 --> 57:46.000
he would immediately be killed. So they had no eyes in the Kremlin. You know, there were

57:46.000 --> 57:52.560
literally hundreds of Russian spies who had, who had defected the United States and were

57:52.560 --> 57:58.320
in the Kremlin who were killed during that period. They had no idea anything about Khrushchev,

57:58.320 --> 58:02.960
about how he saw the world. And they saw the Kremlin itself as a monolith, you know, that this

58:04.560 --> 58:10.160
kind of, you know, the same way that we look at Putin today, that, you know, it's all they have

58:10.160 --> 58:14.880
this ambition of world conquest and that it's driving them and there's nothing else they think

58:14.880 --> 58:22.160
about. They're absolutely single-minded about it. But actually there was a big division between

58:22.160 --> 58:28.480
Khrushchev and his joint chiefs and his intelligence apparatus. And they both at one

58:28.480 --> 58:33.360
point discovered they were both in the same situation. They were surrounded by spies and

58:33.360 --> 58:38.320
military personnel who were intent on going to war and they were the two guys resisting it. So

58:38.320 --> 58:45.360
when my uncle, my uncle had this idea of, you know, being the peace president from the beginning,

58:45.360 --> 58:50.400
he told Ben Bradley, one of his best friends who, you know, was the publisher of The Washington

58:50.400 --> 58:58.320
Post or the editor-in-chief at that time, he said, Ben Bradley asked him, what is, what do

58:58.320 --> 59:05.040
you want in your gravestone? And my uncle said, he kept the peace. He said, the principal job of

59:05.040 --> 59:13.200
president of the United States is to keep the country out of war. And so when he first became

59:13.200 --> 59:21.920
president, he anxiously agreed to meet Khrushchev in Geneva to do his summit. And by the way,

59:21.920 --> 59:27.760
Eisenhower had wanted to do the same thing. Eisenhower wanted peace and he was going to

59:27.760 --> 59:35.040
meet in Vienna. But that peace summit was blown up. He was going to try to do, you know, he was

59:35.040 --> 59:41.600
going to try to end the Cold War. Eisenhower was in the last year of his, in May of 1960.

59:42.560 --> 59:50.960
But that was torpedoed by the CIA during the U-2 crash. You know, they sent a U-2 over the Soviet

59:50.960 --> 59:56.560
Union and it got shot down. And then they told, and then Alan Douglas told Eisenhower to deny

59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.640
that we had a program. They didn't know that the Russians had captured Gary Francis Powers.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:08.080
And so when, and that blew up the peace talks between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. And so,

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:16.320
you know, there was a lot of tension. My uncle wanted to break that tension. He agreed to meet

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:24.160
with Khrushchev in Vienna early on in his term. He went over there and Khrushchev snubbed him.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:33.600
Khrushchev lectured him imperiously about the, you know, the terror of American imperialism

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.320
and rebuffed any, you know, they did agree not to go into Laos. They made an agreement that kept

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:48.080
the United States, kept my uncle from sending troops to Laos. But it had been a disaster in Vienna.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:54.880
So then we had a spy that used to come to our house all the time. A guy called Georgi Bolshakoy.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:02.960
He was this Russian spy my parents had met at the embassy. They had gone to a party or reception

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:09.280
at the Russian embassy and he had approached them and they knew he was a GRU agent and KGB.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.760
He was both. Oh, he used to come to our house. They really liked him. He was very attractive.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.520
He was always laughing and joking. He would do rope climbing contests with my father. He would

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.120
do push-up contests with my father. He was, he could do the Russian dancing, the Cossack dancing.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:33.520
And he would do that for us and teach us that. And he was, and we knew he was a spy too. And this

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.000
was at the time of, you know, the James Bond films were first coming out. So it was really exciting

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.920
for us to have an actual Russian spy in our house. The State Department was horrified by it. But,

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:52.560
but anyway, when Khrushchev, after Vienna and after, you know, the Bay of Pigs,

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:59.520
Khrushchev had second thoughts. And he sent this long letter to my uncle.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:07.440
And he didn't want to go through his, his State Department or his embassy. He wanted to end run

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.760
them. And he was friends with Bolshoy. So he gave Georgi the letter and Georgi brought it and handed

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.600
it to Pierre Salinger, folded in the New York Times. And he gave it to my uncle. And it was

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:28.560
this beautiful letter, which he said, you know, he, my uncle had talked to him about the children

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.560
who were played, you know, we played 29 grandchildren who were playing in his yard.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:38.000
And he's saying, what is our moral basis for making a decision that could kill these children? So

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.480
they'll never write a poem. They'll never participate in elections. They'll never run for

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.040
office. How can we make, how can we, can we morally make a decision that is going to eliminate

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.120
life for these beautiful kids? And he had said that to Khrushchev and Khrushchev wrote in this

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:05.200
letter back saying that he was now sitting as this dacha on the Black Sea and that he was thinking

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.640
about what my uncle Jack had said to him at Vienna. And he regretted very deeply not having taken the

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.120
olive leaf that Jack had offered him. And then he said, you know, it occurs to me now that we're all

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.440
on an arc and that there is not another one and that the entire fate of the planet

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.440
and all of its creatures and all of the children are dependent on the decisions we make. And you

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:36.080
and I have a moral obligation to go forward with each other as friends. And immediately after that,

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:44.160
this was, you know, he said that right after the Berlin crisis in 1962, General Curtis LeMay tried

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:55.760
to, had tried to provoke a war with an incident at Checkpoint Charlie, which was the entrance,

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:03.280
the entrance and exit through the Berlin Wall in Berlin. And the Russian tanks had come to the wall,

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.480
the US tanks had come to the wall and there was a standoff. And my uncle had sent a message to

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.040
Khrushchev then through Dobrynin saying, my back is at the wall. I cannot, I have no place to back,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.840
to please back off. And then we will back off. And Khrushchev took his word,

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:30.000
backed his tanks off first. And then my uncle ordered LeMay to back, he had, LeMay had mounted

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.960
bulldozer plows on the front of the tanks to plow down the Berlin Wall. And the Russians had

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.200
come. So it was just, you know, it was the, it was his generals trying to provoke a war.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:49.040
And, but they started talking to each other. And then when he, after he wrote that letter,

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.560
they agreed that they would install a hotline so they could talk to each other and they wouldn't

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:02.720
have to go through intermediaries. And so at Jack's house on the Cape, there was a red phone that we

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.160
knew if we picked it up, Khrushchev would answer. And there was another one in the White House.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.880
But they knew it was important to talk to each other, you know, and you just wish that we had

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:22.800
that kind of leadership today. That can, you know, that just understands our job. Look, I know you

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.560
know a lot about AI, right? And you know how dangerous it is potentially to humanity and what

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:36.640
opportunities it also, you know, offers. But it could kill us all. I mean, Elon said first

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.600
it's going to steal our job, then it's going to kill us, right? And it's probably not hyperbole.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.720
It's actually, you know, if it follows the laws of biological evolution, which are just the laws

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:55.680
of mathematics, that's probably a good endpoint for it, you know, a potential endpoint. So we need,

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:02.000
it's going to happen, but we need to make sure it's regulated and it's regulated properly for

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:11.920
safety in every country. And that includes Russia and China and Iran. Right now we should be putting

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:17.280
all the weapons of war aside and sitting down with those guys and say, how are we going to do this?

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.360
There's much more important things to do. This stuff is going to kill us if we don't figure out

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:30.720
how to regulate it. And leadership needs to look down the road at what is the real risk here.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:40.880
And the real risk is that, you know, AI will enslave us for one thing and then destroy us

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.600
and do all this other stuff. And how about biological weapons? We're now all working on

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.640
these biological weapons and we're doing biological weapons from Ebola and, you know,

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.880
dengue fever and, you know, all of these other bad things. And we're making ethnic bio-weapons,

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.360
bio-weapons that can only kill Russians, bio-weapons that the Chinese are making that,

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:13.120
you know, can kill people who don't have Chinese genes. So all of this is now within reach. We're

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:20.800
actively doing it and we need to stop it. And biological weapons treaty is the easiest thing

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.120
in the world to do. We can verify it, we can enforce it, and everybody wants to agree to it.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:33.040
Only insane people do not want to continue this kind of research. There's no reason to do it.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.520
So there are these existential threats to all of humanity now out there like AI and biological

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:47.760
weapons. We need to stop fighting each other, start competing on economic game fields, playing

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.440
fields instead of military playing fields, which will be good for all of humanity. And we need to

01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.560
sit down with each other and negotiate reasonable treaties on how we regulate AI and biological

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.360
weapons. And nobody's talking about this in this political race right now. Nobody's talking about

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.840
it in a government. They get fixated on these little wars and, you know, and these comic book

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:19.840
depictions of good versus evil. And, you know, and we all go, you know, and go off and give them the

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.240
weapons and enrich, you know, the military and industrial complex. But we're on the road to

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:33.360
perdition if we don't end this. And some of this requires to have this kind of phone that connects

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.000
Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy that cuts through all the bureaucracy to have this communication

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.920
between heads of state. And in the case of AI, perhaps heads of tech companies where you can

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.280
just pick up the phone and have a conversation because a lot of it, a lot of the existential

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.640
threats of artificial intelligence, perhaps even bio weapons is unintentional. It's not even

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:01.200
strategic intentional effects. So you have to be transparent and honest about, especially with AI,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.240
that people might not know what's the worst that's going to happen once you release it out into the

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:11.600
wild. And you have to have an honest communication about how to do it so that companies are not

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:19.200
terrified of regulation, overreach of regulation. And then government is not terrified of tech

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.440
companies, of manipulating them in some direct or indirect ways. So like there's a trust that

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:33.280
builds versus a distrust. So basically that old phone where Khrushchev can call John F. Kennedy

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:44.400
is needed. Listen, I don't understand AI. I can see from all this technology how

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.120
it's this kind of turnkey totalitarianism that once you put these systems in place,

01:09:52.080 --> 01:10:00.640
they can be misused to enslave people and they can be misused in wars and to subjugate, to kill,

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.280
to do all of these bad things. And I don't think there's anybody on Capitol Hill who understands

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.200
this. We need to bring in the tech community and say, tell us what these regulations need to look

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:20.960
like so that there can be freedom to innovate, so that we can milk AI for all of the good things

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:29.760
but not fall into these traps that pose existential threats to humanity.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.360
It seems like John F. Kennedy is a singular figure in that he was able to have the

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:42.560
humility to reach out to Khrushchev and also the strength and integrity to resist the,

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:49.120
what did you call them, the salad brass and institutions like the CIA. So that makes it

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:55.760
particularly tragic that he was killed. To what degree was the CIA involved

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.760
or the various bureaucracy involved in his death?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:09.600
The evidence that the CIA was involved in my uncle's murder and that they were subsequently

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.120
involved in the cover-up and continue to be involved in the cover-up. There's still 5,000

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:24.080
documents that they won't release 60 years later, is I think so insurmountable and so

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:33.840
mountainous and overwhelming that it's beyond any reasonable doubt, including dozens of confessions

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:42.400
of people who were involved in the assassination, but every kind of document.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.600
It came as a surprise recently to most Americans, I think,

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:58.320
the release of these documents in which the press, the American media, finally acknowledged that

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:07.680
yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset and he was recruited in 1957. He was a Marine

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:15.120
officer, working at the Atasui Air Force Base, which was the CIA Air Force Base with the U-2

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.720
flights, which was a CIA program and that he was recruited by James Jesus Angleton, who was the

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:30.400
director of counterintelligence and then sent on a fake defection to Russia and then brought back

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:41.280
to Dallas. People didn't know that, even though it's been known for decades. It never percolated

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:51.840
into the mainstream media because they have such an allergy to anything that challenges the Warren

01:12:51.840 --> 01:13:03.280
report. When Congress investigated my uncle's murder in the 1970s, the church committee did,

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.400
and they did a two and a half year investigation and they had many, many more documents and much

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:16.160
more testimony available to them than the Warren Commission had. This was a decade after the Warren

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.920
Commission, they came to the conclusion that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy. There was a

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.480
division where essentially one guy on that committee believed it was primarily the mafia,

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:37.200
but Richard Schweitzer, the senator who was head of the committee, said straight out the CIA was

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.280
involved in the murder of the President of the United States. I've talked to most of the staff

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.160
on that committee and they said, yeah, and the CIA was stonewalling us the whole way through.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:56.160
The actual people that the CIA appointed, George Johannides, who the CIA appointed as a liaison to

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.720
the committee, they brought him out of retirement. He had been one of the masterminds of the

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:11.520
assassination. It's impossible to even talk about a tiny fraction of the evidence here.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.960
I suggest to people, there are hundreds of books written about this that assemble this evidence and

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:25.520
mobilize the evidence. The best book to me for people to read is James Douglas's book,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:32.640
which is called The Unspeakable. Douglas is an extraordinary scholar and he does this

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:41.040
it's an amazing job of digesting and summarizing and mobilizing all of the

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.240
probably a million documents and the evidence from all these confessions that have come out

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:55.040
into a coherent story. It's riveting to read and I recommend people who do not take my word for it

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:02.000
and don't take anybody else's word for it. Go ahead and do the research yourself in one way

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.920
to do that is probably the most efficient way is to read Douglas's books. He has all the references

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.800
there. So if it's true that CIA had a hand in this assassination, how is it possible for them to

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:21.200
amass so much power? How is it possible for them to become corrupt? And is it individuals or is it

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.200
the entire institution? No, it's not the entire institution. My daughter-in-law who's helping to

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:36.800
run my campaign was a CIA in the clandestine services for all of her career. She was a spy

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.560
in the weapons of mass destruction program in the Mideast and in China.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:49.040
There's 22,000 people who work for the CIA. Probably 20,000 of those are patriotic Americans

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.200
and really good public servants and they're doing important work for our country.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:02.000
But the institution is corrupt because the higher ranks of the institution. In fact,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.880
Mike Pompeo said something like this to me the other day. He was the director of the CIA. He said

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.760
when I was there, I did not do a good job of cleaning up that agency. And he said the entire

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:20.160
upper bureaucracy of that agency are people who do not believe in the institutions of democracy.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.520
That's what he said to me. I don't know if that's true, but I know that's significant. He's a smart

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:34.400
person and he ran the agency and he was the secretary of state. But it's no mystery how that

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:41.120
happened. We know the history. The CIA was originally, first of all, there was great

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:48.320
reluctance in 1947. For the first time, we had a secret spy agency in this country during World

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:55.920
War II called the OSS. That was disbanded after the war because Congress said having a secret spy

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:02.640
agency is incompatible with a democracy. Secret spy agencies are things like the KGB,

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.960
Stasi in East Germany, SAVAK in Iran, and PEEP in Chile, whatever, all over the world.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.240
They all have to do with totalitarian governments. They're not something that you can have.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:27.120
It's antithetical to democracy to have that. But in 1947, we created it. Truman signed it in,

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:35.360
but it was initially an espionage agency, which means information gathering, which is important.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.240
It's to gather and consolidate information from many, many different sources from all over the

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:50.240
world and then put those in reports. The White House, the president, can make good decisions

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:58.800
based upon valid information, evidence-based decision-making. But Alan Dulles, who was

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:07.040
essentially the first head of the agency, made a series of legislative machinations and political

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.680
machinations that gave additional powers to the agency and opened up what they called

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.720
then the Plans Division, which is the Plans Division is the dirty tricks. It's the black

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:26.240
ops fixing elections, murdering what they call executive action, which means killing

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:34.400
foreign leaders and making small wars and bribing and blackmailing

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:41.760
people, stealing elections, that kind of thing. At that time, we were in the middle of the Cold War

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.160
and Truman and Eisenhower did not want to go to war. They didn't want to commit troops.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:56.640
It seemed to them that this was a way of fighting the Cold War secretly without

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:08.320
and doing it at minimal cost by changing events invisibly. It was seductive to them.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.920
Congress, when they first voted it in place, both political parties said,

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.560
if we create this thing, it could turn into a monster and it could undermine our values. Today,

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.280
it's so powerful and nobody knows what its budget is. Plus, it has its own investment fund

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.600
in Kutel, which has invested, made, I think, 2,000 investments in Silicon Valley.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:41.520
It has ownership of a lot of these tech companies and a lot of the CEOs of those tech companies

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.640
have signed state secrecy agreements with the CIA, which if they even

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.400
reveal that they have signed that, they can go to jail for 20 years and have their assets removed,

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:58.400
etc. The influence that the agency has, the capacity to influence events at every level

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:10.800
in our country is really frightening. For most of its life, the CIA was banned from propagandizing

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:17.440
Americans, but we learned that they were doing it anyway. In 1973, during the Church Committee

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:25.440
hearings, we learned that the CIA had a program called Operation Mockingbird where they had at

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:31.840
least 400 leading members of the United States press corps, the New York Times, the Washington

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:41.360
Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc., who were secretly working for the agency and steering news coverage

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:52.160
to support CIA priorities. They agreed at that time to disband Operation Mockingbird in 1973,

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.720
but there's indications they didn't do that. They still, the CIA today is the biggest funder of

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:09.360
journalism around the world. The biggest funder is through USAID. The United States funds journalism

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.240
in almost every country in the world. It owns newspapers, it has thousands and thousands of

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.960
journalists on its payroll. They're not supposed to be doing that in the United States, but

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:28.560
in 2016, President Obama changed the law to make it legal now for the

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.200
CIA to propagandize Americans. I think we can't look at the Ukraine War and how that was,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:45.520
how the narrative has been formed in the minds of Americans and say that the CIA had nothing to do

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:50.560
with that. What is the mechanism by which the CIA influences the narrative? Do you think it's

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.120
through the press? Indirectly through the press or directly by funding the press?

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:03.120
Directly through. I mean, there are certain press organs that have been linked to the agency,

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:09.280
that the people who run those organs, things like the Daily Beast, now Rolling Stone, Editor of

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:15.600
Note, Rolling Stone, Noah Schlackman, has deep relationships with the intelligence community,

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:22.480
Salon, Daily Coast. But I wonder why they would do it. From my perspective,

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.000
it just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity where

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.320
your opinion cannot be influenced or bought. I agree with you, but I actually think that the

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:44.400
entire field of journalism has really ashamed itself in recent years because it's become the

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:51.040
principal newspapers in this country and the television station, the legacy media have

01:22:51.040 --> 01:23:00.400
abandoned their tradition, which was when I was a kid, my house was filled with the greatest

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.280
journalists alive at that time, people like Ben Bradley, like Anthony Lewis, Mary McGrory,

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:16.960
Ed Hamill, Jack Newfield, Jimmy Breslin, and many, many others. After my father died,

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:24.720
they started the RFK journalism awards to recognize integrity and courage, journalistic integrity and

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:34.480
courage. For that generation of journalism, they believed that the function of a journalist

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.960
was to maintain this posture of fear, skepticism toward any aggregation of power, including

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:47.360
government authority, that people in authority lie and that they always have to be questioned,

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.680
and that their job was to speak truth to power and to be guardians of the First Amendment right to

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:01.120
free expression. But if you look what happened during the pandemic, it was the inverse of that

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:08.560
kind of journalism where the major press organs in this country were, instead of speaking truth

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:15.520
to power, they were doing the opposite. They were broadcasting propaganda. They became propaganda

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:21.360
organs for the government agencies. They were actually censoring the speech of anybody who

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:30.320
dissents of the powerless. In fact, it was an organized conspiracy. The name of it was the

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:35.360
Trusted News Initiative, and some of the major press organs in our country signed onto it,

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:43.440
and they agreed not to print stories or facts that departed from government orthodoxy. The

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:53.920
Washington Post was the signature, the UPI, the AP, and then the four social media groups, Microsoft,

01:24:53.920 --> 01:25:00.640
Twitter, Facebook, and Google all signed onto the Trusted News Initiative. It was started by the

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:08.400
BBC, organized by them, and the purpose of it was to make sure nobody could print anything that

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.800
departed from government orthodoxy. The way it worked is the UPI, the AP, which are the news

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:22.160
services that provide most of the news around the country, and the Washington Post would decide what

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:29.040
news was permissible to print. A lot of it was about COVID, but also Hunter Biden's laptops.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.840
It was impermissible to suggest that those were real or that they had stuff on there that was

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:47.120
compromising. By the way, what I'm telling you is all well-documented, and I'm litigating on it

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.360
right now, so I'm part of a lawsuit against the DNI. I know a lot about what happened, and I have

01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:01.040
all this documented. People can go to our website. There's a letter on my Substack now to Michael

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:08.160
Scheer of the Washington Post that outlines all this and gives all my sources, because Michael

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:14.000
Scheer accused me of being a conspiracy theorist when he was actually part of a true conspiracy

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:22.560
to suppress anybody who was departing from government orthodoxies by either censoring

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:29.200
them completely or labeling them conspiracy theorists. You can understand the intention

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.120
and the action, the difference between this we talked about. You can understand the intention

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.520
of such a thing being good in a time of a catastrophe, in a time of a pandemic. There's

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:48.080
a lot of risk to saying untrue things, but that's a slippery slope that leads into a place

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.000
where the journalistic integrity that we talked about is completely sacrificed,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
and then you can deviate from truth. If you read their internal memorandum,

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.080
including the statements of the leader of the trusted news initiative, I think her name is

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:10.960
Jennifer Cecil. You can go on our website and see her and say, amen. She says,

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:19.440
the purpose of this is that when people look at us, they think we're competitors,

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.000
but we're not. The real competitors are coming from all these alternative news sources now,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.680
all over the network. They're hurting public trust in us, and they're hurting our economic

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.240
model. They have to be choked off and crushed. The way that we're going to do that is to

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:44.000
make an agreement with the social media sites that if we label their misinformation, the social

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.560
media sites will deplatform it, or they will throttle it, or they will shadow ban it,

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:56.640
which destroys the economic model of those alternative competitive sources of information.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:04.720
So that's true, but the point you make is an important point. The journalists themselves,

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.920
who probably didn't know about the TNI agreement, certainly I'm sure they didn't,

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:17.200
they believe that they're doing the right thing by suppressing information that may challenge

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:23.440
government proclamations on COVID. But there's a danger to that, and the danger is that

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.960
once you appoint yourself an arbiter of what's true and what's not true,

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:37.360
then there's really no end to the power that you have now assumed for yourself, because

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.400
your job is no longer to inform the public. Your job now is to manipulate the public.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:51.520
And if you end up manipulating the public in collusion with powerful entities, then you become

01:28:51.520 --> 01:29:00.880
the instrument of authoritarian rule rather than the opponent of it, and it becomes the inverse of

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:08.480
journalism and a democracy. You're running for president as a Democrat. What to you are the

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:15.920
strongest values that represent the left-wing politics of this country?

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:24.320
I would say protection of the environment and the commons, the air, the water, wildlife, fisheries,

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:31.920
public lands, those assets that cannot be reduced to private property ownership, the landscapes,

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:38.320
our purple mountain majesty, the protection of the most vulnerable people in our society,

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:48.240
people which would include children and minorities, the restoration of the middle class,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.720
and protection of labor, dignity, and decent pay for labor,

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:06.400
bodily autonomy, a woman's right to choose or an individual's right to endure

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:13.920
unwanted medical procedures, peace. The Democrats have always been anti-war.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:23.120
The refusal to use fear as a governing tool. FDR said that the only thing we have to fear

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:29.520
is fear itself, because he recognized that tyrants and dictators could use fear to disable

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:38.880
critical thinking and overwhelm the desire for personal liberty.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.800
The freedom of government from untowardly influence by corrupt corporate power.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.320
This is the end of this corrupt merger of the state and corporate power that is now,

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:04.080
I think, dominating our democracy. That's what Eisenhower warned about when he warned against

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.560
the emergence of the military industrial complex. Then I prefer to talk about the positive revision

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:19.120
of what we should be doing in our country and globally, which is I see that the corporations

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:27.840
are commoditizing us, are poisoning our children, are strip mining the wealth from our middle class,

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:36.080
and treating America as if it were business liquidation, converting assets to cash as

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:46.080
quickly as possible, and creating or exacerbating this huge disparity in wealth in our country,

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.120
which is eliminating the middle class and creating a Latin American-style feudal model.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:59.520
There's these huge aggregations of wealth above and widespread poverty below.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:07.120
That's a configuration that is too unstable to support democracy sustainably. We're supposed

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:14.720
to be modeling democracy, but we're losing it. I think we ought to have a foreign policy

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.240
that restores our moral authority around the world, restores America

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:26.240
as the embodiment of moral authority, in which it was when my uncle was president

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:35.520
and as a purveyor of peace rather than a war-like nation. My uncle said he didn't want

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.200
people in Africa and Latin America and Asia to think of, when they think of America,

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.640
to picture a man with a gun and a bayonet. He wanted them to think of a Peace Corps volunteer.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:56.400
He refused to send combat soldiers abroad. He never sent a single soldier to his death abroad

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:06.960
into combat. He sent 16,000. He resisted in Berlin in 1962. He resisted in Laos

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:17.840
in 1961. He resisted in Vietnam. In Vietnam, they wanted him to put 250,000 troops. He only

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:27.680
put 16,000 advisers, which was fewer troops. He sent to get James Meredith into Ole Miss

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:34.720
in Oxford, Mississippi, one black man. He sent 16,000, and a month before he died,

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:42.640
he ordered them all home. I think it was October 2, 1963. He heard that a Green Beret had died,

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:51.200
and he asked his aide for a list of combat fatalities. The aide came back, and there were

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.960
75 men had died in Vietnam at that point. He said, that's too many. We're going to have no

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:04.240
more. He ordered. He signed a national security order, 263, and ordered all of those men,

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:12.000
all Americans, home from Vietnam by 1965, with the first thousand coming home by December 63.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.880
In November, he, of course, just before that evacuation began, he was killed. A week later,

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.640
President Johnson remanded that order. Then a year after that, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution,

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.920
we sent 250,000, which is what they wanted my uncle to do, which he refused.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:41.120
Then it became an American war. Then Nixon topped it off at 560,000. 56,000 Americans never came

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:48.160
home, including my cousin George Skakel, who died at the Tet Offensive. We killed a million

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:54.080
Vietnamese, and we got nothing for it. America should be the symbol of peace.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:01.520
And today, my uncle really focused on putting America on the side of the poor

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:12.080
instead of our tradition of fortifying oligarchies that were anti-communism. That was our major

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:16.160
criteria. If you said you were against communism, of course, the people were. We were the rich

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.480
people. Our aid was going to the rich people in those countries, and they were going to the

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.120
military hunt us. Our weapons were going to the hunt us to fight against the poor.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.160
My uncle said, no, America should be on the side of the poor. So he launched the Alliance for

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:39.440
Progress and USAID, which were intended to bring aid to the poorest people in those and build

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:47.920
middle classes and take ourselves away. In fact, his most, his favorite trip, his two favorite

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:54.640
trips while he was president, his most favorite trip was to Ireland, which is an incredible

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.240
emotional homecoming for all of the people of Ireland. His second favorite trip was when he

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.320
went to Colombia. He went to Latin America, but Colombia was his favorite country.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.000
And I think there were two million people came into Bogota to see him, this

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.000
vast crowd, and they were just delirious cheering for him. And the president of Colombia,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.480
Lleras Carmargo, said to him, do you know why they love you? And my uncle said, why? And he said,

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.520
because they think you've put America on the side of the poor against the oligarchs.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:40.800
And when my uncle, after he died today, there are more avenues and boulevards and hospitals

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:48.080
and schools and statues named after and commemorating in parks, commemorating John

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:54.320
Kennedy in Africa and Latin America than any other president in the United States, and probably more

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.920
than all the other presidents combined. And it's because he put America on the side of the poor,

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.640
and that's what we ought to be doing. We ought to be projecting economic power abroad.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:14.560
The Chinese have essentially stolen his playbook. And we've spent $8 trillion on the Iraq war and

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:22.000
its aftermath, the wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan. And what do we get for that?

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:29.760
We got nothing for that money, $8 trillion. We killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:38.720
Iraq today is much worse off than it was when Saddam was there. It's an incoherent violent war

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:45.200
between Shia and Sunni death squads. We pushed Iraq into the embrace of Iran, which has now become

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.240
essentially a proxy for Iran, which is exactly the outcome that we were trying to prevent for

01:37:50.240 --> 01:38:02.880
the past 20 or 30 years. We created ISIS. We sent 2 million refugees into Europe, destabilizing all

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.280
of the nations in Europe for generations. We're now seeing these riots in France,

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.600
and that's a direct result from the Syrian war that we created and our creation of ISIS.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:26.880
Brexit is another result of that. For $8 trillion, we wrecked the world. During that same period,

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:35.040
we spent $8.1 trillion bombing bridges, ports, schools, hospitals. The Chinese spent $8.1

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:44.480
trillion building schools, ports, hospitals, bridges, and universities. And now the Chinese

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.120
are outcompeting us everywhere in the world. Everybody wants to deal with the Chinese,

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:56.320
because they come in, they build nice things for you, and there's no strings attached,

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:03.600
and they're pleasant to deal with. As a result of that, Brazil is switching the Chinese currency.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:11.280
Argentina is switching. Saudi Arabia, our greatest partner. We put trillions of dollars into

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:18.480
protecting our oil pipelines there, and now they're saying we don't care what the United

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:27.520
States thinks. That's what my mom and Ben Salam said. He said he dropped oil production

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:36.880
in Saudi Arabia in the middle of a U.S. inflation spiral. They've never done that to us before,

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:45.040
aggravate the inflation spiral. Then they signed a unilateral peace deal with Iran,

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.960
which has been the enemy that we've been telling them to be a bulwark against for 20 years.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.480
Two weeks after that, he said, we don't care what the United States thinks anymore. That's what we

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.800
got for spending all those trillions of dollars there. We got short-term friends, and the United

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:08.240
States policy abroad, and we have not made ourselves safer. We've made Americans,

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:13.280
we've put Americans in more jeopardy all over the world. You have to wait in lines to get

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:23.920
through the airport. The security state is now costing us $1.3 trillion, and America is

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:31.520
unsafer and poorer than it's ever been. We should be doing what President Kennedy

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.120
said we ought to do and what China, the policy that China has now adopted.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.840
That's a really eloquent and clear and powerful description of the way you see U.S. should be

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.480
doing geopolitics and the way you see U.S. should be taking care of the poor in this country.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:56.160
Let me ask you a question from Jordan Peterson that he asked when I told him that I'm speaking

01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.440
with you. Given everything you've said, when does the left go too far?

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:09.680
I suppose he's referring to cultural issues, identity politics.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.760
Jordan was trying to get me to badmouth the left the whole time I was in. I really enjoyed my talk

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.920
with him, but he seemed to have that agenda where he wanted me to say bad things about the left.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:31.200
You know, that's not what my campaign is about. I want to do the opposite.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:40.320
I'm not going to badmouth the left. I was on a show this week with David Remnick from The New

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.480
Yorker, and he tried to get me to badmouth Donald Trump and Alex Jones and a lot of other people,

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.480
and baiting me to do it. Of course, there's a lot of bad things I could say about all those people,

01:41:52.480 --> 01:42:01.600
but I'm trying to find values that hold us together and we can share in common rather

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.600
than to focus constantly on these disputes and these issues that drive us apart.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.280
So me sitting here badmouthing the left or badmouthing the right is not going to advance the

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:20.320
ball. I really want to figure out ways that what do these groups hold in common that we can all

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.040
have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.240
Well, that's music to my ears, but in that spirit, let me ask you a difficult question.

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.440
You wrote a book harshly criticizing Anthony Fauci. Let me ask you to steel man the case

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.960
for the people who support him. What is the biggest positive thing you think Anthony Fauci did

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.920
for the world? What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:58.000
I don't want to sit here and speak uncharitably by saying the guy didn't do anything, but I

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:07.680
can't think of anything. If you tell me something that you think he did, maybe there was a drug that

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.360
got licensed while he was in NIH that benefited people, that's certainly possible. He was there

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:24.080
for 50 years. In terms of his principal programs, of the AIDS programs and his COVID programs,

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.520
and I think that the harm that he did vastly outweigh the benefits.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.680
Do you think he believes he's doing good for the world?

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.840
I don't know what he believes. In fact, in that book, which is, I think, 250,000 words,

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.800
I never try to look inside of his head. I deal with facts. I deal with science.

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:50.160
Every factual assertion in that book is cited and sourced to government databases or peer

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.480
reviewed publications. I try not to speculate about things that I don't know about or I can't

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:05.280
prove. I cannot tell you what his motivations were. I mean, all of us, he's done a lot of things that

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:11.920
that I think are really very, very bad things for humanity and very deceptive.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.720
We all have this capacity for self-deception. As I said at the beginning of this podcast,

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.480
we judge ourselves on our intentions rather than our actions, and we all

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.880
have an almost infinite capacity to convince ourselves that what we're doing is right.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:38.800
And, you know, not everybody kind of lives an examined life and is examining their motivations

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.680
in the way that the world might experience their professions of goodness.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:50.000
Let me ask about the difficulty of the job he had. Do you think it's possible to do that kind of job

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.640
well? Or is it also a fundamental flaw of the job of being the centralized figure that's supposed to

01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:05.760
know? No, I think he was a genuinely bad human being and that there were many, many good

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:12.800
people in that department over the years. Bernice Eddy is a really good example,

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:18.560
John Anthony Morris, many people whose careers he destroyed because they were trying to tell the

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:25.440
truth. One after the other, the greatest scientists in the history of NIH were run out of that

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:34.480
organization, out of that agency. But, you know, people listening to this, you know, probably,

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:41.840
you know, in hearing me say that will think that I'm bitter or that I'm doctrinaire about him,

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:48.240
but, you know, you should really go and read my book. And it's hard to summarize a, you know,

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:54.640
I tried to be really methodical to not call names, to just say what happened.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:01.280
You are the bigger picture of this is you're an outspoken critic of pharmaceutical companies,

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.480
Big Pharma. What is the biggest problem with Big Pharma and how can it be fixed?

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:15.120
The problem could be fixed through regulation, you know, the problems, but the pharmaceutical industry

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:26.000
is, I mean, I don't want to say because this is going to seem extreme that a criminal enterprise,

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.160
but if you look at the history, that is an applicable

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.880
characterization. For example, the four biggest vaccine makers,

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:46.160
Sanofi, Merck, Pfizer, and Glaxo, four companies that make all of the 72 vaccines that are now

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:54.240
effectively mandated for American children. Collectively, those companies have paid $35

01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:03.600
billion in criminal penalties and damages in the last decade. And I think since 2000, about $79

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:10.560
billion. So these are the most corrupt companies in the world. And the problem is that they're

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:18.640
serial felons. They, you know, they do this again and again and again. So they did, you know,

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:25.120
Merck did Vioxx, which Vioxx, they, you know, they killed people by falsifying science.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.320
And they did it. They lied to the public. They said this is a headache medicine and an arthritis

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.000
painkiller. But they didn't tell people that it also gave you heart attacks. And they knew,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.400
you know, we've found when we sued them, the, you know, the memos from their bean counters saying

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.520
we're going to kill this many people, but we're still going to make money. So they make those

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.200
calculations and those calculations are made very, very regularly. And then, you know, when they,

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:02.160
when they get caught, they pay a penalty. And I think they paid about $7 billion

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.560
for Vioxx. But then they went right back that same year that they paid that penalty.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.040
They went back into the same thing again with Gardasil and with a whole lot of other drugs. So

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:20.160
the way that the system is set up, the way that it's sold to doctors, the way that

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:26.080
that nobody ever goes to jail. So there's really no penalty that

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.920
it all becomes part of the cost of doing business. And, you know, you can see other businesses that

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.160
if they're not, if they don't, if there's no penalty, if there's no real, I mean, look,

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.120
these are the companies that gave us the opioid epidemic, right? So they knew what was going to

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.200
happen. And we, you know, you go and see, there's a documentary, I forget what the name of it is, but

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:56.560
it shows exactly what happened. And, you know, they corrupted FDA. They knew that this,

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:03.200
that oxycodone was addictive. They got FDA to tell doctors that it wasn't addictive.

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:10.720
They pressured FDA to lie and they got their way. And they've so far, they led this year,

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.760
you know, those, they got a whole generation addicted to oxycodone. And now, you know,

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.400
when they got caught and they made it, we made it harder to get oxycodone. And now all those

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:30.400
addicted kids are going to fend no one dying. And this year it killed 106,000. That's twice as many

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:36.560
people who were killed during the 20 year Vietnam War, but in one year, twice as many American kids.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.040
And they knew what was going to happen. And they did it to make money. So I don't know what you

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.320
call that other than saying that's a criminal enterprise. Who is it possible to have

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:55.120
within a capitalist system to produce medication, to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not

01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:02.080
corrupt? Of course it is. How? Through a, you know, through a solid regulatory regimen,

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:10.480
where drugs are actually tested. I mean, the problem is not the capitalist system.

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.520
The capitalist system, I, you know, I have great admiration for the love that the capitalist system

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:22.320
is the greatest economic engine ever devised. But it has to be harnessed to a social purpose.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:30.240
Otherwise it's going to, it leads us, you know, down the trail of oligarchy,

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.880
environmental destruction, and, you know, and commoditizing, poisoning, and killing human

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:47.440
beings. That's what it will do in the end. You need a regulatory structure that is, that is not

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.320
corrupted by entanglements, financial entanglements with the industry.

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.680
And we've set this up the way that this is, that the system is set up today,

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:09.840
has created this system of regulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget comes from

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:16.080
pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, you know, their money is coming,

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.600
their salaries are coming from pharma, half their salaries. So they're, you know, they know who their

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:27.280
bosses are. And that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved as

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.640
quickly as possible. It's called fast track approval. And they pay 50%, 50% of FDA's budget

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:37.840
goes about 45%. It actually goes to fast track approval.

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.920
Do you think money can buy integrity?

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:43.200
Oh, yeah, of course it can in the right, right. Yeah. I mean, there's,

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.240
that's not something that is, that is controversial. Of course it will.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.760
So, and then-

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.800
Slightly controversial to me. I would like to think that scientists that work at FDA-

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:56.880
Well, it may not be able to buy your integrity. I'm talking about population wide. I'm not talking

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:04.480
about the individual. But I'd like to believe that scientists, I mean, in general, a career

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:09.520
of a scientist is not a very high paying job. I'd like to believe that people that go into

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:16.400
science that work at FDA, that work at NIH are doing it for a reason that's not even correlated

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:21.840
with money really. Yeah. And I think probably that's why they go in there, but scientists are

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:29.840
corruptible. And, you know, the way that I can tell you that is that I've brought over 500 losses

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.080
and almost all of them involve scientific controversies. And there are scientists on

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:41.520
both sides in everyone. When we sued Monsanto, there was, on the Monsanto side, there was a Yale

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.000
scientist, a Stanford scientist, and a Harvard scientist. And on our side, there was a Yale,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.320
Stanford, and Harvard scientist. And they were saying exactly the opposite things.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.000
In fact, there's a word for those kind of scientists who take money for their opinion,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.040
and the word is byostitutes. And they are very, very common. And, you know, and I've been dealing

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:10.240
with them my whole career. You know, I think it was Upton Sinclair who said that it's very difficult

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:17.760
to persuade a man of a fact if that fact will diminish his salary. And I think that's true for

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:23.680
all of us if they, you know, we find a way of reconciling ourselves to things that are,

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:32.320
to truths that actually, and worldviews, that actually benefit our salaries.

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:42.160
Now, NIH, NIH has probably the worst system, which is that scientists who work for NIH, NIH itself,

01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:47.760
which used to be the premier gold standard scientific agency in the world. Everybody looked

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:54.880
at NIH that today it's just an incubator for pharmaceutical drugs. And, you know, that is

01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:04.240
that gravity of economic self-interest. Because if you're, if NIH itself collects royalties,

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.120
they have margin rights for the patents on all the drugs that they work on. So with the Moderna

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:15.440
vaccine, which they promoted incessantly and aggressively, NIH owned 50% of that vaccine

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.960
and is making billions and billions of dollars on it. And there are four, at least four scientists

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:28.080
that we know of and probably at least six at NIH who themselves have margin rights for those patents.

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:34.000
So if you are a scientist who work at NIH, you work on a new drug, you then get margin rights

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.840
and you're entitled to royalties of $150,000 a year forever from that forever. Your children,

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.400
your children's children, as long as that product's on the market, you can collect royalties.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.520
So you have, you know, the Moderna vaccine is paying for the top people at NIH. You know,

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:57.040
some of the top regulators, it's paying for their boats, it's paying for their mortgages,

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:07.520
it's paying for their children's education. And you know, you have to expect that in those

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:15.520
kinds of situations, the regulatory function would be subsumed beneath the mercantile ambitions of

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:22.080
the agency itself and the individuals who stand to profit enormously from getting a drug to market.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:27.680
Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer, to find problems with those drugs before

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.160
they get to market. But if you know that drug is going to pay for your mortgage,

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:38.160
you may overlook a little problem. And we're even a very big one. And that's the problem.

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.800
You've talked about that the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.720
And you've said that you're not anti-vaccine, you're pro-safe vaccine.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.840
It's a difficult question. Can you name any vaccines that you think are good?

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.480
I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:07.680
averting more problems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is, you know, safe and

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:13.360
effective. Those are big words. What about the polio? Can we talk about the polio?

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:26.400
Here's the problem. The polio vaccine contained a virus called Semi-virus SV40. It's one of the

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:32.240
most carcinogenic materials that is known to man. In fact, it's used now by scientists around the

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:39.360
world to induce tumors in rats and guinea pigs in labs. But it was in that vaccine, 98 million

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.680
people who got that vaccine in my generation got it. And now you've had this explosion

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:48.960
of soft tissue cancers in our generation that kill many, many, many, many, many more people

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:55.120
than polio ever did. So if you say to me that the polio vaccine was effective against polio,

01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:01.920
I'm going to say yes. If you say to me, did it kill more people? Did it cause more deaths than

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.120
it had ever? I would say, I don't know, because we don't have the data on that.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:11.440
But let's talk, well, you know, we kind of have to narrow in on is it effective against the thing

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.480
it's supposed to fight? Oh, well, a lot of them are. Let me give you an example. The most popular

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:23.200
vaccine in the world is the DTP vaccine, diphtheria tetanus and pertussis. It was introduced in this

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:31.120
country around 1980. That vaccine caused so many injuries that Elias, which was the manufacturer,

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.440
said to the Reagan administration, we are now paying $20 in downstream liabilities for every

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.080
dollar that we're making in profits. And we are getting out of the business unless you give us

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:49.520
permanent immunity from liability. So the vaccine companies then were given, and by the way,

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.640
Reagan said at that time, why don't you just make the vaccine safe?

01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.640
And why is that? Because vaccines are inherently unsafe. They said unavoidably unsafe. You cannot

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:07.600
make them safe. And so when Reagan wrote the bill and passed it, the bill says in its preamble is

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:13.440
because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe. And the Bruceowitz case, which was a Supreme Court case

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:19.440
that upheld that bill, uses that same language, vaccines cannot be made safe. They're unavoidably

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:24.480
unsafe. So this is what the law says. Now, I just want to finish this story because this

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:31.760
illustrates very well your question. The DTP vaccine was discontinued in this country,

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:38.640
and it was discontinued in Europe because so many kids were being injured by it. However,

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:44.240
the WHO and Bill Gates gives it to 161 million African children every year.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:52.560
And Bill Gates went to the Danish government and asked them to support this program,

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:58.240
saying we've saved 30 million kids from dying from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:04.800
The Danish government said, can you show us the data? And he couldn't. So the Danish government

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:12.800
paid for a big study with Novo Nordisk, which is a Scandinavian vaccine company in West Africa.

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.360
And they went to West Africa and they looked at the DTP vaccine for 30 years of data.

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:23.440
And they hired, they retained the best vaccine scientists in the world, these kind of deities

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:27.680
of African vaccine program, Peter AAB, Sigrid Morgensen, and a bunch of others.

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:34.800
And they looked at 30 years of data for the DTP vaccine and they came back and they were shocked

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.760
by what they found. They found that the vaccine was preventing kids from getting diphtheria,

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:44.800
tetanus, and pertussis. But the girls who got that vaccine were 10 times more likely to die

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:51.040
over the next six months than children who didn't. Why is that? And they weren't dying

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:55.360
from anything anybody ever associated with the vaccine. They were dying of anemia,

01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:02.720
bilharzia, malaria, sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease, pneumonia.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:13.200
And it turns out this is what the researchers found, who were all pro-vaccine, by the way,

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:20.480
they said that this vaccine is killing more children than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:24.640
prior to the introduction of the vaccine. And for 30 years, nobody ever noticed it.

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:30.080
The vaccine was providing protection against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the children's

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:35.520
immune systems and they could not defend themselves against random infections that were harmless to

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:41.520
most children. But isn't it nearly impossible to prove that link? You can't prove the link. All you

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:47.760
can do is, for any particular interest you get, illness or death, you can't prove the link.

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:53.840
But you can show statistically that if you get that vaccine, you're more likely to die

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.400
over the next six months than if you don't. And those studies, unfortunately, are not done

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:04.640
for any other vaccines. So for every other medicine, in order to get approval from the FDA,

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:10.400
you have to do a placebo-controlled trial prior to licensure, where you look at health outcomes

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:19.200
among an exposed group, a group that gets it, and compare those to a similarly situated group

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:28.240
that gets a placebo. The only medical intervention that does not undergo placebo-controlled trials

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:34.240
prior to licensure of vaccines, not one of the 72 vaccines that are now mandated for our children,

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.800
have ever undergone a placebo-controlled trial prior to licensure.

02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.400
So I should say that on that point, I've heard from a bunch of folks that disagree with you,

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:50.640
including Polio. I mean, testing is a really important point. Before licensure, placebo

02:01:50.640 --> 02:02:00.000
control, randomized trials, Polio received just that against the saline placebo control.

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:07.120
So it seems unclear to me. I'm confused why you say that they don't go through that process. It

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:15.920
seems like a lot of them do. Here's the thing. I was saying that for many years because we

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:24.160
couldn't find any. And then in 2016, in March, I met President Trump, ordered Dr. Fauci to meet

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:31.040
with me. Dr. Fauci and Francis Collins, and I said to them during that meeting,

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.440
you have been saying that I'm not telling the truth when I said not one of these has undergone a

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:44.400
prior pre-licensure placebo control. And the Polio may have had one post-licensing. Most of them

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:52.960
haven't. The Polio may have. I don't know. But our question was prior to licensure, do you ever test

02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:05.520
these for safety? And by the way, I think the Polio vaccine did undergo a saline placebo trial

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:14.320
prior to licensure, but not for safety, only for efficacy. So I'm talking about safety trials now.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:22.880
Fauci told me that he said, I can't find one now. He had a whole tray of files there.

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.480
He said, I can't find one now, but I'll send you one. I said, just for any vaccines. And we won.

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:36.880
For any of the 72 vaccines. He never did. So we sued the HHS. And after a year of stonewalling us,

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:44.080
HHS came back and they gave us a letter saying we have no pre-licensing safety trial for any

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:51.840
of the 72 vaccines. And that letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit against them because

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:58.480
we had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is posted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it.

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:06.960
So if HHS had any study, I assume they would have given it to us and they can't find one.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.480
Well, let me zoom out because a lot of the details matter here. Pre-licensure,

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:21.280
what does placebo control mean? This probably requires a rigorous analysis. And actually,

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:26.720
at this point, it would be nice for me just to give a shout out to other people, much smarter

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:34.640
than me, that people should follow along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Use their mind, learn,

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.240
and think. So one really awesome creator, I really recommend him, is Dr. Dan Wilson.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:46.400
He hosts the Debunk the Funk podcast. Vincent Recaniello, who hosts This Week in Virology,

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.640
brilliant guy, I've had him on the podcast. Somebody you've been battling with is Paul

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:56.640
Offit. Interesting Twitter, interesting books, people should read and understand and read your

02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.400
books as well. And Eric Topol has a good Twitter and good books. And even Peter Hotez, I'll ask

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:13.280
you about him. And people should, because Paul Offit published a substack recently, debunking,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:26.480
I think, my discussion with Joe Rogan. And we have published a debunk of his debunking.

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:34.720
So if you read his stuff, you should read both. You should read. And I would love to debate

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:39.840
any of these guys. So Joe Rogan proposed just such a debate,

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:45.120
which is quite fascinating to see how much attention and how much funding it garnered,

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:50.560
the debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do you think Peter rejected the offer?

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:58.640
I think it's, again, I'm not going to look into his head. But what I will say is if you're a

02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:06.000
scientist and you're making public recommendations based upon what you say is evidence-based science,

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.160
you ought to be able to defend that. You ought to be able to defend it in a public forum,

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:21.040
and you ought to be able to defend it against all comers. If your science is based on,

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:27.520
is rooted in logic and reason, and if you can't use logic and reason to defend your position.

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:35.280
And by the way, I know almost all of the studies. I've written books on them and

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:41.840
we've made a big effort to assemble all the studies on both sides. And so I'm prepared to

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:48.320
talk about those studies and I'm prepared to submit them in advance for each of the points.

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:56.800
And by the way, I've done that with Peter Hotez. I've actually, because I had this kind of informal

02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:05.520
debate with him several years ago with a referee at that time, and we were debating not only by

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:11.120
phone, but by email. And on those emails, every point that he would make, I would cite science.

02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:15.360
And he could never come back with science. He could never come back with publications.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:21.840
He would give publications that had nothing to do with, for example, thimerosal vaccines,

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:28.800
mercury-based vaccines. He sent me one time 16 studies to rebut something I'd said about

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.440
thimerosal and not one of those studies. They were all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:41.920
thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real debate where you're using reason and isolating points

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:50.880
and having a rational discourse. I don't blame him for not debating me because I don't think he has

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:59.200
the science. Are there aspects of all the work you've done on vaccines, all the advocacy you've

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:06.480
done that you found out that you were not correct on, that you were wrong on, that you've changed

02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:15.280
your mind on? Yeah, there are many times over time that I found that I've made mistakes and we correct

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:22.960
those mistakes. I run a big organization and I do a lot of tweets. I'm very careful, for example,

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:29.520
my Instagram. I was taken down for misinformation, but there was no misinformation on my Instagram.

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:34.240
Everything that I cited on Instagram was cited or sourced to a government database or to peer

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:43.840
reviewed science. But for example, The Defender, which was our organization's newsletter, we

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.320
summarize scientific reports all the time. That's one of the services that we provide.

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:54.560
We watch PubMed and we watch the peer reviewed publications and we summarize them when they come

02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:00.720
out. We have made mistakes. When we make mistakes, we are rigorous about acknowledging it,

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:05.680
apologizing for it, and changing it. That's what we do. I think we have one of the most robust

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:13.600
fact checking operations anywhere in journalism today. We actually do real science. Listen,

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:19.520
I've put up on my Twitter account. There are numerous times that I've made mistakes on Twitter

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:27.200
and I apologize for it. People say to me, oh, that's weird. I've never seen anybody apologize

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:34.560
on Twitter, but I think it's really important. Of course, human beings make mistakes. My book is

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:42.000
230,000, 40,000, 50,000 words. There's going to be a mistake in there. What I say at the beginning

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.840
of the book, if you see a mistake in here, please notify me. I give away that people can notify me.

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.120
If somebody points out a mistake, I'm going to change it. I'm not going to dig my feet in

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.720
and say, I'm not going to acknowledge this. Some of the things we've been talking about,

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:07.040
you've been an outspoken contrarian on some very controversial topics. This has garnered

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.840
some fame and recognition in part for being attacked and standing strong against those attacks.

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:21.360
If I may say for being a martyr, do you worry about this drug of martyrdom that might cloud

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:27.040
your judgment? First of all, yeah, I don't consider myself a martyr and I've never considered myself a

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:33.280
victim. I make choices about my life and I'm content with those choices and peaceful with them.

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.640
I'm not trying to be a martyr or a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:41.280
is right because I want to be peaceful inside of myself.

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:54.240
The only guard I have is fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific study

02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.520
that shows that I'm wrong, for example, if you come back and say, look, Bobby,

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:09.600
here's a safety study on polio that was done pre-licensure and used a real saline solution,

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:12.160
I'm going to put that on my Twitter and I'm going to say I was wrong.

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.800
There is one out there, but that's all I can do.

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.520
All right. I have to ask, you are in great shape. Can you go through your diet and exercise routine?

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:34.560
I do intermittent fasting, so I eat between noon. I start at my first meal around noon

02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:45.520
and then I try to stop eating at six or seven. And then I hike every day.

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:47.360
Morning, evening.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:51.040
In the morning, I go to a meeting first thing in the morning,

02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:57.760
12-7 meeting. And then I go hike uphill for a mile and a half up and a mile and a half down

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:04.720
with my dogs and I do my meditations. And then I go to the gym and I go to the gym for 35 minutes.

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:13.440
I do it short time. I've been exercising for 50 years. And what I found is it's sustainable

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:18.880
if I do just a short periods. And I do four different routines at the gym.

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.000
And I never relax at the gym. I go in there and I have a very intense exercise.

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:32.720
I could tell you what my routine is, but I do backs one day, back just one day,

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:41.120
legs and then a miscellaneous. And I do 12. My first set of everything is I try to reach failure

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.000
at 12 reps. And then my fourth set of everything is a strip set.

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:56.640
I take a lot of vitamins. I can't even list them to you here because I couldn't even remember them

02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:05.040
all, but I take a ton of vitamins and nutrients. I'm on an anti-aging protocol from my doctor

02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:16.240
that includes testosterone replacement. But I don't take any steroids. I don't take any

02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:25.440
anabolic steroids or anything like that. And the DRT I use is bio-identical to what my body produced.

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:27.840
What are your thoughts on hormone therapy in general?

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.520
I've talked to a lot of doctors about that stuff because I'm interested in health.

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:40.640
And I've heard really good things about it, but I don't know. I'm definitely not an expert on it.

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.240
About God, you wrote, God talks to human beings through many vectors, wise people, organized

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:54.160
religion, the great books of religions, through art, music, and poetry. But nowhere was such

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:59.600
detail and grace and joy as through creation. When we destroy nature, we diminish our capacity

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.680
to sense the divine. What is your relationship and what is your understanding of God? Who is God?

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:18.240
Well, God is incomprehensible. I guess most philosophers would say we're inside the mind

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:26.480
of God, and so it would be impossible for us to understand actually what God's form is.

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:43.840
When I was raised in a very, very deeply religious setting, we went to

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:52.960
church in the summer, oftentimes twice a day, a morning mass, and we definitely went every Sunday.

02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:01.760
We prayed in the morning, we prayed before and after every meal, we prayed at night,

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:07.520
we sent a rosary, sometimes three rosaries a night. And my father read us the Bible

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:13.120
whenever he was home. He would read us, we'd all get in the bed and he'd read us the Bible story.

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:19.040
The Bible stories. I went to Catholic schools, I went to Jesuit schools, I went to the nuns,

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:26.880
and I went to a Quaker school at one point. I became a drug addict when I was about 15 years

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:32.560
old, about a year after my dad died. I was addicted to drugs for 14 years. During that time,

02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:39.440
when you're an addict, you're living against conscience. I was always trying to get off of

02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.600
drugs, never able to, but I never felt good about what I was doing.

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.400
When you're living against conscience, you kind of push God to the peripheries of your life.

02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:06.160
I'll call me he, it recedes and gets smaller. When I got sober,

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:13.680
I knew that I had a couple of experiences. One is that I had a friend of my brother's,

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:21.280
one of my brothers who died of this disease of addiction, had a good friend who used to take

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:29.680
drugs with us, and he became a Mooney. So he became a follower of Reverend Young Moon.

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:39.120
He had the same kind of compulsion that I had, and yet it was completely removed from him.

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.600
He used to come and hang out with us, but he would not want to take drugs, even if I was

02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:54.080
taking them right in front of him. He was immune to it. He'd become impervious to that impulse.

02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:06.560
And when I first got sober, I knew that I did not want to be the kind of person who was waking up

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:12.640
every day in white-knuckling sobriety and just trying to resist through willpower. By the way,

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:20.000
I had iron willpower as a kid. I gave up candy for Len when I was 12, and I didn't eat it again

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:27.120
until I was in college. I gave up desserts the next year for Lent, and I didn't ever eat

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.240
another dessert until I was in college, and I was trying to bulk up for rugby and for sports.

02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:37.200
So I felt like I could do anything with my willpower, but somehow

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:46.720
this particular thing, the addiction, was completely impervious to it. It was cunning,

02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:52.880
baffling, incomprehensible. I could not understand. I couldn't just say no and then

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:55.200
never do it again like I did with everything else.

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:07.120
So I was living against conscience, and I thought about this guy. Reflecting my own prejudices at

02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:16.000
that time in my life, I said to myself, I didn't want to be like a drug addict who was wanting a

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:21.520
drug all the time and just not being able to do it. I wanted to completely realign

02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:29.120
myself so that I was somebody who got up every day and just didn't want to take drugs,

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:34.720
never thought of them. I kissed the wife and children and went to work and never thought

02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:40.880
about drugs the whole day. I knew that people throughout history had done that. I'd read

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:47.760
the lives of the saints. I knew St. Augustine had a very, very dissolute youth and had this

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.440
spiritual realignment transformation. I knew the same thing had happened to St. Paul at Damascus.

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:59.680
The same thing had happened to St. Francis. St. Francis also had a dissolute and fun loving

02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:06.000
youth and had this deep spiritual realignment. I knew that that had happened to people throughout

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:13.680
history, and I thought that's what I needed, something like that. I had the example of this

02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:19.360
friend of mine, and I used to think about him, and I would think, and this again reflects the

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.680
bias and probably the meanness of myself at that time, but I said I'd rather be dead than be a

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:34.880
Mooney. But I wish I somehow could distill that power that he got without becoming a religious

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:44.800
nuisance. At that time, I picked up a book by Carl Jung called Synchronicity. Jung,

02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:52.080
he was a psychiatrist. He was a contemporary of Freud's. Freud was his mentor, and Freud wanted

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:58.000
him to be his replacement, but Freud was an avowed atheist. Jung was a deeply spiritual man.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.160
He had these very intense and genuine spiritual experiences from when he was a little boy,

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:06.320
from at least three years old, that he remembers. His biography is fascinating about him because he

02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:17.440
remembers him with such detail. He was interesting to me because he was a very

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:21.600
faithful scientist, and I considered myself a science-based person from when I was little,

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:28.800
and yet he had this spiritual dimension to him which infused all of his thinking and really,

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:42.240
I think, branded his form of recovery or of treatment. He had this experience that he

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:48.720
describes in this book. He ran one of the biggest sanitariums in Europe, in Zurich,

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:57.440
and he was sitting up on the third floor of this building, and he's talking to a patient

02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:04.560
who was describing her dream to him. The fulcrum of that dream was a scarab beetle,

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:11.680
which was an insect that is very, very uncommon, if at all, in Northern Europe, but it's a

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:19.360
common figure in the iconography of Egypt and the hieroglyphics on the walls of the pyramids, etc.

02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:27.920
And while he was talking to her, he heard this bing, bing, bing on the window behind him,

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:32.160
and he didn't want to turn around to take his attention off her, but finally he does it.

02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:37.440
In exasperation, he turns around, he throws up the window, and a scarab beetle flies in and

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:42.000
lands in his hand, and he shows it to the woman, and he says, is this what you were thinking of?

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:48.080
Is this what you were dreaming about? And he was struck by that experience, which was similar to

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:54.400
other experiences he's had like that, and that's what synchronicity means. It's an incident,

02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:02.960
a coincidence, you know? If you're talking with somebody about somebody that you haven't thought

02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:09.120
about in 20 years and that person calls on the phone, that's synchronicity. And he believed it

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:15.520
was a way that God intervened in our lives that broke all the rules of nature that he had set up,

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:22.160
the rules of physics, the rules of mathematics, to reach in and sort of tap us on the shoulder

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:30.640
and say, I'm here. And so he tried to reproduce that in a clinical setting, and he would put one

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:34.640
guy in one room and another guy in another room and have them flip cards and guess what the other

02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:40.560
guy had flipped. And he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance, laws of mathematics,

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.920
that he would approve the existence of a supernatural law. And that was the first

02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:51.760
step to proving the existence of a God. He never succeeds in doing it, but he says in the book,

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:56.880
even though I can't prove using empirical and scientific tools the existence of a God,

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.600
I can show through anecdotal evidence having seen thousands of patients come through this

02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:08.320
institution that people who believe in God get better faster and that the recovery is more

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:14.400
enduring than people who don't. And for me, hearing that was more impactful than if he

02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:19.120
had claimed that he had proved the existence of a God because I would not believe that.

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:26.640
But I was already at a mindset where I would have done anything I could to improve my chances of

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:33.600
never having to take drugs again by even 1%. And if believing in God was going to help me,

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:39.920
whether there's a God up there or not, believing in one itself had the power to help me, I was

02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:44.080
going to do that. So then the question is, how do you start believing in something that you can't

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:51.520
see or smell or hear or touch or taste or acquire with your senses? And Jung provides the formula

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:58.000
for that. And he says, act as if you fake it till you make it. And so that's what I started doing.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.840
I just started pretending there was a God watching me all the time and kind of life was a series of

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:08.800
tests and there was a bunch of moral decisions that I had to make every day. And each one,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.680
these were all just little things that I did, but each one now for me at a moral dimension,

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:21.600
like when the alarm goes off, do I lay in bed for an extra 10 minutes with my indolent thoughts or

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:28.400
do I jump right out of bed? Do I make my bad most important decision of the day?

02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:37.440
Do I hang up the towels? When I go into the closet and pull out my blue jeans and a bunch

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:43.440
of those wire hangers fall on the ground, do I shut the door and say I'm too important to do that,

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:49.760
that somebody else's job or not? And so do I put the water in the ice tray before I put it in the

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:56.320
freezer? Do I put the shopping cart back in the place that it's supposed to go in the parking lot

02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:04.640
of the Safeway? And if I make a whole bunch of those choices right, that I maintain myself in

02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:12.000
a posture of surrender, which keeps me open to the power, to my higher power, to my God.

02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:21.360
When I do those things right, so much about addiction is about abuse of power, abuse of

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:30.320
all of us have some power, whether it's good looks or whether it's connections or education or

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:38.720
family or whatever, and there's always a temptation to use those to fulfill self-will.

02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:46.480
And the challenge is how do you use those always to serve instead God's will and the good of our

02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:56.720
community? And that, to me, is kind of the struggle. And when I do that, I feel God's

02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:02.000
power coming through me and that I can do things. I'm much more effective as a human being.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:14.160
That gnawing anxiety that I lived with for so many years and my God, it's gone. And that I can kind

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:23.040
of put down the oars and hoist the sail and the wind takes me and I can see the evidence of it in

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:33.440
my life. And the big temptation for me is that when all these good things start happening in

02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:40.720
my life and the cash and prizes start flowing in, how do I maintain that posture of surrender? How

02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:46.000
do I stay surrendered then when my inclination is to say to God, thanks God, I got it from here

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:54.480
and drive the car off the cliff again. And so, I had a spiritual awakening and my desire for

02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:03.040
drugs and alcohol was lifted miraculously. And to me, it was as much a miracle as if I'd been able

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:09.280
to walk on water because I had tried everything earnestly, sincerely, and honestly for a decade

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:13.840
to try to stop. And I could not do it under my own power. And then all of a sudden,

02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:22.400
it was lifted effortlessly. And so, I saw that evidence, early evidence of God in my life,

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:28.720
and I'm of the power. And I see it now every day of my life.

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.680
So, adding that moral dimension to all of your actions is how you were able to

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:39.600
win that Camus battle against the absurd, the Sisyphus with the bowl.

02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:43.840
It's all the same thing. It's the battle to just to do the right thing.

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:46.480
And now Sisyphus was able to find somehow happiness.

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.160
Well, Bobby, thank you for the stroll through some of the most important moments in

02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:59.120
recent human history and for running for president. And thank you for talking today.

02:27:59.120 --> 02:27:59.840
Thank you, Lex.

02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:05.680
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. To support this podcast,

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.160
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:16.320
John F. Kennedy. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:23.680
answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Instead, let us accept our own responsibility

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:28.160
for the future. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
