00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.640
And if I mess something up, mess it up, like what even is a mistake?

00:10.640 --> 00:15.240
But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what?

00:15.240 --> 00:20.080
I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing if I wasn't constantly standing

00:20.080 --> 00:22.680
on the edge of the cliff like wild.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.840
Why are you standing on the edge of the cliff?

00:24.840 --> 00:30.760
Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities.

00:30.760 --> 00:37.640
The following is a conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld, a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist, and

00:37.640 --> 00:43.000
a true musician who has recorded and performed with many legendary artists including Jeff

00:43.000 --> 00:50.360
Beck, Prince, Eric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger, Jackson Brown, Rod Stewart,

00:50.360 --> 00:54.880
David Gilmour, Pharrell, Hans Zimmer, and many, many more.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.720
This was a fun and fascinating conversation.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.520
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.920
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.600
And now, dear friends, here's Tal Wilkenfeld.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
There's a legendary video of you playing with Jeff Beck.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.920
We're actually watching it in the background now.

01:13.920 --> 01:19.300
So for people who don't know, Jeff is one of the greatest guitarists ever.

01:19.300 --> 01:26.720
So you're playing with him at the 2007 Crossroads Festival and people should definitely watch

01:26.720 --> 01:27.720
that video.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.020
You were killing it on the bass.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.020
Look at that face.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.020
Were you scared?

01:32.020 --> 01:33.020
What was that experience like?

01:33.020 --> 01:34.020
Were you nervous?

01:34.020 --> 01:35.020
You don't look nervous.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.020
Yeah.

01:36.020 --> 01:40.840
Yeah, I wasn't nervous.

01:40.840 --> 01:46.540
I think that you can get an adrenaline rush before a stage, which is natural, but I think

01:46.620 --> 01:51.140
As soon as you bring fear to a bandstand, you're limiting yourself.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.340
You're kind of like wooling yourself off from everyone else.

01:54.340 --> 01:59.100
If you're afraid, what is there to be afraid of?

01:59.100 --> 02:03.420
You must be afraid of making a mistake and therefore you're coming at it as a perfectionist

02:03.420 --> 02:09.580
and you can't come at music that way or it's not going to be as expansive and vulnerable

02:09.580 --> 02:13.060
and true.

02:13.100 --> 02:20.620
I was excited and passionate and having the best time.

02:20.620 --> 02:28.220
And also, you know, the fact that he gave me this solo, the context of this performance

02:28.220 --> 02:33.620
is that this was a guitar festival, it's one of the biggest guitar festivals in the world

02:33.620 --> 02:36.180
because it's Eric Clapton's festival.

02:36.180 --> 02:40.980
And there's like 400 guitarists that are all playing like solos all night.

02:40.980 --> 02:46.340
And we were like towards the end of the night and I could tell like Jeff got like a kick

02:46.340 --> 02:52.500
out of, you know, I'm not going to solo on like one of my most well-known songs, Castle

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
Ben and His Lovers.

02:53.500 --> 02:58.220
Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it, but people know Jeff for that song and his solo on it.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.540
He's like, I'm going to give it to my bass player.

03:00.540 --> 03:07.580
And like, and he did and like he's like bowing and like that, that like he didn't have to

03:07.580 --> 03:08.580
do that.

03:09.180 --> 03:12.700
But you really stepped up there.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.980
It just, it just shows what a generous musician he is.

03:17.980 --> 03:21.620
And that's evident in his playing across the board.

03:21.620 --> 03:25.340
He is a generous, loving, open musician.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.140
He's not there for himself.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.780
He's there for the music.

03:28.780 --> 03:33.260
And he thought, well, this would be the perfect musical thing to do.

03:33.500 --> 03:40.860
And it kind of all started like when I went to audition for him, which was an interesting

03:40.860 --> 03:46.540
experience because I got, I got food poisoning on the plane.

03:46.540 --> 03:53.820
And so like literally when the plane landed, I went straight into an ambulance into a hospital

03:53.820 --> 03:54.820
overnight.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.780
The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door, which was like a three hour drive,

03:58.780 --> 04:01.580
like through windy country roads.

04:02.260 --> 04:05.340
He answered the door and he's like, okay, you're ready to play.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.580
So we went upstairs and started like rattling off the set.

04:08.580 --> 04:15.060
And when it came to this song, cause of it and his lovers, he just said solo and he,

04:15.060 --> 04:16.820
he loved it and kept the solo in it.

04:16.820 --> 04:21.900
So that's kind of how, cause there was no bass solo before I was playing in his band.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.140
So this whole thing was kind of new.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.340
So even with food poisoning, like you, you could step up.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.340
Yeah.

04:28.340 --> 04:30.980
That's just like what instinct.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.820
That's just being able to differentiate from like the body and from like expression music.

04:35.820 --> 04:36.820
All right.

04:36.820 --> 04:37.820
Yeah.

04:37.820 --> 04:38.820
You know, it's interesting.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.420
You said fear walls you off from the other musicians.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.420
And what are you afraid of?

04:43.420 --> 04:45.620
You're afraid of making a mistake.

04:45.620 --> 04:50.860
You know, Beethoven said to play a wrong note is insignificant to play without passion is

04:50.860 --> 04:51.860
inexcusable.

04:51.860 --> 04:52.860
Yeah.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.540
Do you think the old man had a point?

04:55.540 --> 04:56.540
Yeah.

04:56.900 --> 05:08.100
I think styles of music invite varying degrees of, I would say, uncertainty or unsafety in

05:08.100 --> 05:10.820
the way that people might perceive it.

05:10.820 --> 05:15.180
So for instance, like the tour that I was just on, like playing all my brother's songs,

05:15.180 --> 05:20.620
like I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night.

05:20.620 --> 05:26.380
And if I, you know, mess something up, mess it up, like what even is a mistake?

05:26.540 --> 05:30.700
If I do like a clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what?

05:30.700 --> 05:35.780
Like I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing if I wasn't constantly standing

05:35.780 --> 05:38.500
on the edge of the cliff like wild.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.980
And so I don't care about those few little things.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.980
I care about the overall expression.

05:44.980 --> 05:49.740
And then there's other gigs that, you know, for instance, if I got called for like a pop

05:49.820 --> 05:59.020
or a country session or a show, in those environments, they may want you to play safe, like just

05:59.020 --> 06:05.740
play the pot and play it with a great groove and time and great dynamics and don't really

06:05.740 --> 06:09.100
veer away from the pot and stuff.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.260
And I've done plenty of those gigs too.

06:11.260 --> 06:14.860
It's just a different like hat you put on.

06:14.860 --> 06:18.380
What do you get from the veering, from the veering off the beaten path?

06:18.540 --> 06:19.820
You just love it?

06:19.820 --> 06:23.180
Or is that going to make the performance better?

06:24.780 --> 06:27.100
Like why, why, why standing on the edge of the cliff?

06:28.140 --> 06:35.020
Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities and unknown.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.380
You don't know what's coming.

06:36.380 --> 06:39.420
And I love being there in the unknown.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.820
Otherwise, it's just like, well, why are we doing this?

06:44.140 --> 06:50.540
Am I just like a clown on stage, like showing you my skills or what, you know, what I've

06:50.540 --> 06:51.660
studied in my bedroom?

06:51.660 --> 06:59.020
It's like, no, like I want to be like pure expression happening right now and responding

06:59.020 --> 07:01.020
in real time to everything that's happening.

07:01.580 --> 07:06.300
And anytime I'm not doing that, it's like it's a waste of everybody's time.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.660
Have you ever messed it up real bad?

07:09.100 --> 07:09.820
Mess what up?

07:11.340 --> 07:12.540
I mean, you know, comedians bomb.

07:12.540 --> 07:13.740
You're a big fan of comedy.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.220
Yeah.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.500
Have you ever bombed on stage?

07:16.060 --> 07:16.700
Probably.

07:17.900 --> 07:22.300
I think, I think it's all about recovery, you know, and the more times that you fall

07:22.300 --> 07:30.460
off the cliff, the quicker you know how to recover and the varying ways that you can

07:30.460 --> 07:36.940
recover to the point in which it's concealed so much that maybe a listener might not even

07:36.940 --> 07:38.620
know that you're recovering.

07:38.620 --> 07:42.300
And eventually you learn to fly if we take that metaphor all the way off the cliff.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.420
You know, you're like, all right.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.580
I remember one time when I was really young.

07:47.100 --> 07:52.140
Well, not really young, but like when I was 21 or 22.

07:52.140 --> 07:52.860
Yeah, exactly.

07:54.060 --> 08:00.780
But when I was first playing with Jeff Beck and we played at what I consider the best,

08:01.500 --> 08:07.100
the coolest jazz festival, it's Monterey Jazz and like Miles played there, everyone

08:07.100 --> 08:09.580
played there and they have the best speaker system ever.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.500
I was excited for months.

08:12.380 --> 08:17.820
And the drummer Vinnie was like practicing for like eight hours in the bus on the way

08:17.820 --> 08:21.260
there and everyone was like on fire on stage.

08:21.260 --> 08:27.260
And I remember playing a note, just one note that I really didn't like.

08:28.060 --> 08:37.260
And I let it go in the moment on stage, but as soon as I got off stage, I was really sad.

08:37.260 --> 08:40.380
And so I sat like on this road case, everyone was out celebrating.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.740
I like sat on this road case with a sad face, like boo hoo.

08:44.300 --> 08:48.300
And then Claude Knobbs, like the owner of the, you know, the whole festival came out

08:48.300 --> 08:50.700
to me, he's like, doll, what's wrong?

08:51.500 --> 08:56.780
And I'm like, I played a bad note, such a child.

08:57.500 --> 09:02.780
And like he said all this wise stuff that, you know, Miles Davis had imparted to him

09:02.780 --> 09:04.460
and like it fully cheered me up.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.620
He's like, is there anything that would make you feel better?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.940
And I was like, caviar.

09:13.260 --> 09:17.340
The dude came back 10 minutes later with this huge thing.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.780
Oh, wow.

09:18.780 --> 09:19.580
It was a joke.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.740
It was a joke, but he actually brought me caviar.

09:22.380 --> 09:27.900
But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being sad about a performance.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.180
Now I'm just like, okay, whatever.

09:29.180 --> 09:29.900
Like it's done.

09:29.900 --> 09:34.540
Was it a physical slip of like the fingers or was it, did you intend to play that note?

09:35.660 --> 09:36.620
That I can't remember.

09:37.580 --> 09:43.740
I can't remember if it was just a bad choice that sounded like a clanger or why it happened.

09:43.740 --> 09:47.980
It was so long ago, but I don't get depressed about that anymore.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.980
That'd be funny if that was like your biggest and only regret in life is that note haunted

09:51.980 --> 09:53.420
you in your dreams.

09:53.420 --> 09:57.740
And then like, you know, like I'm on my deathbed and just everyone's just bringing me caviar.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.860
Joke went way too far.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.740
You talked about confidence somewhere.

10:03.740 --> 10:04.540
I don't remember where.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.980
So I want to ask you about how much confidence it takes to be up there.

10:07.980 --> 10:13.020
You said something that Anthony Jackson told you as encouragement, a line that I really like

10:13.020 --> 10:16.140
that quote, on your worst day, you're still a bad motherfucker.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.500
That's actually a Steve Gad quote.

10:20.060 --> 10:24.620
And Steve used to tell that to Anthony because Anthony used to get real depressed if he did a

10:24.620 --> 10:27.020
wrong thing or not perfect thing.

10:27.020 --> 10:30.060
And Steve Gad used to say this to Anthony Jackson.

10:30.140 --> 10:35.020
And then Anthony was my first bass mentor or just mentor in general.

10:35.020 --> 10:36.940
People don't know he's a legendary bassist.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.300
He's a legendary bassist.

10:38.300 --> 10:45.260
And I started playing the bass when I was 17 and I moved to New York and I met Anthony

10:45.260 --> 10:48.540
and he started mentoring me a bit in a very not typical way.

10:48.540 --> 10:54.860
Like he would just sit in his car with me for hours and talk music.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.580
You guys just listen to music and analyze it.

10:57.580 --> 10:58.140
Exactly.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.500
And that was the best form of learning, I think.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.100
Just like, well, what do you perceive here?

11:03.660 --> 11:06.860
And well, I heard this and just discussing that.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.780
Jazz usually?

11:08.780 --> 11:11.260
No, all styles of music.

11:12.140 --> 11:17.260
And yeah, he told me that story about on your worst day because, you know, like, yeah,

11:17.260 --> 11:22.300
even then, like when I was like 18, 19, I get sad sometimes about performances.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.420
Like I could have done this.

11:23.500 --> 11:28.140
It's like, I don't do that anymore, thankfully, or I'd be miserable.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.420
So you still, you always kind of feel pretty good.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.780
Yeah, yeah, now I do.

11:34.380 --> 11:39.580
Now it's just, I sense the body feeling fatigued, especially if it's a very long show.

11:39.580 --> 11:44.140
Like the ones I just did with three hour shows and we did, you know, one to three hour sound

11:44.140 --> 11:44.380
checks.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.860
So that's a lot of physical activity every day.

11:46.860 --> 11:53.500
So I just feel the body being tired, like fatigued, the ears are fatigued.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.100
That's about it.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.100
I don't really reflect on the show much.

11:59.100 --> 12:04.940
You're almost like from a third person perspective, feel the body, get tired and just accept it.

12:04.940 --> 12:09.340
Yeah, I don't want to identify with it because then I'm tired, but I'm not tired.

12:09.340 --> 12:09.740
That's very sad.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.980
I'm usually like energized.

12:11.980 --> 12:17.100
It's like with the food poisoning, the mind is still capable of creative genius, even

12:17.100 --> 12:20.060
if the body is gone, something like that.

12:21.820 --> 12:28.060
So no self-critical component to the way you see your performances anymore.

12:30.060 --> 12:37.260
There is critique, but not in the way that it would diminish my sense of self.

12:37.820 --> 12:38.860
It's different.

12:38.860 --> 12:43.340
I can just kind of look at something and be like, okay, well, actually next time I'll

12:43.340 --> 12:44.940
do this choice and this choice.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.580
Maybe, maybe this would serve the song better.

12:48.540 --> 12:55.740
Maybe this would help the groove feel more like this, but it's not like I suck because

12:55.740 --> 12:57.980
I did this and I am a loser.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.500
Do you think that's bad?

12:59.500 --> 13:03.500
Because even when I asked that question, I had a self-critical thought.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.580
Why did you ask that question?

13:05.580 --> 13:06.780
That's the wrong question.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.700
I always have the self-critical engine running.

13:09.740 --> 13:11.020
Is it necessarily a bad thing?

13:11.900 --> 13:14.380
It depends if it's affecting you negatively.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.820
What is negative anyway?

13:15.820 --> 13:23.820
Well, if it brings your frequency down and you feel less joyful inside, unless you don't

13:23.820 --> 13:32.060
feel complete, you feel less than, less worthy of something, then you could call that bad

13:32.060 --> 13:33.980
if you aspire to not feel that way.

13:34.780 --> 13:35.020
Yeah.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.940
I aspire to not feel that way in the big picture, but in the little picture, a little pain is

13:40.940 --> 13:41.580
good.

13:41.580 --> 13:42.140
That's fair.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.820
So confidence.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.980
You seem like, in this performance, you seem confident.

13:48.780 --> 13:52.540
You seem to be truly walking the bad motherfucker way of life.

13:55.180 --> 14:02.060
A word that I prefer over confidence is trust because I think with confidence is almost

14:02.060 --> 14:09.100
like there's a belief assigned to it that I am this thing that you believe in.

14:09.740 --> 14:16.860
Whereas trust is just simply knowing that you can get up there and handle whatever is

14:16.860 --> 14:17.740
going to come your way.

14:18.380 --> 14:25.260
It's more of an open feeling where it's like, yeah, I could do this, sure, but not like

14:25.260 --> 14:26.380
I'm a bad motherfucker.

14:26.940 --> 14:27.500
You know what I mean?

14:28.780 --> 14:29.740
There's a huge difference.

14:29.740 --> 14:35.900
Because I've shared the stage with people who have a lot of confidence and it can be

14:36.460 --> 14:39.020
like a brick wall, just like fear is a brick wall.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.980
So the brick wall is a bad thing.

14:41.980 --> 14:45.100
Like the thing you have with Jeff here on stage is not a brick wall.

14:45.100 --> 14:45.660
There's no wall.

14:45.660 --> 14:46.620
There's chemistry.

14:46.620 --> 14:46.940
Yeah.

14:46.940 --> 14:49.740
How can you explain that chemistry, the two you had?

14:49.740 --> 14:51.100
Trust and lack of fear.

14:51.100 --> 14:51.740
Yeah.

14:51.740 --> 14:58.700
And also I will say that each individual has developed likes and dislikes over their

14:58.700 --> 14:59.660
lifetime.

14:59.660 --> 15:04.940
And that can be like, in this case, we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes.

15:04.940 --> 15:11.500
So in this particular case, obviously our likes and dislikes are very much aligned such

15:11.500 --> 15:15.820
that the things I do to compliment him, he enjoys and vice versa.

15:15.820 --> 15:24.940
But it could be two very trusting, open musicians on stage that don't have walls up, but their

15:24.940 --> 15:27.180
choices are very different.

15:27.180 --> 15:30.940
And one person likes heavy metal and the other person likes classical.

15:30.940 --> 15:33.260
So it's got to be both.

15:33.260 --> 15:36.860
So you guys were good at like, yes, ending each other musically.

15:36.860 --> 15:37.740
Definitely.

15:37.740 --> 15:44.380
Is that where you're most at peace in a meditative way is on stage?

15:46.540 --> 15:49.100
It used to be that it would only be on stage.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.140
It started with that.

15:50.140 --> 15:57.900
That was almost like my way in to flow state and meditation was playing music.

15:57.900 --> 16:05.020
And then back in the day when I kind of crash after shows, I wanted to change that.

16:05.020 --> 16:08.140
I wanted to always feel like I'm in flow state.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.060
Have you succeeded?

16:10.780 --> 16:13.340
I've gotten a lot better.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.860
I'm still obviously on the journey, but yes.

16:16.860 --> 16:17.740
So you meditate.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.780
I think you've said somewhere that you meditate before shows or just in general.

16:21.820 --> 16:22.860
I meditate every day.

16:24.140 --> 16:30.700
When I'm on tour with my band, I ask that we all meditate together for at least 20 minutes.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.500
And I don't dictate which type of meditation.

16:33.500 --> 16:38.700
I don't put on a guided meditation because everyone has their own thing they want to do.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.460
Maybe someone might be praying in their head.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.180
It doesn't matter.

16:41.260 --> 16:47.900
It's just the idea that we all put our phones down and we all are in one room connecting

16:48.540 --> 16:55.020
energetically, spiritually, and just letting our lives go for a second.

16:55.020 --> 16:58.940
And then we walk straight on the stage and it's always really connected.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.420
And there were a couple of gigs where we ran out of time for that.

17:02.220 --> 17:05.980
And I could tell there was a major difference in the performance.

17:07.580 --> 17:10.140
So it both connects you and centers you, all of those things.

17:11.020 --> 17:11.340
Yeah.

17:11.340 --> 17:18.060
But then when I'm home, I love to meditate and I've tried various styles of meditation

17:18.060 --> 17:21.580
and studied various types of things.

17:21.580 --> 17:24.860
So I don't do just one thing.

17:24.860 --> 17:27.980
I kind of customize it depending on where I'm at in my life.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.700
You and the world lost Jeff back a year ago.

17:33.660 --> 17:34.940
You told me you really miss him.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.860
How's the pain of losing Jeff change you?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.420
Maybe deepen your sense of the world.

17:43.580 --> 17:51.740
It's hard to accept that we won't create something musically again in this lifetime.

17:56.060 --> 18:07.340
But in terms of the grief, grief was easier for me because I went through a major grief period in

18:07.340 --> 18:11.020
2016 and 17.

18:12.140 --> 18:21.740
And that was the first time I'd really gone through the process of grief in a non-family

18:22.300 --> 18:26.700
situation, like with friends and mentors and people that I'd created with,

18:26.700 --> 18:27.420
which is different.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.860
It's a different kind of connection.

18:30.460 --> 18:31.980
My grandparents died.

18:31.980 --> 18:39.340
It's like there was nothing left unsaid and I was at peace with what was happening.

18:39.900 --> 18:49.660
With this, when Prince died out of the blue in mid-2016 and then Leonard Cohen died in November,

18:51.900 --> 18:59.580
that just tore me to shreds because Leonard Cohen was not just someone that profoundly

18:59.580 --> 19:06.860
inspired me musically and lyrically, but spiritually we had a very deep connection.

19:08.780 --> 19:13.340
That was the basis of a lot of our conversation was spirituality.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.780
At that time, I felt like a piece of me went missing.

19:21.580 --> 19:29.420
That was a very long process where I just stayed in my place and didn't want to play

19:29.420 --> 19:30.460
a note of music.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.780
I kind of wanted to just get rid of all my stuff.

19:35.820 --> 19:41.100
So I had a friend come over and he's like, you should just,

19:41.100 --> 19:43.020
why don't you come to the comedy store?

19:43.020 --> 19:44.220
I'm like, comedy store?

19:44.220 --> 19:48.140
Like, what am I going to go to some store and buy clown suits?

19:48.140 --> 19:49.020
Like, what are you talking about?

19:49.020 --> 19:50.300
What's a comedy store?

19:50.300 --> 19:54.060
He's like, no, no, no, like the comedy store, the place where like comedians go.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.300
I'm like, okay, well, I've never seen Stand Up.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.260
I've seen Seinfeld on TV.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.580
That's like the extent of my Stand Up experience.

20:02.460 --> 20:07.980
So he took me to the comedy store and every single one of those comedians

20:07.980 --> 20:11.180
embraced me like I was family.

20:11.180 --> 20:12.860
It didn't even take a day.

20:12.860 --> 20:17.100
I was like part of the family and I made like 25 best friends.

20:18.140 --> 20:24.460
And I ended up throwing all my stuff in storage and like finding a little room

20:24.460 --> 20:27.420
to stay in where I rented my gear out.

20:29.100 --> 20:35.260
And my rent paying was me loaning the gear because I didn't want

20:35.260 --> 20:37.660
any responsibilities financially.

20:37.660 --> 20:43.420
I just wanted to be completely free so that I could like just process it

20:43.420 --> 20:48.060
and not feel like I had to commit to anything work-wise or creatively.

20:48.060 --> 20:50.060
I just wanted to unplug.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.260
And so this was like a fun and very different way to unplug

20:53.260 --> 20:56.700
because, you know, previously I may have just gone to a monastery

20:56.700 --> 21:00.060
and spent, you know, weeks at a monastery or months.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.380
But in this case, I was like, you know what?

21:02.380 --> 21:05.020
This is a different kind of experience.

21:05.020 --> 21:08.700
I'm going to just hang out with comedians and stay in this room.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.700
And with no responsibility, really.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.420
Yeah.

21:11.420 --> 21:17.180
Other than to really deeply connect with this grief that I'm experiencing,

21:17.180 --> 21:19.180
I'm not going to negate it.

21:19.900 --> 21:24.300
I'm going to really fully connect to it.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.500
And I did.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.860
And it was tough.

21:26.860 --> 21:31.500
And then, you know, more people in 2017 were leaving.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.700
Greg Almond, Tom Petty.

21:32.700 --> 21:36.780
I mean, it was like, these are people that I worked with all these people

21:36.780 --> 21:41.020
and like had great connections with them and they were all going.

21:41.020 --> 21:44.060
And the world was mourning the loss of these people

21:44.060 --> 21:48.300
because of everything that they'd given to the world.

21:48.540 --> 21:52.380
They'd changed the world's lives, not just mine because I knew them personally.

21:53.260 --> 21:57.660
And so that was also complicated and why, for me,

21:59.340 --> 22:03.580
it was interesting to be grieving the loss of these musicians with comedians.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.220
And I learned a lot.

22:06.220 --> 22:10.860
It changed my life because I just learned to laugh at absolutely anything, everything.

22:11.820 --> 22:15.660
I mean, my grandpa had a really great sense of humor too.

22:15.740 --> 22:19.820
My grandpa's a Holocaust survivor and he could just kind of laugh at anything.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.300
And I already kind of have that in me.

22:22.940 --> 22:27.580
But being around all these comedians just kind of exaggerated that for me

22:27.580 --> 22:30.220
and that really changed things for me, for the better.

22:30.220 --> 22:34.860
So then when Jeff Beck died, it was like, okay, I've got these tools.

22:34.860 --> 22:39.100
I know what this is and I'm going to go through it again

22:39.740 --> 22:43.260
and I'm going to be on tour with Incubus in two days.

22:44.060 --> 22:44.380
Yeah.

22:45.020 --> 22:49.820
And so Mike Durnt from Green Day, he called me up and he said,

22:49.820 --> 22:51.980
hey, I know you're going through a lot.

22:51.980 --> 22:54.860
And I said, yeah, I don't even know what I'm going to play.

22:54.860 --> 22:58.060
I really want a vintage jazz bass for this.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.860
I only have a 70s one that I don't really think is appropriate.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.700
I really need a 60s one, blah, blah, blah.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.180
And Mike's like, I'm going to hook you up.

23:05.180 --> 23:12.060
He showed up to my place the next day with a truckload of old P basses and jazz basses

23:12.700 --> 23:15.820
and brought them all into my studio and I'm playing them.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.820
And then I pulled one out of the case and it's Olympic white, just like Jeff Beck.

23:22.460 --> 23:28.460
And I play it and not only did I get goosebumps and started crying,

23:28.460 --> 23:32.060
but I looked over at Mike and same thing was happening.

23:32.060 --> 23:37.740
And he's like, I guess Jeff might be happy about this.

23:38.540 --> 23:42.620
And he's like, well, I didn't want to let this one go.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.220
I was just trying to cheer you up a bit and maybe loan it to you for the tour.

23:46.220 --> 23:50.460
But if you really want it, it's yours.

23:50.940 --> 23:57.420
And I was like, oh my God, this is like, Mike Durnt is the nicest guy ever.

23:59.820 --> 24:00.620
So that happened.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.620
So that bass's name is Jeff and it's a white jazz bass.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.060
And I played it on the Incubus tour.

24:06.700 --> 24:11.580
But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped to handle grief now.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.420
Tell me about the Comedy Store a little bit more.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.860
Do you think comedians and musicians in some

24:17.580 --> 24:20.140
deep fundamental way are made from the same cloth?

24:21.100 --> 24:24.700
Like, are they spiritually connected somehow?

24:25.580 --> 24:29.660
I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way.

24:29.660 --> 24:37.180
So I think personality wise, comedians and musicians are quite different actually.

24:38.060 --> 24:38.620
In what way?

24:39.980 --> 24:44.700
Well, you'd have to subdivide even musicians into different categories too,

24:44.700 --> 24:48.860
because the thing that I appreciate about comedians

24:48.860 --> 24:52.300
is that you go to a restaurant with them and like all the observational humor,

24:53.260 --> 24:56.940
they'll notice everything and make you laugh about it,

24:56.940 --> 24:59.900
which a really great songwriter does the same thing too.

25:00.460 --> 25:05.100
And my favorite lyricists like Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon,

25:06.460 --> 25:10.300
Warren Zevon, they add comedy into their lyric.

25:11.260 --> 25:16.540
So those types of people I would liken to hanging out with a comedian.

25:16.540 --> 25:22.140
It's very different from like say somebody that is an instrumental guitarist or something like

25:22.140 --> 25:28.940
that, that they're more focused on whether it's like a kinesthetic thing or like a physical thing

25:28.940 --> 25:35.980
or whatever it is, they're not quite doing the observational thing in the same way.

25:35.980 --> 25:41.900
So I just appreciate like my favorite thing to do is go out and laugh,

25:41.900 --> 25:45.660
especially because like I can tend to be pretty analytical and be in my head.

25:46.220 --> 25:54.060
And so anything that just kind of lets me be in my heart and just enjoy life.

25:54.060 --> 25:57.180
I think there's a photo of you with Dave Chappelle on stage.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.380
What was that about?

25:58.380 --> 26:04.940
So right after Leonard Cohen passed away, the Comedy Store threw me a birthday party.

26:04.940 --> 26:10.940
It was this crazy lineup and like it was like I'd play a song with my band

26:11.820 --> 26:16.540
and then Jackson Brown sat in and like sung a song.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.180
And then like Dave Chappelle came up and said some jokes.

26:19.180 --> 26:22.140
It was like one of my favorite nights ever.

26:22.140 --> 26:22.940
Yeah.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.140
Yeah, it was cool.

26:24.140 --> 26:27.500
It was a very healing birthday party.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.580
Yeah, there's something magical about that place.

26:29.580 --> 26:29.820
Yeah.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.020
It's really special.

26:31.020 --> 26:34.540
Yeah, well, the mothership has some magic to it too.

26:34.540 --> 26:35.420
It's really cool.

26:35.420 --> 26:38.940
It's different, totally different vibe, but like super awesome.

26:39.900 --> 26:45.980
You've said that Leonard Cohen is a songwriting inspiration of yours.

26:47.260 --> 26:51.500
I saw you perform his song Chelsea Hotel brilliantly on the internet.

26:53.100 --> 26:57.340
It's about, for people who don't know, his love affair with Janet Joplin.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.380
How does that song make you feel?

27:01.340 --> 27:01.820
Great.

27:01.820 --> 27:02.780
I love that song.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.380
Which aspect?

27:04.380 --> 27:08.540
Musically, the melancholy feeling, the hopeful feeling.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.020
The cocky feeling, all of it.

27:13.020 --> 27:16.220
Like every single line is a different feeling to it really.

27:16.220 --> 27:20.220
Yeah, but as a whole piece, I appreciate it so much.

27:20.220 --> 27:26.300
I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel and when Leonard and I first met,

27:27.420 --> 27:31.660
that was one of the first things we talked about was that, you know,

27:32.860 --> 27:37.580
I lived there where all that stuff went down before they tore it apart.

27:37.580 --> 27:43.740
And yeah, it's just a beautiful song.

27:44.380 --> 27:46.460
You know, what makes me sad the way it ends?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.460
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.620
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, that's all.

27:56.620 --> 27:59.020
I don't even think of you that often.

27:59.020 --> 28:01.420
You know that line, I don't even think of you that often,

28:01.420 --> 28:03.740
always like breaks my heart for some reason.

28:04.460 --> 28:10.620
Like how ephemeral, how short-lasting like certain love affairs can be.

28:11.180 --> 28:12.860
Just kind of like, huh.

28:13.980 --> 28:14.540
Yeah.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.500
Do you think he meant it?

28:15.500 --> 28:18.220
I always think he's trying to convince himself of it.

28:19.020 --> 28:22.140
It could be both or either, you know?

28:22.140 --> 28:26.060
I mean, that's the beautiful thing about poetry and lyric is that it's supposed to be open.

28:27.020 --> 28:30.380
Yeah, I wonder if it's also open to him depending on the day, you know?

28:30.380 --> 28:30.940
Definitely.

28:31.340 --> 28:37.980
The thing that he taught me or his advice to me was when you're writing a song,

28:39.980 --> 28:45.340
look at it the next morning, like just first thing and read it, and then take a walk.

28:46.540 --> 28:49.020
Smoke a joint, read it again.

28:50.300 --> 28:53.500
Go have a fight with your daughter.

28:54.140 --> 28:55.740
Come back, read it again.

28:56.380 --> 28:58.700
Get drunk, read it again.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.380
Wait a week, read it again.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.780
Just so that, you know, from every state and every position,

29:05.980 --> 29:10.460
the wider the lens is going to be from an audience perspective.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.700
You want things to mean multiple things.

29:14.300 --> 29:19.260
So there's one line I read somewhere that he regrets putting in the song.

29:19.260 --> 29:20.300
So I've got to ask you about it.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.500
It's pretty edgy.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.620
It's about giving me head on the unmade bed.

29:25.180 --> 29:25.660
Yeah.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.020
You think that's a good line or bad line?

29:27.020 --> 29:28.140
I think it's an amazing line.

29:28.140 --> 29:29.820
It's one of the best lines in the song.

29:29.820 --> 29:30.620
Yeah, right?

29:30.620 --> 29:35.020
When he put that song out, obviously he didn't regret it or he wouldn't have put that

29:35.020 --> 29:35.980
lyric in the song.

29:36.540 --> 29:42.860
I think what happened was that eventually word got out either from him or from somebody else

29:42.860 --> 29:45.020
that the song was about Janis Joplin.

29:45.020 --> 29:45.420
Yes.

29:45.420 --> 29:49.180
And so at that point, he regretted the indiscretion.

29:50.060 --> 29:53.500
So it wasn't that he regretted how great the line was.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.460
It was just, you know, the privacy factor.

29:57.260 --> 30:03.740
But then again, Leonard's known for rewriting his lyrics in his live shows.

30:03.740 --> 30:08.140
You'll see a bunch of songs where it's like new lyrics and he didn't do it because he

30:08.140 --> 30:09.340
didn't like the old lyrics.

30:09.340 --> 30:13.100
He just did it because he could because he's Leonard.

30:13.100 --> 30:16.540
And it's like, why not have fun with words the way musicians have fun, you know,

30:16.540 --> 30:19.020
improvising solos on stage.

30:19.660 --> 30:25.180
And he could have changed that line in Chelsea Hotel after in retrospect, and he never did.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.660
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.

30:27.660 --> 30:33.980
You were talking so brave and so sweet, giving me head on the unmade bed while the limousines

30:33.980 --> 30:35.260
wait in the street.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.460
It's so powerful.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.340
It's a powerful line.

30:37.340 --> 30:38.780
It just kind of shocks you.

30:38.780 --> 30:40.700
Well, that's what's so great about it.

30:41.900 --> 30:45.740
But also heartbreaking because it doesn't last.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.980
Especially actually to me, it adds more meaning once you know it's Janis Joplin.

30:50.780 --> 30:54.460
It's like, okay, these two stars kind of collided for a time.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.100
But why is it heartbreaking?

30:57.100 --> 30:59.820
It could also be just beautiful that they had a little fling.

31:00.540 --> 31:02.620
Yeah, everything is beautiful.

31:02.620 --> 31:03.260
Thank you.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.620
Even the dark stuff.

31:04.620 --> 31:05.660
What's not beautiful?

31:07.260 --> 31:11.420
Everything is beautiful if you look long enough and deeply enough.

31:12.780 --> 31:13.740
What were we saying?

31:13.740 --> 31:16.060
Oh, what do you think about Hallelujah?

31:17.020 --> 31:19.180
What do you think about the different songs of his?

31:20.140 --> 31:22.220
Why did you choose Chelsea Hotel to perform?

31:22.220 --> 31:28.700
Because I lived there and it meant something to me to sing that song.

31:30.060 --> 31:34.860
Actually, when I put that song out on YouTube, that's when he sent me an email.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.700
He's like, hey, do you want to come over?

31:37.900 --> 31:39.500
So this is how you guys connected?

31:39.500 --> 31:41.580
No, we met in a rehearsal studio.

31:42.220 --> 31:46.380
I ended up watching their whole rehearsal and sitting there next to Roshi,

31:46.380 --> 31:51.340
his 105-year-old monk, which was really great.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.980
I remember when I was shaking his hand.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.620
It was just me and Roshi on the couch watching Leonard with his band.

31:59.260 --> 32:04.220
And we were shaking hands and he grips my hand like this so it doesn't let it go.

32:04.780 --> 32:07.820
And he looked at my eyes and he said, where are you?

32:08.700 --> 32:10.620
And I said, in the handshake.

32:11.580 --> 32:12.080
Yes.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.620
Wow, you passed the test.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.420
Passed the Roshi test.

32:17.420 --> 32:21.180
And then what's funny was that the next thing that happened about five minutes later,

32:21.580 --> 32:27.180
was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you, of caviar.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.540
This is not a callback.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.900
Well, it is in a way, in a deep fundamental way.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.740
He started feeding the monk caviar.

32:34.860 --> 32:38.940
And that healed my Montreux Jazz Festival sadness forever.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.240
The end.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.780
Do you think there's a kind of like weird,

32:44.460 --> 32:47.020
like there's a sense of humor to it all somehow?

32:47.020 --> 32:48.940
Like, why does that happen?

32:48.940 --> 32:49.740
Why does that happen?

32:49.740 --> 32:56.060
Why, like why stuff like that happens or that the Jeff bass speaks to you?

32:57.180 --> 32:58.140
Why do we need to know?

32:59.020 --> 33:00.220
You believe in that stuff?

33:00.220 --> 33:01.100
In what stuff?

33:01.100 --> 33:04.460
That there is a rhyme to the whole thing somehow?

33:04.460 --> 33:10.940
Like there's a frequency to which magical things of that nature can happen?

33:10.940 --> 33:27.980
I'm divided about that answer because I think just things are flowing.

33:27.980 --> 33:31.340
I don't necessarily, I don't think anything's kind of like planned out.

33:32.460 --> 33:37.180
Like through time, it's like an orchestra playing of different

33:37.180 --> 33:39.820
experiences and circumstances that are somehow connected.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.060
I think everything's connected.

33:42.060 --> 33:42.780
So yes.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.260
But predetermined means like?

33:45.260 --> 33:49.340
I don't believe in the predetermined stuff necessarily,

33:49.340 --> 33:54.780
which is different from whatever your previous comma is.

33:54.780 --> 33:57.340
And comma is a whole other kind of conversation.

33:57.340 --> 34:01.100
I don't mean comma is in like good comma, bad comma, just comma meaning

34:02.300 --> 34:07.660
the collection of things you've acquired over this lifetime or other lifetimes.

34:07.660 --> 34:12.300
Just whatever that is, is going to influence your future.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.900
Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life.

34:17.660 --> 34:21.740
Maybe I just read it that way because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me that's like lucky,

34:22.780 --> 34:23.420
feels lucky.

34:24.220 --> 34:27.740
And sometimes I wonder like, huh, this is weird.

34:28.460 --> 34:33.100
It does feel like the universe just kind of throws stuff at you with a chuckle.

34:34.860 --> 34:35.340
I don't know.

34:35.340 --> 34:35.820
Not you.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.340
The proverbial you.

34:37.340 --> 34:37.580
One.

34:38.540 --> 34:38.780
Yeah.

34:39.820 --> 34:43.740
You said you sometimes watch classic movies to inspire your songwriting

34:43.740 --> 34:45.580
and you mentioned watching Taxi Driver.

34:46.700 --> 34:47.660
I love that movie.

34:49.100 --> 34:52.380
And I think you mentioned that you wrote a love song based on that movie.

34:52.940 --> 34:59.820
So Travis Bickle, for people who don't know, is a taxi driver and he's deeply lonely.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.580
What do you think about that kind of loneliness?

35:02.220 --> 35:07.980
I think that loneliness is a product of feeling separate from the world

35:09.180 --> 35:16.620
and separate from others and that the less you experience that separation,

35:16.620 --> 35:18.780
the less you'll feel lonely.

35:19.900 --> 35:24.380
How often have you felt lonely in this way, separated from the rest of the world?

35:25.260 --> 35:28.620
It's less and less every single year.

35:29.100 --> 35:33.420
Because I work very hard at it.

35:33.420 --> 35:34.860
Feeling like a part of the world.

35:35.580 --> 35:39.100
Yeah, just meditating and studying scriptures and.

35:39.100 --> 35:42.700
Don't you think that, I mean, isn't there a fundamental loneliness to the human experience?

35:43.340 --> 35:43.820
Just.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.620
In what sense?

35:45.340 --> 35:49.500
That all the struggles, all the suffering you experience is really experienced by you alone.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.020
Is it?

35:51.740 --> 35:53.260
Maybe at the very bottom, it's not.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.420
It's kind of all the same stuff.

35:55.900 --> 35:56.940
You didn't feel alone.

35:57.020 --> 36:01.020
You didn't feel alone in 2016, 2017.

36:01.900 --> 36:07.740
I felt like I lost a piece of myself that I had given to somebody else.

36:08.460 --> 36:16.060
And I feel like people feel that in romantic exchanges, whether it's long term, short term.

36:17.260 --> 36:22.460
You give a piece of yourself and then if that person dies or you break up with that person,

36:23.100 --> 36:25.420
you feel like you've lost that piece of yourself.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.780
Which I feel like is very different experience than

36:28.780 --> 36:33.580
if you just are opening yourself rather than giving a piece of yourself.

36:33.580 --> 36:37.500
You're just opening yourself to somebody or something.

36:38.860 --> 36:42.220
So opening is fundamentally not a lonely experience.

36:43.340 --> 36:44.780
No, it's a loving experience.

36:45.420 --> 36:49.340
And then losing a piece of yourself can be.

36:50.140 --> 36:53.420
Yeah, because you can't really, you can't lose a piece of yourself if you are

36:53.660 --> 36:56.060
the same self as every other self.

36:56.060 --> 36:56.860
Right, right.

36:56.860 --> 37:00.460
So if you see yourself as together with everybody, then there's no losing.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.020
Yeah.

37:01.020 --> 37:03.020
Yeah, yeah.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.460
It's a beautiful way to look at it.

37:04.460 --> 37:08.860
You said that there's something healing about being in an empty hotel room

37:09.580 --> 37:12.060
with no attachments except your suitcase.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.620
You know, a lot of people will talk about hotel rooms being

37:16.540 --> 37:20.220
a fundamentally lonely experience, but you're saying it's.

37:21.260 --> 37:21.740
It's healing.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.540
It's healing.

37:22.940 --> 37:23.740
It's healing.

37:23.740 --> 37:27.820
Yeah, because I just get to sit there and not worry about all this stuff.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.940
These meaningless attachments.

37:31.500 --> 37:36.140
I've got my suitcase with my necessities or my three suitcases sometimes.

37:39.660 --> 37:45.500
I can just sit there and meditate and just be with myself and it's so awesome.

37:46.060 --> 37:49.180
And usually like you plan your touring for like, you know,

37:50.140 --> 37:53.980
you kind of get the business aspect of things taken care of in advance.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.660
So you can kind of just really be flowing day to day on a tour.

37:58.220 --> 37:59.500
And it's a great feeling.

38:00.540 --> 38:05.180
It's funny because this last tour that I did, we didn't have hotels every night.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.500
We had hotels maybe like once a week.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.900
And I hadn't done that before.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.500
Usually it's I'm frequently in hotels.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.780
So I didn't get that space that I'm really used to getting.

38:18.780 --> 38:19.340
You missed them.

38:20.220 --> 38:23.740
I very much missed it and had to be very creative.

38:23.740 --> 38:31.900
And I ended up like going into the back lounge when everyone was asleep and like

38:31.900 --> 38:34.860
meditating back there or like before everyone woke up.

38:36.620 --> 38:38.940
And I actually like joined.

38:38.940 --> 38:42.140
There was like an online meditation retreat that was happening.

38:42.140 --> 38:47.180
It was like 12 hours a day of silent meditations that happens once a year.

38:47.180 --> 38:51.020
And I love this particular group of people.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.860
And they knew I was on tour.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.860
So they're like, just join when you can.

38:54.860 --> 38:58.060
And so I was on the tour doing the meditation retreat at the same time.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.100
It was so fun.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.780
It was so fun because I was like in the back lounge.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.620
The bus is like moving around like this.

39:04.620 --> 39:08.940
My laptop, the Zoom is like, and I'm just like sitting like meditating.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.980
It was like, yeah, this is the shit.

39:11.980 --> 39:12.620
It's silent.

39:12.620 --> 39:16.140
So they're all connected to Zoom and just doing 12 hours a day.

39:16.140 --> 39:16.700
Yeah.

39:16.700 --> 39:17.420
That's cool.

39:17.420 --> 39:22.540
These particular retreats that I started doing, it's not straight silent.

39:22.540 --> 39:26.540
There are, you know, silence sits every hour for 50 minutes.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.460
And then there's some talks.

39:29.180 --> 39:33.820
And like these people that I've been working with are really cool because

39:33.820 --> 39:39.660
they're integrating spiral dynamics into Zen.

39:40.460 --> 39:43.740
And it's like the coolest combination.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.020
What spiral dynamics?

39:45.020 --> 39:47.820
Like Ken Wilber, do you know Ken Wilber?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.260
Integral theory.

39:49.260 --> 39:49.580
Yes.

39:49.580 --> 39:50.780
Can you explain a little bit?

39:50.780 --> 39:54.620
So I vaguely know of him because of kind of this notion that

39:56.700 --> 39:58.860
everything is one.

39:58.860 --> 40:00.060
Like everything is integrated.

40:00.060 --> 40:06.460
That every field has truths and falsehoods and we should integrate the truths.

40:07.820 --> 40:08.460
Yeah.

40:08.460 --> 40:13.900
It's hard to explain how it applies to this type of meditation because it's

40:13.900 --> 40:21.740
in the guided parts of the meditation that this whole holonic theory is brought in

40:21.740 --> 40:28.300
about transcending and including every aspect of your being.

40:29.820 --> 40:36.940
Because he talks about levels of development in consciousness and how this applies to

40:37.820 --> 40:44.140
every single religion or non-religion that there are these levels of development

40:44.140 --> 40:48.300
and that go all the way up to enlightenment.

40:48.300 --> 40:54.060
No matter what you start off with, it could be, you know, Christianity, Buddhism,

40:54.060 --> 40:57.260
Vedanta, doesn't matter, like anything.

40:57.260 --> 41:02.060
Then I just like it when everything is and everyone is taken into account.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.460
It doesn't matter where you're coming from, that there's a way to be self-realized,

41:06.460 --> 41:07.740
self-actualized.

41:07.740 --> 41:13.500
There are self-actualized beings from all walks of life with very, very different paths.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.700
There's no one path.

41:15.580 --> 41:19.980
I mean, in this particular retreat I do, there's like a lot of silent sits and then

41:19.980 --> 41:21.660
there's some guided meditations.

41:24.060 --> 41:29.660
But I've tried a lot of different avenues and they're all great, so I wouldn't just say,

41:29.660 --> 41:30.860
just try this one thing.

41:31.500 --> 41:36.140
I've studied the Upanishads with Vedanta teachers and gone through those

41:36.140 --> 41:41.180
texts for months and months and stayed at monasteries and how they break it down

41:41.180 --> 41:47.740
makes total sense to my mind and heart and more importantly than my mind, my inner knowing,

41:47.740 --> 41:48.460
it resonates.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.620
Inner knowing.

41:50.620 --> 41:55.020
Yeah, because your mind is like the thinking tool.

41:55.820 --> 42:00.220
It's not you, you're not your mind, you're not your thoughts, you're not your body.

42:01.020 --> 42:07.100
You know, so it's like just the you, like that knowing that you have, that's kind of

42:07.100 --> 42:11.660
when something resonates there, that's usually when you go with something.

42:12.220 --> 42:14.140
What was living in a monastery like?

42:14.140 --> 42:15.020
It's the best.

42:15.660 --> 42:16.460
What are we talking about?

42:17.100 --> 42:22.300
It's just an empty room with like a tiny single bed and a sheet and a pillow and that's it.

42:22.300 --> 42:23.100
That's it.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.860
You have to eat the same thing as everyone.

42:25.420 --> 42:26.300
What's the food like?

42:26.300 --> 42:26.860
What is it?

42:27.580 --> 42:30.780
Very plain, cheap, basic food.

42:30.780 --> 42:36.700
Which is funny for someone like me because I'm pretty particular about my diet.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.980
You brought over like 20 different ingredients.

42:42.620 --> 42:47.100
So what was the day in the life of Tal and a monastery?

42:48.220 --> 42:56.140
You wake up at 5 a.m. to the bell and you go and meditate like constantly.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.260
Till bedtime other than two meals.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.500
How are you sitting?

43:01.500 --> 43:02.620
Are you in a group?

43:02.620 --> 43:03.660
Is there other people there?

43:04.460 --> 43:06.060
And you're just sitting there?

43:06.060 --> 43:09.740
Well, if you're talking about the Zen monastery, because I stayed in a Zen monastery

43:11.820 --> 43:15.340
and I did a thing with that, the guy was telling you about that kind of

43:16.140 --> 43:22.780
the integral Zen thing where he uses Ken Wilber's work in combination with Zen.

43:22.780 --> 43:26.140
That's a little bit different because he does talks, we talk about things.

43:26.860 --> 43:33.100
And that's very separate from the monastery, like the Vedanta monasteries I've stayed at,

43:33.100 --> 43:38.620
which there's very little meditation in terms of sitting silently.

43:39.580 --> 43:45.740
Instead, we are meditating on the scriptures like the Upanishads and we're like diving into that.

43:46.700 --> 43:49.500
What were the differences, the takeaways from the experiences?

43:50.300 --> 43:55.020
The two different, the integral one and the meditating on scriptures?

43:55.980 --> 44:03.180
They both have been incredibly helpful to me because the Vedanta,

44:06.780 --> 44:14.060
anytime I go into my head about something, the answer is there based on this knowledge.

44:17.820 --> 44:23.500
With the Zen monastery, it's like you just got to put your butt in the seat and sit and wait

44:24.460 --> 44:28.380
and maybe something will happen, maybe it won't, but just keep sitting.

44:28.380 --> 44:35.420
It's very disciplined and you go through a lot, your body's purging a lot.

44:37.260 --> 44:41.340
There's a lot and you don't necessarily have the answers as to what is happening.

44:42.220 --> 44:46.460
I think for somebody like me, I need both.

44:46.460 --> 44:50.780
I need to be in a place where there's complete uncertainty but complete discipline

44:51.500 --> 44:55.020
and just doing the regimented thing.

44:56.140 --> 45:03.180
Then there's the me that feels very satisfied from an analytical standpoint understanding

45:03.180 --> 45:06.460
what's happening, what is the gross and the subtle body.

45:07.660 --> 45:11.100
I want to understand these things about what it is to be a human.

45:13.180 --> 45:13.980
I like them both.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.380
Understand what it means to be a human.

45:17.020 --> 45:20.780
Having that patience and just sitting with yourself helps you do that.

45:22.140 --> 45:26.140
Yes, more so like the analysis part.

45:29.180 --> 45:35.420
Sitting with yourself, there's no better education of facing every demon and

45:36.460 --> 45:39.020
it's all going to come out and it's not going to be pretty,

45:40.220 --> 45:44.380
but then there's things that happen on the other side of it that are so profound.

45:45.260 --> 45:46.620
Have you met most of your demons?

45:48.060 --> 45:49.980
I've met the demons that have come out.

45:50.620 --> 45:51.660
Oh, there might be more.

45:51.660 --> 45:52.460
Who knows?

45:52.460 --> 45:54.460
Okay, well, to be continued.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.340
I heard you say that you wrote a love song after Taxi Driver.

46:03.340 --> 46:07.180
What kind of love songs do you write more of?

46:09.580 --> 46:11.580
You're a songwriter first, but people don't know.

46:11.580 --> 46:14.140
They might think you're primarily a bassist.

46:14.140 --> 46:15.100
But they're wrong.

46:15.900 --> 46:21.420
I said, do you write mostly broken heart ones or hopeful love songs,

46:21.420 --> 46:26.060
in love songs, about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs?

46:27.420 --> 46:31.420
Well, the last album I put out is pretty self-explanatory as to what that is.

46:33.100 --> 46:33.980
A lot of pain, though?

46:34.780 --> 46:35.580
There was, yeah.

46:35.660 --> 46:36.160
Mm-hmm.

46:36.860 --> 46:42.620
Some of it was storytelling, and some of it was real experience,

46:42.620 --> 46:45.420
and it's always like a combination of things.

46:46.540 --> 46:55.820
I serve the song, so sometimes you use your own life experience to tell a song,

46:55.820 --> 47:03.100
and sometimes you may watch a movie and part of that script merges with your own experience,

47:03.100 --> 47:07.900
and that tells the right story for the point you're trying to make in the song.

47:07.900 --> 47:14.300
So it varies from song to song, in terms of what a biographical it is.

47:14.300 --> 47:14.860
Yeah.

47:14.860 --> 47:18.780
I was stuck at the end of Taxi Driver when, what's her name, Betsy?

47:19.740 --> 47:21.340
Because Travis becomes a hero.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.660
She tries to get with him, and he rejects her.

47:24.860 --> 47:27.180
Also, that was powerful.

47:27.260 --> 47:27.760
Yeah.

47:28.540 --> 47:36.700
My favorite love songs are the ones where you're not sure it's about romantic love,

47:36.700 --> 47:43.740
or love of God, or love of life, or just pure, just love.

47:44.620 --> 47:48.060
I was thinking George Harrison writes songs like that, like What Is Life?

47:49.340 --> 47:53.260
Or like Bob Dylan's song that George Harrison covered, If Not For You?

47:54.060 --> 47:56.540
Yeah, it's just grateful, grateful for his love.

47:56.700 --> 47:57.420
Right, right.

47:57.420 --> 48:04.940
That's kind of like what I'm experiencing now, and so who knows what will end up coming out.

48:05.580 --> 48:07.020
Do you have been writing this kind of...

48:07.740 --> 48:08.700
Yeah, I've been writing.

48:09.900 --> 48:15.340
I don't have an intention of putting something out in any particular time frame,

48:15.340 --> 48:18.860
but I'm just writing and letting things flow.

48:19.820 --> 48:26.780
And yeah, there's a bunch of Leonard Cohen songs, too, where you're like,

48:27.580 --> 48:32.300
there's so many ways to interpret this song, and there's so many ways.

48:33.260 --> 48:37.820
I just love songs that aren't so specifically about one thing.

48:38.460 --> 48:42.300
You know, I really love the song To Play It, To Listen To,

48:42.300 --> 48:45.340
Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton, and I thought it was pretty straightforward.

48:46.300 --> 48:49.420
And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein,

48:50.540 --> 48:53.900
who's a mutual friend of ours, and he told me it's not about what I thought it's about.

48:54.540 --> 48:55.660
Oh, yeah? What did he say?

48:57.660 --> 49:01.660
It's a more complicated story. It's actually a man...

49:01.660 --> 49:08.540
So, Wonderful Tonight is a story about a man just finding his wife beautiful

49:09.420 --> 49:10.620
and appreciating it throughout.

49:12.220 --> 49:14.940
But he said it was actually a man missing his wife.

49:15.500 --> 49:21.660
He's imagining that she's lost because of the decisions he's made in his life.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.420
So it's pain.

49:24.300 --> 49:28.140
And he had a long, beautiful Eric Weinstein-like explanation of why.

49:28.140 --> 49:28.700
I love this.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.980
Have you and Eric played music?

49:31.980 --> 49:37.340
No. We've just hung out and had very long conversations about everything.

49:37.340 --> 49:38.860
He's a bit of a musician, you know?

49:38.860 --> 49:39.100
Yeah.

49:39.740 --> 49:43.340
Okay. You picked up the guitar when you were 14.

49:43.340 --> 49:44.060
Let's go back.

49:44.940 --> 49:49.180
And one interesting thing that just jumped out at me is he said you learned how to practice

49:49.820 --> 49:51.740
in your head because you only had 30 minutes.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.860
Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes.

49:55.740 --> 49:57.580
I read somewhere that Coltrane did the same.

49:58.220 --> 50:02.540
He was not the practice part, but he was able to play instruments in his head

50:03.500 --> 50:09.660
as a way to think through different lines, different musical thoughts, that kind of stuff.

50:10.140 --> 50:14.220
I just, maybe can you tell the story of that?

50:14.220 --> 50:19.900
Yeah. I just grew up in an environment that was focused on academia.

50:20.780 --> 50:26.220
And I fell in love with guitar and really just wanted the focus to be that.

50:27.260 --> 50:33.260
So my limit was 30 minutes a day for, I don't even remember how many times a week.

50:33.820 --> 50:36.300
Might've been every day or five days a week, whatever.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.060
So your parents didn't want you to play more than that?

50:39.020 --> 50:39.740
Um, no.

50:40.620 --> 50:46.380
And so I just learned how to visualize the fretboard in my head and I'd practice all day

50:46.380 --> 50:47.020
in my head.

50:47.580 --> 50:53.740
It's kind of like, you know, the Queen's Gambit, the TV show with Anya Taylor-Joy,

50:53.740 --> 50:55.420
and she just like sees it on the ceiling.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.700
I used to do that with the fretboard.

50:57.580 --> 50:58.940
Yeah. Just practice.

50:58.940 --> 51:02.060
And I actually recommend it to every musician because

51:02.060 --> 51:10.060
if you're just practicing here, you don't know what is more dominant necessarily.

51:10.780 --> 51:13.660
Is it this or is it your motor skills?

51:13.660 --> 51:17.740
If you just take that away and do it here, you know you've got it.

51:18.700 --> 51:23.100
So I'm glad that that happened and that I learned how to do that.

51:23.900 --> 51:28.540
And in terms of like learning fast, because like I had to like learn how to,

51:28.540 --> 51:31.900
well, I had to try to absorb a lot of information in a short amount of time.

51:31.900 --> 51:39.420
When I did have the instrument, I kind of would like do things in bursts.

51:39.420 --> 51:43.500
Like even in that half an hour, I would just go like play for a couple of minutes.

51:43.500 --> 51:47.180
And then I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd do it again.

51:47.180 --> 51:51.740
And I noticed there was like a huge difference between the first time and the second time.

51:51.740 --> 51:55.420
Whereas if I just kept repeating stuff, it would be like much slower.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.140
Well, what did you do in that minute?

51:59.420 --> 52:00.220
Just hang out.

52:00.220 --> 52:00.940
Just integrate?

52:01.500 --> 52:05.980
Yeah. It's like my brain was telling me like, just chill out for a sec.

52:05.980 --> 52:09.180
That's enough information. Let me take a second to integrate that.

52:09.740 --> 52:11.500
That's at least what it felt like to me.

52:12.220 --> 52:15.820
And the most hilarious thing happened a couple of months ago.

52:16.460 --> 52:18.140
I know you're friends with Andrew Huberman.

52:18.780 --> 52:23.900
So he put out some clip, which was a part of one of his podcasts about learning.

52:24.620 --> 52:29.500
And he said that there was some research done on learning fast

52:29.500 --> 52:36.460
and that if you practice something for a minute or so,

52:36.460 --> 52:42.940
and then you let your brain rest for 30 seconds or a minute,

52:42.940 --> 52:45.340
that in that 30 seconds or a minute,

52:45.340 --> 52:50.780
your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster and in reverse.

52:51.340 --> 52:53.420
And I was like, whoa, that's so cool.

52:53.420 --> 52:55.500
Because that's what I used to do when I was a kid.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.580
Now there's science that proves that,

52:57.580 --> 53:04.300
which is really cool for musicians to know that that's a good way to practice efficiently.

53:04.300 --> 53:09.100
Because some musicians, they're like practicing for six, seven, eight hours a day.

53:09.100 --> 53:10.060
I've never done that.

53:10.060 --> 53:12.540
I've never practiced more than an hour a day, even now.

53:14.460 --> 53:16.780
That's my technique and it works.

53:17.660 --> 53:20.300
Are you also practicing in your head sometimes?

53:20.300 --> 53:22.540
Now I'm not practicing as much.

53:22.540 --> 53:24.700
I'm more always writing songs in my head.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.460
So that's why I like silence.

53:26.460 --> 53:30.860
That's why I love being in the empty hotel room and being alone.

53:30.860 --> 53:36.940
Or, you know, songs come to me while I'm showering or walking around doing the dishes.

53:36.940 --> 53:41.100
Or occasionally when I'm hanging out with friends or like comedians

53:41.100 --> 53:44.620
and people just like say shit and I'll be like, that's a cool line.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.060
I'm just like jot it down on my phone.

53:46.060 --> 53:47.020
It's not always musical.

53:47.020 --> 53:48.460
It's sometimes lyrical.

53:48.460 --> 53:50.300
It's more lyrical than musical now.

53:51.340 --> 53:57.020
Because it's like, for me, it's like, well, there's so much music in the world.

53:57.020 --> 54:02.700
If I'm going to write a song, I want the song to be about something interesting.

54:02.700 --> 54:06.220
And so, yeah, the words matter to me.

54:06.940 --> 54:07.340
Yeah.

54:07.340 --> 54:10.940
And the right work and have so much power.

54:10.940 --> 54:11.740
It's crazy.

54:11.740 --> 54:14.460
Like we said with Leonard Cohen.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.740
And then they're often simple.

54:16.380 --> 54:17.900
The really powerful ones are simple.

54:18.220 --> 54:21.740
When you mentioned Hallelujah, you know, he wrote like 80 verses to Hallelujah

54:21.740 --> 54:23.660
before he narrowed it down to like four.

54:23.660 --> 54:26.140
And it took him like 15, 20 years to write that song.

54:26.780 --> 54:29.180
So some writers will do that.

54:30.300 --> 54:34.780
And then other writers just vomit it out and it's beautiful.

54:35.660 --> 54:39.260
Like I've heard that Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell, they're fast writers.

54:39.260 --> 54:40.700
They just kind of comes out.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.180
That makes me feel so good to know Leonard Cohen wrote so many verses of that.

54:45.180 --> 54:49.900
Like that was so deliberately crafted.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.380
Extensively, rigorously crafted.

54:53.740 --> 55:00.060
He just would spend months and years and constantly refining, refining.

55:00.060 --> 55:02.140
Do you have songs like that for yourself?

55:02.140 --> 55:04.940
Yeah, it's song dependent.

55:04.940 --> 55:07.420
Some just flow out and it's like, oh, there it is.

55:08.300 --> 55:09.100
Everything's there.

55:09.100 --> 55:14.380
And then other songs, it's like, you might have started it with music

55:14.380 --> 55:16.140
and there's some words that come out

55:16.140 --> 55:18.140
and then trying to fill in the rest of the word.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.620
Sometimes it can be like a square peg and a round hole.

55:20.620 --> 55:24.940
And other times it's like, oh no, I can, you know, it depends.

55:24.940 --> 55:28.940
Sometimes it becomes like a math problem and hopefully it doesn't

55:29.580 --> 55:33.100
because you just want to say what's right for the song.

55:33.740 --> 55:38.620
And usually when you, you know, write it all together,

55:38.620 --> 55:42.380
like the lyric and the melody and the chords

55:42.380 --> 55:44.300
and everything's kind of developing at once,

55:45.100 --> 55:48.940
at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful.

55:50.140 --> 55:51.900
Like Sondheim used to write like that.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.980
Just like he wouldn't move on until like he would just go this way.

55:56.700 --> 55:58.540
Whereas for me, it's just like, I'll just go with

55:58.540 --> 56:01.660
what seems to be coming naturally and I'll just let it be what it is.

56:01.660 --> 56:03.820
And then you come back and you say, okay, well, what,

56:03.820 --> 56:05.260
what do I have to do to this now?

56:05.260 --> 56:06.620
Like what's needed?

56:07.660 --> 56:09.660
Just to linger on the learning process.

56:13.340 --> 56:16.780
What would you recommend for young musicians and how to get good?

56:18.860 --> 56:21.180
What are the different paths a person can take

56:22.060 --> 56:24.540
to understand it deeply enough to create something special?

56:26.300 --> 56:31.260
I think first and foremost understanding why you are playing music.

56:31.980 --> 56:35.340
If it's because you have something that you're trying to express

56:35.900 --> 56:40.620
or that you're just in love with expression itself, with art itself.

56:40.620 --> 56:41.980
Those are great reasons.

56:43.260 --> 56:47.900
Um, to, to start this journey.

56:47.900 --> 56:51.020
The why should be, I think the why is really important

56:51.020 --> 56:55.900
because it's a jagged lifestyle and there's a lot in it.

56:55.900 --> 57:00.620
And so if you don't have your purpose, if you're not centered in your purpose,

57:01.340 --> 57:05.500
then all that, that jagged lifestyle is probably going to get to you.

57:06.140 --> 57:06.860
Jagged.

57:06.860 --> 57:08.060
It's jagged.

57:08.060 --> 57:09.100
Yeah, it's jagged.

57:09.100 --> 57:11.260
It's, it's all over the place.

57:11.260 --> 57:12.060
It's uncertain.

57:12.700 --> 57:15.500
It's one thing, one moment and a completely different thing.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.580
Another moment, you never know what's going to happen.

57:17.580 --> 57:23.260
And if you thrive on variety, which I love variety, um, then it's perfect.

57:24.380 --> 57:29.820
But also every human being needs a certain amount of certainty and structure.

57:29.820 --> 57:34.780
And so it's the certainty can come from your inner knowing,

57:34.780 --> 57:39.420
knowing that you're doing exactly what you want to be doing

57:39.420 --> 57:43.660
and knowing what your purpose is in doing it in this expression.

57:44.700 --> 57:47.020
Otherwise you're just kind of like a leaf blowing in the wind.

57:48.220 --> 57:51.900
Like in the early days touring, just playing clubs seems like tough.

57:52.540 --> 57:52.780
Yeah.

57:53.420 --> 57:54.140
It's a lot.

57:54.140 --> 57:58.140
Yeah, it's a lot of like the physical labor aspect of it is really hard.

57:58.140 --> 58:03.900
Playing on stage to, to two people or 2000 or 20,000, that doesn't make a difference.

58:04.460 --> 58:07.980
I mean, it makes a difference to the ticket sales, which informs how,

58:07.980 --> 58:11.660
what level of luxury you might have on the road or not.

58:11.660 --> 58:14.700
But other than that, it's just people that are listening to music.

58:16.380 --> 58:17.580
The music doesn't change.

58:19.180 --> 58:21.820
Does it make it tough when it's two people versus 200?

58:21.820 --> 58:22.060
No.

58:22.780 --> 58:26.380
So even if nobody recognizes whatever the thing you're doing.

58:26.380 --> 58:31.100
No, because the, the idea is to be doing like having a great conversation on stage.

58:33.020 --> 58:35.340
The audience can come and go.

58:35.340 --> 58:35.580
Yeah.

58:36.460 --> 58:41.020
I mean, I, I always like it, like there's certain points in shows where I, I'm just like,

58:42.140 --> 58:45.260
I consciously am like, oh, yes, there's an audience over there.

58:45.260 --> 58:48.140
Cause I'm so like wrapped up in whatever's happening on stage.

58:49.020 --> 58:49.980
You forget yourself.

58:50.540 --> 58:52.700
Well, maybe I'm remembering myself.

58:52.700 --> 58:58.300
Oh, damn callback somehow feels like one.

59:00.140 --> 59:00.380
Okay.

59:01.100 --> 59:03.420
You think every instrument is its own journey?

59:03.420 --> 59:09.260
As you play guitar, you play bass, you sing just the mastery of an instrument,

59:09.260 --> 59:11.180
or let's avoid the word mastery.

59:11.180 --> 59:14.060
The understanding of an instrument is its own thing.

59:14.060 --> 59:18.940
Are they somehow like physical manifestations of the same thing?

59:20.060 --> 59:26.460
Both, you know, like every instrument has its strengths, beauty limitations,

59:27.420 --> 59:32.700
range, like possible range that can, you know, be extended to some degree or another,

59:32.700 --> 59:37.740
depending on who you are, like trumpet or something, you know, like sudden people can

59:37.740 --> 59:39.820
hit higher notes than others, blah, blah, blah.

59:39.820 --> 59:47.980
But that being said, we're all playing the same 12 or 24 or however you divide the octave,

59:47.980 --> 59:50.620
that many notes, you know, we're all playing the same notes.

59:51.500 --> 59:53.820
So in that sense, it's all the same thing.

59:53.820 --> 59:58.780
It's just music or better yet, it's just art or expression.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.220
But yeah, every instrument has, you know, you got to go through the physical

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.940
aspects of it, the motor skills and all of that.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.540
And hopefully you get through that really quickly so you can get to the expression

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.140
quickly.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.620
Because if you get stuck in just that first phase, that'd be really boring.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:26.700
Yeah, but that's a pretty long phase, the technical skill required to really play an instrument.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.700
For some people it's a long thing and some people it's short.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.780
It very, very much varies.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:39.820
It might have to do with like how you learn and getting to know like your

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.820
strengths in learning, like more oral or more like, is it more like,

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:51.180
like what's your strength and playing off of those strengths.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:58.300
So for me, like I was saying earlier, it was just an intuitive thing that I knew,

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.980
I can feel when my brain is full, like that it needs processing time.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.220
And so I listened to that, I don't push past it.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.820
Even if it's like one minute and I do something, I'm like, okay,

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:11.740
silence.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.220
And then I come back and I trust that it's going to be there and is there.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.980
So just trusting yourself I think is really important,

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:23.740
trusting that you know you better than anybody else is going to know you.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:28.140
So that's the kind of thing with teachers that can be either really,

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.620
really helpful and great or really not great.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.460
Like I'm primarily self-taught.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:37.020
I've had amazing mentors of all walks of life.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:45.500
And I think I'm unbelievably blessed that my mentors are some of my favorite musicians on

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.380
earth, whether it's Leonard Cohen or Jeff Beck or Wayne Shorter, whoever these people are,

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.300
like they are my favorite musicians.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:02:01.020
So not everyone has that opportunity, but the opportunity that we have now that I didn't have

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.300
when I was starting is that everything's on YouTube.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.580
Like every interview with every genius,

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:12.300
like you don't need to necessarily have these people in person now.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.700
I mean, and then I'll say to that, yes and no.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.940
I agree with myself and then I don't agree with myself.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.820
And the reason is I do believe that there is something that happens

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.620
when you're in person with a master.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:36.220
In some cases that there is something transferred that is not intellectual,

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.900
it's not spoken, it's something else that happens, that can happen.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.860
That I've experienced and I really value that.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.620
And I think that applies to specific disciplines and also generally.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:57.260
Like I've been around Olympic gold medalists just to hang out with them for several days.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:00.380
And there's something about greatness.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:05.980
There's a way about them that kind of permeates the space around them.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.820
You kind of learn something from it, even if you don't practice that particular discipline.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.860
There's something to it, if you're able to see it.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.740
I also like what you said about the playing stuff in your head,

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:27.900
that it forces you to not be lost in the physical learning of the instrument.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.820
I think that's one of the things I

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.140
probably regret a little bit.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:39.580
So I play both piano and guitar and I've become quite, over the years,

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.540
technically proficient at the instruments.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.860
But I think my mind is underdeveloped because of that.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:04:00.140
Meaning I can feel the music when it's created, but I can't create out of the feeling.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.940
I haven't practiced the projecting the feeling onto the music.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.380
I'm not like a musician, but it's a different muscle.

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.460
If you really want to create beautiful things, the creation happens here.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.900
I think it's more here.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.500
It's some part of the body, but it's not with your fingers.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.660
Yeah, because I think the fingers is more this.

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.940
Yes, it is here.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:33.340
It's just nice that you said that because it's really good advice if you want to create.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.340
Yeah, slowing down is really great, too.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.180
What do you mean, slowing down?

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.740
Slowing everything down.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:51.260
I can play something really fast, but I may want to practice it.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:02.700
Let's see.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:02.940
Like...

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.780
Go slow as possible.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:20.620
Because there's all these micro movements that are happening that if you just go...

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:28.300
Like, you can't pay as close attention to the exact tone that you're pulling from each note.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:33.260
And there's a lot to pay attention to how my fingers are touching the string here.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.140
I can change my tone a million ways just by the direction of this finger.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.580
And same with how this lands and how hard I'm attacking the string.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.740
And with what intention am I hitting the string?

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.540
Emotionally, physically, and so even if you can go...

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.140
Play that so slow.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.740
See how locked into a pocket you can be.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:03.580
See how you feel every aspect of that.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.460
Because then when it gets sped up, it's still there with you.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:07.580
Yeah.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.220
That's brilliant.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:13.020
It's kind of like the transcended and included thing that Ken Wilbert talks about.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.540
It's like...

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.980
And I guess that's what meditation can do for you is to really listen to...

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.860
Observe every aspect of your body, the breath, and all this.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.940
Hear you're observing every element.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.980
Every super detailed element of playing a single note.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.980
It's cool that if you speed it up, it's still there with you.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.460
It is.

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.740
Yeah, it is.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.100
Because there are certain people, it's like they play really fast,

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:42.700
but I don't hear the fullness of tone always.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.660
It's probably because maybe they didn't...

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:51.180
Maybe it's because they didn't slow it down and really sit with each note

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.660
and let it resonate through their whole being.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.500
It's spiritual.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.940
It's like a spiritual expression.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.660
It's not just like...

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.940
It's not a sport.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.100
A lot of people treat music like a sport.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:04.700
Yeah.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.060
Since starting to learn more like Stevie Ray Vaughan versus Jimi Hendrix,

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.860
I would spend quite a long time on single notes or just bending,

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.180
just like, just listening to what you can do with bends, spending.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.980
Just thinking like people like B.B. King and all these blues musicians

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.980
like spend a career just making a single note cry.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.780
Yeah.

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.620
There's like an art form to that.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.340
Yeah.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:32.540
And I think you putting it, like taking it really slow,

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:36.700
which I never really thought of, is a really good idea.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.380
Like really slow it down.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:43.420
That's the same with like sitting with your own emotions.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.700
It's like we, when emotions are overwhelming to us, we get real busy.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.540
We move real fast because it's like we don't want to feel our feelings.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.100
Those are the moments to slow yourself down.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.380
And observe it.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.220
Anger, jealousy.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.180
And just be with it.

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.060
Just be with it.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.900
Be like, be cool with it.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.860
Like love it.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.300
Love the anger.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.100
It's all beautiful.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.940
Can you educate me on the difference between bass?

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.980
Bass and bass?

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.220
Okay.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.260
Well, one is a fish.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.580
At least I pronounced it correctly.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.060
That's good.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.380
It's all about the bass.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.740
Can you pronounce my name?

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:22.700
Tall.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:23.900
Wow.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.820
Most people say tall.

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.140
Tall.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:28.780
Or tall.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.220
You said tall.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.260
Who says tall?

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.700
Like so many people.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:33.900
In the south, maybe tall.

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.300
I don't know.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.500
But the fact that you used my name right, you get extra points.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:37.820
Tall.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.660
I didn't know this was a game.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.260
Am I winning?

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:41.500
Yeah.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.220
I like winning.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.500
How do you play the bass?

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.420
What's the difference between fingerstyle and slap?

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.100
Slap is like this.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.220
Fingerstyle is like this.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.460
Ever played bass with a pick?

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:52.940
Yeah.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.420
Sometimes.

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.420
I'm not accusing you of anything.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.340
No accusation taken.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.340
I don't know if these are sensitive topics.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.540
That would be pretty hilarious if I was sensitive about bass techniques,

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.100
but not about love.

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:09.260
It just looks so cool to slap it, and I don't understand what that's about.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.460
Like that thumb thing.

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.180
I slap less.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.100
A lot less.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.540
Almost never, actually.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:22.620
It has a very distinctive sound and does a very distinctive thing to a song

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:29.820
that is not something I hear needed very often in music today.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:30.940
Yeah.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:38.540
But in certain styles, like funk, it sounds awesome and it makes sense.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.740
It was something that was a bit overused at one point.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.860
For instance, like my mentor, Anthony Jackson, he refused to slap.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.860
He actually said, if you want me to slap, I'll leave this gig.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.420
So I'm not like that.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.420
See, that's why I said sensitive.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.860
See, I was reading into it.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.300
Because he's sensitive about it.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.700
I was feeling the spiritual energy of the sensitivity of the topic, Anthony Jackson.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.620
And then, I mean, I'm playing electric bass, so generally speaking,

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.020
you don't particularly want to hear electric bass on straight-ahead jazz anyway.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.380
You want to hear an upright bass.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:19.740
But if I was to play jazz on electric bass, I might even kind of

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:28.860
like palm mute, instead of going like, I might go to very.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:37.820
Anything to kind of make the notes shorter and less resonant and kind of fade away quick.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.820
Because the upright does that naturally.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.540
And I have a different bass, like a hollow body harmony that sounds closer to an upright

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:49.660
that I'll use in certain, like on my song Under the Sun that I put out,

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.940
that was on a harmony bass.

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:56.140
And it has like kind of an upright acoustic kind of tone to it, but with more sustain.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:03.980
And is jazz fusion the style where you have like an electric bass?

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:05.900
Can you educate me with jazz?

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.420
Again, you can have both.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.340
You can have either on anything.

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.260
There's no like real rules.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.500
I've heard you say something interesting, which is, well, a lot of things you say is interesting.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.580
Just one thing.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.620
And it's what time you're leaving.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:27.660
What time was that again?

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:29.660
Three minutes.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:36.940
That it's maybe easier sometimes to define a musical genre by the don'ts than the dos.

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.900
The don'ts than the dos.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.580
What are the don'ts of jazz and rock?

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.140
What are the don'ts of jazz fusion?

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:46.940
What are the don'ts?

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.980
In any domain of life, what are the don'ts?

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:53.740
The don'ts is just to please leave your fear at the door.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:03.100
And the dos is to be open to anything and open your ears, like respond to what's happening now.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:12.140
I think that quote you're talking about might have been more about an individual musician's

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.820
unique sound, because everyone has their sound.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:22.940
If they've developed their voice and they've listened to their own aesthetic preferences,

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.460
of which everyone is slightly different, everyone has slightly different likes and dislikes,

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.860
then you'll have a unique sound on your instrument and your unique sound

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:39.500
is defined more by the choices you make rather than, I mean, it's equally as defined by the

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500
choices you make and the choices you don't make.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.380
I mean, it's the flip side of the same coin, really.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.100
Yeah, there's certain musicians you can just tell.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.300
It's them.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.540
Just you hear a few notes and you're like, okay, it's them.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.180
Sometimes it's tone, sometimes it's the way they play a rhythm.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.380
Yeah, that quote you're talking about might have even had to do with someone's real limitations

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.580
on an instrument.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:07.740
That then that would define their sound as the things that they actually can't do versus what

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.620
you're choosing to do versus not choosing to do, which is that flip side of the same coin thing.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.700
How many fingers do you play with?

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.460
It seems like a lot of the greatest musicians aren't technically perfect.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:26.700
The imperfections is the thing that makes them unique and where a lot of the creativity comes

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.260
from.

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:34.140
Hendrix said a lot of those things, the way he put a thumb over the top.

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.420
Well, his hands were huge.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.180
There was no other place for the thumb to go.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.540
It was great that he could reach the E string and that was an advantage.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.780
And he was a lefty playing a right and a guitar.

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:48.780
Flipped, I guess.

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.220
That's weird.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.700
That probably doesn't have much of an effect, maybe a spiritual one, I don't know.

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.620
Actually, flipping a guitar is different.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.860
It does bring out something different in you because I've done a flipped and it's like,

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.420
oh, wow.

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.020
Yeah, it's really different.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:10.940
I remember talking to my osteopath because there's so much weight on this shoulder

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.940
while I'm playing all the time.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.980
And they were saying, well, just after shows, just literally just turn it upside down,

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.620
do the exact same thing in the opposite way.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.060
It'll even out your body.

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.060
And I was like, that's good advice.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.100
Have you actually tried it?

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.140
Okay.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:26.460
All right.

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.460
I'll write that down.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:32.940
All right.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.260
Well, do you know a guy named Davey 504?

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.020
I've heard of him.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.540
I've recently learned of him.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.220
He's a YouTuber and a bass player.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.420
He's amazing.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:48.780
He combines memes and also just these brilliant bass compositions and says slap like a lot.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.900
He's big into slapping.

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.580
That's how that's he's the one that kind of made me realize this is a thing.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:54.460
Okay.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:59.500
And he also said that you're one of the best, not the best bassists in the world.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.140
There was a bunch of his fans that wrote in and he analyzed the Jeff Beck thing

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.020
that we watched at Crossroads is one of the greatest solos ever, bass solos ever.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.700
So shout out to him.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.900
What does that make you feel like?

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.940
You're the greatest of all time.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.140
Chocolate cookies.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:14.540
Chocolate.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.740
Is that your favorite?

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.260
I like macadamia nut.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.700
Like if you really want to get into it with like white chocolate.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:21.820
Yeah.

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.220
That's a rare one for people to say is the favorite.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.420
Chocolate chip is just like easy.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.100
You can kind of get them anywhere.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:27.740
Yeah.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.220
Last thing you want to be is easy in this world.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.460
You want to be easy.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.860
You said that I love rock and roll quote.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.580
I love folk.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.460
I love jazz.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.820
I love Indian classical music.

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.940
I really love all kinds of music as long as it's authentic and from the heart.

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.660
So when you play rock versus jazz, you played all kinds of music.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.780
What's the difference technically, musically, spiritually for you?

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.380
Well, there's no spiritual difference.

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.620
Okay. Cross that off the list.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:59.740
But musically, it's kind of like what we were saying earlier.

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:09.020
It's like each genre has its language of what makes it that genre.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:15.340
And that would be a good thing to say it's defined by the do's and don'ts.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:24.300
Um, because yeah, it's like, I'm trying to think, basically I put the song first

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:33.580
and I think of the song as the melody, the lyrics, and then the harmony and obviously the groove.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.020
So the song goes before the genre in a sense, each song is like its own thing.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.060
They're both things that are held in my mind.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:49.100
It's like, okay, genre and then song, which is comprised of those basic, you know, elements.

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.420
And I tend to kind of prioritize lyric because

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.380
somebody is trying to express something over music.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.860
And so that the lyric is very, very important.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.100
And so then the choices come from there.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:14.140
It's like, okay, within the genre of X, this is the typical language.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.860
And then how do I best serve this lyric?

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:26.220
And then where else can I pull from that might not be in these two bags

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.100
that would put a little twist on it?

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.940
So those are all the kinds of things I might be thinking about.

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:37.580
But I don't like twists for the sake of twists either.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:44.540
I like twists because I want to hear something that might be fresh.

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:51.340
But when someone does something just to be hip, it's annoying to me.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.820
I think you can hear the difference.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:57.580
It's like when people like, they write in odd time signatures,

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:03.980
or they write all these riffs just because they can, just because they have the chops to do it,

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.980
or they know how to play in 1116 and whatever.

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:15.260
But if it's not actually creating a piece of music that's going to move somebody,

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.620
then why are you doing it?

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.380
And so I think a lot of the questions I'm asking myself when I'm approaching a song are

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:25.740
mainly philosophical and aesthetic.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.940
So you like to stand on the edge of the cliff, not for the thrill of it,

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.900
but because that's where you find something new, potentially.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:32.540
Yeah.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.300
And it's thrilling.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.780
But you're not doing it just for the thrill.

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.980
I'm not doing it for the thrill.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.980
It just happens to be thrilling.

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.780
All right.

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.780
Because you can always reel it back in.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:44.860
Can you though?

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.380
Yeah, you can.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.100
No.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:53.420
You can do a totally disciplined, I can go into a session and, okay, my favorite thing about

01:18:54.380 --> 01:19:00.220
going into a session with musicians that I adore is that we don't hear the demo,

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:05.100
because if you hear a demo, you're hearing what the producer or songwriter have already

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.420
imagined that every instrument is playing.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:10.140
And then it's like, well, I've already heard what you want.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:14.380
Now part of my mind is focused on what I already know you want,

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.140
what the destination is going to be.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.500
Why did you bring me in here?

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.740
I want to not hear it.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:23.420
I just want you to set it a piano and sing the song.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:27.420
I want to hear the chords and the lyric and sit in an acoustic guitar, play it,

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.460
and then let's all go in the room and then take one.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.860
I would say 80% of the time, take one has the most gold.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.580
And there might be like a mistake or two or someone forgot to go to the B section

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:44.220
and you might want to like punch that in so that you're hitting the right chord.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.620
But all the magic is in that take.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.380
And then sometimes it happens where it's like you go,

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:53.580
it's like we're rehearsing and take one, two, three, four, five,

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.820
and then you're like thinking about it too much.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:58.300
And then you go and you have a dinner and you come back

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.420
and the next take one after dinner is the one.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.180
It's usually after there's some sort of a break.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.460
But obviously there's exceptions to that rule.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.060
Sometimes it's take two and three.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.860
Yeah, you said that this is something that surprised you about recording with Prince,

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.380
is that he would just, so much of it would be take one.

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.660
It would just move so quickly.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.780
Yeah. Well, with that particular album that we made together,

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.140
it's called Welcome to America.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.780
He called me up and asked me, he said, I want to make a band with you.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.980
I'm like really inspired by what you're doing with Jeff Beck.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.580
I want to make a trio.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:39.260
Do you like the drum rolls of Jack DeGionnette was like his first question to me.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.540
I'm like, well, yeah, who doesn't?

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.060
Who doesn't like Jack DeGionnette?

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.340
Like one of the greatest of all time.

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.100
And he's like, well, you know, sounds like,

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.940
because we had a discussion about drumming,

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.260
sounds like you're kind of particular about drummers.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:56.220
So why don't you find us the drummer and I'll trust you to find the drummer.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.780
You can audition some people, send me some recordings

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:02.540
and maybe your two favorites and I'll pick out of the two or something.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.580
So I did that.

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.460
Went on a journey, found a couple guys.

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.580
He picked the one.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:15.100
We went in and he basically just would be like, okay,

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.300
so the A section is going to go like this and then the B section.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:22.380
I think we're going to go to G and then the bridge.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.100
I might go to B flat, but maybe I'll hold off and da da da.

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.060
Okay, let's go.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.060
One, two, three, four.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.820
And then we recorded it to tape.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.420
There was no punch.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.340
He did not want me to punch anything.

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:38.460
Like it was like, and there was one song called Same Page, Different Book.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.180
And he like talked through it just like he did.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:46.860
And then he had me soloing between each phrase, like little fills.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.420
It's like, I didn't know that that was going to come up and he loved that.

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:55.980
He loved to have me on the edge of my seat, like falling off the cliff.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.740
That was my first like real like falling off a cliff moment

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:04.220
from somebody else holding me at the edge of the cliff.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:04.780
You know what I mean?

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.940
Now I just do it on my own because it's so fun and it makes sense.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.020
It's the best thing for the music.

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:16.460
When you say punch the tape, is that when you actually record it?

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.860
Like if you record to tape and there's like say like you hit a bum note,

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:26.060
like to punch in means to like fix that note.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:30.060
Like re-record over that one little area and punch that note in.

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.780
He didn't want that.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.580
He's like, oh my favorite record is just like whatever happened, happened.

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.780
That's that moment in time.

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.300
Let's make a new moment in time.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.580
It's great.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.340
Nobody makes records like that anymore.

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.780
Everyone wants to like, you know, edit and edit and re-record and this and that.

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:51.020
And unfortunately with a lot of music, and I'm not saying all music

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.860
because there's plenty of great music coming out.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:23:05.100
But there's the danger of it being flat because every little imperfection is digitally removed.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:09.980
Well, that's one of the promising things about AI is because it can be so perfect

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:14.140
that the thing will actually come back to and value about music

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.980
is the imperfections that humans can create.

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.620
There'll be a greater valuation of imperfections.

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.380
I mean, you can kind of program imperfections too.

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:25.260
Yeah, sure.

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.940
That's also very sad.

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.620
But then you get closer and closer to what it means to be human.

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.300
And maybe there'll be AIs among us.

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.500
They'll be human, flawed like the rest of us.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.780
Mortal and silly at times.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.660
Another big sigh.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.260
Is it fair to say that you're very melodic on bass?

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:55.340
Like you make the bass sing more than people normally do?

01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.460
Is that a compliment?

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.420
Yes, I think so.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:57.920
Thank you.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.620
Moving on to the next question.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:07.260
By way of understanding, there's something about the way you play bass that just kind

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:12.060
of pulls you in the way when you listen to somebody play a guitar, like a guitar solo.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.660
The thing I love about Jeff Beck is that he played the guitar like a singer.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:22.140
And I think that the way that Wayne shorted played his saxophone,

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.020
it's like a singer.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.860
And I think everyone, every musician aspires to just sound like a singer.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.820
So you make it sing.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.860
Let me ask you about, just come back to Hendrix.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:35.580
Because you said that you had three CDs, Jimi Hendrix,

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.140
Herbie Hancock, and Rage Against the Machine.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.420
First of all, great combination.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.460
I'm a big Rage fan.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:46.220
It's so funny because when I listen to some of the music that I create,

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:50.620
my solo music, I'm like, I could see how this is a combination of

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.820
Herbie Hancock, Rage Against the Machine, and Jimi Hendrix.

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.140
I hear the influences, it's funny.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.380
Just from your musician perspective, what's interesting to you about,

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.460
what really stands out to you about Hendrix?

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:12.220
I just would love to hear a real professional musician's opinion of Hendrix.

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:19.420
I love that he has two voices combined into one voice.

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:25.980
So it's like, there is his voice on the guitar, and there is his singing voice,

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.740
and there is the combination of the two that make one voice.

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:35.340
And of course, the third element is his songwriting.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:39.500
And all of this have this beautiful chemistry,

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:44.540
and all work geniusly perfectly together.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.260
And there's nothing like it.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.860
And he always beat himself up about being a singer, and he didn't like his voice,

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:58.620
but it's like, my favorite singers are the singers that don't sound like singers.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.420
Bob Dylan.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.300
Bob Dylan.

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.420
You like Bob Dylan.

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.300
Love Bob Dylan.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.220
You love his voice too.

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.100
I love his voice.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.020
Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice?

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.260
He's expressing his lyrics.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.660
It's just pure expression.

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.260
Exactly what he means.

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:23.740
I feel everything that he's saying with 100% authenticity.

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.220
That's what I want to hear from a singer.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:30.620
I don't care how many runs you can do, and I want to believe what you're saying.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.460
A lot of cone is that.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.300
There's countless, like Neil Young.

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.020
I mean, there's so many musicians.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.860
I love Elliott Smith for that reason.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.500
Let me ask you about mentorship.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.740
You said teachers and mentors.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.620
You had mentors.

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:50.940
What's a good mentor for you?

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:52.940
Harsh or supportive?

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.380
Supportive.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:55.900
Supportive.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.740
You've seen Whiplash, the movie?

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.620
So that guy, somebody screaming at you, like kicking you off the cliff?

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.140
Not necessary.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.980
I feel like anybody that's truly passionate about something that they want to be

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:14.220
great at or a master of or this and that, they've already got that person inside their own head.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.540
You don't need somebody else to do that for you.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:29.180
I think you need love, acceptance, guidance, support, time, advice if you ask for it.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.700
Just a space, just a nice open space.

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:36.220
All my mentors were just that for me.

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.220
They didn't tell me to do anything.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.900
They didn't care.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.660
Why do they need to be invested in where I'm going?

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.420
Only I know where I'm going.

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:51.020
So for some mentor to come and be like, this is what you need to be doing in practice.

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.620
It's like, but why?

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:53.900
What if that's not my path?

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:54.940
That might be your path.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.980
So I'm not really, again, otherwise it feels like a sport.

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.060
Like who can run the fastest race?

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.420
And it's like, well, okay, well, I get that for sport.

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:09.980
Maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore, but still like,

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.060
I would say athletes have the same mentality.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.140
They've got that in them already too.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:20.060
Like, so I think more like of a strategic approach to mentorship works really well

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:27.100
and mainly just having an open space and just being available to someone.

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:31.180
And kind of show that they see the special in you.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:35.260
And they give you the room to develop that special, whatever.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:35.820
Exactly.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:40.700
Cause if you do have that harsh critic inside you, it's like, it is nice to have

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:45.340
somebody that isn't like your family or someone that's not obligated in any way

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.420
that just sees your talent and they're like, yeah, I dig what you're doing.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:50.140
Keep doing it.

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.340
Yeah. It's funny that that's not always easy to come by.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:57.820
Do you have any mentors?

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.500
Yeah, I've had a few recently, but for most of my life, people didn't really,

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.740
you know, I, I'm very much like that too.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:09.100
Like somebody to pat me on the back and say, like, like see something in you of value.

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.060
Yeah. I didn't really have that.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.620
So do you wish you did?

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.220
Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:20.140
But maybe the wishing that I did is the thing that made me who I am,

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.260
not having it, the longing for that.

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:29.820
Maybe that's the thing that helped me develop a concept of, you know,

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:39.180
a constant sense of longing, which I think is a, is a way of, because I have that engine in me,

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.940
it really allows me to deeply appreciate every single moment, every single,

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:48.140
everything that's given to me. So like just the eternal gratitude.

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:51.820
So you never know which the, which are the bad parts and the good parts.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.820
So if you remove one thing, it might be

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.980
it might be, it, the whole thing might collapse.

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.700
I suppose I'm grateful for the whole thing.

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:09.660
That one note you screwed up so many years ago, that might've been essential.

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:13.100
What about, because you do jiu-jitsu.

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:13.500
Yes.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:13.900
So like-

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.340
Do you? Are you?

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:20.380
I don't, my dad does. My dad's super into it. I love my dad. He's the coolest.

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:27.500
Um, but no, I don't do it. He's a, he's a blue belt right now.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.220
Nice, nice. You ever been on the mat with him?

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.620
Not yet, but I plan on it.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.340
Should do it.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.140
What belt are you?

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:35.820
Black belt.

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:38.300
Sick. Do you want to go on the-

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:43.100
Yeah, right. You got the shit talking part of jiu-jitsu down. You just have to do the technique.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.660
Um, but like for that, like for instance, like, do you,

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.380
do you need a harsh mentor or a teacher or?

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.980
Yeah, but you like, you said it really beautifully. Like there's a, to me, I agree.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.300
There's a difference between sport and art.

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:01.820
Yeah.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:07.500
They overlap. There's, you know, for sure, but there's something about sport where like

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.460
perfection is actually like perfection. Perfection is really the thing you really want to get to.

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:15.580
The technical perfection with art, it feels like technical perfection is,

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:24.140
um, it's almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever something unique. So, um, but yeah,

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:29.980
with, with sport, I definitely, and one of the kind of athletes that wants to have like a

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:37.260
dictatorial coach, somebody that like helps me really push myself to the limit.

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:42.140
But you're the one that's kind of dictating how hard you're getting pushed in a way. Like

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:48.060
you're choosing your mentor. Like that whiplash video is like, he didn't ask for that, you know,

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.860
in a way he might've.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.380
Well, maybe, maybe subconsciously. I mean, there's, it's a movie.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.860
Next, you're going to tell me they're just actors. I mean,

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.660
and, but, you know, yeah, how do we choose things? You know, you don't always choose,

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:10.540
but you're kind of maybe subconsciously choose. And some of it, like some of the great Olympic

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:16.140
athletes I've interacted with, their parents for many years would force them to go to practice

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:19.980
until they discovered the beauty of the thing that they were doing. And then they loved it.

01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.380
Yeah.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:27.020
So like, at which point does, uh, something that looks like abuse become like a gift,

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:37.100
you know, it's weird. It's all very weird, but for you, support and space to discover the thing,

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.820
the voice, the music.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:45.180
That's my personal choice because I'm very familiar with the inner critic and I can bring

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.500
her out at any point. I don't need help with that. You know, so you do have.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:56.300
Yeah. She was on overdrive. That's why now I'm, I had to work on that so much.

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.540
Yeah. You have a really happy way about you right now. Thanks.

01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:04.860
The very sun. Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen?

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.740
Yeah, sure.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.860
A lot of songs of his, I listened to make me feel this melancholy feeling.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.860
It's not just Bruce Springsteen, but Bruce does a lot.

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:22.700
What is that about songs that arouse a kind of sad feeling or longing feeling

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:29.420
or feeling? What is that? What is that about us humans on the receiving end of the music?

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:38.220
Frequencies, each frequency does elicit a different kind of emotional response. That's,

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.660
that is real. You mean like on the physics aspect?

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:49.820
Yeah, yeah. The physical level. So there is that combined with the right kind of lyric

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.780
and the right kind of melody of the right kind of chord will elicit a very particular kind of

01:33:54.860 --> 01:34:01.580
emotion. And it is scientific. It can be analyzed. I don't particularly want to analyze it because

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:08.940
I don't want to approach things with that in advance. I don't want it to inform where I'm

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:17.100
going. I like the feeling to lead me naturally to where I'm writing. But yeah, there's a real

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:23.580
chemical element to that. And then also, like I was saying, like the lyric, what it means to you.

01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:30.860
Poetry is supposed to mean something to everybody, like different. It's not supposed to mean one

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:37.740
thing. Like you can't analyze and be like, this is what this poet meant. And like we were talking

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:43.340
about with Leonard earlier, it's like the broader you can leave a lyric, the better you can appeal

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:49.100
to people in so many different ways. And even to the songwriter, like I'll sing some of my songs

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:55.340
from five years ago and I'll be like, oh, I didn't even think that it could have meant that.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:00.220
But I guess it does. That's funny. I'll like just giggle on stage suddenly because a lyric

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:05.980
will hit me differently from a different new experience or something. Have you ever cried

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:12.540
listening to a song? Of course. Weep like a baby in a bathtub.

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:19.260
Which, who's a regular go-to then? Leonard. Yeah.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:24.060
Hallelujah is a song that makes, consistently makes me feel something.

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.420
It's holy. His work is holy. And if you were in his presence,

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:37.340
I guess there was a lot to that being.

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:42.700
What advice would you give to young folks on how to have a life they can be proud of?

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:49.900
Just tackle the demons as early as possible, whether it's through your art or through

01:35:49.900 --> 01:36:00.700
meditation or through whatever it means, diaries, whatever it is, just walk towards the things that

01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:13.020
are scary. Because if you don't, they'll just expand. They become bigger. If you avoid the

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:18.700
demons, they become bigger. What does that mean for you today? Are you still missing Jeff?

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:25.260
I'll always miss Jeff, but I don't feel like a piece of me is missing.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:33.900
And same with Leonard. It's that I did give them a piece of myself and maybe they gave me a piece

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:43.740
of them that I hold with me and I cherish, but it doesn't feel like I'm less than or they're less

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:57.260
than or anything's less than. Just you learn to appreciate the impermanence of everything in life,

01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:04.060
impermanence of everything except for consciousness, I guess you could say is

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:11.420
the only thing that is permanent. So everything else, you learn to appreciate that impermanence

01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:21.820
because the limit amount of time in this particular body, it's enticing, gives you a

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:26.540
time limit, which is cool. I like that. You've come to accept your own?

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.500
Yeah. It's cool that I'm like, okay, I've got maybe this amount of time, who knows?

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:38.540
But if I was, yeah, if I died today, I'd be really happy with my life. It's not like I'm like,

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:43.420
oh, I missed out on this and that. So you really want to make sure that every day

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:47.420
could be your last day and you're happy with that? I've always lived that way.

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:53.660
Yeah. I felt this way since I was in my early twenties. I'd be like, yeah, I could die today.

01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:02.140
Sure. I don't want to die. I have no reason to die. But if I did, I know that I put my everything,

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:07.900
all my effort and all my passion and all my love into whatever I've already done. So if my time's

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:13.740
up, then my time's up. What role does love play in this whole thing, in the human condition?

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:20.860
Well, love is everything. I mean, if you define love, if you're talking about love as in romantic

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:30.860
love or paternal or maternal love, or if you're talking about love as in an Eastern tradition,

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.500
like Vedanta, for instance, love is consciousness. Love is everything.

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300
That's the only permanent thing.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:42.700
Yeah. Or if you were to come from a Zen or like a Buddhist perspective,

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:48.860
they would say nothingness, like emptiness is versus fullness.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:54.620
Well, those guys are really obsessed with the whole suffering thing and letting go of it.

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:55.660
Yeah.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:05.660
Well, I was wondering if you would do me the honor of playing a song.

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.660
Do you want a suffering song or a suffering song?

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.700
I think I would love a suffering song.

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.500
Do you want to sound check and make sure I'm not?

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:20.700
Yeah.

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:28.780
Sound check. One, two. Yeah, it sounds really good.

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:31.180
This one's good. All right, count me off.

01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:40.780
Yeah. I don't know how to count somebody off. Where do I start? A nine or three, two, one.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.060
Yeah, you got it. One, two.

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:44.700
One, two.

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:59.580
I call out to the ocean

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:08.060
My tears fall into the sea

01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:16.860
For the valves that have been broken

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:24.780
Across the dunes of time repeatedly

01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:32.460
Like a knight in battered armor

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:40.460
I lay my sword upon the ground

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:48.460
Cause I can't keep fighting these same battles

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:54.140
More has been lost than has been found

01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:03.740
It's hard to feel things changing

01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:11.420
After all's been said and done

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:20.700
We spend our lives rearranging

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.700
Everything under the sun

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:36.700
I walk the same road to work each Monday

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.100
I walk the same road to work each Monday

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:49.580
Every step tears at my heel

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.980
I sleep not to dream but to forget on Sunday

01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:06.060
I spoke just turning with the wheel

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:15.660
It's hard to feel things changing

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:23.820
After all's been said and done

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:31.100
We spend our lives rearranging

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:39.500
Everything under the sun

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:49.100
Reaching for the sky, feet buried in the ground

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:57.180
Looking for some way out of the circle spinning round

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:07.180
My eyes on the horizon, seeking out the light

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:17.180
But don't let me be lost forever in the night

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:29.180
Cause it's hard to feel things changing

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:39.180
After all's been said and done

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:47.260
We spend our lives rearranging

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:55.260
Everything under the sun

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.260
Under the sun

01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:10.860
You're amazing. That was amazing, Tal. Thank you so much.

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.500
Try turning it to 11.

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:27.500
It's quite loud. Can you see if on the headphones it's like this, Tony?

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:28.860
Can you play something?

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:42.060
You're such a professional.

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.300
I should produce your next record.

01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:58.860
Please.

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:08.860
Love don't rescue me

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:14.860
I've got nowhere better I want to be

01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:22.860
I want to be held but not be holden

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:30.860
Stand in my ground with one eye open

01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:38.460
This fight doesn't quite add up

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:50.060
Love, I thought you were free

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:56.460
But now I'm on the hook for all you've given me

01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:04.060
Doesn't matter what I say or think or do

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:12.060
You see what you see with the lens you're looking through

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:24.060
This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:29.660
And it's killing me

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:35.660
Killing me

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:53.260
Love, I'm losing my voice

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:59.260
You led me to believe I had a choice

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:06.860
But let's pause, retract our claws

01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:14.860
You could take my side while I take yours

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:26.860
This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.460
And it's killing me

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:40.460
Killing me

01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:12.460
Love, come rescue me

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:20.460
I've got nowhere better I want to be

01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:32.060
This fight keeps me tied to the worst in me

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:38.060
And it's killing me

And now let me leave you with some words from Maya Angelou.

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:55.420

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.180
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
