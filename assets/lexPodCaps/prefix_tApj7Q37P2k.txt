00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
The following is a conversation with Ben Askren,

00:02.560 --> 00:06.480
wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant,

00:06.480 --> 00:08.800
opinionated, and fun personality

00:08.800 --> 00:10.400
in the world of martial arts.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.600
And yes, he occasionally likes to talk a little trash.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.940
Given his wild online antics and his boxing match

00:18.940 --> 00:22.340
with Jake Paul, some people may forget

00:22.340 --> 00:25.320
just how dominant he was in the sport of wrestling

00:25.320 --> 00:28.940
and in MMA for most of his career.

00:28.980 --> 00:32.900
In wrestling, he is a two-time NCAA Division I

00:32.900 --> 00:36.320
national champion and four-time finalist.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.580
In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years

00:39.580 --> 00:44.500
with a record of 19-0 before losing to Jorge Masvidal

00:44.500 --> 00:47.380
with a flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.420
He's also into cryptocurrency, disc golf,

00:50.420 --> 00:54.860
and is the co-host of Flow Wrestling Radio Live.

00:54.860 --> 00:57.180
This is the Alex Fridman Podcast.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.780

01:00.780 --> 01:04.980
And now, here's my conversation with Ben Askren.

01:06.460 --> 01:10.300
Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career,

01:10.300 --> 01:13.920
your MMA career, let me ask you, I have to ask you,

01:13.920 --> 01:15.620
what did you think about the Jake Paul

01:15.620 --> 01:17.360
versus Tyron Woodley fight?

01:19.100 --> 01:20.820
Well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously biased.

01:20.820 --> 01:22.080
I thought Tyron won.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.300
I had five rounds of three.

01:25.340 --> 01:27.980
And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.860
I thought he was more effective with the striking

01:29.860 --> 01:32.600
and he was more aggressive and Jake had more volume.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.020
But that was the only thing I would give him.

01:36.020 --> 01:38.140
And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.160
They thought he landed more, significantly more punches.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.820
I just didn't think it really did any damage.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.460
It was a split decision.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.220
Split decision, yeah.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.260
Were you surprised?

01:49.740 --> 01:50.580
Well, it was the thing.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.420
So the thing I said when I went in to fight him,

01:52.420 --> 01:54.860
I said, maybe he's good, maybe he's not.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.860
We really have no idea to this point, you know?

01:57.860 --> 02:02.060
And so I knew Tyron was a lot better at boxing than I was.

02:02.060 --> 02:04.540
And so I thought, okay, Tyron is,

02:04.540 --> 02:08.060
I think it's a good likelihood that Tyron beats him up.

02:08.060 --> 02:10.520
But there's a chance that Jake's kind of good at this.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.820
And I think that's kind of what played out is

02:12.820 --> 02:13.660
he's kind of good at it.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.060
Even if you saw it the way I saw it,

02:15.060 --> 02:16.980
he still was impressive in his showing

02:16.980 --> 02:19.380
and he's obviously put a lot of time into it.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.500
So he's not bad, we'll say that much, you know?

02:23.500 --> 02:24.740
But isn't it surprising to you

02:24.740 --> 02:29.740
that like a elite level athlete, combat athlete,

02:30.080 --> 02:33.060
lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously

02:33.060 --> 02:35.380
but is nevertheless not elite level?

02:36.780 --> 02:40.420
Hmm, but I think boxing's a really specific rule set.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.940
So I'll speak about Tyron, not myself.

02:41.940 --> 02:43.780
Tyron had good striking,

02:43.780 --> 02:47.540
but obviously it was his first boxing match ever.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.260
And within mixed martial arts,

02:49.260 --> 02:51.620
you have the fear of the takedown

02:51.620 --> 02:52.460
and the fear of the kick

02:52.460 --> 02:54.980
and fear of other things to go along with the punching.

02:54.980 --> 02:57.580
And so if you look at Tyron throughout his MMA career,

02:57.580 --> 03:00.300
lots of times what set up his punches

03:00.300 --> 03:02.420
were like level change fakes.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.060
At a takedown, they dropped, boom,

03:04.060 --> 03:05.940
and then something comes over the top, right?

03:05.940 --> 03:07.780
So there's many more elements to worry about

03:07.780 --> 03:09.140
in mixed martial arts versus boxing.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.460
There's only one.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.120
It was his first fight.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.820
Yes, I thought Tyron was gonna win.

03:13.820 --> 03:14.720
I thought it was gonna happen.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.780
But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident that Jake's,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.340
he's not bad at boxing.

03:19.340 --> 03:20.500
He's pretty solid, you know?

03:20.540 --> 03:23.380
He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.500
Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins?

03:26.500 --> 03:27.460
I guess Tyron?

03:27.460 --> 03:28.300
I guess Tyron.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.060
They fight again and again and again, like iterative.

03:32.060 --> 03:35.260
Yeah, so I mean, part of the thing is,

03:35.260 --> 03:37.440
okay, so Jake's corner said you need a knockout

03:37.440 --> 03:38.600
going into the eighth round, right?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.740
So I think they thought,

03:40.740 --> 03:41.900
maybe they're trying to motivate him,

03:41.900 --> 03:43.060
but I don't see it that way

03:43.060 --> 03:45.980
because if they were actually thought that he was winning,

03:45.980 --> 03:47.940
why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk

03:47.940 --> 03:49.740
when Tyron has clearly his knockout power, right?

03:49.740 --> 03:51.700
It's a really stupid coaching philosophy

03:51.700 --> 03:53.060
if that's what you're thinking.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.060
So you obviously are thinking,

03:54.060 --> 03:57.260
hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.220
And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning

04:00.220 --> 04:02.660
and didn't have the urgency necessary.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.900
And so I think there's a chance he turns it up a lot.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.100
Man, I would wanna watch him again before I...

04:10.100 --> 04:12.700
So okay, I have this problem with my personality.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.660
Here's my personality, Lex.

04:14.660 --> 04:16.140
I have an issue with not being able

04:16.140 --> 04:17.660
to give really exact answers.

04:17.660 --> 04:18.780
So I hate giving you an answer

04:18.780 --> 04:22.360
that I don't feel like is 100% calculated.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.820
So I would like to see them go once more

04:24.820 --> 04:26.700
because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron...

04:26.700 --> 04:27.940
Because if Tyron can turn up the pace

04:27.940 --> 04:29.300
and Jake can't handle it,

04:29.300 --> 04:32.780
then I think it's an eight, one, or nine, two, right?

04:32.780 --> 04:34.460
If it goes the exact same way

04:34.460 --> 04:36.140
and maybe Tyron wins a close split decision,

04:36.140 --> 04:37.620
I'm saying, oh, it's probably gonna be close

04:37.620 --> 04:38.460
every single time.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.100
We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.980
So it's like, I feel like out of one match,

04:44.980 --> 04:46.220
it's not totally indicative

04:46.220 --> 04:47.580
of what the future is gonna look like.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.380
But I feel like Tyron would get a knockout

04:50.380 --> 04:52.980
and then you would still be in the same place,

04:52.980 --> 04:56.980
like not knowing what to predict.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.980
Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.300
Looking back, you had a little bit of time now.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.980
How would you analyze that fight?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.940
Well, I mean, the fight specifically,

05:09.940 --> 05:11.740
I got cracked with an overhand right,

05:11.740 --> 05:13.580
so I mean, it kind of sucks.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.980
I would say, you know, and this is where everyone's like,

05:16.980 --> 05:18.660
I really don't care.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.380
And everyone's like,

05:20.380 --> 05:21.860
why would you turn to your reputation?

05:21.860 --> 05:23.660
It's like, well, I wanted to do it.

05:23.660 --> 05:26.340
I had enjoyable time training and in the buildup.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.700
Obviously I wasn't skillful enough to get the win.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.940
But even despite the fact that I know

05:31.940 --> 05:33.500
what's gonna happen,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.620
if someone asked me to do it again,

05:34.620 --> 05:36.780
I probably would have done it again, you know?

05:36.780 --> 05:38.620
And so the way I was thinking about

05:38.620 --> 05:40.900
when I was deciding whether to do it or not,

05:40.900 --> 05:41.980
because I got the offer.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.540
It's like, okay, is this money,

05:43.540 --> 05:45.180
it can change my life.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.020
Yeah, it could, right?

05:46.020 --> 05:48.340
It's not gonna double my net worth,

05:48.340 --> 05:50.900
but it's gonna add significantly and make my life easier.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.340
Number two is like, when I was in high school,

05:52.340 --> 05:54.180
we used to do boxing matches for free,

05:54.180 --> 05:55.180
just because we thought it was fun.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.100
We didn't have something going on Friday night.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.460
Me and my buddies would get together

05:58.460 --> 05:59.900
and we had some boxing, it was like basically,

05:59.900 --> 06:01.780
and we'd punch each other in the head.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.380
So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable,

06:03.380 --> 06:05.300
and not gonna pay me a whole bunch of money.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.380
Yeah, sure, I'll do it.

06:07.380 --> 06:10.500
Would you, do you think if you got the rematch,

06:10.500 --> 06:12.380
if you did the rematch, would you,

06:12.380 --> 06:13.700
what are the odds you win?

06:13.700 --> 06:14.540
Okay, let's see.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.380
I'm probably not very good.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.740
I think he's pretty good actually, and I'm not very good.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.060
Now he's probably at a low point for me,

06:20.060 --> 06:22.060
because, so when I started training for that,

06:22.060 --> 06:24.140
I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been.

06:24.140 --> 06:26.620
I came off my hip surgery, I literally,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.860
like when I said yes, like I'll do it,

06:29.860 --> 06:31.340
like I had literally started working out

06:31.340 --> 06:33.700
like the week before for the first time in my,

06:33.700 --> 06:35.260
you know, since the surgery,

06:35.260 --> 06:37.180
because I wasn't able to do anything.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.860
So could I perform better?

06:39.860 --> 06:41.940
Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron,

06:41.940 --> 06:44.660
like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?

06:44.660 --> 06:48.020
Probably not, but I don't think I can beat Tyron.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.580
So, in boxing, correct, in boxing, yeah.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.300
So my chances of beating him, you know,

06:52.300 --> 06:55.260
and watching that card, it's like, damn,

06:55.260 --> 06:58.140
like kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks,

06:58.140 --> 06:58.980
who I know can beat.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.820
That's what would be fun, you know,

07:00.820 --> 07:03.980
cause like the training, the preparation was fun,

07:03.980 --> 07:07.500
but then obviously I got my butt kicked, that sucked.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.860
You know, can I swear on this podcast?

07:08.860 --> 07:09.700
Yeah, of course.

07:10.540 --> 07:11.780
I was gonna drop an F-bomb, but I wasn't quite sure, so.

07:11.780 --> 07:14.100
Okay, I think that sucked is a swear.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.820
You could drop all of the F-bombs you want.

07:16.820 --> 07:20.460
So preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared

07:20.460 --> 07:25.340
for that fight or the Jordan Burroughs exhibition?

07:27.780 --> 07:31.460
I mean, like how did you approach it mentally, you know?

07:31.460 --> 07:33.460
Well, the Burroughs thing, I obviously, it's okay.

07:33.460 --> 07:36.300
So when I retired the first time in 2017,

07:36.300 --> 07:39.380
Burroughs was the only current, like we'll say,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.180
really elite level wrestler that I'd never trained with.

07:42.180 --> 07:43.980
I was really good friends with Nebraska's

07:43.980 --> 07:45.540
head of the coach, still am.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.540
And I said, hey, I just want, I'm gonna pay my own way.

07:47.540 --> 07:48.380
I want to come down and train with Jordan,

07:48.380 --> 07:50.140
cause I want to see what it feels like.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.620
You know, I want to get in there and mix it up.

07:51.620 --> 07:54.100
I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.300
I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.460
And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018

08:00.460 --> 08:02.220
and I spent four days training with Jordan.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.660
It was a really good time.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.420
It gave me some great insight into how he thinks

08:06.420 --> 08:09.100
and you know, what a great champion he is.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.580
What was the like training with him?

08:10.580 --> 08:12.140
Like what, can you give some insights?

08:12.140 --> 08:12.980
Yeah, of course.

08:12.980 --> 08:17.980
Like what the, like how hard is the live training?

08:18.540 --> 08:19.500
Is it more drilling?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.340
Is it technical?

08:20.340 --> 08:23.860
Like how does his, it seems like his style

08:23.860 --> 08:25.380
is very different than yours.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.980
So how does that match up in the room

08:26.980 --> 08:29.260
in terms of like what you learn from each other,

08:29.260 --> 08:30.100
that kind of thing.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.740
We only went full live for one,

08:31.740 --> 08:33.540
I think it was like a 12 or 15 minute go

08:33.540 --> 08:35.500
where we would just go wrestle.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.700
We did a bunch of simulated live,

08:39.540 --> 08:40.380
but obviously he had,

08:40.380 --> 08:41.940
so I was a senior in college

08:41.940 --> 08:43.340
and he was a freshman in Nebraska

08:43.340 --> 08:45.060
and so our teams had dueled each other.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.460
He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.100
But he had followed my career.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.980
And so when I went in there, it was like,

08:51.980 --> 08:54.340
hey, I know you're really good at this position.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.340
What about this position?

08:55.340 --> 08:56.180
What are you trying to do?

08:56.180 --> 08:57.740
How exactly does it work?

08:57.740 --> 09:00.140
And then let's wrestle there, you know?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.700
And then, hey, what about this position?

09:01.700 --> 09:05.500
And so, you know, we would spend 30 to 40 minutes

09:05.500 --> 09:07.580
talking about that position.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.980
On the ground or?

09:08.980 --> 09:10.860
It was like, one was a chest wrap,

09:10.860 --> 09:12.820
one was a headlock, one was,

09:12.820 --> 09:13.780
I don't even know, it's called,

09:13.780 --> 09:15.980
we call it the lightning dump, but it's a-

09:15.980 --> 09:16.980
The lightning dump?

09:16.980 --> 09:19.340
Yeah, my buddy's name was Lightning Luke Smith

09:19.340 --> 09:21.340
in high school and he was the first person I saw do it.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.300
So usually when I see someone do something,

09:23.300 --> 09:24.940
then I name that move after them.

09:24.940 --> 09:25.780
Got it.

09:26.940 --> 09:27.780
I know, right?

09:27.780 --> 09:28.600
Great name.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.440
It's a good name.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.060
Yeah, but so what I said with that is like,

09:32.060 --> 09:33.580
he was still trying to be the best in the world.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.060
I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burrows

09:35.060 --> 09:36.260
because I enjoy wrestling.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.220
Is like someone who, at that point,

09:40.220 --> 09:42.260
when he has five world titles at that,

09:42.260 --> 09:44.380
four or five at that point, a lot.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.780
And so I used to tell my high school kids is like,

09:45.780 --> 09:48.020
hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world,

09:48.020 --> 09:49.900
who's bringing someone in and saying,

09:49.900 --> 09:50.740
how do I do this?

09:50.740 --> 09:51.580
How do I do that?

09:51.580 --> 09:52.400
What about this?

09:52.400 --> 09:53.240
What about that?

09:53.240 --> 09:55.700
And so the level of inquisitiveness,

09:55.700 --> 09:58.420
that's a hard word, inquisitiveness he has,

09:58.420 --> 09:59.480
is really impressive.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.700
And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did

10:01.700 --> 10:04.220
because he's figuring out all these little situations.

10:04.220 --> 10:05.860
And that's honestly one of the biggest things

10:05.940 --> 10:07.780
that I think wrestlers,

10:07.780 --> 10:09.940
a lot of wrestlers fail to do as they get older.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.760
Even when they get to early college age,

10:11.760 --> 10:13.020
they say, this is my style.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.180
This is what I do.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.300
I'm gonna lift and work out hard.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.300
And I'm not gonna add anything to my game.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.620
Whereas you've seen many progressions

10:21.620 --> 10:22.460
in Jordan Burrows' game.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.500
He just made his 10th world team.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.580
And if you have a really keen eye,

10:27.580 --> 10:30.260
you've been able to watch him change.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.260
I've been watching him since 2007.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.220
He's changed so much

10:34.220 --> 10:36.660
and obviously still maintained a world-class level

10:36.660 --> 10:37.820
almost the entire time.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.940
When you say change, like what change?

10:40.940 --> 10:42.980
Because he's got that double leg.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.540
But there's no greater double leg anymore.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.380
What's that?

10:45.380 --> 10:46.220
He hit his double leg for the first time

10:46.220 --> 10:48.820
because Alex Deirdre, he hadn't hit it in years.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.260
Yeah, so that's like, when people think about Jordan Burrows,

10:51.260 --> 10:52.300
they think about the double leg.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.300
Because in his early years,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.780
fire, he had a great double leg, right?

10:55.780 --> 10:58.060
And so in those years, I would say,

10:59.020 --> 11:01.580
the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows' double leg

11:01.580 --> 11:04.140
wasn't his level of explosiveness.

11:04.980 --> 11:05.860
It was his level of persistence.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.340
He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.060
And a lot of times it would be from fun, creative angles

11:11.060 --> 11:13.380
and out of scramble, boop, obviously he's on you, you know?

11:13.380 --> 11:15.540
And he was just super persistent with it.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.500
And I think that was probably the key.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.260
And then you saw, when he came out

11:20.260 --> 11:22.100
to win the first world championship in 2011,

11:22.100 --> 11:24.180
it was kind of that type of mentality.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.380
And then shortly after then,

11:25.380 --> 11:26.980
obviously everyone was starting to lower their stance,

11:26.980 --> 11:28.980
getting lower, and he developed a really good, like,

11:28.980 --> 11:30.460
mantis go behind series

11:30.460 --> 11:32.380
where he would go one way, the other way.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.740
Then he started developing a really good, like,

11:33.740 --> 11:36.620
low single ankle pick type thing, you know?

11:36.620 --> 11:39.740
And then his hand fighting got really tremendous,

11:39.740 --> 11:43.180
like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.940
And now I just commented at the 21 trials, like,

11:45.940 --> 11:48.140
a few of the defensive sequences he got into was like,

11:48.140 --> 11:50.780
holy shit, like, just not from an athletic standpoint,

11:50.780 --> 11:51.900
from a technical standpoint,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.860
the things he were doing were just tremendous.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.900
So I've seen him as someone, like,

11:55.900 --> 11:58.020
who's continued to reinvent themselves

11:58.020 --> 12:00.780
over the course of the last 10, 12 years.

12:00.780 --> 12:04.580
Especially as a junior and senior in college,

12:04.580 --> 12:06.660
you were exceptionally dominant.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.580
If you were to face him at both of your peaks

12:09.580 --> 12:13.180
of NCAA wrestling, could you beat him?

12:13.180 --> 12:16.900
And if you can beat him, well, of course you can beat him.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.660
How do you solve the Jordan Boros problem?

12:20.660 --> 12:23.220
Well, so from a folk-style wrestling standpoint.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.220
Folk-style, yes. Folk-style.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.180
So, you know, he had some competitive matches

12:27.180 --> 12:28.060
as junior and senior year.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.420
He had a 2-1 win over, or maybe a 3-2,

12:30.940 --> 12:32.380
over Michael Chandler, who was my teammate,

12:32.380 --> 12:33.780
who's fighting in the UFC now.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.740
He had a 2-1 win over Tyler Caldwell.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.460
So I think you can glean some insight into that.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.820
You know, he got ridden,

12:40.820 --> 12:42.620
he got so mad about this up on a podcast.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.020
So during Corona, we had to make up

12:44.020 --> 12:45.380
all kinds of bullshit to talk about.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.220
Yeah.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.660
And we were doing, like, the last 10 years,

12:47.660 --> 12:49.700
best 165s, and I said,

12:49.700 --> 12:51.580
Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.420
Oh, wow.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.140
He got so mad, he wanted to come on the podcast the next day,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.860
so hopefully he doesn't listen to this.

12:55.860 --> 12:56.860
Fuck you, Ben.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.100
You know?

12:58.100 --> 12:58.940
But, you know.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.020
When was this?

13:00.020 --> 13:00.860
This is during Corona.

13:00.860 --> 13:01.940
Corona, last year.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.780
He got mad.

13:02.780 --> 13:03.620
We were talking about...

13:03.620 --> 13:04.460
Before the trials.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.300
Yeah, correct, yeah.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.220
So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus,

13:09.220 --> 13:11.020
and that was his junior year, not his senior year.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.060
Sure, right, but it's close.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.660
So I think there's some things there.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.980
I think the interesting thing would be,

13:16.980 --> 13:19.220
if I would have stuck around, right,

13:19.220 --> 13:22.140
so I chose to go into mixed martial arts after 2008,

13:22.140 --> 13:23.820
I would have been 74, and he would have been 74,

13:23.820 --> 13:24.740
so we would have had to wrestle.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.260
And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burrows puzzle

13:27.260 --> 13:29.180
is a lot more difficult to solve

13:29.180 --> 13:31.060
than the folk style Jordan Burrows puzzle,

13:31.060 --> 13:33.540
and I think he would acknowledge

13:33.540 --> 13:35.580
that he's much better at freestyle

13:35.580 --> 13:37.180
than he was at folk style.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.180
You know, although he was very good, he's better.

13:39.180 --> 13:42.980
Does his, like, raw speed, explosiveness,

13:42.980 --> 13:44.340
present a problem to you?

13:44.340 --> 13:46.060
Well, so, he was never...

13:46.060 --> 13:48.500
I mean, he didn't really excel on the mat

13:48.500 --> 13:49.780
in kind of either style.

13:49.780 --> 13:53.140
In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,

13:53.140 --> 13:55.780
but in folk style, like, in his entire college career,

13:55.860 --> 13:59.020
I think he has, like, 10 pins, which is almost nothing,

13:59.020 --> 14:03.140
you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.460
He was good enough on most people to get off bottom

14:05.460 --> 14:07.700
without it being an issue, but it wasn't like,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.460
oh, my gosh, this is an area where we really have

14:09.460 --> 14:11.740
to be careful, there's a lot of things here.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.860
You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.340
Whereas in freestyle, he...

14:16.340 --> 14:18.220
I don't wanna say never, but the amount of times

14:18.220 --> 14:21.180
he gets turned is incredibly rare, very, very rare,

14:21.180 --> 14:22.940
and he does have a lace transition,

14:22.940 --> 14:24.060
so he gets a lot of points there.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.660
So, and obviously freestyle is...

14:27.660 --> 14:30.220
It can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?

14:30.220 --> 14:32.780
Where we're only doing takedowns, so, yeah.

14:32.780 --> 14:37.220
Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials,

14:37.220 --> 14:38.900
to Kyle Dake?

14:38.900 --> 14:41.180
Oh, Kyle's so, so he's so good, right?

14:41.180 --> 14:44.460
I mean, I think his performance at the Olympics was,

14:45.580 --> 14:47.700
well, his loss in the Olympics was shocking to,

14:47.700 --> 14:50.140
I mean, we never see that happen to Kyle Dake, you know?

14:50.140 --> 14:53.620
He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.300
and obviously he was on the losing side for a while,

14:55.300 --> 14:56.900
and now he's on the winning side.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.740
But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip,

15:00.740 --> 15:03.740
and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like

15:03.740 --> 15:04.740
it's not a coin flip.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.740
Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake is gonna win

15:07.740 --> 15:10.260
that match significantly more times than he isn't,

15:10.260 --> 15:11.460
is what it feels like.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.300
Yeah, I forgot which trials it was.

15:14.300 --> 15:19.300
Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?

15:19.420 --> 15:23.580
Like, he, you saw inklings of, like,

15:24.580 --> 15:27.060
oh, wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.

15:27.060 --> 15:31.900
Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw,

15:31.900 --> 15:35.100
but then he lost one of the matches decisively,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.820
and then he was hurt in 14,

15:37.820 --> 15:41.260
and in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms.

15:41.260 --> 15:45.140
So actually in 16, at the trials we had,

15:45.140 --> 15:46.500
so Jake Herbert was number one seed.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.020
He was former, as Guy Russell,

15:48.020 --> 15:50.220
I was a former world silver medalist.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.700
So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet,

15:52.700 --> 15:54.780
who is now a world champion, Olympic champion.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.420
You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,

15:56.420 --> 15:59.020
who was a two-time world champion now,

15:59.020 --> 16:00.460
and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket,

16:00.460 --> 16:01.740
who had not made any teams yet,

16:01.740 --> 16:03.900
but is now, what, a four-time world medalist,

16:03.900 --> 16:05.020
two-time world champion.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.460
So, and then obviously, Jaden came out on top of that,

16:07.460 --> 16:10.660
won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.

16:10.660 --> 16:14.020
So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16,

16:14.020 --> 16:17.440
and Kyle's contention the whole time,

16:18.380 --> 16:19.380
and they argued about this.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.300
So I actually did a little bit of backstabbing.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.300
It's not backstabbing.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.460
And both of them or just one of them?

16:23.460 --> 16:24.460
I didn't tell any of them.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.860
Okay, so Jordan got mad.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.860
We talked about this fake match during Corona, right?

16:28.860 --> 16:30.380
We had to make up something to talk about.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.220
Yeah, of course.

16:31.220 --> 16:32.380
There's obviously no matches.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.340
So we talked about this fake match.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.060
Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?

16:36.060 --> 16:37.580
Listen, here's what I said.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.620
Kyle Dake's four-time NCAA champion.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.260
Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.980
I said, Kyle Dake wins two-one

16:43.980 --> 16:45.580
on a minute and six ride time,

16:45.580 --> 16:47.740
which, I mean, is literally, we're talking

16:47.740 --> 16:50.220
as close as it gets, as close as it gets

16:50.260 --> 16:52.580
for Kyle Dake, who's a four-time NCAA champion.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.380
I'm sorry, are we talking?

16:54.380 --> 16:55.380
Over Jordan Burrows.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.460
Over Jordan Burrows.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.300
In a Folk Style match.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.380
In a Folk Style match.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.220
Hypothetically.

16:59.220 --> 17:00.340
Completely hypothetical.

17:00.340 --> 17:01.500
Now or in college?

17:01.500 --> 17:02.420
In college.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.700
Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.980
So completely hypothetical.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.340
And so Jordan called in.

17:08.340 --> 17:11.780
He was all pissed at me for picking Kyle Dake.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.700
He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.980
So I said, F that, that's dumb.

17:16.980 --> 17:17.860
We had to pick a winner.

17:17.860 --> 17:19.100
We had to do something hypothetical.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.580
So then I called Kyle Dake and I said,

17:20.580 --> 17:22.300
Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case

17:22.300 --> 17:23.260
in the morning.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.180
If he's gonna do that,

17:24.180 --> 17:26.380
why don't you come in and argue your case?

17:26.380 --> 17:29.740
So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.500
So they both show up and they went at it.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.940
But one of the contentions Kyle had for years,

17:34.940 --> 17:36.340
and there's still this rule,

17:36.340 --> 17:38.900
if you win a world-level medal,

17:38.900 --> 17:42.660
the following year, you sit out until the very end

17:42.660 --> 17:44.740
of the American trials.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.700
And they do a best two or three.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.900
So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,

17:49.900 --> 17:53.260
he had to come through a tournament on Saturday,

17:53.260 --> 17:54.620
probably three matches.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.900
And then on Sunday,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.220
he would wrestle Jordan in the best two out of three.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.380
So his contention was,

17:59.380 --> 18:01.260
I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage

18:01.260 --> 18:02.780
because I have to compete on Saturday.

18:02.780 --> 18:03.860
And then competing on,

18:03.860 --> 18:05.580
it's a fair argument, it really is.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.500
But I also see USA Wrestling's point is like,

18:08.500 --> 18:10.100
if someone wins a world medal,

18:10.100 --> 18:11.060
we're gonna reward them

18:11.060 --> 18:13.540
because we want that person on the team again.

18:13.580 --> 18:16.940
It's crazy though that you're like Kyle Dake had to wrestle

18:16.940 --> 18:19.300
because he's not wrestling bums in that division.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.140
Not bums, yeah.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.340
And yeah, I don't know.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.660
I don't know how wrestlers do it.

18:23.660 --> 18:28.380
Because you have to go to war like three matches

18:28.380 --> 18:30.460
and then face Jordan Barrows.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.260
Especially a few of those years with,

18:32.260 --> 18:34.700
Dake had the name Andrew Howe,

18:34.700 --> 18:36.820
but those were really competitive matches.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.660
David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.380
Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Dieringer.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.180
So he had some really competitive matches

18:42.180 --> 18:44.740
before he ever got to Jordan Barrows.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.220
So I never answered your initial question was,

18:47.220 --> 18:48.060
how did I feel?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.060
So the Jordan Barrows match,

18:50.060 --> 18:52.420
I was not in wrestling shape at all.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.700
Meaning wrestling's heavily,

18:53.700 --> 18:54.620
especially in neutral positions,

18:54.620 --> 18:56.580
heavily dependent on timing and other things.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.540
I was wrestling very, very minimally

18:58.540 --> 19:00.740
because I started fighting again.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.860
So like my athletic shape was great,

19:03.860 --> 19:06.180
but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.580
So I think they were actually trying to do

19:09.580 --> 19:12.220
Barrows-Dake at the Beat the Streets.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.820
It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.660
In New York?

19:15.660 --> 19:16.740
In New York City.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.140
They usually raise like a million dollars.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.620
They started all these programs in New York City to get,

19:20.620 --> 19:22.620
which I really wonder what they're doing with the money now

19:22.620 --> 19:24.060
because they probably can't have the kids wrestling

19:24.060 --> 19:25.820
because New York's crazy.

19:25.820 --> 19:26.660
Anyways.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.660
I think New York figures out a way

19:27.660 --> 19:28.780
what to do with the money.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.700
Hence, Michael Maus complaining

19:30.700 --> 19:32.260
that they're corrupt and all that.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.220
But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization,

19:34.220 --> 19:35.580
who then starts the clubs in New York.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.700
So I don't know what to do with the money.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.620
Anyways, so I was called like, I don't know,

19:39.620 --> 19:41.740
two weeks before the event and said,

19:41.740 --> 19:44.820
hey, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Barrows.

19:44.820 --> 19:45.820
It fell out.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.300
Would you wrestle him?

19:48.300 --> 19:50.060
I said, yeah, sure, why not?

19:50.060 --> 19:53.060
And it's like, listen, I trained with him

19:53.060 --> 19:55.500
for four days the year before.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.500
I had a pretty good idea how the match was gonna go.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.220
Wasn't gonna go so well for me.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.980
But it's like, okay, you're missing a main event.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.660
I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life,

20:03.660 --> 20:05.140
I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.900
I can help you guys raise a bunch of money

20:06.900 --> 20:08.300
for Beat the Streets.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.020
My goal is, I thought I could get one takedown

20:11.020 --> 20:13.900
or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.540
I didn't get there.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.700
He went kind of hard.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.740
He went hard, yeah, that asshole didn't give me a point.

20:18.740 --> 20:19.580
Yeah, that.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.740
I said, this is bullshit, Jordan.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.700
I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.500
You're fucking going too hard right now.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.500
I'm not a wrestler anymore, I'm a fighter.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.700
I'm coming in here, so.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.220
Yeah, so I had a really good idea.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.540
I mean, we wrestled together.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.460
I think, and he'll probably get mad,

20:34.060 --> 20:36.980
I think in the live go, we did like the 12 or 15 minutes.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.340
I think I actually scored a takedown in that, I believe.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.900
Maybe, or maybe it was a turn.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.580
He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.860
Yeah, so I knew what was gonna happen.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.900
I knew what the outcome was gonna be.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.980
I knew I could, I was hoping to stay competitive

20:49.980 --> 20:53.740
and maybe lose like 10-2 or something, like, yeah.

20:53.740 --> 20:56.500
Well, let's walk back, because I think

20:56.500 --> 20:58.300
I originally brought it up in terms of

20:58.300 --> 21:01.540
how prepared were you against Jake Paul

21:01.580 --> 21:03.540
versus Jordan Borrows?

21:03.540 --> 21:07.380
So did you prepare for Jake, cardio-wise?

21:07.380 --> 21:09.580
Yeah, I worked hard, yeah, I did.

21:09.580 --> 21:13.420
But it was, I told you, I started training for my,

21:13.420 --> 21:15.780
I mean, once I had my hip surgery,

21:15.780 --> 21:18.060
they said, you know, for the first six weeks,

21:18.060 --> 21:19.700
you can't even walk.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.940
And it was hard for me to listen to him,

21:20.940 --> 21:23.620
because by week four, four and a half, five,

21:23.620 --> 21:25.340
I was feeling pretty good, I wanna get rid of my crutches.

21:25.340 --> 21:26.580
But I'm like, you know what,

21:26.580 --> 21:28.540
this is for the rest of my life.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.260
And if you get the, so if you get the real hip replacement,

21:31.260 --> 21:33.260
there's no wrestling, there's no nothing, right?

21:33.260 --> 21:34.260
So that's the next step.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.980
So, okay, I'm gonna take this seriously.

21:35.980 --> 21:37.620
So I do my crunch for the six weeks.

21:37.620 --> 21:41.820
The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing,

21:41.820 --> 21:43.340
can't necessarily do anything, you know?

21:43.340 --> 21:45.460
So then I get done with the three months,

21:45.460 --> 21:46.940
which is like January.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.100
And I'm like, okay, I should start working out.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.460
So I started riding a bike a little bit.

21:50.460 --> 21:53.300
And then, okay, now I'm fat, I'm fucking fat,

21:53.300 --> 21:54.180
I'm gonna get in better shape,

21:54.180 --> 21:55.060
because I haven't been able to do anything.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.940
So I'm actually start working out.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.420
And then that happened, right?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.380
So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months

22:01.380 --> 22:03.980
and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.

22:03.980 --> 22:08.820
And, you know, I knew I wasn't gonna be a full-time boxer.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.420
So it's like, how do I put a boxing camp together?

22:11.420 --> 22:14.420
So I found, you know, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes,

22:14.420 --> 22:18.220
he came up and kind of lived with me-ish kind of thing

22:18.220 --> 22:19.940
for three months.

22:19.940 --> 22:23.100
I found a couple of this guy, K9, out of Michigan.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.540
He came over three weeks, he was great.

22:25.540 --> 22:26.980
I went to Freddie Roach for a week.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.860
So I kind of like, you know,

22:28.860 --> 22:31.020
try to get as many good ideas as I could.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.220
And my thought was like, okay, well, if this dude sucks,

22:34.220 --> 22:36.620
I can just be tough and, you know, block a few punches,

22:36.620 --> 22:38.260
get him tired and then beat him up.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.580
If he's good, that's probably not much I'm gonna do

22:40.580 --> 22:41.540
about in the next three months,

22:41.540 --> 22:44.220
because I was never good at boxing in the first place.

22:44.220 --> 22:47.460
All of my standup in mixed martial arts was predicated on,

22:47.460 --> 22:49.380
how do I get through the two or three punches

22:49.380 --> 22:50.340
that are gonna come at me

22:50.340 --> 22:52.380
in the time I need to get ahold of them?

22:52.380 --> 22:54.940
You know, you only have to make two or three of them miss

22:54.940 --> 22:57.820
and then boom, you're on top of them, at least for me.

22:57.820 --> 22:59.420
That was all my striking was predicated on.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.540
It wasn't about, hey, I'm gonna do damage on the feet

23:01.540 --> 23:02.700
in order to make something else happen.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.660
It was like, how do I clear this barrier, get ahold of you?

23:06.660 --> 23:08.540
And if you, I actually did the math one time.

23:08.540 --> 23:09.860
I think I got a takedown.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.180
If you include the knockout round against Masvidal,

23:14.180 --> 23:16.140
I got a takedown in every round except two.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.340
So it was like 53 out of 55 rounds.

23:18.340 --> 23:19.940
In MMA, I got a takedown.

23:19.940 --> 23:20.780
Wow.

23:20.780 --> 23:21.620
Somewhere in there.

23:21.620 --> 23:24.380
Okay, so you're hunting the takedown once.

23:24.860 --> 23:28.460
Once you get your hands on them, you get the takedown.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.340
Yeah.

23:29.340 --> 23:32.940
Okay, but the incredible thing about you,

23:32.940 --> 23:37.940
I just recently spent a couple of days with Jimmy Pedro

23:37.940 --> 23:42.940
and he talked about his guys and just champions in general

23:43.260 --> 23:46.580
hating to lose more than they love winning.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.060
And the way you talked about losing,

23:49.060 --> 23:51.180
you lost very few times in your career.

23:51.180 --> 23:56.180
Like later, you were dominating both wrestling and MMA,

23:56.460 --> 24:00.060
but the way you took these losses against people that are,

24:00.060 --> 24:03.100
I don't know, below elite level.

24:03.100 --> 24:03.940
It's fair.

24:03.940 --> 24:07.940
I was going to get pissy, but it's completely fair.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.140
I thought he was a bum too.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.500
No, that's not what I meant, I'm in trouble.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.740
It's okay, no, it's good.

24:12.740 --> 24:15.100
No, no, but like, what,

24:15.100 --> 24:17.140
can you explain the psychology behind that?

24:17.140 --> 24:21.100
Like the, what, is there a system behind this?

24:21.100 --> 24:22.620
Is there a philosophy behind this?

24:22.620 --> 24:26.220
Well, so I wasn't very good in the beginning.

24:26.220 --> 24:27.820
And I think that's where it all starts from.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.980
So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13.

24:30.980 --> 24:32.420
I started at five.

24:32.420 --> 24:35.620
I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.180
Didn't really get good till 13.

24:37.180 --> 24:38.260
It's still at 13.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.140
I'm, it's not like I'm great.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.340
I'm getting better, right?

24:41.340 --> 24:42.860
I'm pretty good.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.180
So I actually, I'm actually,

24:44.180 --> 24:46.180
I have writing this book on sports psych,

24:46.180 --> 24:47.420
but this, it's, I got, well,

24:47.420 --> 24:49.860
I got someone to write it for me kind of thing

24:49.860 --> 24:51.540
because I've had this philosophy for years

24:51.540 --> 24:53.020
that there's, there has to be this balance

24:53.020 --> 24:54.260
between two things, right?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.580
So on the one hand, in this category,

24:56.580 --> 24:59.140
on the one hand, you have hating to lose.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.100
A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.020
But on this other hand,

25:03.020 --> 25:07.940
you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?

25:07.940 --> 25:08.860
Because if you don't have that,

25:08.860 --> 25:10.540
you're never going to reach your full potential either.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.940
And so you have to balance these two balls

25:12.940 --> 25:14.300
at the same time, right?

25:14.300 --> 25:16.740
And so like for me, I always,

25:16.740 --> 25:18.340
and this is maybe because I wasn't good,

25:18.500 --> 25:19.380
but I was always like,

25:19.380 --> 25:21.540
let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.180
Let me go find, I would like literally,

25:24.180 --> 25:25.020
like seventh, eighth grade

25:25.020 --> 25:26.340
when I was starting to get better,

25:26.340 --> 25:28.060
it was like, and there's no internet.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.100
Well, there's no one was using the internet.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.260
It was like a wrestling magazine.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.020
And like, hey dad, there's a tournament here.

25:33.020 --> 25:34.300
I think that, are the kids going to be there?

25:34.300 --> 25:37.780
Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?

25:37.780 --> 25:40.460
You would wrestle like in competition against them.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.140
In competition, yeah, yeah, in competition.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.580
Hey, I heard there's this tournament.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.660
Here's the magazine, says this tournament.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.060
Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?

25:47.060 --> 25:48.660
You weren't trying to win.

25:48.660 --> 25:50.300
You were trying to get the experience.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.860
I was trying to wrestle the best guys.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.020
Maybe I win, maybe I lose.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.740
There's no, when you used to do a competition,

25:54.740 --> 25:57.220
there's no guarantee of a win or a loss.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.820
You're just doing competition, right?

25:58.820 --> 26:01.180
So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself

26:01.180 --> 26:03.740
against the best guys of which I thought

26:03.740 --> 26:05.140
maybe I could come out on top, right?

26:05.140 --> 26:07.620
So like eighth grade year, I won way,

26:07.620 --> 26:09.940
you know, I probably lost a handful of times

26:09.940 --> 26:11.340
in the state of Wisconsin.

26:11.340 --> 26:12.500
It's probably really, really minimal

26:12.500 --> 26:13.980
the amount of times I lost, you know?

26:13.980 --> 26:15.580
But it was just about getting the challenge.

26:15.580 --> 26:19.260
And it's like some kids, and not kids in my club,

26:19.260 --> 26:20.620
because I'll push them very hard on this,

26:20.620 --> 26:22.820
are scared of challenging themselves.

26:22.820 --> 26:25.380
They like being the big fish in the small pond.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.620
They're not willing to go say,

26:26.620 --> 26:29.100
I wanna go get that guy, and I wanna get that guy,

26:29.100 --> 26:30.180
and I wanna get that guy.

26:30.180 --> 26:33.020
And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me

26:33.020 --> 26:34.580
is like, I always just love to challenge.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.980
I enjoy competing thoroughly, right?

26:36.980 --> 26:38.660
And I understood from a young age

26:38.660 --> 26:39.700
because it wasn't very good.

26:39.700 --> 26:40.580
Losing's a part of it.

26:40.580 --> 26:41.900
You're not always gonna win.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.060
And that was kind of it.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.820
It's like, hey, sometimes, you know,

26:45.060 --> 26:49.260
for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way,

26:49.260 --> 26:51.180
but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.620
And like, that's pretty rare.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.340
I didn't plan for that to happen.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.660
That was just what happened.

26:55.660 --> 26:58.540
Okay, but you also didn't lose

26:58.540 --> 27:00.660
like the second part of your college career.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.340
My 87, I won my last 87 matches.

27:03.340 --> 27:04.980
Yeah.

27:04.980 --> 27:08.140
So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?

27:08.140 --> 27:08.980
You just-

27:08.980 --> 27:09.820
I don't like losing.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.660
I still don't like it.

27:10.660 --> 27:11.500
Yeah.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
Yeah, I would have much rather-

27:12.540 --> 27:15.180
Okay, but you don't,

27:15.180 --> 27:17.540
you don't seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off

27:17.540 --> 27:18.380
a little bit.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.740
Okay, so like specifically with these two instances

27:20.740 --> 27:21.580
that you bring up.

27:21.580 --> 27:25.540
With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay.

27:25.540 --> 27:26.380
All right, let's-

27:26.380 --> 27:27.220
Let's go deep, let's go deep.

27:27.220 --> 27:28.060
All right.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.700
So the Masvidal one, it feels different because-

27:30.700 --> 27:31.820
So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.220
Let's, for people who don't know,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.380
Masvidal loss was your first loss.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.220
First loss.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.060
In MMA.

27:38.060 --> 27:38.880
Yes.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.720
Yeah.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.460
Yeah, and I mean, it was a dramatic loss.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.300
Very dramatic.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.620
And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially

27:45.620 --> 27:49.900
one of the greats of all time coming into this fight.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.820
And so, this pressure, all of that.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.260
So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.260
I didn't feel the pressure.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.020
So the Masvidal fight is,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.100
he got one fucking move on me.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.500
It's not like he beat me.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
And if we do that again, I think I win.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.580
At that point in my life, for sure,

28:08.620 --> 28:12.300
I think I win way, way, way more times than I lose.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.300
He knew that too.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.140
That's why he didn't want,

28:14.140 --> 28:15.580
he didn't want to sound the bottom of the agreement.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.100
That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.260
Cause I had to continue to taunt him

28:18.260 --> 28:21.140
in order to get him to sign, right?

28:21.140 --> 28:23.100
So that one hurt because,

28:23.100 --> 28:24.260
and so people don't know my MMA career,

28:24.260 --> 28:25.100
I'll just go through it fast.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.500
I did three fights in like smaller leagues.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.600
I got signed by Bellator.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.560
I was undefeated for three and a half years.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.520
I was nine and oh.

28:32.580 --> 28:36.540
When I got done with that in 2012, no, 2013,

28:36.740 --> 28:39.540
I, at that point in my head,

28:39.540 --> 28:41.380
I was just going to transition to the UFC

28:41.380 --> 28:42.380
cause that's where you go.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.180
I was ranked like six in the world.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.540
I hadn't really had a competitive match

28:46.540 --> 28:48.600
at the end of the Bellator thing.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.620
And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me,

28:51.620 --> 28:52.840
we still haven't had this conversation.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.740
I wish I could ask him.

28:53.740 --> 28:55.620
I should ask him sometime.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.540
Chose to refuse me any entry into UFC.

28:58.540 --> 29:01.500
He just said, I went to his office

29:01.500 --> 29:03.780
and he literally said, we're not interested.

29:03.780 --> 29:05.420
We're not going to make you an offer.

29:05.420 --> 29:08.380
Did you, did you mention something to about him,

29:08.380 --> 29:09.220
about the UFC?

29:09.220 --> 29:10.620
That was a year before that.

29:10.620 --> 29:11.460
That was a year before.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.940
And that might play a role in it, I think.

29:13.940 --> 29:17.540
So yes, what happened the year before that was,

29:17.540 --> 29:19.900
I called him a liar, which, but listen,

29:19.900 --> 29:20.740
I'm right on this one.

29:20.740 --> 29:22.980
Cause he said, you can't test for drugs.

29:22.980 --> 29:26.060
Cause I'm all natural, which you could tell by my physique.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.940
And I was always put off by the fact

29:28.940 --> 29:30.660
that so many people cheated.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.980
And I was very vocal about that.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.060
And so he had made some statement like,

29:35.060 --> 29:36.140
oh, well, there's no way you could test.

29:36.140 --> 29:36.980
I said, bullshit.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.420
You very specifically, I said,

29:38.420 --> 29:42.020
USADA does it for all other sports worldwide.

29:42.020 --> 29:42.940
You can do it.

29:42.940 --> 29:43.760
And then it was funny.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.380
Cause I hired USADA a couple of years later.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.860
So I think he took some offense to that,

29:46.860 --> 29:49.780
but that was like a year and almost a year and a half,

29:49.780 --> 29:52.180
I think, somewhere, it was later.

29:52.180 --> 29:54.220
It's not like he holds a grudge or anything.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.100
Yeah.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.400
So I, so I literally go to Vegas.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.060
It's a long story.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.380
You can read about it other places.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.660
So I got released from a belt.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.940
It's not like this is a negotiation.

30:05.780 --> 30:06.620
I got released from my belt or contract.

30:06.620 --> 30:07.440
I said, I'm out of here.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.380
I'm going to go to the UFC.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.020
I go to Vegas.

30:11.020 --> 30:14.340
And then I was told, hey, there's no offer for you.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.760
Tough shit, you know?

30:15.760 --> 30:19.420
So then I ended up signing with one championship.

30:19.420 --> 30:21.700
I spent, what, three and a half years there.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.020
I won the belt in my second fight

30:23.020 --> 30:24.940
and retained the title the entire time.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.100
And then I just, I think-

30:27.100 --> 30:27.940
Again, dominating people.

30:27.940 --> 30:29.820
Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.420
And so I retired 18 and 0.

30:32.420 --> 30:34.700
Never, never get, and for someone who loves a challenge,

30:35.460 --> 30:36.300
never getting to really challenge myself

30:36.300 --> 30:37.940
was incredibly frustrating.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.300
And I left the door open.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.900
But I said, if I ever get the chance

30:40.900 --> 30:42.900
to prove I'm in this world, I'd love to come back.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.980
So somehow a year later, I get traded.

30:45.980 --> 30:46.900
Trades have never happened.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.580
And this is the one and only trade ever.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.840
I've been retired for a year.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.860
I got traded.

30:51.860 --> 30:52.700
I get to come back.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.540
I fight Robbie Lawler in the first fight.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.500
I win.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.260
And then essentially they're saying, okay, if you fight,

30:58.260 --> 30:59.740
you know, if you beat George,

30:59.740 --> 31:01.700
you're going to get the title shot against Marty.

31:01.700 --> 31:06.100
And it's like, this is what I've been working for.

31:06.100 --> 31:06.940
I've been trying to prove

31:06.940 --> 31:08.460
I was the best fighter in the world for the last 10 years.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.960
And I have not been afforded this opportunity.

31:12.420 --> 31:14.340
So when I lost to George, that was hard

31:14.340 --> 31:18.260
because it was something that I had waited for

31:18.260 --> 31:20.180
for a really, really long time.

31:20.180 --> 31:22.220
It was something that I thought I could compete for

31:22.220 --> 31:23.260
and I never got the opportunity to do.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.300
So that one was hard.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.700
At the same time from like just a competitive logistic,

31:27.700 --> 31:29.260
and it's like, he got me with one move.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.100
It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes

31:31.100 --> 31:33.420
and then I got beat a bunch of different ways.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.420
So that was like, fuck, like if I get it again,

31:36.420 --> 31:37.260
I could have done it,

31:37.260 --> 31:38.700
but they're not going to let me have it again.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.700
It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year

31:40.700 --> 31:42.380
or the next week or whatever, you know,

31:42.380 --> 31:45.020
you lose a big 10, you go to nationals two weeks later.

31:45.020 --> 31:48.580
Does that loss change you in any way, your psychology?

31:48.580 --> 31:50.060
I don't think so.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.540
It's the first loss.

31:51.540 --> 31:56.380
I mean, had I had a longer MMA career post that,

31:56.380 --> 31:58.940
there definitely would have been a lot of time spent

31:58.940 --> 32:01.980
getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?

32:01.980 --> 32:03.940
Which I had already spent time there.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.860
I don't, I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip,

32:06.860 --> 32:09.300
the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do

32:09.300 --> 32:11.460
was preventing me from doing some things.

32:11.460 --> 32:12.980
And it's why, if you look at the fight,

32:12.980 --> 32:15.500
I'm like bent over as they go for the double leg.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.340
Yeah.

32:16.340 --> 32:17.300
So what happened for people who don't know,

32:17.300 --> 32:20.140
you went in for a double leg and he went,

32:20.140 --> 32:22.940
he did a flying knee and that caught you well.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.620
Specifically the way he did that knee

32:24.620 --> 32:25.940
was kind of different than the way

32:25.940 --> 32:28.380
anyone had thrown flying knees before.

32:28.420 --> 32:31.100
Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical,

32:31.100 --> 32:34.180
whereas he took a few like running steps and went more,

32:34.180 --> 32:37.660
you know, the trajectory of the angle was different.

32:37.660 --> 32:39.780
So I think that's kind of probably why it caught,

32:39.780 --> 32:42.460
you know, I think a lot of things in combat,

32:42.460 --> 32:44.340
well, probably everything, but I focus specifically

32:44.340 --> 32:45.900
on combat, have been subconsciously.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.660
Like our brain is reading what's coming at us

32:48.660 --> 32:50.980
and lost time to stuff we've seen before

32:50.980 --> 32:53.180
so we can judge how to move correctly.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.660
You misread because it's something you haven't seen before.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.740
Had not seen anyone come at that specific angle.

32:58.380 --> 32:59.860
So that loss was really hard.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.140
With the Burroughs one, I told you,

33:02.140 --> 33:03.260
I knew I was going to lose.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.340
So it was like, whatever, you know,

33:05.340 --> 33:07.780
I'm taking this because I want to put

33:07.780 --> 33:09.580
the sport of wrestling out there in a big way.

33:09.580 --> 33:10.980
I want to help them raise a lot of money.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.340
We sold at Madison Square Garden Hulu Theater

33:13.340 --> 33:14.460
and we raised a whole bunch of money.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.260
So my goals were accomplished.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.420
Jake Paul fight, I took it because they paid me

33:18.420 --> 33:20.020
a whole bunch of money and I thought it was going to be fun.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.940
Did I have any illusion I was a great boxer?

33:21.940 --> 33:23.700
No illusions whatsoever.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.180
Would I have preferred to win?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.060
Absolutely.

33:26.060 --> 33:27.860
But you know, like I told everyone,

33:27.860 --> 33:29.340
whether I win or lose on Saturday night,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.220
I'm going to be back coaching wrestling on Monday

33:31.220 --> 33:32.420
because that's what I enjoy doing

33:32.420 --> 33:34.380
and I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.940
And once I'm out, these middle school kids

33:35.940 --> 33:38.100
give me a little bit of shit about it.

33:38.100 --> 33:38.940
That's it.

33:38.940 --> 33:39.780
That's about it.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.940
Where were you in terms of your shape

33:41.940 --> 33:44.980
and how you felt in the Mazda fight?

33:44.980 --> 33:46.460
Would you say you're on the,

33:46.460 --> 33:48.340
I mean it's a difficult question to ask

33:48.340 --> 33:51.060
of a world class athlete,

33:51.060 --> 33:54.580
but like were you past peak?

33:54.580 --> 33:55.420
Oh, yeah.

33:55.420 --> 33:58.060
So I don't know why guys like to lie about that.

33:58.060 --> 34:00.500
I mean, the peak for me was really evidently

34:00.500 --> 34:02.020
in my late twenties

34:03.100 --> 34:06.820
and maybe they are all fueled by extra supplements.

34:06.820 --> 34:07.660
I don't know.

34:07.660 --> 34:09.140
But for me, that was evident.

34:09.140 --> 34:11.620
But you get this, so you get this crosshair

34:11.620 --> 34:14.380
where if you're smart,

34:14.380 --> 34:16.060
like I mentioned Joan Burrows was,

34:16.060 --> 34:17.420
you're still gaining wisdom.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.260
You're gaining strength.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.860
You're gaining a lot of things, right?

34:19.860 --> 34:22.180
And so while your physicality may go down,

34:22.180 --> 34:24.540
your overall skill level still may be rising.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.060
Especially in MMA because people usually start later

34:28.060 --> 34:29.860
because they're gaining wisdom, strategy,

34:29.860 --> 34:32.060
all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?

34:32.060 --> 34:32.980
They're getting all these things.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.420
So their actual competitive peak,

34:35.420 --> 34:37.100
despite their athletic peak going down,

34:37.100 --> 34:39.820
might still be a few years past that, right?

34:39.820 --> 34:41.740
Because these things are crossing.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.340
No, so I felt I was great.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.260
Obviously the hip was an issue.

34:47.140 --> 34:49.540
It's funny because so that,

34:49.540 --> 34:51.460
I knew I had a lot of pain here

34:51.460 --> 34:53.060
and I knew it was because of this.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.220
And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done,

34:54.220 --> 34:56.580
I'll just get it taken care of, whatever.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.740
But every time I train,

34:57.740 --> 35:00.260
I'll have pain kind of like all up my back.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.260
And the day after the surgery,

35:02.260 --> 35:05.380
I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my,

35:05.380 --> 35:06.500
the surgery was on the left side.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.740
There's no pain on the right side of my back.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.020
I'm like, that's fucking weird.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.300
Like every morning I wake up,

35:10.300 --> 35:12.220
there's a lot of pain there, you know?

35:13.100 --> 35:14.500
I'm like, okay, I'm on pain pills.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.140
Maybe it'll come back tomorrow.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.220
And that's because I've never been back since my hip pain.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.260
So it was weird because it was like this.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.180
I thought this was affecting this,

35:23.180 --> 35:26.500
but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.380
So, you know, if I get to get a new hip,

35:28.380 --> 35:31.500
honestly, if I don't know if this is gonna change

35:31.500 --> 35:33.700
the competitive outcome whatsoever.

35:33.700 --> 35:36.660
If I had known how good the hip replacement was gonna be,

35:36.660 --> 35:38.580
I would have done it the second I retired

35:38.580 --> 35:41.580
from one championship in November of 2017.

35:41.580 --> 35:44.820
I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1.

35:44.820 --> 35:46.340
Just from a lifestyle standpoint,

35:46.340 --> 35:48.460
I could only sleep in one position.

35:48.460 --> 35:49.660
There was a lot of things I couldn't do.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.260
I was in a lot of pain.

35:51.260 --> 35:52.780
So I would have done that a lot earlier.

35:53.060 --> 35:55.780
But no, from an athletic point, I was ready to eat.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.380
This shit goes wrong sometimes.

35:58.500 --> 36:02.180
I don't know how to ask this, but, you know, Joe Rogan, me,

36:03.260 --> 36:08.180
had a sense about you similar to like, Fedor,

36:08.180 --> 36:11.100
that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.140
Yeah.

36:12.140 --> 36:15.460
Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now

36:15.460 --> 36:19.500
of being in the top 10 of all time?

36:19.500 --> 36:20.660
I didn't prove it.

36:20.660 --> 36:21.980
I don't deserve it.

36:22.020 --> 36:23.580
You had to, I mean.

36:23.580 --> 36:24.620
But I didn't prove it.

36:24.620 --> 36:29.100
I mean, so it's like, had I somehow gotten

36:29.100 --> 36:32.140
to convince Dana White, we go and convince him in 2013

36:32.140 --> 36:35.060
to make me an offer, and I didn't even need a good offer.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.180
I just needed any offer.

36:36.180 --> 36:37.820
Had I gotten the offer then,

36:37.820 --> 36:39.820
maybe the outcome's different, right?

36:39.820 --> 36:42.020
But given, I would never expect anyone

36:42.020 --> 36:43.220
to think of me that way.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.060
I didn't prove it.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.460
I know what I was, and I'm good with that.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.180
And yeah, other people never got to see that.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.340
Do you think, well, you don't know,

36:50.340 --> 36:52.020
you can't know fully, right?

36:52.020 --> 36:55.820
Do you think if you went to the UFC at that time

36:55.820 --> 36:56.900
instead of won championship?

36:56.900 --> 36:59.260
I think I would've had a lot of success.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.100
Yeah, I mean, there's obviously certain guys,

37:01.100 --> 37:02.380
there's a lot of guys I've trained with

37:02.380 --> 37:05.660
that I had a lot of really good results against.

37:05.660 --> 37:07.620
And obviously-

37:07.620 --> 37:10.060
Who was the Walter Waite at that?

37:10.060 --> 37:12.260
Tyron was a champion for a long time there.

37:12.260 --> 37:13.860
So I was around, Tyron was a champion,

37:13.860 --> 37:15.180
Anthony was a champion at lightweight.

37:15.180 --> 37:17.340
I was, you know, same gym as him.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.340
And we had a lot of people coming through.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.740
Would you face Tyron?

37:21.740 --> 37:22.580
Would I have fought him?

37:22.580 --> 37:23.540
I don't think so.

37:23.540 --> 37:26.380
I mean, so he was still the champion when I came into the UFC

37:26.380 --> 37:29.220
and we said, no, we were not gonna fight.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.700
All right.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.580
Hey, so he can't change history, right?

37:32.580 --> 37:33.500
So once something happens,

37:33.500 --> 37:36.540
you gotta accept for what it is and move forward.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.380
And obviously hope you can continue

37:38.380 --> 37:39.740
to keep accomplishing great things,

37:39.740 --> 37:42.420
which for me, obviously my athletic career is over.

37:42.420 --> 37:45.420
So now it's gonna be through my wrestling academies

37:45.420 --> 37:48.060
and you know, who knows what else I get into.

37:48.140 --> 37:51.260
You might do exhibition matches

37:51.260 --> 37:52.620
and all that kind of stuff, right?

37:52.620 --> 37:53.460
Says who?

37:53.460 --> 37:55.540
Wrestling and stuff, no?

37:55.540 --> 37:56.380
I don't think so.

37:56.380 --> 37:59.540
So here's my thing with the wrestling matches is like-

37:59.540 --> 38:00.380
Just for fun.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.060
If you said, hey Ben, just for fun.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.540
Would you love to go wrestle someone?

38:03.540 --> 38:04.540
Yeah, I would.

38:04.540 --> 38:05.380
I would, right?

38:05.380 --> 38:06.620
I love wrestling.

38:06.620 --> 38:07.660
I get in there.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.980
I love, you know, I love like,

38:08.980 --> 38:11.420
so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.260
He's in college.

38:12.260 --> 38:13.100
He got in Keegan O'Toole.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.100
He just won a junior world title this year.

38:16.180 --> 38:19.260
And so when I'm doing private lessons,

38:19.260 --> 38:21.100
I have to think about the development of the athletes.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.140
Sometimes I can wrestle hard,

38:22.140 --> 38:23.540
but most of the time it's like,

38:23.540 --> 38:24.740
I'm just gonna help them

38:24.740 --> 38:25.860
with whatever they need help with.

38:25.860 --> 38:27.220
And it's still wrestling and it's fun,

38:27.220 --> 38:28.540
but it's helping them.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.300
You know, for like, for Keegan Kozak this summer

38:30.300 --> 38:31.380
and he's training for the junior world title.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.900
So to be able to just shake hands sometimes

38:32.900 --> 38:35.340
and say like, I'm gonna try to kick your ass.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.340
Should you try to kick my ass?

38:36.340 --> 38:37.660
You know, like just to go, like-

38:37.660 --> 38:38.500
Yeah, it's a good feeling.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.540
It's so much fun.

38:39.540 --> 38:40.820
And I don't get to do that very much.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.700
So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches?

38:42.700 --> 38:44.340
And the answer is yeah.

38:44.340 --> 38:46.540
The problem, unfortunately for me,

38:46.540 --> 38:48.580
and maybe you could talk me off a ledge here,

38:48.580 --> 38:50.780
is like because of where I've gotten to in my career,

38:50.780 --> 38:52.700
if I choose to do a wrestling match,

38:52.700 --> 38:53.820
people are gonna be really excited about it.

38:53.820 --> 38:56.020
It's gonna pull up and it's like,

38:56.020 --> 38:57.420
I just wanna wrestle just to wrestle.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.180
I'd rather just like go in a room

38:59.180 --> 39:00.620
where no one can watch and just wrestle.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.020
I just enjoy it.

39:02.020 --> 39:03.580
Well, you could also wrestle.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.380
So there's different kinds of wrestling.

39:05.380 --> 39:07.940
There's wrestling where there's an event

39:07.940 --> 39:11.580
and like, you know, there's a buildup and then an announcement.

39:11.580 --> 39:14.620
And you can also do like a Khabib style,

39:14.620 --> 39:18.660
like in the room, there's cameras and you kind of go and-

39:18.660 --> 39:20.260
Wait, Khabib does that?

39:20.260 --> 39:21.660
No, in-

39:21.660 --> 39:22.500
Marcelo did that.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.340
He whooped my ass a few times.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.220
Yeah, exactly.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.380
I mean, I've seen Khabib some videos.

39:26.380 --> 39:28.820
It's not like set up, it's just people going hard

39:28.820 --> 39:31.340
and then it's more fun, you know?

39:31.340 --> 39:36.340
And it's also more like presenting the beauty

39:37.100 --> 39:38.420
of the sport, you know?

39:38.420 --> 39:39.260
For sure.

39:39.580 --> 39:43.300
And there's no winning or losing really in that context.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.980
Like you're always joking around a little bit,

39:45.980 --> 39:47.180
even when you go super hard.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.380
So I feel like, especially in the modern day

39:49.380 --> 39:52.460
with the internet, that's a compelling way to do.

39:52.460 --> 39:53.700
So I've thought about,

39:53.700 --> 39:55.860
this is the one thing I've thought about doing

39:55.860 --> 39:58.980
cause I told you about my buddy was the content thing.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.340
It's called Rockfin.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.180
Thought about doing, you know,

40:01.180 --> 40:03.180
the old really famous Gracie challenge.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.020
Yeah.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.260
Okay, so I thought about doing the Ashgren challenge.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.180
You wanna hear my rule set?

40:06.180 --> 40:07.020
Yeah, let's go.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.020
I'm not sure I'm gonna do this.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.780
People are gonna show up here, like in Wisconsin.

40:10.780 --> 40:11.700
I have to select you.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.740
I'll start with a thousand bucks, right?

40:13.740 --> 40:15.020
Okay, 30 minutes.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.500
You pin me or I pin you.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.220
That's it, no points, no nothing.

40:18.220 --> 40:19.220
We just wrestle.

40:19.220 --> 40:20.580
Camera, that's it, right?

40:20.580 --> 40:22.500
Camera in the room, maybe there's a referee

40:22.500 --> 40:24.420
cause we don't want there to be contention over the pin.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.260
So-

40:25.260 --> 40:26.080
Just one pin.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.420
Just one pin, 30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?

40:28.420 --> 40:31.620
If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?

40:31.620 --> 40:33.500
Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars,

40:33.500 --> 40:36.620
2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 and so on.

40:36.620 --> 40:37.860
If you make it the distance

40:38.700 --> 40:39.540
and I don't pin you and you don't pin me,

40:39.540 --> 40:42.140
I'll pay for your travel and give you 500 bucks, right?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.660
Just a kind of consolation prize for showing up.

40:44.660 --> 40:47.020
If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.780
Wait, who's adding to the jackpot?

40:50.780 --> 40:53.180
I am, it's my money, my money.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.660
But then what's the incentive to keep winning for you?

40:55.660 --> 40:56.500
Cause the jackpot-

40:56.500 --> 40:58.300
Well, cause I would put the content somewhere

40:58.300 --> 40:59.140
and people would watch it, right?

40:59.140 --> 41:00.180
Oh, so you're gonna make money.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.300
Yeah, so you'd make money that way.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.700
But it's not exponentially growing, right?

41:02.700 --> 41:04.380
It's just going up by like-

41:04.380 --> 41:06.060
Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people

41:06.060 --> 41:06.900
that could pin me.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.300
So I would either just not choose those people

41:09.300 --> 41:11.660
or wait till I get a really large audience

41:11.660 --> 41:12.740
and people get really excited.

41:12.740 --> 41:14.820
In that case, I'm making a lot of money, so.

41:14.820 --> 41:15.660
What do you think,

41:15.660 --> 41:17.740
how many matches would go with you?

41:17.740 --> 41:19.540
Like, Caldake shows up.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.900
I don't think he can pin me.

41:20.900 --> 41:21.740
Yeah.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.340
I mean, like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me,

41:24.340 --> 41:25.180
but he can't pin me.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.380
He was never a pinner.

41:26.380 --> 41:27.220
Yeah.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.060
He ain't gonna pin me.

41:28.060 --> 41:30.140
There's only a few people who have the skill level

41:30.140 --> 41:31.340
to do so, right?

41:31.340 --> 41:32.180
It takes a lot.

41:32.180 --> 41:33.580
Cause that was, so pinning was one of my specialties.

41:33.580 --> 41:35.500
I had the fourth most of all time

41:35.500 --> 41:37.660
and I won the pinning award the last two years.

41:38.540 --> 41:41.260
So you think you can be down on points and just pin them?

41:41.260 --> 41:45.180
This is actually one of the issues I have with Jiu-Jitsu

41:45.180 --> 41:47.020
and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing.

41:47.020 --> 41:48.300
I actually think the Eddie Bravo thing is kind of,

41:48.300 --> 41:49.300
people get so mad at me.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.300
Sorry, Jiu-Jitsu.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.740
I think it's bullshit.

41:51.740 --> 41:52.820
And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?

41:52.820 --> 41:53.660
Yeah.

41:53.660 --> 41:55.180
So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass

41:55.180 --> 41:57.220
and the score is 16 to two,

41:57.220 --> 41:58.500
but he can't pin me,

41:58.500 --> 42:00.900
then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him?

42:00.900 --> 42:02.820
I'm probably gonna pin him.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.700
So I'm better than Jordan Burrows?

42:04.740 --> 42:06.020
Nah, that ain't right.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.460
He just whooped my ass.

42:07.460 --> 42:08.300
Do you know what I'm saying?

42:08.300 --> 42:09.380
Like if we can go the whole,

42:09.380 --> 42:11.660
cause they do submission only.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.140
So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for,

42:14.140 --> 42:15.380
what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?

42:15.380 --> 42:18.340
I don't know what's the length of an Eddie Bravo match.

42:18.340 --> 42:19.180
Yeah, I don't know.

42:19.180 --> 42:20.140
It's something like that.

42:20.140 --> 42:21.140
Yeah, yeah.

42:21.140 --> 42:22.580
So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.220
He's gonna out score me significantly.

42:24.220 --> 42:25.260
He will not pin me.

42:25.260 --> 42:26.340
I promise you that.

42:26.340 --> 42:27.260
Okay.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.220
So now we go, we go to the overtime.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.460
Strong wars, but yeah.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.300
He won't wait.

42:31.300 --> 42:32.140
Jordan Burrows is not gonna,

42:32.140 --> 42:32.980
he's gonna beat me.

42:32.980 --> 42:33.900
I will give you that.

42:33.900 --> 42:35.100
Kyle Dague won't pin you either.

42:35.100 --> 42:35.940
No.

42:35.940 --> 42:36.780
Okay.

42:36.780 --> 42:38.900
They will both beat me on points very badly.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.420
Now David Taylor, he might pin me

42:40.420 --> 42:42.700
cause he's a very good pinner also.

42:42.700 --> 42:43.540
They'll beat me very badly.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.140
They will not pin me.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.540
But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like,

42:47.540 --> 42:50.180
so in Eddie Bravo, you get a rear naked choke

42:50.180 --> 42:51.460
or an arm bar.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.500
Okay, give me a cradle.

42:52.500 --> 42:53.580
I'll probably pin him.

42:53.580 --> 42:54.420
Okay.

42:54.420 --> 42:55.260
A good cradle.

42:55.260 --> 42:56.940
You can say cradle or maybe give them,

42:56.940 --> 42:58.220
they're probably not gonna pin me, right?

42:58.220 --> 43:00.180
Maybe there's a chance, but probably not.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.260
Cause that's just not their specialty.

43:01.260 --> 43:05.380
So for people who don't know the Eddie Bravo thing is,

43:05.380 --> 43:07.340
when it goes into overtime,

43:07.340 --> 43:09.980
you get a dominant position on a person

43:09.980 --> 43:12.220
and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle.

43:12.220 --> 43:13.180
This is the wrestling equivalent.

43:13.180 --> 43:14.020
Yeah.

43:14.020 --> 43:14.860
But you take their back.

43:14.860 --> 43:15.700
Maybe an arm bar.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.380
Yeah, like a wrestling arm bar.

43:17.380 --> 43:18.660
So, and I don't think that's very fair.

43:18.660 --> 43:19.820
Cause if someone whoops your ass,

43:19.820 --> 43:20.660
they whoops your ass.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.860
And then, you know,

43:21.860 --> 43:24.260
and so I think the reason why Jiu-Jitsu people accept

43:24.260 --> 43:26.660
that rule set is that I don't think,

43:26.660 --> 43:27.980
I think they know this, but would admit it.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.620
I don't think their point scoring system,

43:29.620 --> 43:33.860
adequately rewards what people value.

43:33.860 --> 43:36.500
So like in wrestling, we value takedowns

43:36.500 --> 43:38.060
cause it gets as close to the pin.

43:38.060 --> 43:41.220
And the most valuable scoring is a near fall

43:41.220 --> 43:44.660
near to the pin because that's the ultimate goal of the sport.

43:44.660 --> 43:46.260
Whereas in Jiu-Jitsu, for example,

43:46.260 --> 43:48.780
like if I were to get a takedown,

43:48.780 --> 43:50.260
so like if I went to Gordon Ryan

43:50.260 --> 43:52.340
and he just didn't pull guard,

43:52.340 --> 43:54.060
I would probably get the takedown.

43:54.060 --> 43:56.140
Now, if somehow he didn't submit me,

43:56.140 --> 43:57.180
which he probably would, right?

43:57.180 --> 43:59.300
But say he got close to like 12 submissions,

43:59.300 --> 44:01.700
but somehow I slipped out of all of them.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.980
Now I went to Zebra, like that's ridiculous.

44:03.980 --> 44:06.220
Like he should very clearly win cause he almost submitted.

44:06.220 --> 44:07.060
You know what I'm saying?

44:07.060 --> 44:09.860
Like there, and I realized the difficulty.

44:09.860 --> 44:12.900
I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions,

44:12.900 --> 44:15.140
but that is the most valuable thing

44:15.140 --> 44:17.060
is getting close to finishing the match.

44:17.060 --> 44:20.220
And in most competitions, they don't actually reward them.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.500
But okay, so this isn't about the sport.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.820
This is about the Ben Askren challenge

44:24.820 --> 44:25.660
that we're talking about.

44:25.660 --> 44:28.300
Okay, why 30 minutes?

44:28.300 --> 44:29.660
Why not unlimited time?

44:31.100 --> 44:33.260
Why go until whenever?

44:33.260 --> 44:34.100
Cause you-

44:34.100 --> 44:34.940
Well, cause then it's just a cardio thing.

44:34.940 --> 44:36.140
Cause at some point,

44:37.300 --> 44:39.380
then someone would just have to fall over dead, right?

44:39.380 --> 44:40.860
There's no more skill level involved.

44:40.860 --> 44:42.900
It's just who can stand up the longest.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.340
You honestly don't think,

44:45.340 --> 44:47.620
30 minutes is a cardio thing too.

44:47.620 --> 44:49.380
How do you think that's actually gonna look?

44:49.380 --> 44:51.420
Kyle Dade going against you for 30 minutes.

44:51.420 --> 44:55.300
So it's gonna be kind of boring for the most part.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.900
What position are you going to be stuck in?

44:58.820 --> 45:01.500
But you just can't have a gigantic amount of action

45:01.500 --> 45:02.340
for 30 minutes.

45:02.340 --> 45:03.500
So I relate it,

45:03.500 --> 45:06.260
cause some of my kids, when I'm teaching them wrestling,

45:06.260 --> 45:10.580
they're like, well, but I can't do that for seven minutes.

45:10.580 --> 45:12.980
And I'm like, well, say if I had you do

45:14.180 --> 45:16.060
hand cleans at a relatively heavy weight

45:16.060 --> 45:18.740
as hard as you could, you're not gonna last seven minutes.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.620
Your pace will slow down, right?

45:20.620 --> 45:23.020
So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step here

45:23.020 --> 45:24.900
cause I'm wrestling, you're competing against someone.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.380
So if you're here at 100 and you go to 80,

45:27.380 --> 45:29.100
but they go to 70, that's great.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.340
And then you go to 60, but they go to 40,

45:31.340 --> 45:32.860
this is even better, right?

45:32.860 --> 45:34.460
Because the gap is growing.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.820
So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine.

45:36.820 --> 45:38.700
If they get more tired, that's better.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.420
So I think most people would know that.

45:40.420 --> 45:43.140
So they would kind of slow it down.

45:44.980 --> 45:46.660
But yeah, I think at 30, I mean,

45:46.660 --> 45:48.020
I've wrestled 30 minute goes,

45:48.020 --> 45:51.340
I've wrestled hour long goes.

45:51.340 --> 45:52.540
You're not gonna get so tired,

45:52.540 --> 45:53.980
you're gonna fall over in that time period.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.140
But at some point, if it's unlimited,

45:56.220 --> 45:58.460
someone will get so tired or dehydrated

45:58.460 --> 46:00.660
that they're just gonna freaking fall over.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.700
Yeah, but you think,

46:02.700 --> 46:05.260
what about making it exciting and dynamic?

46:06.300 --> 46:08.620
You think the other person is always going to be

46:08.620 --> 46:11.700
going for the pin and thereby make it dynamic.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.900
Well, if they're working that hard,

46:12.900 --> 46:15.060
then they might exhaust themselves, right?

46:15.060 --> 46:18.020
And obviously then if you're being that dynamic,

46:18.020 --> 46:20.260
then you're adding risk to yourself too,

46:20.260 --> 46:22.700
because you are doing that.

46:22.700 --> 46:23.540
Well, I love this.

46:23.540 --> 46:24.620
This is a great idea.

46:25.460 --> 46:29.140
Well, I think I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums,

46:29.140 --> 46:30.900
or not as great people in the beginning.

46:30.900 --> 46:32.940
And then I would start bringing in better people

46:32.940 --> 46:35.860
because they would be enticed by $20,000,

46:35.860 --> 46:36.700
the possibility to win.

46:36.700 --> 46:40.060
And not much fanfare, just a camera and just a local.

46:40.060 --> 46:41.220
That's it, in my wrestling room.

46:41.220 --> 46:42.860
Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie challenge.

46:42.860 --> 46:44.660
Yes, yeah.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.260
And so then maybe you have like,

46:48.140 --> 46:50.140
for most people, you have someone edit

46:50.140 --> 46:52.820
like the 90 seconds of the most fun things that happen.

46:52.820 --> 46:54.660
And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes

46:54.660 --> 46:55.500
if you want to.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.340
Yeah.

46:56.340 --> 46:57.180
I mean, I think most people,

46:57.180 --> 46:59.020
if they're not really, really elite,

46:59.020 --> 47:00.380
I'm probably gonna pin them.

47:01.500 --> 47:02.900
If they're not really elite.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.700
So, yeah, but I don't know.

47:06.700 --> 47:07.660
That's something I've been thinking about.

47:07.660 --> 47:10.020
This has been like fun for me to think about.

47:11.060 --> 47:12.420
And obviously it plays in my skill sets

47:12.420 --> 47:16.020
because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.180
So, yeah.

47:17.180 --> 47:21.900
So like you said, you weren't very good in your early days

47:22.060 --> 47:23.420
until 13, 14.

47:23.420 --> 47:24.580
What was the switch?

47:24.580 --> 47:27.100
You began, you started to dominate people

47:27.100 --> 47:28.940
in your college career, you dominated.

47:28.940 --> 47:30.180
Yeah.

47:30.180 --> 47:33.620
And obviously you just stopped losing at some point.

47:33.620 --> 47:34.460
Yeah.

47:34.460 --> 47:36.500
So, well, I would say,

47:36.500 --> 47:38.100
so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition,

47:38.100 --> 47:40.380
I would go in the summers and try to make the world team.

47:40.380 --> 47:43.660
So I would lose some, not a lot, right, minimally.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.540
Okay, so when I'm five, I start playing all sports.

47:47.540 --> 47:51.500
Like, I know you moved to America at what age?

47:52.140 --> 47:52.980
13.

47:52.980 --> 47:55.060
Okay, so at least, I don't know what it was for you,

47:55.060 --> 47:57.540
but in America at my age,

47:57.540 --> 48:00.180
you usually played like a sport every season, right?

48:00.180 --> 48:02.540
So that's what I did in the beginning.

48:02.540 --> 48:04.580
I had minimal success in wrestling.

48:04.580 --> 48:06.140
I was kind of chunky.

48:06.140 --> 48:08.980
And then in fifth grade, I don't,

48:08.980 --> 48:11.340
and I can't tell you, I wanted to be better.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.940
And I told my parents, it is funny

48:12.940 --> 48:14.220
because now I look at other 11-year-olds

48:14.220 --> 48:15.860
and very few of them are this mature.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.260
And I actually think emotional maturity

48:17.260 --> 48:18.500
is kind of one of the key indicators

48:18.500 --> 48:21.140
of how long-term successful someone's gonna be.

48:21.700 --> 48:23.060
And at age 11, I said, I don't wanna play baseball.

48:23.060 --> 48:24.540
And I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball

48:24.540 --> 48:25.380
because I wanna wrestle more

48:25.380 --> 48:26.820
because I wanna get better at wrestling.

48:26.820 --> 48:28.420
So at age 11, I quit baseball

48:28.420 --> 48:30.900
so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May.

48:30.900 --> 48:33.260
Because that was all that existed at that point in time.

48:33.260 --> 48:34.500
You couldn't wrestle in June, July,

48:34.500 --> 48:36.100
or any of those other months.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.740
What was that desire to get better?

48:38.740 --> 48:39.580
What is it?

48:39.580 --> 48:40.400
So it's not about winning.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.380
I don't know where it came from.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.220
I just wanted to get better.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.060
I wanna get better.

48:44.060 --> 48:44.880
I wanna be good at this.

48:44.880 --> 48:45.720
I wanna be really good at this.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.940
So when you're looking at kids now as a coach,

48:47.940 --> 48:49.060
you're looking for that.

48:49.140 --> 48:51.140
Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck.

48:51.140 --> 48:51.980
I wanna get better.

48:51.980 --> 48:54.340
And I wanna try to also inspire that.

48:54.340 --> 48:58.340
I mean, honestly, I think as a coach,

48:58.340 --> 49:01.820
that's probably my biggest job is to get a kid

49:01.820 --> 49:03.940
and get them to believe I can do this.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.260
Because if I can do this, what can I?

49:06.260 --> 49:07.360
I can do that.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.860
I can do that too, right?

49:08.860 --> 49:11.540
And there's so many kids who unfortunately have

49:11.540 --> 49:14.860
shitty parents or bad teachers that tell them,

49:14.860 --> 49:16.740
you suck, you can't be anything.

49:16.740 --> 49:18.740
So I think my biggest goal as a coach

49:18.740 --> 49:20.260
is to get someone to believe they can do it.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.340
So actually some of the ones that believe they can do it,

49:22.340 --> 49:23.220
they're the most fun,

49:23.220 --> 49:25.420
but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?

49:25.420 --> 49:26.380
The ones who think they can

49:26.380 --> 49:28.420
are the ones that need me the most.

49:28.420 --> 49:31.340
Cause they need someone to fuck, let's go.

49:31.340 --> 49:33.400
So I don't know what inspired me.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.240
I'm not sure.

49:34.240 --> 49:37.900
So age 11, fifth grade, I quit.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.500
So then I started having more success,

49:40.500 --> 49:41.320
you know, when I'm like, say,

49:41.320 --> 49:42.900
placing at the state tournament.

49:43.820 --> 49:44.860
In high school.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.260
So you write fifth, so sixth grade,

49:47.260 --> 49:49.340
I placed it like the state, local youth state tournament,

49:49.340 --> 49:51.980
you know, so I'm like having more success.

49:51.980 --> 49:52.900
Seventh grade was the first year

49:52.900 --> 49:55.160
I won the youth state tournament.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.140
So I'm getting better.

49:56.140 --> 49:58.180
Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good,

49:58.180 --> 50:00.140
but like when I went to the national tournaments,

50:00.140 --> 50:02.180
I was still having really minimal success.

50:03.260 --> 50:04.860
My freshman year, I decided to quit football.

50:04.860 --> 50:05.700
Same reason.

50:05.700 --> 50:06.920
It's like, well, I need to put more time into this.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.620
My parents, we got, my dad,

50:08.620 --> 50:10.020
luckily got a mat in my basement.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.580
So, you know, there's no,

50:11.580 --> 50:13.980
so we have a year-round club and our impetus was that

50:13.980 --> 50:16.860
we didn't have this opportunity to go to a club year round.

50:17.420 --> 50:18.260
So we had a mat in my basement.

50:18.260 --> 50:21.500
I had to go find, hey, you want to come wrestle?

50:21.500 --> 50:22.860
Yeah, to find partners for myself.

50:22.860 --> 50:23.700
What'd you do?

50:23.700 --> 50:24.520
Did you drill?

50:24.520 --> 50:25.380
Did you live wrestle?

50:25.380 --> 50:26.700
What'd you do in that basement?

50:26.700 --> 50:28.580
So actually, I think you'll enjoy this.

50:28.580 --> 50:31.980
I think the start of my scrambling

50:31.980 --> 50:34.460
was kind of based around that.

50:34.460 --> 50:36.300
So I got kind of,

50:36.300 --> 50:37.700
I think it's probably my freshman sophomore.

50:37.700 --> 50:39.940
I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?

50:39.940 --> 50:41.380
It's been a while.

50:41.380 --> 50:45.180
But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year,

50:45.180 --> 50:47.580
I found two kids who were really consistent,

50:47.580 --> 50:49.100
who would come out, like you would come out on,

50:49.100 --> 50:50.020
he'd come out on Tuesday

50:50.020 --> 50:51.620
and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?

50:51.620 --> 50:52.660
And they would come every week

50:52.660 --> 50:55.060
and they were really consistent partners for me

50:55.060 --> 50:56.340
to have in the summer.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.980
But they weren't nearly as good as me.

50:57.980 --> 50:58.860
They were way worse.

50:58.860 --> 51:02.320
So it's like, okay, how do I,

51:02.320 --> 51:04.260
how do I make this kind of like fun

51:04.260 --> 51:06.060
and compelling for them to come back?

51:06.060 --> 51:07.020
If I just whooped their ass,

51:07.020 --> 51:08.940
they're not going to come back, you know?

51:08.940 --> 51:11.300
So it was like, I would let them get as close as they could,

51:11.300 --> 51:13.460
as I thought they could do a takedown

51:13.460 --> 51:14.620
before not getting it

51:14.620 --> 51:16.980
and then try to like escape or get out.

51:16.980 --> 51:18.380
So obviously if I let them get really close,

51:18.380 --> 51:19.620
sometimes they get it, you know?

51:19.620 --> 51:21.500
So they're enjoying it.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.580
I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?

51:23.580 --> 51:24.460
I have no idea.

51:25.340 --> 51:26.660
And that was kind of like the start

51:26.660 --> 51:28.900
because I had to figure my way out of bad positions

51:28.900 --> 51:32.260
because I had to try to make it entertaining for them

51:32.260 --> 51:33.460
where they still got something out of it

51:33.460 --> 51:34.900
and they wanted to come back the next week.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.420
And I also got something out of it.

51:36.420 --> 51:37.740
Yeah, I love this.

51:37.740 --> 51:40.380
Because that relationship is so important with that.

51:41.180 --> 51:45.300
I've had a few drilling partners, training partners

51:45.300 --> 51:47.900
that were really important to my life.

51:47.900 --> 51:52.100
And I always wonder why it's so difficult to find them.

51:54.340 --> 51:55.700
If anyone's listening to this,

51:55.700 --> 51:58.820
I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area actually.

51:58.820 --> 52:00.980
Getting the reps with people is hard.

52:00.980 --> 52:05.420
Even in jiu-jitsu, it's just like people

52:05.420 --> 52:06.540
want to do the fun stuff.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.460
They don't want to really put in the work

52:08.500 --> 52:10.460
and it takes a certain kind of personality.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.300
And then you also have to make it fun

52:13.300 --> 52:14.700
for the other person, just like you said.

52:14.700 --> 52:16.060
If there's a skill mismatch,

52:16.060 --> 52:19.660
but also if you have an interest mismatch

52:19.660 --> 52:21.860
in terms of the amount of drilling

52:21.860 --> 52:23.140
you want to do, all that kind of stuff,

52:23.140 --> 52:25.020
you have to figure out ways to make it fun.

52:25.020 --> 52:25.900
It's tricky.

52:25.900 --> 52:26.740
So you did.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.940
So yeah, I think I did that and no one told me.

52:29.940 --> 52:32.300
I get frustrated because now we have,

52:32.300 --> 52:35.620
just in my academy, we probably have 50, 60,

52:35.620 --> 52:38.220
high school kids only that are year round.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.300
Maybe they're not as consistent in the summer

52:40.300 --> 52:41.140
or whatever, but they're there.

52:41.140 --> 52:42.180
So when they don't have a great partner,

52:42.180 --> 52:43.020
they start whining.

52:43.020 --> 52:44.540
It's like, you little bitches.

52:45.860 --> 52:47.060
Some days they get really mad about it

52:47.060 --> 52:48.260
because it's like, I had no partners.

52:48.260 --> 52:50.740
I had to find freaking two partners come twice a week.

52:50.740 --> 52:53.060
You guys, there's still 22 people in the room.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.260
I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you,

52:55.260 --> 52:57.180
but like go work out with that dude.

52:57.180 --> 52:58.660
You know?

52:58.660 --> 53:00.180
So what was the switch, the change?

53:00.180 --> 53:01.580
Or was it gradual?

53:01.580 --> 53:02.660
Gradual.

53:02.660 --> 53:04.300
Yeah, so it was the ninth grade.

53:04.300 --> 53:07.380
I quit football because I want to get really serious.

53:07.380 --> 53:08.660
What was your position in football?

53:08.660 --> 53:10.500
I was actually a nose tackle.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.180
But at that point, okay, so I was also,

53:12.180 --> 53:13.500
the other thing I kind of left out here,

53:13.500 --> 53:15.740
I was really fat growing up.

53:15.740 --> 53:19.340
In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat.

53:19.340 --> 53:20.460
And if I want to be competitive wrestling,

53:20.460 --> 53:21.980
I shouldn't be fat because weight matters.

53:21.980 --> 53:24.620
I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade.

53:25.740 --> 53:28.460
So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.

53:28.460 --> 53:30.860
So I still wasn't as heavy as I was when I was in sixth grade.

53:30.860 --> 53:31.780
So I was pretty small too,

53:31.780 --> 53:33.820
but I was also slow, unfortunately.

53:33.820 --> 53:35.660
So they put me a nose tackle.

53:35.940 --> 53:38.380
I liked the compativeness, so I was decent at it.

53:39.460 --> 53:41.180
So that's where you wrestled 119?

53:41.180 --> 53:42.540
For my freshman year, yeah.

53:43.740 --> 53:46.060
So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success

53:46.060 --> 53:48.940
state-wise, but not nationally.

53:48.940 --> 53:51.340
As my national success didn't come to my junior year

53:51.340 --> 53:52.980
in high school.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.100
But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time.

53:55.100 --> 53:55.940
And then senior year,

53:55.940 --> 53:57.580
I started having a lot of success nationally,

53:57.580 --> 53:59.380
and I got recruited.

53:59.380 --> 54:01.780
But then even when my freshman year of college,

54:01.780 --> 54:03.420
this is where I loved competing,

54:03.420 --> 54:04.260
I would go every weekend.

54:05.060 --> 54:07.820
If you take the emotions out of competition,

54:08.940 --> 54:12.140
all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,

54:12.140 --> 54:14.380
and then figuring out what you need to work on.

54:14.380 --> 54:16.740
If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is.

54:16.740 --> 54:19.020
So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman,

54:19.020 --> 54:20.380
which is incredibly rare.

54:20.380 --> 54:24.940
I had 10 losses, so it's not so great guys.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.980
So my skill level still at that point was not that great.

54:27.980 --> 54:29.220
And then the next year I came out

54:29.220 --> 54:30.180
and I made it into the finals.

54:30.180 --> 54:33.940
So I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year

54:33.940 --> 54:35.900
to the real freshman year.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.860
So a few questions.

54:37.860 --> 54:40.900
Where did the funk style of wrestling,

54:40.900 --> 54:42.780
the creative style get developed?

54:42.780 --> 54:44.420
At which stage?

54:44.420 --> 54:47.060
So I think looking retroactively,

54:47.060 --> 54:48.740
there was no intention to start

54:48.740 --> 54:50.020
when I was in high school with those kids,

54:50.020 --> 54:54.700
but I think that's kind of like what was happening, right?

54:54.700 --> 54:56.380
So what I would really say is

54:56.380 --> 54:59.220
I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college

54:59.260 --> 55:01.820
named Mike Ironman, great guy.

55:01.820 --> 55:04.300
But then the second thing was it was just out of necessity.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.460
I had this burning desire to be the best.

55:06.460 --> 55:09.220
And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room,

55:09.220 --> 55:10.580
because we had, you know, Tyron was there,

55:10.580 --> 55:13.420
we had All-American 157, we had All-American 184,

55:13.420 --> 55:16.020
so I was not having a ton of success.

55:16.020 --> 55:18.500
And very quickly I realized from like

55:18.500 --> 55:22.340
a more traditional athletic perspective, strength and speed,

55:22.340 --> 55:25.100
I couldn't keep up with anyone, I was way worse.

55:25.100 --> 55:27.260
So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I do this?

55:27.260 --> 55:29.180
You know, I wanna do this, how do I do this?

55:30.020 --> 55:31.380
There's gotta be a way, you know?

55:31.380 --> 55:33.460
So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things,

55:33.460 --> 55:36.540
but then it was just like this creative expansion

55:36.540 --> 55:39.820
for the next, you know, say three to five years.

55:39.820 --> 55:42.660
And then even now it's like, I don't know,

55:42.660 --> 55:44.700
there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo,

55:44.700 --> 55:47.420
or there's something that's like fun

55:47.420 --> 55:49.700
about the way the body moves and works

55:49.700 --> 55:52.660
and exploring something new and thinking about,

55:52.660 --> 55:55.300
hey, wrestling's been happening at a relatively high level

55:55.300 --> 55:57.800
for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.360
And there's still new things being developed.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.680
And so when you see something new, you're like,

56:02.680 --> 56:03.880
oh damn, like that's great.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.720
Or like Jason Nolte may have to win Dixie,

56:05.720 --> 56:07.400
I'm like, why did I not think of that shit?

56:07.400 --> 56:08.240
Like, why did I think of that?

56:08.240 --> 56:11.240
It's so easy, I should have thought of that, you know?

56:11.240 --> 56:14.880
So there's just like obsession with the sport of wrestling

56:14.880 --> 56:19.640
and positions where I actually think sometimes,

56:19.640 --> 56:20.760
thank God we didn't have smartphones

56:20.760 --> 56:23.360
because I may have been distracted by my smartphone.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.800
Maybe I wouldn't have been because I was so obsessed,

56:24.800 --> 56:26.000
but maybe, but you know,

56:26.000 --> 56:28.520
some days I couldn't finish the single leg

56:28.520 --> 56:31.720
on a specific person or maybe they were finishing on me

56:31.720 --> 56:34.320
and it was like, go home and I was just fucking obsessed

56:34.320 --> 56:38.760
about that one position, like, okay, what am I missing here?

56:38.760 --> 56:41.560
And not just accepting that whatever the coach does

56:41.560 --> 56:43.880
is the answer, but like, what am I missing?

56:43.880 --> 56:45.640
What ways can my body move

56:45.640 --> 56:48.440
that no one's told me it can move yet?

56:48.440 --> 56:50.280
Where can my arms go, right?

56:50.280 --> 56:51.360
Where can I do all these things?

56:51.360 --> 56:53.800
And so I would just obsess about these things.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.680
And then sometimes you come in the next day and you say,

56:55.680 --> 56:57.680
oh, well, maybe this, you know?

56:57.680 --> 56:59.360
And maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,

56:59.360 --> 57:01.040
maybe it works twice and then it doesn't work the next time.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.160
And so you kind of like have this creative process

57:03.160 --> 57:05.000
and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
that are on the cutting room floor

57:06.000 --> 57:07.680
that never made it to the light

57:07.680 --> 57:08.880
because you thought they were gonna be good

57:08.880 --> 57:10.360
and they failed and they sucked.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.280
And then, you know, to the point where like my senior year,

57:14.920 --> 57:16.760
I got to this point where the people,

57:16.760 --> 57:18.240
then they were just figures.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.880
Figures would wrestle in my head

57:19.880 --> 57:21.280
about positions I was thinking about.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.440
I wouldn't tell them what to do.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.480
They would just go in my head.

57:24.480 --> 57:27.640
And then like some of, oh, fuck, wait, that's it.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.080
That's it, like that just happened.

57:29.080 --> 57:29.920
That's the move.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.640
And then I'd go try to practice it, sure enough.

57:31.640 --> 57:32.720
Boom, that's the move.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.720
That's exactly what you have alpha zero playing,

57:34.720 --> 57:35.560
learning chess.

57:35.560 --> 57:38.920
You have, it's called self plays.

57:38.920 --> 57:43.760
You have, what, did the figures have like a clear?

57:43.760 --> 57:45.160
No faces, they were just like.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.640
Did they have a human form

57:46.640 --> 57:48.840
or is it just like stick figures essentially?

57:48.840 --> 57:50.920
Yeah, it was not like humans.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.000
It was more like stick figures.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.280
It wasn't stick figures exactly.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.000
Like they were, sorry.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.200
They had some volume?

57:56.200 --> 57:58.040
Yeah, it was like a gray person

57:58.040 --> 58:00.560
and they had three dimensions essentially

58:00.560 --> 58:03.680
because I had to see how the things moved and yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:09.320
I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind

58:09.320 --> 58:12.520
at Google are, I don't know if you've seen,

58:12.520 --> 58:14.440
but there's something called reinforcement learning

58:14.440 --> 58:15.560
and artificial intelligence

58:15.560 --> 58:19.200
where you have like, they've done it for like sumo wrestling.

58:19.200 --> 58:23.080
You have like, you have these two stick figures

58:23.880 --> 58:26.200
that don't even know how to get up at first

58:26.200 --> 58:28.680
and they figure out how to stand on their two feet

58:28.680 --> 58:31.200
and then they figure out how to push the other person

58:31.200 --> 58:33.560
off of the pedestal.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.040
Wait, so, but what about like when you look

58:36.040 --> 58:38.840
at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble

58:38.840 --> 58:41.560
with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.720
So are they doing that same program or no?

58:43.720 --> 58:48.720
No, no, no, this, everything Boston Dynamics is doing

58:49.120 --> 58:50.400
is hard coded.

58:50.400 --> 58:53.880
So it's not, it's not learning the,

58:55.160 --> 58:57.440
all the sophisticated movements and strategies

58:57.440 --> 58:58.960
like high level strategies and movement.

58:58.960 --> 59:02.040
That's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do

59:02.040 --> 59:03.880
and if it does it, like the parkour stuff,

59:03.880 --> 59:04.880
that's all hard coded.

59:04.880 --> 59:06.440
Oh, interesting.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.240
People like project and think like these robots

59:10.240 --> 59:13.000
have like discovered like how to move

59:13.000 --> 59:14.760
in sophisticated ways they haven't.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.200
Well, that's why when you and John were talking

59:17.200 --> 59:20.400
about the grappling robot.

59:20.400 --> 59:24.040
I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head

59:24.040 --> 59:28.120
is that with the chess, right, if a chess piece moves,

59:28.120 --> 59:31.400
right, the horse can move like an L, right?

59:31.400 --> 59:32.600
It can only move like an L.

59:32.600 --> 59:35.120
It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second

59:35.120 --> 59:36.720
or seven meters per second.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.720
It can only move there, right?

59:38.720 --> 59:41.480
Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg

59:41.480 --> 59:43.640
with many different velocities.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.240
I can shoot at different angles.

59:45.280 --> 59:48.160
I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?

59:48.160 --> 59:50.680
I can shoot with my head up versus my head, I mean, right?

59:50.680 --> 59:52.200
All these things are gonna matter.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.400
We're talking about a human being defending the single leg.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.920
All of those things are gonna matter

59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.120
and that's where human beings who wrestle

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.880
are calculating those things subconsciously.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.720
They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.600
Oh, the force is coming at me at this

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.640
so I need to do that, right?

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.360
They're just doing it because.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.160
But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely,

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.120
if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.800
you're going to have to constrain the speed

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.160
at which it moves and the power that it's able to deliver.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.400
So that presumably, that'll be the limitation.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.920
So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.440
But then, so if we go human, max force,

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.480
or Jordan Rose double, max force, right?

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.840
That's the highest we get.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.200
Then we go down from there.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.120
Even within that, it's like sometimes,

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.200
I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of,

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.240
I don't know, we'll say 20 is the number, right?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.800
I don't know, I'll shoot it at 20.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.640
Because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15,

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.600
sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.880
Because you feel something in your opponent

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.320
that makes you do it differently.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.760
So they would have to learn how,

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.680
and then all of these different things,

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.920
and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.520
So the robot would have to learn

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.400
all of these different incoming inputs to the system

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.880
and then create this reaction.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.160
Oh no, no, no, 100%.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.360
So this would be all continuous.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.040
So unlike chess, it would not, it's just chess is discreet.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.040
It's one, you move, it's a very specific set of moves.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.160
Now here you would, those are all variables you control

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.440
and they're continuous variables.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.480
So the speed, the force, there's actuators,

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.640
so there's all these joints, right?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640
You can move.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.600
I mean, it's just an optimization problem.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.240
It's kind of fascinating.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.600
So I've been fascinated thinking about it

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.440
since you guys talked about it.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.280
It was a long time ago,

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.120
I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.560
and I've kind of been obsessing about it ever since.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.960
It just changes when, so unlike boxing, for example,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.480
or striking, you know, once you grab a hold of somebody,

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.320
it changes, you're now one body, right?

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.720
So it's very complicated.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.640
It's not just shooting a double leg without,

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.160
like maybe doing like faking a double leg

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.800
and then shooting the double leg,

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.680
that's very doable with robotics,

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.640
but then like doing a clinch and from there,

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.960
doing like a Russian tie, like that.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.440
That's, I think that's way harder than people realize

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.280
in terms of how many things are involved,

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.480
like the force of the grip, the leverage you're providing

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.040
with all the different parts of the shoulder and the arm

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.800
and the torso, the twist,

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.760
how much of your weight are you allocating,

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.880
like leaning on the other person,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.640
taking weight off of one of your legs and the other leg,

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.480
all of that.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.440
I think that's the really interesting thing about humans

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.160
is we're able to do all of this calculation.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.000
Subconsciously.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.440
Yeah, subconsciously.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.960
Yeah, and that's what I've been thinking about since we,

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.680
it's like how many things, even these high school athletes

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.000
who are like getting medium good

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.560
are subconsciously thinking about all the time

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.040
or not even, not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to,

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.880
but then even like for me, I'm, you know,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.600
I'm a few orders of mag do better

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.560
than some of these kids that play.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.360
And so when I, when I go like super hard,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.720
it's like I can feel their weight moving

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.680
in the wrong direction.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.960
And so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.720
is kind of easy sometimes, you know,

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.560
because they're not feeling it the right way, right?

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.640
Or their timing's just a little bit off

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.200
or the way they're grabbing the hip,

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.800
maybe they should be up a little higher, right?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.600
These really small things.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.760
for a robot is just, there's so many things.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.040
The big problem is ethically,

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.680
I don't know how many people are willing to train

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.840
the robot because you're going to get hurt.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.080
Well, can you make a robot change the robot or no?

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.960
Yes, but then it's expensive.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.040
So because they're going to get the padding on that thing.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.040
I know, but the, but then it's not, you know, it, it's,

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.200
then you're not capturing the full.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.160
Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them, right?

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.880
You know, something for that effect.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.320
You could, I mean, you could, you could.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.040
I mean, you're talking about robots that are,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.720
these are humanoid robots.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.360
So we're talking about $500,000 million robots.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.280
So you would have to be motivated

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.400
to spend a lot of money because you have to have them wrestle

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.400
for like a lot.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.240
To get better.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.240
Yeah, to get better.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.560
And then the open question is

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.840
how long does it take to get good enough to be a human?

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.560
I don't, I don't think, I don't think we understand.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.400
I don't know.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.240
I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.080
Yeah.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.400
Like, is it a really hard problem?

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.000
Like what's harder, chess or wrestling?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.120
Wrestling by far.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:42.960
Not even close.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.800
That's, yeah.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.120
That's the sense.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.280
So because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.120
And possibilities.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.240
So once I shoot the single leg,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.480
now you have X amount of choices.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.840
Once you make your choice,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.040
now I have a choice, X amount of choices.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.200
Now you have X amount of choices on the defense

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.800
and we can just keep going back and forth, right?

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.320
And this number becomes.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.800
Yeah, but the same happens with chess.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.640
Correct.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.480
But then in wrestling,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.360
you have to make these movements very instantaneously, right?

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.200
Cause I should have seen like,

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.040
I'm not going to wait and say, what's your defense?

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.880
Yeah.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.720
Right, it's being instantaneously.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.360
And then also again, based on the force and the vectors

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.200
and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.920
So really, you know, if you're saying,

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
why can't you just single leg?

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.840
Moving the chess, it's not one move, right?

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.160
If you want to talk about different forces and stuff,

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160
it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.640
based on how hard I shoot it,

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.440
the angle, the direction, all of those things.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.400
Yeah, but wait a minute.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.840
So robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.920
People probably know the physiology of this,

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.760
but the reaction speed for a human

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.640
is maybe a hundred milliseconds, something like that.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.480
I don't know.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.160
From sensation to like,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.760
from the signal traveling up to your brain and down,

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.200
I don't know what that number is,

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.600
but robots certainly could do way faster.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.040
You would actually have to like constrain the speed.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.760
Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.600
Yes.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.880
Right, so yeah, theoretically,

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.320
they could eventually be wrestlers,

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.720
but you asked what was hard wrestling a chess.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.560
Yeah.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.280
I think wrestling is because of the time component in it

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.880
and then the physicality of, you know,

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.160
is it this force or that force, you know,

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.320
because if I'm going to say,

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.040
say we're in a seatbelt side-by-side, right,

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.880
a wrestling seatbelt, not a Jiu-Jitsu,

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.000
based on the pressure you're giving me,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.560
I might do a bunch of different things, right?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.600
And so like to an untrained eye,

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.040
they might both look like the same thing from you.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.760
To a trained feel, it's like, well, in one case,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.120
it's really evident I should go this way.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.280
In another case, it's really evident I should go that way.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.120
So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.120
the AI systems, so human versus human plays certain way

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.280
together, they actually haven't considered

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.960
a really large number of strategies

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.440
that AI systems discover.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.000
So one possibility with a robot,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.720
they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.040
That's what I'm saying.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.160
That like will dominate no matter what the human does.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.600
You think that, so you think there's that,

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.280
so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking about,

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.920
the wrestling's so fun is there's,

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.040
even after 80 to 90 years,

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.120
there's this continuous evolution.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:11.960
Yeah.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.800
So you think.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800
There'll be some like low single type thing,

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.840
like John Smith type of situation.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.520
Well, like a down block go behind is something

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.160
that has really, I would say really in the last five-ish

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.680
years has really been evolved.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.560
What's a go behind?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560
Down block go behind.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.880
So when you shoot, well, they just head inside

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.360
or head outside matters, but there's one for both.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.120
You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.280
And then, so that was kind of in existence

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280
when I was in college, right?

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.560
You down block them and you stop,

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.080
but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.480
And now immediately as you shoot,

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.160
I attack that shoulder and then I start hitting

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.120
a go behind on you, right?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.320
And so like that in its current incarnation,

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.040
it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.800
I would say it probably became popular

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.040
five to seven years ago.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.000
So yeah, there's these big things that are happening.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.400
Now I really want to roll back

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.520
because I want to be ahead of the game.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.320
I want to know what I'm missing.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.720
I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.720
that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.480
much more than humans do.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.080
So it'll give you a piece

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.800
and not only does it give you a piece,

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.800
it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.160
So-

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.120
Because it knows that that's better for the long term.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.960
Long term.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.680
So like humans rarely sacrifice

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.880
without getting the piece back

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.560
like two or three moves after.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.280
Alpha Zero can wait like five moves.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.520
So basically you'll have, potentially with wrestling,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.440
you might have a robot that like puts itself

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.840
in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.720
that will actually turn out-

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.040
Lures the opponent in to trap.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:45.880
Exactly.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.720
That's what my style is based on.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.920
Well, you basically narrow,

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.440
one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.880
You put yourself in a bad position,

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.200
but it narrows the set of choices.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.400
For them, because they're not used to it.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.120
Yeah, they're not used to it.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:02.320
And then you drag them into your, yeah.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.760
So, but there's also,

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.880
the problem is there's mechanical issues.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.040
Like it's actually just difficult to build robots

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.320
that are able to sense,

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.720
because we have sensation throughout our body.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.560
Yeah.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.000
It's just difficult to build that kind of robot.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:16.840
It's expensive.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.600
You start talking about multi-million dollars

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.840
and then people start asking you questions.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.640
Why did you invest all of this money?

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.960
I'm gonna ask you what moves I do.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.800
Duh.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.920
Hello.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.360
It could be a better investment.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.680
Okay.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.080
So I mentioned John Smith.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.360
He is, if people don't know,

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.320
one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.920
He's also creative like you.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.720
He spoke really highly of you.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720
What do you think about that guy?

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.240
Did you guys ever work together?

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.160
Not really.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.320
So, so you know what?

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.160
When I was a senior

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.040
and I had the people wrestling in my head,

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.880
I was lucky enough to be doing,

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.760
I was pretty much graduated.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.760
So I did an independent study with the sports.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.720
I was potentially going to go to grad school

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.560
for sports psych.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.720
Well, I actually did nine credits

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.480
and then I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.920
I continued learning on my own.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.240
But I did independent study with the guy

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.240
who's the head of USA track and field sports psych.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.520
So the class was,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.560
I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.360
And he was like fascinated by me.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.920
So he didn't really make me do homework.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.520
It was like the greatest three credits ever.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.360
We just talked.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.200
I learned so much.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.240
It was so awesome.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320
But so I started,

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.920
so one time it came up that I had these robot

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.240
or people wrestling in my head, you know?

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.400
And he said, well, who else do you think?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.800
I said, I bet John Smith happened.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.080
So I went and got John Smith's number

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.400
and called him and said, hey,

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.520
you ever had these people wrestling in your head?

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.680
And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching,

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.840
they went away.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.920
Same thing happened to me.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.440
So they started coaching.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.280
They went away.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.520
So if I really force myself now,

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.160
and I'm like, you know, I see some in practice

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.200
and it's really higher level

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.240
because high school wrestling,

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.560
I don't want to make you guys feel bad,

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.400
but it's like, it's a little bit lower level, right?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.560
So if like Keegan, for example, who won the junior,

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.000
if he's struggling with a problem or asked me a question

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.640
and I can force myself to like see the body's moving

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.960
and think about it again, you know,

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.360
kind of like I wasn't early age,

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.840
but it won't just flow there anymore.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.840
So he said it went away.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.400
And for me, it went away also.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.400
By the way, if you can pause on the bodies in your head,

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.560
how are they generating new ideas?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.960
Are they just kind of?

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.120
I don't know.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.200
You tell me.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.960
So it's just, they're just like scrambling in your head?

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.960
It would be specifically based on a problem

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.240
I was struggling with or a specific position, you know?

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.760
It goes in for a single and then go from there.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.880
Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.240
and I don't have to work that hard because it's easy, right?

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.720
And yeah, I'm just sitting there like kind of acting

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.760
like I'm looking at the board and these guys are wrestling

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.960
and I'm watching them wrestle.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.960
And yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.360
Is there somebody you looked up to style-wise?

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.360
Not Gable, John Smith, all these like legend status people?

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.080
Probably Gable, John Smith, but after the fact.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.400
So the problem with wrestling in my era

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.800
was you couldn't watch it.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.560
There was no access, right?

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560
It wasn't really available.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.760
Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.760
they're kind of hard to find, right?

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.080
There's a couple of them on YouTube,

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.040
but I've obviously seen all of those.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.080
But in my era, there really wasn't any of it.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.560
So it was hard to be a fan of something.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.200
And that's why wrestling, the fans are going like this

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.760
because now you can flip on the Flow app

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.000
and you can watch something that's happening in Europe,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:29.840
right?

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.640
We can do this easily so we can be a fan of people.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.440
So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.600
because there just was no access.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.080
So now I can watch them when I like

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.120
and say, oh shit, like that guy's wrestling.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360
Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.400
You know, that type of thing.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.440
You know, on a quick rant, it's really frustrating

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.640
that you can't watch the Olympics.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.720
Oh my God, it's so frustrating.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.960
I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on that point.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.840
Go to NBC's headquarters, I'll go with you.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.760
You got a soldier here.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.520
I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.240
He was surprised by this too.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240
Most matches you can't see.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.640
Even you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steel's,

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.760
and you can't see the full match.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.880
You get like a crappy highlight.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.600
So the two biggest things in wrestling,

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.120
and really the three, the NCAA championships on ESPN,

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.120
the Olympic trials are on NBC and the Olympics are on NBC.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.440
And these companies are so big,

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.400
they don't have a department dedicated to selling the rights

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.000
to that footage, right?

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.160
So the rights to wrestling footage,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.600
which no one really cares all that much about

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.680
except a niche, are the exact same as track and field

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.920
or basketball in the Olympics.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.680
So yes, all of this stuff

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.680
is completely inaccessible to us.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.240
The NCAAs, the Olympic trials and the Olympics,

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.600
you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.240
Yeah, old, the current film.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.720
Yeah.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.640
So you can't even watch the Gable match?

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.720
The Gable Steel, no.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.480
They did a, you know, they do something

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.000
that annoys the fuck out of me.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.280
What? Okay.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.280
They do like a three or two minute highlight.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.040
So it's like they capture the most important thing,

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.880
but like it's all about the buildup.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.840
It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.280
and the nerves and you walk out and like that,

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.720
I mean, I don't know, you miss,

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.720
then when the triumph happens or the heartbreak happens,

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.600
it has that much more power.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.840
Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN,

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.160
I'm happy to join that.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.000
I think, unfortunately, the IOC.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.640
Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.920
IOC is selling for the Olympics is the one that's making.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.520
Well, so NBC broadcast,

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.600
so they obviously have the live rights.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.400
You would think they would have recorded,

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.880
if they, I mean, they're the ones recording it,

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.640
you would think they keep the rights when you think so.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.640
No, no, no, they're getting a license of it.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.440
They're getting exclusive like license,

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.640
but like the, you know, for example,

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.480
I've had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player,

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.680
and there's a really sort of famous match,

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.560
it's a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics,

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.360
where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.600
It's a 20 minute match to go to war,

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.320
and that's not available anywhere,

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.760
but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.200
The reason I know this is on the IOC channel.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.400
So they've uploaded all of these matches.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.040
They have it and then put it up.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.240
So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won,

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.080
got put public, and so I don't know if it was private.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.120
It got put up on YouTube.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.040
I was alerted to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:42.880
It was so dumb.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.720
I'm like, what?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.400
This is, I think 13 years later, this is bullshit.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.800
Like this should have been up.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.600
So I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.080
That has to be the USOC then or NBC?

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.280
So I know like, okay, so I know Flo, right?

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.280
I know that there's a lot of things that work for them.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.880
I know if Flo buys your event or whatever, right?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.400
They buy the rights.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.520
Generally in the contract,

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.400
they'll have rights to both live stream it

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.400
and then use that footage at any point moving forward.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.760
So those matches live on Flo's website.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.880
That's why I would be surprised

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.920
that if NBC didn't have something similar.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.760
Flo does a pretty good job of providing like a place

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.080
where you can watch all these matches.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.000
NBC does not.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:23.840
Does not, yeah.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.120
And also there's an argument with Flo as well,

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:28.680
but certainly with Olympics,

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.920
there's a difference between what Flo does

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.640
and what the Olympics represent.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.800
What do you mean by that?

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.840
Like it feels like the Olympics,

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.080
which is what the charter says,

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:41.320
should be as accessible as possible.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.160
Yes, that's true.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.120
Like you should really lower the barrier

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.800
for entry for the Olympics.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.040
You know that's what the charter says,

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.120
but those people in the IOC,

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.000
those, we said they're the worst people ever.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.840
Yeah.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.680
They're very bad.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.640
Well, they're not bad.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.720
They just lost touch of the dream they once had

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.880
when they joined the IOC.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.920
I would argue all the way back

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.400
that these are rich fat cats who like,

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.760
I get so mad about the NCAA,

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.360
which finally now got rid of this term,

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.120
bullshit term amateurism.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.760
It's like, well, there's some holy grail

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.160
where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.840
but the people who own the IOC

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.360
are the people who own the institutions,

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.080
college institutions are making boatloads of money

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:17.920
off of you.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.200
That's crap.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:24.200
So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.320
Did you believe you can win gold?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.840
Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.520
So your mental game was on point.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.440
Yeah, I was ready.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.480
So what went wrong?

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.880
This wasn't good enough.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.840
That was what I said.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.680
Yeah.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.440
Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time,

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.800
it was my first year of international competition.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.360
So when I came out in 2007,

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.320
it was my first time making 74 kilograms,

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.560
which is pretty small for me.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.880
I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.000
and I was having success.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.840
In America, I was beating everyone.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.200
I don't want to say easy, but yeah,

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.440
I was doing really well.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.400
I went international one time

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.720
and there was one match I got cheated on.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.880
The Russians, they're cheaters.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.680
I think it was Ukraine, not Russia.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.600
I lost one real match where I actually lost.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600
And it was to Denis Sargush,

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.160
who had gone to win three world titles,

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.960
but he was behind the tee of that year

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.200
and it was competitive.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.840
So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.680
I beat a bunch of other guys who were good,

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.640
had passed decent results.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.000
So I knew I was right there.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.040
Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora,

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.160
and I had someone do scouting reports for him.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.000
Actually, my high school coach,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.560
you know, coaches for our academy, John Messimerick,

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560
and Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.920
I got him and I lost him second round.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.040
So I wasn't good enough.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.000
Had I decided to keep wrestling,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.080
I probably would have gotten better,

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.880
but at that point in time, this wasn't in the cards.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.520
So in your division was, like you said, Satiev,

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.680
Vyacheslav Satiev.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.120
That guy is special.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.240
He's very special.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.120
So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.760
who I enjoyed watching.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.200
And that was a guy, again, it was kind of after the fact

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.400
because it was hard to access footage,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.280
but he was a lot of fun to watch.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.960
What do you think made him great?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.240
A lot of people talked about him

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.280
as potentially one of the greatest ever.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.120
Absolutely.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.800
So he won six in three, six Worlds,

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.720
six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total,

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.120
which there's only one or two people above that.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.960
So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him,

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.400
but from what I've seen, his feel is different.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.000
He was just ahead of his time

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.400
and the feel and the touch he had for certain moves

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.560
and different things, because obviously physically

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.240
he's kind of unimposing.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.280
He's taller and skinnier, which is,

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.560
it can work in wrestling, but it is by less represented.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.240
Yeah, he was special.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.520
So good.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.560
Do you take any inspiration from,

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.200
let's talk about Dagestan in general.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.680
What do you think makes those wrestlers great?

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.120
Yeah, it's fascinating.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.280
Have you read the book, The Talent Code?

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.120
Yeah.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:07.960
It's great.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.120
And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:09.960
all around the world.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.000
So now obviously with our wrestling academies,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.480
we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.280
I got to assume they didn't cover Dagestan

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.160
in that book specifically,

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.080
but I got to assume a lot of the same principles

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.360
that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.680
They did South Korea and women's golf.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.400
They did Curacao and baseball.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.520
They picked a lot of these other places

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.920
that were really elite.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.720
I think it was maybe Moscow and women's tennis also.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:42.200
So I think all these things that make any group great

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.200
or organization is probably the same things

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.360
that's happening there.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.600
Well, the hardship, I mean,

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.440
is there something specific about wrestling

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.400
that can create so many great champions?

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.080
From that area, so obviously they all love it.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.160
Like it's a big deal that wrestling specifically

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.000
is a big deal there.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.680
You know, they do Sambo also, obviously.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.920
So that's part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.640
They obviously are rough tumble, tough life.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.840
Getting a lot of fights.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.520
And then I think that also that a lot of them,

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.720
it is a way out, right?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.760
They're the elite level athletes in that part of the world

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.680
from my understanding are really well compensated

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.240
compared to what the average person makes

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.200
and they're treated really well.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.920
So people see it as a way out.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.800
Whereas like, and then honestly, if America is getting better,

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.720
but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA was

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.440
because I didn't want to be poorer than my whole life.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.280
You know what I'm saying?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.120
It sucked.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.040
It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.120
for the next 48 years.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.040
So I'm going to go do something else.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.080
If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.560
If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling,

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.200
I probably would have kept wrestling.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.240
So I think, I think it's those factors.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.040
And obviously now they have a really like,

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.880
a bunch of really good people in one area.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.400
So there's probably, it's been going on for a long time.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.160
So there's probably been a bunch of like adults

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.680
and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.680
So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.280
So I'm definitely going to travel there as I talk to them

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.320
because I can speak Russian.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.640
That makes it makes it very,

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.720
makes me uniquely qualified to.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.280
My brother can speak a little bit of Russian.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.120
Your brother can?

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:16.960
Yeah.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.680
Okay, like a little bit like two swears and hello?

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.520
No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.920
Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me overstep.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.720
I think he would be able to have a conversation with you.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.560
I think.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.600
Okay.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.480
Probably not like you.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.160
What's the, what's the reason he knows Russian?

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.040
I don't know why he got obsessed with languages.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.000
And so his college degree is actually,

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.680
what do they call, interdis, where you have three minors.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.240
So he had a minor in Russian,

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:45.240
a minor in Spanish and maybe Japanese.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.960
I'm messing up.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.360
It's definitely, he's Russian and Spanish for sure.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.760
I don't know what the third one is.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.880
No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.040
But the, the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling,

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.080
like they don't really go super hard.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:22:59.920
Yeah.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.760
And I only spent a couple.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.320
So I was there, I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.960
That was where the World Cup was.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.000
We had to train there for like two days afterwards.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.520
So I didn't get to dig deep,

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.160
did dig deep into what was going on or anything.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.840
But yeah, I mean, I think sparring has,

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.120
a sparring is very beneficial for wrestling.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.440
Not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.280
Sparring in wrestling is,

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.360
so I always just describe it to be really simple.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.880
If we're drilling, it's relatively zero percent resistance.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.840
If we're going as hard as we can, that's a hundred percent.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.600
There's all this gray area in the middle,

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.760
that's sparring, right?

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.760
And so, you know, if you have a good relationship,

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.520
like, you know, especially college, me and my brother,

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.240
we can just go and we know where each other's at.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.440
We don't even have to talk about it, right?

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.880
But like in my wrestling club, I'll say,

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.440
okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.200
Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.040
And this is for him.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.520
So I want him to go 70.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.160
And defensive guy, I want you to go 40.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.880
So you're not supposed to be trying to win here.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.720
You're gonna go a little later.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:03.400
I want you to give him some looks, you know?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.200
So I think it has really taken hold of America.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.000
I think it's really beneficial for success.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.640
And I think that's, I mean,

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.960
America's doing better than we've ever done historically.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.240
Well, that's 70 and 40.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.360
That's like an art form to find that right place.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.800
Because like what the really good people I've trained with,

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.800
they go much closer to 100% speed-wise.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.760
Or like, but without like forcing things

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.880
the way you would when you're going.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.720
It's some weird combination of things that,

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.320
like if you truly earn a technique,

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.520
then you're given that technique.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.200
But like, if you don't, you don't.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.240
And then it becomes much less injury-prone.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.560
It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.440
You don't get stuck in positions.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.520
It's just a lot of movement.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.240
Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about,

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.040
you know, like different ways to learn and get better.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.600
And so I think John obviously innovated

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.320
within the sport of Jiu-Jitsu.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.520
And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.360
I think about it like-

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.240
Sorry to interrupt.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.120
You have this academy and you sent me this plan

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.040
that you have a really well thought through plan

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.280
for how to develop a good wrestler.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.960
So I think it's, so for me there's four categories, right?

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.240
There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.400
You're coming in and I'm showing you the move

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.680
and you're literally going out there and you're trying.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.240
To me, that's not even drilling.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.160
That's like teaching.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.480
Like you're trying to learn something.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.320
So obviously in someone's earlier periods,

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.920
they're spending a lot of time in that phase

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.360
because they literally don't even know

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.640
how to move their bodies the right way.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.880
Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.160
because you need to, you absolutely have to get those reps

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.120
to become really proficient in that movement

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.200
and then the sparring and then the live, right?

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.360
And so like, I think obviously by the time you get

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.760
to the kind of, I don't want to say end point, right?

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.280
But further on, the time you spend teaching is so,

01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.560
I don't want to say in, I'm sorry,

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.480
in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.320
but it's so much smaller

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.480
because to someone who's really good,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.040
who have coached for 10 years,

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.600
I don't have to give this big, long drawn out explanation.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.480
I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.000
or just do this, right?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.360
We don't have to spend any time there.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.360
So I think that's like something that consumes

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.880
for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13,

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.560
we're consuming a massive amount of time there

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.720
on that teaching, learning phase.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.520
And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.080
But that makes total sense, right?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.280
Yeah.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.480
It's funny because when you look at like Jiu-Jitsu schools,

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.920
they spend a lot of time in the teaching, learning,

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.160
and then the live, it feels like there's not enough drilling.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.240
I like how you draw a distinction there

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.640
because it feels like you're always starting from scratch.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.840
Like people have like very crappy short-term memory.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.880
Like they're not, like the way teaching is done

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.040
is you show a technique from scratch

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.080
and it seems disjoint.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.840
It is for sure, especially if you have a class

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.280
that's been with you for a while,

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.360
you don't have to start from scratch.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.160
You can say, hey, let's focus on this one little thing here

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.200
or after we do this, let's do that,

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.280
and you kind of start putting it all together.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.720
And then with Jiu-Jitsu, the thing that I really struggled

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.040
with was a couple of things.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.960
It was, and this is not speaking for all the Jiu-Jitsu,

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.920
my personal experience through the sport.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.880
And I actually found my, so when I unretired,

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.680
I found someone really great that I loved

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.120
and I really wish it was Mark Lehman.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.200
I don't know if you know him at all.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.480
I wish I would have found him earlier

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.000
because he was just tremendous.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.560
But number one, there's no drilling.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.840
So it's like in wrestling, I can boil down to,

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.680
I could probably name you the best six moves, right?

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.600
So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.320
Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.840
It always has been, I don't know, probably always will be

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.000
unless they figure out something different.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.360
The robot.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.480
The robot figures out something different.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.800
We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.640
Why?

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.800
Because everyone's gonna do that, right?

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.440
We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.120
So just like say an arm bar or some type of sweep, right?

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.920
Why can't we go get 50 reps there?

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.560
Hey, I mean, by the time I've been in your jujitsu school

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.360
for two years, I better know a fucking arm bar.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.480
I better know it.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.320
So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.960
Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.680
And then if when I'm hitting my reps,

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.440
if there's something I'm doing wrong,

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.280
then just say, hey Ben, move your leg a little bit that way

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.080
or raise your hips up a little more, right?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.280
Like correct as you're drilling

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.680
so you're getting all these reps at it

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.360
so you're becoming more proficient.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.880
And then the other thing I really struggled with was,

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.200
to your point during live,

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.200
so many times it's just this five minute go, go, go.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.280
And that's not the most efficient way to learn

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.280
because when you have two people,

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.280
especially when they're focused on winning,

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.000
and you say go, they're gonna go to wherever they do best.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.680
Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something,

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.920
I don't want you doing what you do best all the time.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.840
I need you doing some other things, right?

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.960
If you have a great single leg,

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.080
but you can't shoot to the other side of their body,

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.800
we need to work on that, right?

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.640
You need to start shooting the other side.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.520
There's some sense that you,

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.800
it's not like you should be told what to work on,

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.000
but you should be told to work on the thing

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.360
that you wanna work on.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.040
Meaning, because I don't know,

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.200
maybe you can comment on this,

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.800
but everybody develops a different game

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.840
as you get better and better.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.680
There's a set of things you need to be working on.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.240
So I actually have, like when I,

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.160
especially when I'm training very seriously,

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.160
I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.960
and I have a sheet of paper on the side

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.880
where I literally in my head keep counting off

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.360
how many times I put myself in that position

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.400
and pulled off the technique.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.960
And that's all I care about in like training.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.400
So I'll just, whatever it is,

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.200
if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine,

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.360
arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don't,

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.240
I love numbers, so I'll say like,

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.360
I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.640
and I'm not getting off the mat until I do.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.920
And that, you know, if it takes-

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.120
And it's drilling or live contest?

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.400
So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.240
is the live contest.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.080
Okay, got it.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.920
But drilling obviously, drilling,

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:00.760
so I feel like-

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:01.960
I can't find a drilling part,

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.480
like it's so hard to find drilling partners, even-

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.600
So boring.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.920
It's annoying to me that this is boring

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.920
and there's nothing more annoying to me

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.240
than the look of boredom on another person's face

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.080
when we're drilling.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.920
Yeah.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.740
It's like-

01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.640
Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:17.160
Cause you said it to Josh.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.200
Yeah, so he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.520
Why?

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.600
Why am I an idiot or why is drilling beneficial?

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.000
Well, let's go with what your explanation is.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.240
Why is it so beneficial?

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.560
I think for me, there's a meditative aspect to it

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.920
where the more you drill,

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.040
the more you start noticing the details.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.720
Okay, let me push back a little bit here.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.840
I'm not gonna push back all the way.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.200
Cause every time, if I was wrestling,

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.680
I won't high-crouch and like whatever, right?

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.760
But even so say like at a high level

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.000
when I'm really wrestling say 10 years ago,

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.800
even during that drill portion,

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.520
if we talk about the resistance of our opponent

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.080
from zero to 100,

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.040
it's very likely that my partner at that point

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.520
makes these people I'm really comfortable with.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.400
They're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.840
They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.680
or I gotta get through their hands.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.080
If I don't set it up right,

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.920
they might put their arm down, right?

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.000
So it's like we are drilling

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.520
cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level,

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.720
but there's a little bit of sparring.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.800
The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.600
Yeah, so that's not really drilling.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.640
Cause I think it's drilling.

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:27.920
I think literally you're shooting and I'm just like,

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.080
boom, I'm like, show me your dummy.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.120
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.240
No, it's very hard to be a dummy that doesn't do 20%.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.240
So you're gonna do 20%, yeah.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.400
So yes, that's 20%.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.240
But-

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.080
So that's like sparring a little bit then.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.800
No, but they're not really resisting.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.600
They're just giving you the right frame.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.280
They're giving you the right like movement

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.880
and they're being an intelligent dummy essentially.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.440
I mean, but also like the really important component of this

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.360
is you pick the techniques for which it's beneficial.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.640
If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it,

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.200
you don't want to be doing that with,

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.560
I'm saying like there's certain moves

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.880
and I like those moves

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.240
and I select the game base in those moves.

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.600
Like, so are you drilling to get better

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.360
or are you drilling just to work out?

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.760
No, to get better.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.640
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:17.840
I believe you can become like exceptionally good

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.240
very fast by drilling.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.080
But how?

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.640
First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.800
Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.280
a particular move? Absolutely, millions.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.880
Millions, you haven't drilled millions.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.680
Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.800
I think you're just saying numbers.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.640
I don't think you know what 100,000-

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.080
The number is freaking astronomical.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.000
It's way more than 10,000.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.560
I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.960
Dude, there was a 10 year period

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.120
where I wrestled every single day.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.520
That's 3,000 days.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.800
So you're telling me 10,000, that's only three of them a day.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.760
I do way more than that.

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.600
Three of them?

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.440
Probably 30 of them a day.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.400
That's 100,000.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.120
Yeah, hundreds of thousands.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.600
I doubt you did 30 a day for-

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.600
I did, for sure, 100%.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.840
There's no doubt.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.160
Because some days I might do 100, right?

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.880
So 30 of 30 is not very many.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.240
Especially if we count all reps,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.320
if we're counting drilling and live.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.960
So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.000
and I just hated it.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.480
So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar.

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.120
You shoot a high crotch, we'll start.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.160
Coach wants to drill a high crotch.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.000
Okay, we'll start.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.120
You shoot the high crotch, that's great.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.360
Then I'm gonna sit the corner

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.240
or I'm gonna give you my hip or I'm gonna try something.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.240
So then you have to react.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:29.400
And I would argue that all skill level

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:34.000
past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.200
I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.200
It's back and forth.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.640
I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.880
I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.400
And you have to start unconsciously programming

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.240
these things in your head

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.280
because if you're too conscious to think about it,

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.720
it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it in a match.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.120
But the drilling is the unconscious programming.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.160
But the simple movement, the first simple movement,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.240
that single leg or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.040
I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.640
is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.680
at doing other things around it.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.800
No, but that's the key word, you feel.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.160
Okay, I think if we did a study on it,

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.560
then I would be proven correct.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.240
No, perhaps.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.960
So first of all, your brain,

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.900
as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:24.880
it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling.

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.720
It's obvious that you're such a creative energy

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.440
that you're just not going to be somebody

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.440
who's going to enjoy that.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.560
So enjoyment is probably,

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.880
having an active mind is really important.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.840
So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.720
that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.680
And I have that mind.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.320
But do you really think, okay, so if you're,

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.240
let's pick a technique,

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.320
what technique do you want to drill a lot?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.840
I would do jiu-jitsu or wrestling.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840
Whatever you want.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.480
It's hard to describe with words,

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.440
but certain guard passes.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.040
Let me think, just guard pass.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.960
Okay, so you have a guard pass

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.520
and you get it to be a nine and a half out of 10, right?

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.000
Just from a technical standpoint.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.720
Don't you think you need some resistance to feel?

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.200
Because essentially, all benefit after that

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.200
is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.400
And if they shift it that way,

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.640
do I need to sink here or move there?

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.120
So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing,

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.200
but maybe terminology-wise.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.960
Well, the split is the important thing,

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.600
like how much of each.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.280
So I think it is sparring.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.600
I think it's a very light touch spar

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.040
is what you're talking about,

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.480
which is, in my opinion, really isn't drilling.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.560
And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency,

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.040
I don't think brings much value.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.280
No, but that's what I'm trying to tell you

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.880
is I think it does.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:50.880
I think doing that same movement,

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.920
I think you begin to learn more over time.

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.760
Like you're saying, once you get the basic proficiency,

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.040
then there's diminishing returns.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:00.880
I don't think so.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.720
Yes, that's what I think.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.560
I don't think so.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.760
I think everything has diminishing returns

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.280
when you're learning a technique.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.080
But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling,

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.000
if you can have way more gains over here,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.680
why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.640
If this other area,

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:19.800
if you're spending so much time here

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.800
that there's other areas left unexplored,

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.600
you can make gigantic gains over there.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.200
No, but you're gonna lose,

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.000
I think a lot depends on your style.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I think a lot is determined by how good you are at one thing.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.520
And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.720
and then make your whole game

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.960
where it's all pulled into that system,

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.800
then I don't know.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.960
I think one is too small of a number.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.360
Yeah, it's small.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.880
I feel like you can't be easily this, like...

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.080
Yeah, you wanna create funnels.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.280
Funnels. Funnels, right?

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.600
Where everything goes into a few positions.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.440
And then it's all feels.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.520
Where ideally you win 100%.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.520
Yeah. Yeah.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.520
But I feel that you can get like drilling on a dummy

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.000
80% of the time and 20% of the time live rolling

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.640
with people worse than you,

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.240
like a little bit worse than you or a lot worse than you.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.280
Yeah, so I definitely think...

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.840
So my buildup would be teach.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.480
So we're talking about complex technique, right?

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.400
So by the time we're talking about,

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.840
we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient,

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.760
he's probably done the drilling part.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.240
So then now it's like,

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.360
okay, if I wanna get something new to you,

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.520
I'll probably tell you,

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.880
you'll probably be able to do the basic premise

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.440
within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:36.840
And then they'll be like,

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.680
okay, they do this.

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.520
Okay, they do it.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.360
Then it's like, okay.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.200
So now here's from here, what are we gonna do?

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.040
We're gonna go light sparring.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:42.880
So I know you have success

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.720
because I need you to complete the task

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.560
in order to get better at it.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.600
That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.120
is they just wanna go to the toughest person.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.640
But if you go to the toughest person,

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.160
you're not gonna actually execute on any skills.

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.320
You're gonna get a workout and I need you to execute

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.160
because I need you to get good at this

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.000
in order to get good at it.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.520
You have to get all the way through the technique.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.840
Why do you need them to complete

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.880
just so they gain confidence in the technique

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.720
or they go through all the stuff?

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.680
You gotta go all the way through.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.640
Like if I said, learn a high crotch

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.680
when you're drilling but stop halfway every time.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.640
But you're not actually gonna be able to do it

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.680
because you're gonna stop and you're not gonna feel.

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.240
So try it on someone, spar lightly, get it.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.320
Do it on someone who's not as good as you get it.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.240
Then kind of work your way up the ladder

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.880
so you can get it on someone your own skill level

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.960
or maybe better than you in a live competition.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.280
So it's like, I don't know,

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.760
I feel like that basic drilling,

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.240
so a kid like Keegan who I've worked with a few times,

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.560
I feel like if there's something new,

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.840
I could literally tell him this is what I want you to do

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.440
and he has such a great feel.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.920
He could go drill it proficiently

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.160
within probably a minute or two.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.800
But then to hit it on someone high level,

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.280
that's gonna take quite a while longer.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.040
And that's a mix of drilling and sparring

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.840
on people a little bit worse than you.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.840
Yeah, and then equal and then better.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:53.680
Okay.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.320
Because there's just, with grappling,

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.840
there's such a feel component to the pressure,

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.280
the movement, all these things.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.160
And there's still so many things

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.080
that you can throw at someone out of one position,

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.360
not just moves, but moves at different levels of force

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.560
or whatever.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.840
Are you and these kids developing a big picture strategy

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.680
of what are the main setups and takedowns

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.440
and just a whole system?

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.240
So I sent you our technique book, right,

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.720
and how we approach it.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.520
So I think in wrestling, you're going to need,

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.840
you're gonna need a handful of things

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.000
just off the word go, right?

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.200
You're going to, so I think on our feet,

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.800
I need to bell tech this side of the body,

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.880
I need to bell tech that side of the body,

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.880
I need to be able to bring you underneath me,

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.920
I need to be able to go around you, right?

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.760
Now we can accomplish those different ways,

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.400
but we should have all of those weapons

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.200
if we wanna be really good some way, right?

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.440
So if I neglect one of those,

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.360
so if I neglect the ability to say pull you down

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.400
right from how to lock you,

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.520
now if I have a good shot and you're smart,

01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.560
you're just gonna lower your stance,

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:02.000
so my shot is not gonna be as successful

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
and I have the inability to pull you down, right?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.160
So I kind of need all of those so I can,

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.240
as they get better, I can point those things out.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.160
On bottom, my folks out bottom,

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.880
there's certain things like

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:15.560
you have to be good at leg right defense, right?

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.360
You have to, I mean, at a high level,

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.240
or you're just gonna, when you get it in,

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.240
you're just gonna get stuck there,

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.440
not gonna be able to escape.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.960
But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.160
that you can choose from and I'm gonna,

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.480
depending on your body style and what you're good and bad at,

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.400
I'm gonna probably develop something a little different.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.480
I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.160
you'd be better as a knee slide, whatever.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.640
Yeah, top, kind of same thing.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.440
I have to ask you about Khabib.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.080
So I remember a while ago,

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.080
Rogan said that that's the perfect fight for Khabib, you are.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.040
So let me ask two questions.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.600
The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.320
when you're at your peak?

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.880
I don't like, yeah, I mean, this is one of those people

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.040
where people will get really mad at me if I say yes,

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:02.880
but yeah, I mean, I think.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.700
But how would you do it?

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.280
How would you solve that puzzle?

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.120
Yeah.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.920
I mean, we would grapple

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.160
and I think I would be better than him,

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.360
but as I feel weird saying this,

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.840
people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit, you know?

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.080
But no one outgrappled him, right?

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.720
I mean, nobody did and maybe I'm wrong in this,

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.000
but if we look at the best possible candidates,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.160
I'm definitely one of them,

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.600
and then obviously I'd have a small size advantage too.

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.040
So in a wrestling match,

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:33.080
so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match,

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.320
what do you think is the right strategy on him?

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.160
Like, do you understand his style,

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.120
that his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.080
Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.160
Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately, fought any real,

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.520
who I would say really, really high level wrestlers.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.440
I was actually really disappointed

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.920
how bad Justin Gagee's wrestling was,

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:55.720
because Justin Gagee had some solid success,

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.120
but his wrestling was really bad in that fight.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.440
Gagee had success in CWA?

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.320
Yeah, I think he was seventh place maybe,

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.600
or somewhere, he was definitely all American.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.880
He was lower though.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.200
So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt with someone

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.480
who was like, oh man, this guy's a really high level wrestler,

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.600
because you know, we saw, and this is early in his career,

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.840
but you know, Glaston Tebow did give him some issues

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:19.960
earlier in his career.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.680
So I would like to see him in that situation

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.520
and see how he does.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.600
I would love to like, you know,

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.040
I just love wrestling and grappling.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.560
Like, yeah, I'd love it if someone said,

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.680
hey, Ben, you know, Khabib wants to roll with you.

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:31.880
Okay, I'm there tomorrow.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.800
It sounds like a blast, let's go.

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.760
He's probably competitive as hell.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.600
Yeah.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.800
You're still competitive?

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.320
I know when to be and when not to be.

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.040
Like, you know, say if I'm going to the high school kids,

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.920
or I'm not going to be competitive,

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.520
because then I'm just being a dick.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.960
How would you take him down?

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:48.840
What?

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:49.680
You're talking about real wrestling?

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.520
Like wrestling, wrestling?

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.360
Wrestling, wrestling.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.720
I would probably try to take single legs and stuff.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.560
Single legs.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.400
Yeah.

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:57.720
Okay.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.560
No, no.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.080
No, I've, honestly, I don't have the slightest clue.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080
I'd have to feel, I'd feel him out.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.240
But single legs is my best take down.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.720
People talk about his wrestling being really good.

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.560
Yeah.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.400
People that train with him.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.280
So, okay, so I grilled someone,

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.200
I will not say who, on the Ed Ruth thing,

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.560
because Ed Ruth is very elite and focused on wrestling.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.720
He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.800
Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.000
They were on the same team for a while, yeah.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:21.840
Okay.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.880
And there was rumors that Khabib beat him up,

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.160
and I said, I sure can't believe that.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.520
And I've heard that that was,

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.880
if they were just straight wrestling,

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.080
Ed would get slightly the better of it.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.200
Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.040
He's great.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:36.880
He's really good.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.040
Yeah.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.520
So that was what I heard.

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:41.360
But in an MMA setting,

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.040
because of all the tools that Khabib would get him.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:46.400
I don't know.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.400
Well, but I agree.

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.760
I agree with Rogan on this one.

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.720
That would have been good to see.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.560
Yeah, that would have been fun.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.240
So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I'd love it.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.240
I love wrestling and grappling.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.160
I don't do much Jiu-Jitsu,

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.600
because I just don't have time for it anymore.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.280
I'm at the wrestling academy like every single day.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.880
But I love Jiu-Jitsu.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.720
Well, I did it.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.520
And if I didn't have a wrestling academy,

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.960
I probably would still be doing Jiu-Jitsu.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.040
Yeah, you do well in Jiu-Jitsu as well.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.120
But let me ask you a ridiculous question.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.520
Who's the greatest of all time?

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:15.000
Freestyle or folk style?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:15.840
Oh, wrestling.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.560
Hmm.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.080
Well, I will say my knowledge past the year 2000

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.200
is really not that great,

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.040
because you can't-

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:26.860
You mean in which direction?

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:27.700
Sorry, after 2000?

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:28.540
No, no, before.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.040
Because you can't find any film or anything, you know?

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.240
And so you hear of all these-

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.320
So you need evidence?

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320
You need direct evidence?

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.000
I want to be able to watch them and see them

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.680
and feel the times and feel their opponents

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.960
and all those things to really like,

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.760
I hate giving bad answers, you know?

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.120
So I would, there's just not enough footage

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:44.960
of any of those people.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.760
We go back to someone like Alexander Medved.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.960
Like, you can't find footage,

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.320
you can't find anything on him, you know?

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.160
It's like, who is he wrestling?

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.200
I mean, I'm not sure.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:58.200
So post-2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle, so-

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.800
Americans, Russians?

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.720
Tsitiyev has probably the best argument post-2000.

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.560
I think Tsitiyev, if you-

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.960
Yeah, the Russian tank, that guy is, yeah.

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.400
So who's better, Snyder or Tsitiyev?

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.840
So Tsitiyev just won at the Olympics.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.720
I understand this, I understand how that works,

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.960
but they're pretty close, right?

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.000
Not really.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.880
Not that match, but in general, the matchup.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.840
So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.880
Said July have pinned him the following year.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.560
But then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.520
and then just lost.

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.160
I don't want to say fairly decisively,

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.200
but it was six to three and there was a late takedown.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.240
He kind of gave it up and maybe if it was really competitive,

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.360
maybe he wouldn't have taken a wrestle again

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.280
in like two weeks here.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.840
So that, you know, yeah, I mean,

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.160
you have to say said July have at this point.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.800
There's nothing else to say unless Kyle proves us otherwise.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.720
Yeah, not enough people talk about said July have.

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.600
Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.120
You think Kyle should go to MMA?

01:45:59.120 --> 01:45:59.960
Some of these guys.

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.640
Yeah, they're making enough money in wrestling

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.200
where they don't really feel the need to.

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.200
It's terrifying, though, as a heavyweight,

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:06.920
said July have would probably,

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.320
it's like Khabib, but heavyweight.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.200
Well, I don't know if you remember,

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.440
do you remember Bilal Mokhov?

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.960
So Bilal Mokhov actually was the Russian representative

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.800
in both styles of 2016, Greco and freestyle.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920
And he was, to my knowledge,

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.720
the only person the UFC has ever signed

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.960
that was zero in modern era, signed that was zero and zero.

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.320
And then he actually never ended up fighting.

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.720
But weird, right?

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:30.560
So yeah.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.400
No motivation.

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:32.800
Yeah, I don't know what the story is.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.120
Cause sometimes out of Russia,

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.000
I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.880
Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.680
Like they're a world champ or Olympic champ

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.760
and all of a sudden you're like, wait, where'd he go?

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:45.320
You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.960
So I forgot, but I think,

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.760
I think somebody's going to show up to your door.

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.600
I'm worried.

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.040
I honestly, I've said enough bad things

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.040
where I would be a kind of wicker on my shoulder

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.200
if I went to the gym or something, yes.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.240
I, for one, love the Russians.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.000
What about Icarus?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.840
How does that make you feel?

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.680
What about it?

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.520
It's fake news.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.360
Oh, really?

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:07.200
I'm just kidding.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.600
It's probably, yeah, maybe it is.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.560
I don't know.

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.400
I don't know what to think anymore.

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.920
Yeah.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.080
You know, it's troublesome, man.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.120
I hate cheating in all of its forms.

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.240
Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.160
that stood out to you?

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.640
Gable Stevenson, like anything like that.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.440
Gable's great, yeah.

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.840
No, I think America's coming to the point

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.000
where we're going to compete with Russia

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
every single year in wrestling, which obviously, you know,

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:35.040
long, long time ago, many, many years, we did,

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.240
we were great.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.560
And then kind of after that Soviet Union period,

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.840
I think there was a lot of poverty in that area

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.520
and that kind of led the wrestling team

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.840
going down a little bit.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.640
And then obviously a lot of those regions,

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.560
the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea,

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.000
I believe, and they've been really kind of on the upswing

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.840
for the last 20 years.

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.040
And now America really, since 2012,

01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.360
has been on the upswing in wrestling

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.760
and we're kind of really competing with them

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.880
and they're not sending a couple of their best guys.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.880
So for those who don't know,

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.600
the Olympics got put back in the air.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.320
So they are hosting the 2021 World Championships,

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.800
despite the fact that we just had the Olympics

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.640
two months ago.

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.640
So it's happening next week in Oslo, Norway.

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.320
So like Russia's not sending their number one at 57

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.720
and their number one at 65.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.520
So it's like America's probably going to win, I think.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.960
I don't want to guarantee anything,

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.640
but there's a really good chance.

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.000
Dave Taylor, all those guys competing.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.640
America gave any of the Olympians that meddled

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.440
the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off,

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.520
they just got to keep the spots

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:35.920
because they're going to be the first ones

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:36.760
who's two months later if they meddled.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.840
So the only one who's not is Gable.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.000
Gable's moving on.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.680
We have a pretty good guy behind him.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.160
Nick Wasdowski, he's a world medalist.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.160
But then he's a world's filled in the 79 spot.

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.120
Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot,

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.760
who's a world champion also.

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.040
So we have a-

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.000
It's a hell of a team.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.360
Pretty good squad, yeah.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.200
Pretty good squad.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.440
Pretty happy.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.400
So given your run in Bellatorian and one championship,

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.120
that was like one of the most dominant runs in MMA.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.320
What would you say was like key to your dominance

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.880
in that long undefeated streak?

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.240
Huh, probably consistency would be one.

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:16.600
The fact that I lived and trained the same way

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:17.920
no matter where my life was.

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:18.960
Whereas a lot of fighters,

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.920
once they start making money for the first time,

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:22.920
they have all these obligations and they travel

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.760
and they really enjoy making money

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.000
and that's kind of why some of them fall off.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.360
So you had like the same process,

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.200
like the same camp-

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:33.640
My house, I didn't vacation, everything.

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.520
Just, you know, and so that was a big part of it.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.240
Obviously the style thing is like no one could,

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.280
there was only a few people who could stop my style.

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.800
And I think I continue to get better

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.800
as a mixed martial artist and

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.280
I wasn't as innovative in mixed martial arts,

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:56.120
but there was a handful of things that I innovated,

01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.280
you know, specifically in the top position

01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.960
where I spent a lot of time,

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.800
there was just, once I got on top of you,

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.880
it was like in a spiderweb

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.040
and there was just kind of no way out, you know?

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.480
You never felt the certain things I was doing

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.920
and so people just, they gave up eventually.

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.840
How's the level of wrestling in MMA, would you say?

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.520
So I saw somewhere like champions,

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:22.760
the most popular martial art for current UFC champions

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.400
are all wrestling.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.120
So we just lost a bunch of the belts.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.400
Wrestling as a sport, right?

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.600
But yeah, one point we had,

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.560
I think it was eight of nine maybe

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.680
or something to that effect.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.920
And I think it's not just wrestling,

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.760
not just the actual martial art of wrestling

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.200
that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts,

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.560
but other things like the way we're systemized.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.280
So most kids reach high,

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.840
most kids have went through the high school program

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.680
and the college program

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.920
and they know how to show up on time

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.200
and they know how to work hard.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:56.920
So when they go to ATT or AK or wherever,

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.040
they know how to show up on time

01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:58.880
and they know how to work hard

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.720
and that's gonna get you a really long way.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.960
Just those two things, right?

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.920
Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:04.760
Those things.

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.800
Then I think you throw on top of that

01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.160
the fact that most of us have competed 1,500 to 2,000 times

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.280
probably by the time we get to 20 something,

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.520
like that's a huge advantage too.

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.480
Most of these other people from other disciplines

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.200
maybe have competed 100, if that, right?

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.320
So we have this competitive process down

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.160
really, really, really, really well.

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.080
Plus the way cut.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:24.920
The way cut.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.400
There's all these things, right, that factor into it.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.400
I think the fact that we're really open-minded.

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:32.320
I think if you would, I don't pick on Jiu-Jitsu again,

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.560
but how many Jiu-Jitsu guys

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.440
have became highly proficient in wrestling

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.760
versus how many wrestling guys

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.920
have became highly proficient in Jiu-Jitsu?

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:42.000
I think that number swings one way

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.560
and not that much the other way, you know?

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.280
So we're open to adapting and learning

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.040
and for some reason, Jiu-Jitsu people,

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.000
how many of them have got high level wrestling?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Or even mediocre level wrestling?

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.440
The number's really small.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.280
They refuse to.

01:51:58.280 --> 01:51:59.960
It's really frustrating.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.960
Why won't they do this?

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.080
This is obviously a part of it.

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.560
You know, if like, I don't pick on specific guys,

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.160
but there's certain guys in the history of MMA

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.600
where you're like, listen, man.

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.680
I mean, Damien Maia, who was my last fight,

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.680
is a great example of somebody

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.120
who actually did get proficient wrestling, right?

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.720
But there's some of these Jiu-Jitsu guys who's like,

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.600
if you just got on top, you would submit him.

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.480
Why can't you learn a freaking takedown?

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.760
Like, holy moly.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.680
Just learn how to take someone down.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:26.080
Once you get them down, they will not get up

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:26.960
and you win the fight.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.520
Like, it's so easy, you know?

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.360
But they refuse.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.560
How complicated is that journey?

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:33.480
So like, Donna Heard that you mentioned, Craig Jones,

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.840
they're big on wrestling as part of Jiu-Jitsu now.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.880
Like wrestling, not just on the feet,

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.280
but wrestling from the bottom, coming up

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.960
and all that kind of stuff.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:46.480
So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say,

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.720
for a Jiu-Jitsu person to learn?

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.560
Not that hard.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.840
If they really put their mind to it,

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.680
because they already like, when you grapple,

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.160
and this is any grappling art,

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.880
like there's a certain part of it that you kind of get.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.400
And it can, might not be the exact same thing,

01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.800
but you understand how your body moves

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.120
and how to feel certain pressures

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.000
and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.140
So I don't think there's a certain level of stubbornness

01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:09.640
where they didn't want to,

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:12.680
certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason.

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.240
I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the,

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.560
I'm so macho, I can stand and bang thing,

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.040
you know, where they want to show how macho they are.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.080
But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they,

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.200
there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.480
in Jiu-Jitsu and really adapted

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.640
and it doesn't go the other way.

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.840
And then I guess the other thing there too is,

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:35.160
they can both steal from each other, right?

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.800
As any martial art can steal from another.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.560
And like, I feel like Jiu-Jitsu didn't do enough stealing

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.400
from wrestling.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.080
Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possibles

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.480
and said, well, why don't we steal that and that and that?

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:49.000
You know, and like, hey, let's take that over.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.340
And maybe we'd make a little tweak

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.300
because it's different,

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.940
but there's something we can definitely use there.

01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.620
So like in wrestling,

01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.700
for example, you know,

01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.680
there's a one-armed guillotine in Jiu-Jitsu, right?

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:01.140
Okay, so there's a move called,

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:01.980
well, it's got a hard name,

01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.060
it's like the oldest move in wrestling

01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.180
because it's what they did the cows

01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:05.020
where they go around the chin

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.300
and they throw them on the back.

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.460
How do we call that one?

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.940
I don't know.

01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:11.220
Sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?

01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.060
Yeah.

01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.260
Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck

01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.700
and throw it to the side?

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:17.380
No, but in wrestling, in wrestling.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.420
I don't know.

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.260
Okay, we call it that.

01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:20.300
So you're putting it under?

01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.700
Yeah, so you can grab their chin

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:22.860
and then you go under their arm

01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:23.700
and then throw them on their back.

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.740
Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah.

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:26.500
Yeah, so we call that the honey badger,

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.940
but it's got different names wherever you go.

01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.340
It's got different names.

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:34.740
So I would always, I would say like, pre-Jiu-Jitsu,

01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.180
I was average at it.

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.380
Like I could do it,

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:39.820
but against good people, you never get it for,

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.140
because, oh, I'll tell you what,

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.540
because they would get the back of their head up

01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.180
and they were too strong where you couldn't collapse them

01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.220
by going over their neck, right?

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:46.700
Because the forces weren't right.

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.740
So then in Jiu-Jitsu, you learn the one-armed guillotine

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.780
where you grab their chin

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:52.300
and this is more of running along the side of their head

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:54.820
and then you go here and you choke them, right?

01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:58.100
Much more efficient way to move their head

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.260
because the fulcrum is way down here

01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.980
and their head can move into that, right?

01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.540
So once I learned that in Jiu-Jitsu,

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:07.900
I'm like, wait, I can do this in wrestling.

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.140
So now once I learned how to grab their chin the right way

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.620
and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.740
I just had to steal that Jiu-Jitsu,

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.580
put it in wrestling and boom, there we go.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:18.780
But very few people steal any direction.

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.940
That takes creativity.

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.780
Really?

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.620
And open-mindedness.

01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.460
It's so easy because it's already done.

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:23.780
You just gotta steal that.

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.900
I mean, same with Judo.

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:27.180
If you're a gi, Jiu-Jitsu person,

01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:32.180
there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:37.740
because Judo is much more emphasized as explosive moves

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.300
on the transition, which is something Jiu-Jitsu does not do

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.140
because you have some-

01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.180
You mean from the takedown to-

01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:45.940
From the takedown, but also just in general,

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:49.180
just in the concept of transition.

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:53.700
Jiu-Jitsu is very much about we're in this position,

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:56.740
then we're in this position, then we're in this position.

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.740
The Judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind.

01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.460
That's when you need to strike.

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:07.500
And to learn that, that's why people like Travis Stevens

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.540
and Judoka, when they go to Jiu-Jitsu, they can dominate.

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.740
But Jiu-Jitsu people should steal that.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.900
They're too stubborn.

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.500
Yeah, but so is ever, wrestlers are stubborn too.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:21.180
No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers.

01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.020
Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches,

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:27.780
John Smith, Dan Gable, they don't really have interest

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.740
in MMA or Jiu-Jitsu and so on.

01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.100
But you would think somebody like a John Smith

01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:36.740
would put on a white belt and roll around.

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:39.460
Yeah, I think he's just too focused on-

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:40.300
Well, he's a coach.

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:41.740
What he's a coach and what he's doing.

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:45.180
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger,

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.020
he would have had a lot of fun.

01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:47.060
We actually have a really good wrestler

01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.220
making his MMA debut tomorrow.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.820
Bo Nicol, I'm sure you've heard of him, third high level.

01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:54.460
I think he's gonna have a lot of success.

01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:56.420
I mean, some people might say that like,

01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:01.340
Jiu-Jitsu makes you a little comfortable being in your back

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:03.820
and for a wrestler that could be like really bad.

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.020
I hate that take.

01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.260
Yeah, but that's the Dan Gable take.

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:10.820
It's so stupid, it's so stupid, for God's sakes.

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:12.140
We know the fucking rules.

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:13.780
Just wrestling, you don't go to your back.

01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:16.220
In Jiu-Jitsu, you can, it's like whatever.

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:17.060
Yeah.

01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.700
You know, but like in Jiu-Jitsu, for example,

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.260
so I coached, when I was at Rufus,

01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:23.780
I coached the wrestling for a long, I don't know,

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:25.780
three, four, five years.

01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.060
So I've been taking the Jiu-Jitsu guy

01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:29.780
and teaching them a wrestling technique

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:32.420
where you needed to use your feet.

01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.420
To teach Jiu-Jitsu guys, so easy, so simple,

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.060
because they already understand the concept,

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:39.380
butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.540
To take a wrestler who's never done any of it

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.860
and teach him how to use his feet.

01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.980
Oh my God, it's such a beast, it's so hard.

01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:46.820
You know, because they just,

01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.060
that's not a weapon they're thinking about using.

01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:51.580
So it's like, we understand the rules.

01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:52.900
It's like freestyle folks are wrestling.

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:55.140
In freestyle form on the mat, I can lock my hands.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.700
You don't see people locking their hands all the time

01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.180
in folk style just because they did freestyle.

01:57:58.180 --> 01:57:59.380
It's like, they get it.

01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.820
There's a rule, they understand it.

01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.020
So the notion that somehow you get comfort on your back.

01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:08.660
But pinning, that's like a, it has a special meaning.

01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:11.260
But I actually think, so Jiu-Jitsu,

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:16.260
you don't actually wanna be flat, flat very often, right?

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:18.740
I always wondered this

01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:21.900
because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments

01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:26.220
and I did, I would put myself in butterfly guard

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.380
and I wasn't going against good people.

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.300
So, which is why I was doing all these things.

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:34.380
But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:37.140
where you're butterfly guard.

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:40.180
So I think there's a few places where I use it.

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.860
But so specifically the elevator series

01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:42.980
which is my main seat is up bottom.

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:45.340
It is, it's not butterfly guard.

01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.220
It's a butterfly guard, like grip with your foot.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.780
So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot,

01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.980
boom, and I elevate you over, right?

01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:56.260
And then also sometimes, like,

01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:57.700
I think Keegan does this too from watching me,

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:01.940
but if I get double leg, sometimes if I'm accepting,

01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:03.300
so freestyle obviously you're gonna give a point

01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:05.580
to me, folks out, accept me that you've already got me.

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.500
And as I go down, I'm just gonna butterfly guard you off,

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.620
and then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat

01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:13.820
and end up in a wizard position.

01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:15.340
I've used that quite a few times

01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.740
where it is kind of like a bailout mechanism

01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:20.540
that gives me back to maybe not a great position,

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.500
but obviously much better than being taken down.

01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.860
Beautiful.

01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.940
Let me ask you quickly about crypto

01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:30.340
because you're also, you have a show,

01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:33.780
you have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency.

01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:36.420
Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?

01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:38.060
Is it just a financial investment

01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.860
or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it?

01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:44.260
So I, my friend told me about it in 2017.

01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.260
I was actually, I went to, I was,

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.620
my friend met me in Shanghai.

01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:50.820
I fought in one championship, and he told me,

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.060
and the second he told me, I'm like, oh, I'm so in.

01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.580
Because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed.

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.780
I had read, I kind of had an understanding

01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:01.540
how the Fed is unfair.

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.420
And so we told him about crypto,

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:07.500
this decentralized system that no one has control over.

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.540
It just made sense.

02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:11.100
And so like we've had the podcast with Michael Saylor on it,

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:12.580
and I love the way he said this, like,

02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:13.580
who do you trust more with your money?

02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:16.820
Do you trust the politicians or do you trust engineers?

02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:18.260
I think that's an easy choice.

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.100
I don't even think,

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.500
I don't even think I have to think about that.

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:21.860
I don't trust politicians.

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.260
No matter what country they come from,

02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:25.620
China, America, wherever, I don't trust them.

02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:31.580
So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:36.380
Are you, what do you find,

02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:38.540
which ones do you find interesting?

02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:39.700
There's all kinds of ideas.

02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:44.700
So there's the more sort of primal mechanism

02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:46.700
of proof of work and Bitcoin,

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.780
and then there's smart contracts, ideas,

02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:51.020
and there's all kinds of innovations

02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:53.300
across the different points.

02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:55.220
So I can't say I'm in super deep

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.620
where I understand the technical components of a lot of them.

02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.460
I understand what Bitcoin can do for people,

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:02.220
and so that's probably the one I've focused the most on.

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.660
And I actually, I think I was talking about,

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.740
I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin

02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:09.980
because he hates it also, what he did last night.

02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:13.940
And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves,

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:15.820
people in America are so American-centric,

02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.660
they don't understand it.

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.340
So like high levels of inflation,

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.300
that hasn't happened, it's starting to happen.

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:21.820
It hasn't happened in America in a long time, right?

02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.140
But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that.

02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.940
Or remittance payments, right?

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:30.420
Remittance payments to, you see it.

02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:33.900
So I saw this when I was spending all the time in Singapore.

02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.580
Singapore is obviously a really wealthy country,

02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:39.060
and so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino,

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.940
and they would all go on Sundays,

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:42.020
they would go to these places

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.700
to ship stuff back to their families

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:45.020
and through Western Union.

02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.900
Western Union gouges the shit out of these people.

02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:49.100
I mean, they're taking eight, 10, 12%

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.860
of whatever they're sending, then it takes five days,

02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:52.940
and the person's gonna go pick it up,

02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:56.540
whereas Bitcoin, I can send you Bitcoin person to person,

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:59.100
right, so like American people don't understand that.

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.100
American people don't really understand the unbanked,

02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.260
right, a decent portion of the world is unbanked,

02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.620
they don't have access to it,

02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:07.580
and a much, much, much smaller portion of the world

02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.740
doesn't have access to internet.

02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:11.700
So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,

02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:13.980
and we can send money person to person.

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.020
So there's a whole bunch of those problems

02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.740
where Americans don't really think about

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:19.100
that are really obvious that this solves.

02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:21.420
So I think that's the key one,

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:24.380
obviously the fact that the value goes up

02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:28.380
is really outstanding also, but if you look at it,

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:31.820
I got in in 2017, so I got to watch it go up,

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:34.140
I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid,

02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:35.740
and then the majority of my time

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:37.500
was spent through the bear market,

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.900
and so I had to love it for the principles that it provided,

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.700
not the fact that I actually lost money in the beginning,

02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:45.740
and now I'm way up, but yeah.

02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.580
So I-

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:47.420
And you're just holding.

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:50.220
Just holding, I think at the top of this bull market

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.860
I'll probably sell a very small portion.

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:56.060
Oh, you mean like right now there's a bull market?

02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.060
Yeah, most people think in the next three to six months

02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:00.780
we'll be at the top of the market,

02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:02.620
and so probably when that happens

02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:04.780
I'll probably sell a little bit.

02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:06.340
You gotta hodl it, Ben.

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.980
You gotta hodl, well yeah, so here's what I am,

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:12.660
so one of my podcast co-hosts, he's like super rich,

02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:16.180
like uber rich, so he has lost touch with the every man.

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:19.140
So here's my argument to him, it's really simple.

02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:20.980
Listen, I'm doing well for myself in life,

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:24.500
but if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right,

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:27.100
one Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year,

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.940
and this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000,

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:34.260
which is right around what a lot of people think

02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.900
the peak is going to be, they bought one Bitcoin,

02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:39.660
and they are living in a $200,000 house,

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:42.380
so to take half of that, right,

02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.220
you started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin,

02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:47.420
to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000

02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.780
to pay off your house, your remaining house payment,

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:52.100
that's life-changing to someone, it really is,

02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:53.740
and so you still have a Bitcoin,

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:54.900
so if Bitcoin goes to a million,

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.540
you're still gonna have half a million,

02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.180
and you're gonna feel really, really rich

02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.180
with that half a million dollars,

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:02.380
because you bought it for F and $2,500, you know?

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:03.220
Yeah.

02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:06.140
So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich

02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.940
to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them,

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:10.580
because it could change your life.

02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:14.780
And if you hold it and it goes down,

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.300
you're going to feel the pain of that,

02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:19.780
sometimes if you're more constrained financially,

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.460
it's much more psychologically difficult

02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:22.940
to ride the ups and downs.

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:23.780
Yeah, it is, for sure.

02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:26.500
So they have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin,

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:27.660
actually we just had the guy,

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.980
one of the main guys on our podcast,

02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.540
it's called On-Chain Metrics,

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:34.860
so all wallet transactions are visible, you know,

02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:37.380
and so they have all these fun categories.

02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.820
So I actually, I think you said you don't like numbers, but.

02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:40.660
I like numbers.

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:41.500
Oh, you love numbers, I love numbers.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:42.780
So I love numbers also.

02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.180
So they have all these different categories,

02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:49.540
you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin, right?

02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:51.660
Or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet.

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:54.140
And so what they've seen during the downturn, right?

02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:55.700
So April, it kind of peaked and went down,

02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:58.980
is that the whales are still buying,

02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:00.460
so whales, the people of a thousand or more

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:01.860
are still buying.

02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.020
They've said the main group of sellers

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:06.300
is the ones who held it from zero to three months.

02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:07.740
So like, they don't have money,

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.300
they bought it because they thought it was going up,

02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.620
and now they're like, oh shit, I gotta sell it, right?

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:13.300
Whereas anyone who's held it for a long time

02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:15.420
is generally still holding on to it.

02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:16.260
That's interesting.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.820
That's a good indicator, right?

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.220
For the whole space.

02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.060
Yeah.

02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:21.780
Well, let me ask you for some advice.

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.180
You've been through one heck of a career,

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.580
one heck of a life.

02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:28.580
What advice would you give to a young person today?

02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:31.780
Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling's really

02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:33.860
a microcosm of what your life's gonna be,

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:35.620
and that's why one of the things that I stress to kids

02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:37.700
is like, if we can go through this now,

02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.580
and I have a couple kids who are struggling

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:40.420
with certain things right now,

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:42.860
if you can figure out this now in wrestling,

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:44.220
it's gonna be a lot better to figure it out now

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:46.140
and get over this mental hump

02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:48.660
than when you're 32 and you have two kids,

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:50.940
and your job's not going well.

02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.780
It's gonna be a lot worse,

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.860
it's gonna be a lot more painful then.

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.780
Let's fucking figure it out now.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.620
So a lot of these things,

02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:57.380
a lot of these lessons we can learn from wrestling,

02:05:57.380 --> 02:06:00.740
whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic,

02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:02.340
or you know, I said wrestlers show up on time

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:03.660
and they work hard, right?

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.940
These things, if we can learn these things at an early age,

02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.900
those characteristics will generally carry on

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:10.780
throughout our life,

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.820
and those are the things that are gonna make us

02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:12.660
really successful.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:15.860
So I would say find a great coach,

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.140
someone who's gonna spend a lot of time

02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:18.100
and put a lot of time into you

02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:19.460
and make sure they have a lot of wisdom

02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:22.460
and steal all the wisdom that you can from them,

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.660
and then if you can be successful at one thing,

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.500
generally whatever that recipe was

02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:29.820
that took you to be successful at that,

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.740
apply it to everything else, right?

02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:32.740
Apply it to the rest of your life,

02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:36.020
apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy,

02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:38.620
apply it to living in a place you wanna live,

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.420
doing a job you wanna do, right?

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.420
There's so many possibilities,

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.300
and you just have to be bold enough

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:45.420
to go take those chances.

02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.540
It's interesting, because early on in life

02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.980
is when you have much more time,

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:53.060
people don't realize it's time to learn the lessons,

02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:56.620
like somehow later in life you get busier,

02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:58.620
responsibilities and all that kind of stuff,

02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.260
like high school's a magical time,

02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:01.100
you know, in college.

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:01.940
In college, yeah, for sure.

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:04.620
Yeah, there's so much time.

02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.460
Right?

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:06.300
To learn.

02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.140
Well, you don't even have kids yet.

02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.500
Yeah, I don't have kids, but it still fills up.

02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:11.980
Well, no, I'm purposed, and I did something

02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:13.860
that many people don't seem to be able to do.

02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:15.860
I walked away from a lot of responsibilities,

02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.780
just by saying goodbye.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.220
Oh, okay.

02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:23.340
But, you know, meetings, everybody around me at MIT

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.780
was like, meetings fill the day,

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.500
and then you have more projects,

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:30.420
and you do a great job, and you become successful,

02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:32.060
and then more meetings fill the day,

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.420
and more responsibilities as opposed to like,

02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:38.940
wait a minute, do I wanna be involved in all these things,

02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:42.540
and instead do I wanna find one or two things

02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:46.020
to really focus on, and that's what I choose,

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.540
but like, that becomes harder,

02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:50.420
and harder and harder as you get older.

02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:51.820
No, well, I mean, I'm sure,

02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:53.580
and also the more success you have,

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.300
you become sought after other places, too.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:57.500
I'm sure that's happening with you.

02:07:57.500 --> 02:08:00.420
And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no.

02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:01.340
It is, saying no is hard.

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.180
Yeah.

02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:03.020
Yeah.

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.460
You're known for roasting people with a single,

02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.700
with a single boom roasted line,

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:11.420
so any ideas, maybe you wanna mention Malice,

02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:14.940
but any ideas come to mind when you look at me?

02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:17.340
Man, you know what?

02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:19.060
If I was gonna boom roast someone,

02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:21.220
I would wanna kinda like research their career

02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.140
and dissect them and figure out their biggest negatives.

02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:24.100
Get to the core.

02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:25.900
And I didn't have that notion with you.

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.300
I figured, I got a general sense of,

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.660
okay, he's really successful, he's super sharp,

02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:32.780
he's really interested in some really interesting things.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:34.180
I bet we'll have a great conversation,

02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:36.820
but I had no intention to roast you.

02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.660
Yeah, there you go.

02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:38.480
What about Malice?

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:40.160
I had dinner with him last night.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.000
Hmm, for him.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.320
Ha ha, oh man.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.080
How'd you get to know him, by the way?

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.080
On Twitter.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:47.920
Just Twitter.

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.600
Where's the most magical place in the world, right?

02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:51.400
I always tell people it's the greatest source of information

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:52.680
if you know how to use it.

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:54.880
Hmm.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.560
He's insane on Twitter, actually.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.400
He's played a lot.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:58.640
So I had to unfollow him on Twitter,

02:08:58.640 --> 02:08:59.480
because he-

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:00.320
It was too intense?

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:01.240
It's too much, no, it's too much.

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.640
It fills up, like, I wanna be able to consume the content.

02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.800
So if I wanna see something he says,

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.920
I can go to his page, right?

02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.640
But it's just too much for my timeline.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.880
I want to be able to consume who I follow,

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.200
so I try to not follow a lot of people,

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:13.840
because I wanna be able to consume them.

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.040
And he was, he was too much.

02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.680
He fights the trolls, which,

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.360
I don't know why you'd ever fight the trolls.

02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.720
There's just too many of them.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:22.800
Well, he's a troll himself.

02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.600
He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.160
He's the king troll.

02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.960
There's a million of them, so even if you kill,

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.440
if you kill 100,000, there's still not 100,000 left.

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.280
There's just too many.

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.120
You just gotta ignore them.

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.120
It's like the Nightwalker or whatever.

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:36.480
Yeah.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.280
Well, I'll take it, because you had nothing.

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.040
You couldn't roast GSP out of respect, too,

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.880
so I'm just gonna take that as a sign of respect.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:45.800
What do you say bad about GSP?

02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:47.000
Now I try to roast his hair.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.720
Like, why are you trying to grow hair now

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:49.880
after all these years?

02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:50.960
He looked good bald.

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:53.080
Everyone loved him with his head shaved.

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.920
Now it looks kind of strange.

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.120
It's like, why you got hair now?

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.000
Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.480
So he was here, and he wore a black suit and tie.

02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:03.320
Oh, really?

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.160
Yeah, we did the podcast with him,

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.440
just mirror image of me.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:08.640
And then we also did, I haven't released it yet,

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.920
but just the video together,

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.200
and I was doing martial arts stuff in a suit and tie.

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.000
That was quite, that was quite,

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:19.440
that's like, like certain moments in your life

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.640
are just like, I can't believe I was part of that.

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.040
Yeah, from, with GSP, so yeah,

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.200
I don't think I made the indroce move out.

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.680
I mean, maybe the Matt Serra thing

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:32.000
would be the one that you could get him with, you know?

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:32.840
Yeah.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:35.760
I would be really fascinated to really dig deep

02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:37.920
from a sports psychology standpoint,

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.600
because he always talks about how much fear he had

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:40.920
when he was competing,

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.720
and I find that to be interesting,

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.280
because obviously, so it's almost like, to me,

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:48.880
it's almost like, was he successful despite that?

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:50.640
Not because of that, right?

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:53.240
And because anxiety usually leaves it

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:55.440
really negative performance for the majority of people.

02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.400
And what was it about him

02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.800
that the anxiety wasn't super negative?

02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.640
You know what I'm saying?

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.320
Like, it's very interesting.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:03.160
I wonder that too.

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.360
So I have, I wondered that about him,

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.000
but I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.960
especially with people, just about everything, yeah.

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.480
I wonder if that's helpful or not.

02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.240
It feels like it's very helpful.

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.840
Well, I think, so okay, I think in two different ways.

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.880
So I think probably your everyday life, okay,

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.240
is different than like in a performance or a competition.

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:27.640
You have to be like super in the moment

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:28.840
of what you're doing.

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:30.640
So anything that's pulling you away,

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.800
like, oh my gosh, high school kids, right, that coach.

02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.040
Oh my gosh, that girl's in the stands and if I get beat,

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.360
then, and they're actually,

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.600
they're actively thinking about this other thing

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.000
when this is going on.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.440
And I need 100% of your focus right here.

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:45.280
Well, he's never,

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.960
I don't think he has anxiety in the ring, that's the point.

02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:50.200
I think like, I have the same thing.

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.920
Like if I have a really high performance thing

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.880
that I have to do, I don't know,

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.160
a lecture in front of a lot of people.

02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.800
Yeah, that'd be a great example.

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.080
That, there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead,

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.640
days ahead, hours ahead.

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:05.920
So you have a system to get rid of it then.

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:06.960
As you perform.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.320
No, maybe, but it's just the body gets rid of it somehow.

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.600
Yeah, there's not a system.

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.920
Subconscious system.

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:13.760
Yeah, it's self preservation.

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.760
So you don't actually have anxiety

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.280
while you're performing.

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.880
So that's like, so then that problem,

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.880
somehow that problem has solved itself, right?

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:24.280
The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.000
while the wrestling match is happening,

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.520
that's the real issue.

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:30.520
Yeah, but it like sneaks in there too.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.000
That's the difference between MMA and wrestling

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.120
is there's no breaks in wrestling, right?

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:37.960
I guess there is.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:40.600
You can look at the crowd a little bit.

02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:41.440
You can look, so maybe.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.440
A lot of violence, maybe.

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.520
But like there's other things we have to perform.

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.720
Well, there's more breaks.

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.560
Like the lecture, you can catch yourself thinking.

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.280
Like in this conversation, like I've said a bunch of stuff

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.720
where I think, why the hell did you say that?

02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:57.080
That's dumb, right?

02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.240
That's the anxiety because there's a pause.

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:02.600
And that could be, I don't know.

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:05.280
I think it just pushes me to be better.

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:08.200
But maybe I could be way better if I let go of that.

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:10.240
It's scary to think that JSP, if you let go of that.

02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.080
But he didn't.

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:12.400
But he could have been better.

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:15.760
Or did he have a, like you're saying,

02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:17.200
you don't necessarily feel those.

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:19.400
So I think certain people that I've coached,

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.600
they would describe how they would feel

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.200
literally during the wrestling match, right?

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.080
And you're saying like during the speech performance,

02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.640
it's mostly gone.

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.560
And so that's, it'd be interesting to see if like,

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:32.680
he talked a lot about that.

02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:35.200
But if it was all the way, somehow gone.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:36.960
And that means he would have a mechanism for it.

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.200
So I had a really bad performance

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:41.120
my freshman year of high school at Nationals.

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.400
Because I had the ability to be anxious.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.880
And one of my coaches talked about like,

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.480
and a lot of A-type personalities are kind of that way,

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:50.720
because they're trying to consider all possibilities

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:52.000
at the same time.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.880
And while we're actually performing or competing,

02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.520
it's negative performance, right?

02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:59.560
So he said, he would always,

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.760
leading up to the match within say an hour,

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.520
his thing was talking about fishing.

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.680
He would get someone to talk about fishing with him,

02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:06.280
because it would stop him thinking about the match

02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:08.000
and being uber anxious.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.680
So I kind of really took it to heart

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.520
and it really helped me,

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.480
as I would always like have someone to talk to

02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.760
and just goof around about whatever.

02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:16.520
So I'm not thinking about this thing.

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:18.320
And then once I step in, it's time to go.

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.880
So I didn't have this like anxious buildup.

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.400
Now it's how for me, I took it away.

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:23.240
But like me, you know,

02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:25.880
like you said, you have a way to get it away, obviously,

02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:26.720
because it's there and then it's not.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:27.560
Yeah, I guess so.

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:28.880
I guess there's little tricks you come up with.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:30.480
Yeah, you start thinking about it's not fishing.

02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.520
Maybe I should try the fishing thing.

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.280
I hate fishing, so boring.

02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:37.080
Well, maybe it's good to think about that.

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.320
All right, Ben, this is like I told you, I'm a big fan.

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:41.560
I'm a big fan of your wrestling,

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:43.400
your fighting, your personality.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:45.160
Thank you for coming down.

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.160
Thank you for talking today.

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.000
Appreciate it.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.080
It's a huge honor.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.840
Bam, let's go wrestle.

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ben Askren.

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:54.760
To support this podcast,

02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:57.600
please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:01.400
And now let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.480
Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:08.680
can reach down to the bottom of his soul

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.920
and come up with an extra ounce of power it takes to win

02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.560
when the match is even.

02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.360
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
