WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
We've never bowed down to government pressure

00:03.160 --> 00:05.700
anywhere in the world and we never will.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.400
We understand that we're hardcore

00:07.400 --> 00:09.000
and actually there is a bit of nuance

00:09.000 --> 00:12.120
about how different companies respond to this,

00:12.120 --> 00:15.640
but our response has always been just to say no.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.560
And if they threaten to block,

00:17.560 --> 00:20.040
we'll knock yourself out, you're gonna lose Wikipedia.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.600
The following is a conversation with Jimmy Wales,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.080
co-founder of Wikipedia,

00:27.080 --> 00:31.880
one of, if not the most impactful websites ever,

00:31.880 --> 00:33.600
expanding the collective knowledge,

00:33.600 --> 00:37.260
intelligence, and wisdom of human civilization.

00:37.260 --> 00:39.720
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.800
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:41.800 --> 00:43.080
in the description.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.680
And now, dear friends, here's Jimmy Wales.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.200
Let's start at the beginning.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.840
What is the origin story of Wikipedia?

00:51.840 --> 00:53.560
The origin story of Wikipedia?

00:53.560 --> 00:55.640
Well, so I was watching the growth

00:55.640 --> 01:00.040
of the free software movement, open source software,

01:00.040 --> 01:02.000
and seeing programmers coming together

01:02.000 --> 01:06.120
to collaborate in new ways, sharing code,

01:06.120 --> 01:08.320
doing that under free license,

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
which is really interesting

01:09.960 --> 01:13.280
because it empowers an ability to work together

01:13.280 --> 01:15.840
that's really hard to do if the code is still proprietary

01:15.840 --> 01:18.160
because then if I chip in and help,

01:18.160 --> 01:21.020
we sort of have to figure out how I'm gonna be rewarded

01:21.020 --> 01:21.860
and what that is,

01:21.860 --> 01:23.360
but the idea that everyone can copy it

01:23.560 --> 01:26.000
and it just is part of the commons

01:26.000 --> 01:28.240
really empowered a huge wave

01:28.240 --> 01:32.360
of creative software production.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.280
And I realized that that kind of collaboration

01:34.280 --> 01:35.820
could extend beyond just software

01:35.820 --> 01:37.840
to all kinds of cultural works.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.040
And the first thing that I thought of was an encyclopedia.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.680
And I thought, oh, that seems obvious

01:42.680 --> 01:45.520
that an encyclopedia, you can collaborate on it.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.680
There's a few reasons why.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.280
One, we all pretty much know

01:49.280 --> 01:53.040
what an encyclopedia entry on, say, the Eiffel Tower

01:53.040 --> 01:54.360
should be like.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.040
You should see a picture, a few pictures maybe,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.060
history, location, something about the architect,

02:01.060 --> 02:02.360
et cetera, et cetera.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.000
So we have a shared understanding

02:04.000 --> 02:05.200
of what it is we're trying to do

02:05.200 --> 02:06.360
and then we can collaborate

02:06.360 --> 02:07.560
and different people can chip in

02:07.560 --> 02:10.220
and find sources and so on and so forth.

02:10.220 --> 02:13.300
So set up first Newpedia,

02:13.300 --> 02:17.080
which was about two years before Wikipedia.

02:17.080 --> 02:22.080
And with Newpedia, we had this idea

02:22.120 --> 02:24.560
that in order to be respected,

02:24.560 --> 02:26.340
we had to be even more academic

02:26.340 --> 02:29.080
than a traditional encyclopedia

02:29.080 --> 02:31.200
because a bunch of volunteers on the internet

02:31.200 --> 02:33.200
getting out of the encyclopedia,

02:33.200 --> 02:36.360
you could be made fun of if it's just every random person.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.900
So we had implemented this seven-stage review process

02:39.900 --> 02:41.200
to get anything published.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.320
And two things came of that.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.600
So one thing, one of the earliest entries

02:47.600 --> 02:51.040
that we published after this rigorous process,

02:51.040 --> 02:52.640
a few days later, we had to pull it

02:52.640 --> 02:54.240
because as soon as it hit the web

02:54.240 --> 02:57.240
and the broader community took a look at it,

02:57.240 --> 02:58.560
people noticed plagiarism

02:58.560 --> 03:01.000
and realized that it wasn't actually that good,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.680
even though it had been reviewed by academics and so on.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.520
So we had to pull it.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.440
So it's like, oh, okay, well,

03:05.440 --> 03:07.920
so much for a seven-stage review process.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.600
But also I decided that I wanted to try,

03:10.600 --> 03:12.720
I was frustrated, why is this taking so long?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.480
Why is it so hard?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.200
So I thought, oh, okay,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.680
I saw that Robert Merton had won Nobel Prize in Economics

03:20.680 --> 03:23.200
for his work on option pricing theory.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.240
And when I was in academia, that's what I worked on,

03:25.240 --> 03:27.680
was option pricing theory, how to publish paper.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.000
So I'd worked through all of his academic papers

03:30.000 --> 03:32.040
and I knew his work quite well.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.160
I thought, oh, I'll just,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.920
I'll write a short biography of Merton.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.200
And when I started to do it, I'd been out of academia,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.800
hadn't been a grad student for a few years then.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.940
I felt this huge intimidation

03:43.940 --> 03:46.520
because they were gonna take my draft

03:46.520 --> 03:49.280
and send it to the most prestigious finance professors

03:49.320 --> 03:53.120
that we could find to give me feedback for revisions.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.920
And it felt like being back in grad school.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.800
It's like this really oppressive sort of like,

03:56.800 --> 03:58.080
you're gonna submit it for review

03:58.080 --> 03:59.680
and you're gonna get critiques.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.960
Elaborate the bad part of grad school.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.320
Yeah, yeah, the bad part of grad school, right?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.320
And so I was like, oh, this isn't intellectually fun.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.560
This is like the bad part of grad school.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.320
It's intimidating and there's a lot of

04:11.400 --> 04:13.320
potential embarrassment if I screw something up

04:13.320 --> 04:14.520
and so forth.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.840
And so that was when I realized,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.320
okay, look, this is never gonna work.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.520
This is not something that people

04:18.520 --> 04:20.200
are really gonna wanna do.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.440
So Jeremy Rosenfeld, one of my employees had brought

04:23.440 --> 04:25.560
and showed me the Wiki concept in December

04:25.560 --> 04:29.160
and then Larry Sanger brought in the same,

04:29.160 --> 04:31.480
said, what about this Wiki idea?

04:31.480 --> 04:36.480
And so in January, we decided to launch Wikipedia,

04:36.640 --> 04:37.520
but we weren't sure.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.440
So the original project was called Newpedia.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.840
And even though it wasn't successful,

04:41.840 --> 04:43.840
we did have quite a group of academics

04:43.840 --> 04:45.520
and like really serious people.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.760
And we were concerned that,

04:46.760 --> 04:50.320
oh, maybe these academics are gonna really hate this idea

04:50.320 --> 04:53.120
and we shouldn't just convert the project immediately.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.800
We should launch this as a side project,

04:54.800 --> 04:58.280
the idea of here's a Wiki where we can start playing around.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.840
But actually we got more work done in two weeks

05:00.840 --> 05:02.400
than we had in almost two years,

05:02.400 --> 05:04.040
because people were able to just jump on

05:04.040 --> 05:05.520
and start doing stuff.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.480
And it was actually a very exciting time.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.040
Back then you could be the first person who typed

05:11.040 --> 05:13.320
Africa is a continent and hit save,

05:13.320 --> 05:15.400
which isn't much of an encyclopedia entry,

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
but it's true.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.240
And it's a start and it's kind of fun.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.200
Like, you know, you put your name down.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.480
Actually a funny story was several years later,

05:23.480 --> 05:26.360
I just happened to be online and I saw when,

05:26.360 --> 05:27.880
his name is Robert Allman,

05:27.880 --> 05:30.000
won the Nobel Prize in Economics.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.480
And we didn't have an entry on him at all,

05:32.480 --> 05:34.280
which was surprising, but it wasn't that surprising.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.120
This was still early days, you know?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.640
And so I got to be the first person to type,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.080
Robert Allman won Nobel Prize in Economics and hit save,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.520
which again, wasn't a very good article.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.640
But then I came back two days later

05:45.640 --> 05:47.800
and people had improved it and so forth.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.560
So that second half of the experience

05:50.560 --> 05:52.520
where with Robert Merton, I never succeeded

05:52.520 --> 05:53.720
because it was just too intimidating.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.840
It was like, oh no, I was able to chip in and help.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.080
Other people jumped in.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.600
Everybody was interested in the topic

05:58.600 --> 06:00.520
because it's all in the news at the moment.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.280
And so it's just a completely different model

06:02.280 --> 06:03.560
which worked much, much better.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.040
Well, what is it that made that so accessible, so fun,

06:06.040 --> 06:09.360
so natural to just add something?

06:09.360 --> 06:10.720
Well, I think it's, you know,

06:10.720 --> 06:12.000
especially in the early days.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.800
And this, by the way, has gotten much harder

06:13.800 --> 06:15.120
because there are fewer topics

06:15.120 --> 06:18.360
that are just green field, you know, available.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.520
But, you know, you could say, oh, well, you know,

06:22.520 --> 06:26.600
I know a little bit about this and I can get it started.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.520
But then it is fun to come back then

06:28.520 --> 06:30.560
and see other people have added and improved

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
and so on and so forth.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.160
And that idea of collaborating, you know,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.760
where people can, much like open source software,

06:37.760 --> 06:39.320
you know, you put your code out

06:39.320 --> 06:41.400
and then people suggest revisions and they change it

06:41.400 --> 06:45.880
and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.560
It's just a kind of a fun, wonderful, quite geeky hobby,

06:49.560 --> 06:51.440
but people enjoy it.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.720
How much debate was there over the interface,

06:53.720 --> 06:56.640
over the details of how to make that seamless

06:56.640 --> 06:57.480
and frictionless?

06:57.480 --> 06:59.200
Yeah, I mean, not as much as there probably

06:59.200 --> 07:01.040
should have been in a way.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.440
During that two years of the failure of Newpedia

07:04.440 --> 07:06.600
where very little work got done,

07:06.600 --> 07:08.600
what was actually productive was

07:08.600 --> 07:11.560
there was a huge long discussion, email discussion,

07:11.560 --> 07:15.200
very clever people talking about things like neutrality,

07:15.200 --> 07:17.240
talking about what is an encyclopedia,

07:17.240 --> 07:19.440
but also talking about more technical ideas, you know,

07:19.440 --> 07:22.480
things back then, XML was kind of all the rage

07:22.480 --> 07:25.200
and thinking about, ah, could we, you know,

07:25.200 --> 07:29.040
shouldn't you have certain data that might be

07:29.040 --> 07:31.320
in multiple articles that gets updated automatically?

07:31.320 --> 07:35.280
So for example, you know, the population of New York City,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.920
every 10 years there's a new official census.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.240
Couldn't you just update that bit of data in one place

07:41.240 --> 07:42.840
and it would update across all languages?

07:42.840 --> 07:45.240
That is a reality today, but back then it was just like,

07:45.240 --> 07:46.120
hmm, how do we do that?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
How do we think about that?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.320
So that is a reality today where it's,

07:49.320 --> 07:52.200
there's some universal variables, Wikidata.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.200
Yeah, Wikidata, you can link, you know,

07:56.200 --> 07:59.000
from a Wikipedia entry, you can link to that piece of data

07:59.000 --> 08:00.080
in Wikidata.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.200
I mean, it's a pretty advanced thing,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.000
but there are advanced users who are doing that.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.640
And then when that gets updated,

08:04.640 --> 08:06.760
it updates in all the languages where you've done that.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.920
I mean, that's really interesting.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.000
There was this chain of emails in the early days

08:10.000 --> 08:13.200
of discussing the details of what is,

08:13.200 --> 08:14.920
so there's the interface, there's the-

08:14.920 --> 08:16.600
Yeah, so the interface, so an example,

08:16.600 --> 08:18.760
there was some software called Usemod Wiki,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.240
which we started with.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.560
It's quite amusing actually,

08:22.560 --> 08:25.520
because the main reason we launched with Usemod Wiki

08:25.520 --> 08:28.160
is that it was a single Perl script.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.440
So it was really easy for me to install it on the server

08:30.440 --> 08:34.000
and just get running, but it was, you know,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.160
some guy's hobby project, it was cool,

08:36.160 --> 08:37.760
but it was just a hobby project.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.760
And all the data was stored in flat text files,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.440
so there was no real database behind it.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.320
So to search the site, you basically used Grab,

08:49.320 --> 08:52.000
which is just like the basic Unix utility

08:52.000 --> 08:54.240
to like look through all the files.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.640
So that clearly was never going to scale,

08:55.640 --> 09:00.120
but also in the early days, it didn't have real logins.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.160
So you could set your username, but there were no passwords.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.880
So, you know, I might say Bob Smith,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.040
and then someone else comes along and says,

09:08.040 --> 09:09.840
no, I'm Bob Smith, and they both had it.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.720
Now that never really happened,

09:10.720 --> 09:11.560
we didn't have a problem with it,

09:11.560 --> 09:12.480
but it was kind of obvious,

09:12.480 --> 09:13.800
like you can't grow a big website

09:13.800 --> 09:15.320
where everybody can pretend to be everybody.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.480
That's not gonna be good for trust and reputation

09:18.480 --> 09:19.480
and so forth.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.400
So quickly I had to write a little, you know, login,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.480
you know, store people's passwords and things like that

09:24.480 --> 09:26.400
so you could have unique identities.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
And then another example of something, you know,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.040
quite you would have never thought

09:30.040 --> 09:31.080
would have been a good idea,

09:31.080 --> 09:32.400
and it turned out to not be a problem,

09:32.400 --> 09:36.000
but to make a link in Wikipedia in the early days,

09:36.880 --> 09:39.720
you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist

09:39.720 --> 09:41.800
by just using camel case,

09:41.800 --> 09:43.920
meaning it's like upper case, lower case,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.120
and you smash the words together.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.280
So maybe New York City,

09:48.280 --> 09:53.280
he might type N-E-W, no space, capital Y, York City,

09:53.520 --> 09:54.360
and that would make a link,

09:54.360 --> 09:56.320
but that was ugly, that was clearly not right.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.120
And so I was like, okay, well,

09:58.120 --> 10:00.320
that's just not gonna look nice.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.680
Let's just use square brackets,

10:01.680 --> 10:04.160
two square brackets makes a link,

10:04.160 --> 10:05.560
and that may have been an option in the software,

10:05.560 --> 10:07.000
I'm not sure I thought of square brackets,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.280
but anyway, we just did that, which worked really well.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.600
It makes nice links and, you know,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.720
you can see in its red links or blue links,

10:13.720 --> 10:15.680
depending on if the page exists or not.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.400
But the thing that didn't occur to me even think about

10:18.400 --> 10:19.800
is that, for example,

10:19.800 --> 10:22.200
on the German language standard keyboard,

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
there is no square bracket.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.280
So for German Wikipedia to succeed,

10:26.280 --> 10:28.280
people had to learn to do some alt codes

10:28.280 --> 10:29.240
to get the square bracket,

10:29.240 --> 10:32.880
or a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket

10:32.880 --> 10:33.720
where they could find one

10:33.720 --> 10:35.480
and they would just cut and paste one in.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.520
And yet German Wikipedia has been a massive success,

10:37.520 --> 10:40.120
so somehow that didn't slow people down.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.400
How is it that the German keyboards

10:42.400 --> 10:43.560
don't have a square bracket?

10:43.560 --> 10:44.720
How do you do programming?

10:44.720 --> 10:48.840
How do you live life to its fullest without square brackets?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.880
Very good question, I'm not really sure.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.040
I mean, maybe it does now,

10:52.040 --> 10:55.640
because keyboard standards have drifted over time

10:55.640 --> 10:57.600
and becomes useful to have a certain character.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.800
I mean, it's the same thing.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.640
There's not really a W character in Italian.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
And it wasn't on keyboards, or I think it is now,

11:04.800 --> 11:08.080
but in general, W is not a letter in Italian language,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.640
but it appears in enough international words

11:10.640 --> 11:12.600
that it's crept into Italian.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.080
And all of these things are probably Wikipedia articles

11:16.080 --> 11:17.560
in themselves. Oh yeah, oh yeah.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.040
The discussion of square brackets in German.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.240
Whole discussion, I'm sure.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.280
On both the English and the German Wikipedia.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.000
And the difference between those two

11:25.000 --> 11:28.040
might be very interesting.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.400
So Wikidata is fascinating,

11:30.400 --> 11:34.600
but even the broader discussion of what is an encyclopedia?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.800
Can you go to that sort of philosophical question

11:36.800 --> 11:39.640
of what is an encyclopedia?

11:39.640 --> 11:40.480
What is an encyclopedia?

11:40.480 --> 11:44.600
So the way I would put it is an encyclopedia,

11:44.600 --> 11:48.760
or what our goal is, is the sum of all human knowledge,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.920
but sum meaning summary.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.760
So, and this was an early debate.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.200
I mean, somebody started uploading the full text

11:57.200 --> 11:58.720
of Hamlet, for example.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.920
And we said, hmm, wait, hold on a second.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.320
That's not an encyclopedia article, but why not?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.440
So hence was born Wikisource,

12:06.440 --> 12:08.800
which is where you put original texts

12:08.800 --> 12:11.240
and things like that out of copyright text.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.080
Because they said, no,

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
an encyclopedia article about Hamlet,

12:14.080 --> 12:15.120
that's a perfectly valid thing,

12:15.120 --> 12:16.400
but the actual text of the play

12:16.400 --> 12:18.560
is not an encyclopedia article.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.440
So most of it's fairly obvious,

12:20.440 --> 12:23.120
but there are some interesting quirks and differences.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.200
So for example, as I understand it,

12:26.200 --> 12:31.000
in French language encyclopedias traditionally,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.120
it would be quite common to have recipes,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.840
which in English language, that would be unusual.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.960
You wouldn't find a recipe for chocolate cake in Britannica.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.960
And so I actually don't know the current state.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.600
I haven't thought about that in many, many years now.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.280
State of cake recipes in Wikipedia,

12:46.280 --> 12:47.680
in English Wikipedia?

12:47.680 --> 12:49.560
I wouldn't say there's chocolate cake recipes.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.200
I mean, you might find a sample recipe somewhere.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.080
I'm not saying there are none,

12:53.080 --> 12:55.440
but in general, no, like we wouldn't have recipes.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.000
I told myself I would not get outraged

12:57.000 --> 12:59.520
in this conversation, but now I'm outraged.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.360
I'm deeply upset.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.440
It's actually very complicated.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.160
I love to cook.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.120
I'm actually quite a good cook.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.600
And what's interesting is there's,

13:08.600 --> 13:12.000
it's very hard to have a neutral recipe because-

13:12.000 --> 13:13.440
Like a canonical recipe for cake, chocolate cake.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.040
A canonical recipe is kind of difficult to come by

13:17.040 --> 13:18.400
because there's so many variants

13:18.400 --> 13:20.800
and it's all debatable and interesting.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.760
For something like chocolate cake,

13:22.320 --> 13:23.240
you could probably say,

13:23.240 --> 13:24.680
here's one of the earliest recipes

13:24.680 --> 13:26.480
or here's one of the most common recipes.

13:26.480 --> 13:31.480
But for many, many things, the variants are as interesting

13:32.320 --> 13:36.080
as somebody said to me recently,

13:37.240 --> 13:39.720
10 Spaniards, 12 paella recipes.

13:39.720 --> 13:44.240
So these are all matters of open discussion.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.120
Well, just to throw some numbers,

13:46.120 --> 13:49.760
as of May 27th, 2023,

13:49.800 --> 13:54.800
there are 6.66 million articles in the English Wikipedia

13:56.040 --> 14:01.040
containing over 4.3 billion words, including articles.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.720
The total number of pages is 58 million.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.560
Yeah.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.760
Does that blow your mind?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.120
I mean, yes, it does.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.240
I mean, it doesn't because I know those numbers

14:11.240 --> 14:13.280
and see them from time to time.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
But in another sense, a deeper sense, yeah, it does.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.080
I mean, it's really remarkable.

14:19.080 --> 14:24.080
I remember when English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles

14:24.520 --> 14:26.240
and when German Wikipedia passed 100,000

14:26.240 --> 14:27.800
because I happened to be in Germany

14:27.800 --> 14:29.400
with a bunch of Wikipedians that night.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.680
And then it seemed quite big.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.040
I mean, we knew at that time

14:34.040 --> 14:36.840
that it was nowhere near complete.

14:36.840 --> 14:41.280
I remember at Wikimania in Harvard

14:41.280 --> 14:44.240
when we did our annual conference there in Boston,

14:44.440 --> 14:49.440
someone who had come to the conference from Poland

14:49.800 --> 14:54.800
had brought along with him a small encyclopedia,

14:54.960 --> 14:59.160
a single volume encyclopedia of biographies.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.000
So short biographies, normally a paragraph or so

15:02.000 --> 15:03.920
about famous people in Poland.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.240
And there were some 22,000 entries.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.080
And he pointed out that even then, 2006,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.040
Wikipedia felt quite big.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.560
And he said, in English Wikipedia,

15:13.560 --> 15:16.000
there's only a handful of these,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.320
less than 10%, I think he said.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.040
And so then you realized, yeah, actually,

15:21.040 --> 15:26.040
who was the mayor of Warsaw in 1873?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.400
Don't know, probably not in English Wikipedia,

15:28.400 --> 15:30.160
but it probably might be today.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.120
But there's so much out there.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.440
And of course, what we get into

15:34.440 --> 15:37.000
when we're talking about how many entries there are

15:37.000 --> 15:39.960
and how many could there be,

15:39.960 --> 15:43.160
is this very deep philosophical issue of notability,

15:44.320 --> 15:47.880
which is the question of, well, how do you draw the limit?

15:47.880 --> 15:51.040
How do you draw, what is there?

15:51.040 --> 15:54.280
So sometimes people say, oh, there should be no limit,

15:54.280 --> 15:56.000
but I think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny

15:56.000 --> 15:57.400
if you really pause and think about it.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.800
So I see in your hand there, you've got a Bic pen,

16:01.800 --> 16:02.600
pretty standard.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.000
Everybody's seen billions of those in life.

16:05.000 --> 16:05.840
Classic though.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.080
It's a classic clear Bic pen.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.960
So could we have an entry about that Bic pen?

16:09.960 --> 16:13.080
Well, I bet we do, that type of Bic pen,

16:13.080 --> 16:14.720
because it's classic, everybody knows it

16:14.720 --> 16:15.640
and it's got a history.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.920
And actually there's something interesting

16:17.920 --> 16:19.520
about the Bic company.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.920
They make pens, they also make kayaks,

16:22.920 --> 16:24.120
and there's something else they're famous for.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.040
Basically, they're sort of a definition

16:27.040 --> 16:28.720
by non-essentials company.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.640
Anything that's long and plastic, that's what they make.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.440
So if you want to find the common ground.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.920
The platonic form of a Bic.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.520
But could we have an article about that very Bic pen

16:41.520 --> 16:42.760
in your hand?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.720
So Lex Friedman's Bic pen as of this week.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.840
Oh, the very specific instance.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.800
The very specific instance.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.600
And the answer is no, there's not much known about it.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.040
I dare say, unless it's very special to you

16:54.040 --> 16:55.760
and your great grandmother gave it to you or something,

16:55.760 --> 16:56.960
you probably know very little about it.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.760
It's a pen, it's just here in the office.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.920
So that's just to show there is a limit.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.160
In German Wikipedia, they used to talk about

17:06.840 --> 17:10.840
the rear nut of the wheel of Uli Fuchs' bicycle,

17:10.840 --> 17:14.320
Uli Fuchs' well-known Wikipedia of the time,

17:14.320 --> 17:15.160
to sort of illustrate.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.160
You can't have an article about literally everything.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.880
And so then it raises the question,

17:18.880 --> 17:21.280
what can you have an article about, what can't you?

17:21.280 --> 17:24.080
And that can vary depending on the subject matter.

17:25.160 --> 17:29.520
One of the areas where we try to be much more careful

17:29.520 --> 17:31.480
would be biographies.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.720
The reason is a biography of a living person,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.160
if you get it wrong, it can actually be quite hurtful,

17:37.160 --> 17:38.000
quite damaging.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.200
And so if someone is a private person

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
and somebody tries to create a Wikipedia entry,

17:44.480 --> 17:45.360
there's no way to update it.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.200
There's not much known.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.680
So for example, an encyclopedia article about my mother.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.280
My mother, school teacher, later a pharmacist,

17:52.280 --> 17:55.600
wonderful woman, but never been in the news.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.760
I mean, other than me talking about

17:56.760 --> 17:57.960
why there shouldn't be a Wikipedia entry

17:57.960 --> 18:00.640
that's probably made it in somewhere, standard example.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.000
But there's not enough known.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And you could sort of imagine a database of genealogy,

18:08.080 --> 18:09.800
having date of birth, date of death,

18:09.800 --> 18:12.960
and certain elements like that of private people.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.400
But you couldn't really write a biography.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.240
One of the areas this comes up quite often

18:17.240 --> 18:20.280
is what we call BLP1A.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.920
We've got lots of acronyms.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.440
Biography of a living person

18:23.440 --> 18:25.520
who's notable for only one event

18:25.520 --> 18:28.120
is a real sort of danger zone.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.640
And the type of example would be a victim of a crime.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.120
So someone who's a victim of a famous serial killer,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.320
but about whom really not much is known.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.320
They weren't a public person.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.920
They're just a victim of a crime.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.040
We really shouldn't have an article about that person.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.320
They'll be mentioned, of course,

18:43.320 --> 18:46.760
and maybe the specific crime might have an article.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.560
But for that person, no, not really.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.160
That's not really something that makes any sense

18:52.160 --> 18:54.200
because how can you write a biography

18:54.200 --> 18:56.400
about someone you don't know much about?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
And this is, it varies from field to field.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.760
So for example, for many academics,

19:01.760 --> 19:05.160
we will have an entry that we might not have

19:05.160 --> 19:08.440
in a different context because for an academic,

19:08.440 --> 19:11.760
it's important to have sort of their career,

19:11.760 --> 19:13.840
what papers they've published, things like that.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.600
You may not know anything about their personal life,

19:15.600 --> 19:18.040
but that's actually not encyclopedically relevant

19:18.040 --> 19:21.240
in the same way that it is for a member of a royal family

19:21.240 --> 19:23.400
where it's basically all about the family.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.320
So we're fairly nuanced about notability

19:27.320 --> 19:28.800
and where it comes in.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.000
And I've always thought that the term notability,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.400
I think, is a little problematic.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.880
I mean, we struggled about how to talk about it.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.640
The problem with notability is it can feel insulting

19:42.640 --> 19:45.120
to say, oh no, you're not noteworthy.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.120
My mother's noteworthy.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.120
She's a really important person in my life, right?

19:48.120 --> 19:49.240
So that's not right.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.120
But it's more like verifiability.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.320
Is there a way to get information

19:53.320 --> 19:56.160
that actually makes an encyclopedia entry?

19:56.200 --> 19:59.720
It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me

19:59.720 --> 20:01.720
as I've learned recently.

20:01.720 --> 20:05.440
And the first thought I had when I saw that

20:05.440 --> 20:10.360
was surely I am not notable enough.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.920
So I was very surprised and grateful

20:12.920 --> 20:14.280
that such a page could exist.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.640
And actually just allow me to say thank you

20:16.640 --> 20:20.400
to all the incredible people that are part of creating

20:20.400 --> 20:22.880
and maintaining Wikipedia.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.680
It's my favorite website on the internet,

20:24.680 --> 20:27.080
the collection of articles that Wikipedia has created

20:27.080 --> 20:28.160
is just incredible.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.520
We'll talk about the various details of that,

20:31.520 --> 20:36.520
but the love and care that goes into creating pages

20:37.240 --> 20:41.480
for individuals, for a big pen, for all this kind of stuff

20:41.480 --> 20:43.080
is just really incredible.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.360
So I just felt the love when I saw that page.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.880
But I also felt just because I do this podcast

20:48.880 --> 20:51.640
and I just through this podcast gotten to know

20:51.640 --> 20:54.000
a few individuals that are quite controversial.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.040
I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite,

20:59.400 --> 21:02.440
to me as a person who loves other human beings,

21:02.440 --> 21:07.080
I've gone to be at the receiving end of some kind of attacks

21:07.080 --> 21:09.160
through the Wikipedia form.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.120
Like you said, when you look at living individuals,

21:12.120 --> 21:13.600
it can be quite hurtful.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.520
The little details of information.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.120
And because I've become friends with Elon Musk

21:21.280 --> 21:22.600
and I've interviewed him,

21:22.600 --> 21:26.920
but I've also interviewed people on the left, far left,

21:26.920 --> 21:28.040
people on the right.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.120
Some people would say far right.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.840
And so now you take a step,

21:32.840 --> 21:37.240
you put your toe into the cold pool of politics

21:37.240 --> 21:39.680
and the shark emerges from the depths

21:39.680 --> 21:40.800
and pulls you right in.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.840
Boiling hot pool of politics.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.240
I guess it's hot.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.560
And so I got to experience some of that.

21:47.560 --> 21:52.560
I think what you also realize is there has to be

21:54.840 --> 21:58.960
for Wikipedia kind of credible sources, verifiable sources.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.400
And there's a dance there because some of the sources

22:02.400 --> 22:04.960
are pieces of journalism.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.560
And of course, journalism operates

22:06.560 --> 22:09.920
under its own complicated incentives

22:09.920 --> 22:13.520
such that people can write articles that are not factual

22:13.520 --> 22:15.960
or are cherry picking.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.680
All the flaws they can have in a journalistic article.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.480
And those can be used as sources.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.000
It's like they dance hand in hand.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.320
And so for me, sadly enough,

22:28.320 --> 22:31.280
there was a really kind of concerted attack

22:31.280 --> 22:33.440
to say that I was never at MIT.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.240
I never did anything at MIT.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.200
Just to clarify, I am a research scientist at MIT.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.680
I have been there since 2015.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.000
I'm there today.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.680
I'm at a prestigious, amazing laboratory called LIDS.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.640
And I hope to be there for a long time.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.480
I work on AI, robotics, machine learning.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.880
There's a lot of incredible people there.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.520
And by the way, MIT has been very kind to defend me.

22:57.520 --> 23:01.040
Unlike Wikipedia says, it is not an unpaid position.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.680
There was no controversy.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.680
It was all very calm and happy and almost boring research

23:09.320 --> 23:10.560
that I've been doing there.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.920
And the other thing, because I am half Ukrainian,

23:13.920 --> 23:16.840
half Russian, and I've traveled to Ukraine

23:16.840 --> 23:18.760
and I will travel to Ukraine again.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.360
And I will travel to Russia

23:21.360 --> 23:23.440
for some very difficult conversations.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.240
My heart's been broken by this war.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.600
I have family in both places.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.640
It's been a really difficult time.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.440
But the little battle about the biography there

23:32.440 --> 23:36.400
also starts becoming important for the first time for me.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.320
I also want to clarify sort of personally,

23:39.320 --> 23:42.960
I use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.080
My father was not born in Tchaikovsky, Russia.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.120
He was born in Kiev, Ukraine.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.840
I was born in Tchaikovsky, which is a town not in Russia.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.680
There is a town that called that in Russia,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.040
but there's another town in Tajikistan,

23:58.040 --> 24:00.760
which is a former Republic of the Soviet Union.

24:00.760 --> 24:05.760
It is that town is now called B-U-S-T-O-N, Buston,

24:06.920 --> 24:09.200
which is funny because we're now in Austin

24:10.000 --> 24:10.840
and I also am in Boston.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.480
It seems like my whole life is surrounded

24:12.480 --> 24:13.840
by these kinds of towns.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.560
So I was born in Tajikistan

24:15.560 --> 24:17.480
and the rest of the biography is interesting,

24:17.480 --> 24:21.640
but my family is very evenly distributed

24:21.640 --> 24:23.640
between their origins and where they grew up

24:23.640 --> 24:24.840
between Ukraine and Russia,

24:24.840 --> 24:27.400
which adds a whole beautiful complexity

24:27.400 --> 24:28.240
to this whole thing.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.920
So I want to just correct that.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.680
It's like the fascinating thing about Wikipedia

24:34.680 --> 24:38.200
is in some sense, those little details don't matter.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.000
But in another sense, what I felt

24:40.000 --> 24:43.040
when I saw a Wikipedia page about me or anybody I know

24:43.040 --> 24:47.120
is there's this beautiful kind of saving

24:47.120 --> 24:48.640
that this person existed,

24:49.840 --> 24:52.320
like a community that notices you.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.520
It says, like a little, you see like a butterfly

24:56.520 --> 24:58.440
that floats and you're like, huh.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.520
It's not just any butterfly, it's that one.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.440
I like that one.

25:01.440 --> 25:05.280
Or you see a puppy or something or it's this big pen.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.760
This one, I remember this one as the scratch

25:08.280 --> 25:09.920
and you get noticed in that way.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.400
I don't know, that's a beautiful thing and it's,

25:13.560 --> 25:17.200
I mean, maybe it's very silly of me and naive,

25:17.200 --> 25:20.720
but I feel like Wikipedia in terms of individuals

25:20.720 --> 25:24.960
is an opportunity to celebrate people,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.160
to celebrate ideas.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.000
For sure.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.640
And not a battleground of attacks

25:29.640 --> 25:32.040
of the kind of stuff we might see on Twitter,

25:32.040 --> 25:35.400
like the mockery, the derision, this kind of stuff.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.240
For sure.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.800
Of course, you don't want to cherry pick,

25:37.800 --> 25:39.880
all of us have flaws and so on,

25:39.880 --> 25:44.840
but it just feels like to highlight a controversy

25:44.840 --> 25:47.640
of some sort when that doesn't at all represent

25:47.640 --> 25:50.800
the entirety of the human, in most cases, is sad.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.240
So there's a few things to unpack and all that.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.240
So first, one of the things I find really,

25:58.240 --> 26:03.240
always find very interesting is your status with MIT.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.560
Okay, that's upsetting and it's an argument

26:06.560 --> 26:08.640
and can be sorted out.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.120
But then what's interesting is you gave as much time

26:11.120 --> 26:13.360
to that, which is actually important and relevant

26:13.360 --> 26:15.480
to your career and so on,

26:15.480 --> 26:17.600
to also where your father was born,

26:17.600 --> 26:19.080
which most people would hardly notice,

26:19.080 --> 26:21.040
but is really meaningful to you.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.760
And I find that a lot when I talk to people

26:22.760 --> 26:24.960
who have a biography in Wikipedia,

26:24.960 --> 26:28.520
is they're often as annoyed by a tiny error

26:28.520 --> 26:30.240
that no one's gonna notice.

26:30.280 --> 26:34.120
Like this town in Tajikistan has got a new name and so on,

26:34.120 --> 26:35.840
like nobody even knows what that means or whatever,

26:35.840 --> 26:38.160
but it can be super important.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.640
And so that's one of the reasons for biographies,

26:42.640 --> 26:46.160
we say like human dignity really matters.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.560
And so some of the things have to do with,

26:49.560 --> 26:53.120
and this is a common debate that goes on in Wikipedia,

26:53.120 --> 26:55.520
is what we call undue weight.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.280
So I'll give an example.

26:57.840 --> 27:02.120
There was an article I stumbled across many years ago

27:02.120 --> 27:05.880
about the mayor, no, he wasn't a mayor,

27:05.880 --> 27:08.640
he was a city council member of,

27:08.640 --> 27:10.360
I think it was Peoria, Illinois,

27:10.360 --> 27:13.400
but some small town in the Midwest.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.880
And the entry, he's been on the city council

27:15.880 --> 27:17.160
for 30 years or whatever.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.440
He's pretty, I mean, frankly, pretty boring guy

27:19.440 --> 27:22.400
and seems like a good local city politician.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.040
But in this very short biography,

27:24.040 --> 27:26.680
there was a whole paragraph, a long paragraph,

27:26.680 --> 27:31.360
about his son being arrested for DUI.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.080
And it was clearly undue weight.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.840
It's like, what has this got to do with this guy

27:34.840 --> 27:36.160
if it even deserves a mention?

27:36.160 --> 27:40.440
It wasn't even clear, had he done anything hypocritical,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.840
had he done himself anything wrong,

27:42.840 --> 27:44.640
even was his son, his son got a DUI,

27:44.640 --> 27:46.560
that's never great, but it happens to people

27:46.560 --> 27:49.520
and it doesn't seem like a massive scandal for your dad.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.480
So of course, I just took that out immediately.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.480
This is a long, long time ago.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.120
And that's the sort of thing where,

27:55.680 --> 27:59.520
you know, we have to really think about in a biography

27:59.520 --> 28:01.880
and about controversies to say,

28:01.880 --> 28:03.160
is this a real controversy?

28:03.160 --> 28:07.440
So in general, like one of the things we tend to say

28:07.440 --> 28:11.360
is like any section, so if there's a biography

28:11.360 --> 28:14.000
and there's a section called controversies,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.040
that's actually poor practice

28:16.040 --> 28:18.840
because it just invites people to say,

28:18.840 --> 28:20.840
oh, I wanna work on this entry.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.880
Let's see, there's seven sections.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.040
Oh, this one's quite short, can I add something?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.400
Go out and find some more controversies.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.480
No, that's nonsense, right?

28:26.480 --> 28:29.840
And in general, putting it separate from everything else

28:29.840 --> 28:30.920
kind of makes it seem worse

28:30.920 --> 28:33.080
and also doesn't put it in the right context.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.320
Whereas if it's sort of a live flow

28:34.320 --> 28:35.240
and there is a controversy,

28:35.240 --> 28:38.560
there's always potential controversy for anyone,

28:38.560 --> 28:41.560
it should just be sort of worked into the overall article

28:41.560 --> 28:43.120
because then it doesn't become a temptation.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.640
You can contextualize appropriately and so forth.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.880
So that's, you know,

28:50.240 --> 28:53.680
that's, you know, part of the whole process.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.880
But I think for me, one of the most important things

28:56.880 --> 28:59.960
is what I call community health.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.120
So yeah, are we gonna get it wrong sometimes?

29:02.120 --> 29:03.120
Yeah, of course.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.960
We're humans and doing good quality,

29:05.960 --> 29:08.840
you know, sort of reference material is hard.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.840
The real question is how do people react,

29:11.840 --> 29:15.680
you know, to a criticism or a complaint or a concern?

29:15.680 --> 29:20.680
And if the reaction is defensiveness or combativeness back

29:21.240 --> 29:24.680
or if someone's really sort of in there being aggressive

29:24.680 --> 29:27.680
and in the wrong, like, no, no, no, hold on,

29:27.680 --> 29:29.240
we've gotta do this the right way.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.800
You gotta say, okay, hold on, you know,

29:30.800 --> 29:32.280
are there good sources?

29:32.280 --> 29:33.840
Is this contextualized appropriately?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
Is it even important enough to mention?

29:36.880 --> 29:37.920
What does it mean?

29:38.880 --> 29:42.160
You know, and sometimes one of the areas

29:42.160 --> 29:45.600
where I do think there is a very complicated flaw

29:45.600 --> 29:47.680
and you've alluded to it a little bit,

29:47.680 --> 29:51.600
but it's like, we know the media is deeply flawed.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.520
We know that journalism can go wrong.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.320
And I would say, particularly in the last,

29:56.320 --> 30:00.200
whatever, 15 years, we've seen a real decimation

30:00.200 --> 30:03.280
of local media, local newspapers.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.240
We've seen a real rise in clickbait headlines

30:06.240 --> 30:08.920
and sort of eager focus on anything

30:08.920 --> 30:10.120
that might be controversial.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.400
We've always had that with us, of course.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.720
There's always been tabloid newspapers.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.200
But that makes it a little bit more challenging to say,

30:16.200 --> 30:19.520
okay, how do we sort things out

30:19.520 --> 30:20.960
when we have a pretty good sense

30:20.960 --> 30:24.680
that not every source is valid?

30:24.680 --> 30:28.960
So as an example, a few years ago,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.040
it's been quite a while now,

30:31.040 --> 30:36.040
we deprecated the mail online as a source

30:37.240 --> 30:38.480
and the mail online, you know,

30:38.480 --> 30:40.680
the digital arm of the Daily Mail.

30:40.680 --> 30:45.680
It's a tabloid, it's not completely,

30:45.840 --> 30:47.480
you know, it's not fake news,

30:47.480 --> 30:49.840
but it does tend to run very hyped up stories.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.920
They really love to attack people

30:51.920 --> 30:54.640
and go on the attack for political reasons and so on.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.880
And it just isn't great.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.960
And so by saying deprecated,

30:57.960 --> 31:00.400
and I think some people say, oh, you banned the Daily Mail.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.800
No, we didn't ban it as a source.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.800
We just said, look, it's probably not a great source, right?

31:04.800 --> 31:06.160
You should probably look for a better source.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.000
So certainly, you know, if the Daily Mail

31:08.000 --> 31:12.680
runs a headline saying new cure for cancer,

31:12.680 --> 31:16.600
it's like, you know, probably there's more serious sources

31:16.600 --> 31:17.760
than a tabloid newspaper.

31:17.760 --> 31:21.360
So, you know, in an article about lung cancer,

31:21.360 --> 31:23.160
you probably wouldn't cite the Daily Mail.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.600
That's kind of ridiculous.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.960
But also for celebrities and so forth to sort of know,

31:27.960 --> 31:30.280
well, they do cover celebrity gossip a lot,

31:30.280 --> 31:32.520
but they also tend to have vendettas and so forth.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.680
And you really have to step back and go,

31:34.680 --> 31:36.200
is this really encyclopedic

31:36.200 --> 31:38.840
or is this just the Daily Mail going on a rant?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.200
And some of that requires a great community health.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.240
It requires massive community health.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.280
Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of,

31:45.280 --> 31:48.000
I have actually iffy about people I know,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.920
things I know about myself, I still feel

31:54.320 --> 31:58.880
like a love for knowledge emanating from the article.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.640
Like I feel the community health.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.640
So I will take all slight inaccuracies.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.000
I love it because that means there's people,

32:10.000 --> 32:13.440
for the most part, I feel a respect and love

32:13.440 --> 32:14.920
in this search for knowledge.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.000
Like sometimes, because I also love Stack Overflow,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.320
Stack Exchange for programming related things.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.440
And they can get a little cranky sometimes

32:22.440 --> 32:23.960
to a degree where it's like,

32:25.160 --> 32:28.080
it's not as, like you can see,

32:28.080 --> 32:30.160
you can feel the dynamics of the health

32:30.160 --> 32:33.720
of the particular community and sub communities too,

32:33.720 --> 32:37.400
like a particular C Sharp or Java or Python or whatever.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.240
There's little communities that emerge.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.680
You can feel the levels of toxicity

32:42.680 --> 32:45.560
because a little bit of strictness is good,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.600
but a little too much is bad

32:47.600 --> 32:48.920
because of the defensiveness.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.160
Because when somebody writes an answer

32:51.160 --> 32:52.560
and then somebody else kind of says,

32:52.560 --> 32:54.320
well, modify it and then get defensive.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.440
And there's this tension that's not conducive

32:57.440 --> 33:01.080
to improving towards a more truthful depiction

33:01.080 --> 33:02.520
of that topic.

33:02.520 --> 33:06.280
Yeah, a great example that I really loved this morning

33:06.280 --> 33:10.000
that I saw, someone left a note on my user talk page

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
in English Wikipedia saying,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.160
it was quite a dramatic headline saying,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.240
racist hook on front page.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.520
So we have on the front page of Wikipedia,

33:17.520 --> 33:19.840
we have a little section called, did you know?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.480
And it's just little tidbits and facts,

33:21.480 --> 33:22.640
just things people find interesting.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.120
And there's a whole process for how things get there.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.280
And the one that somebody was raising a question about was,

33:29.280 --> 33:34.280
it was comparing a very well-known US football player,

33:34.520 --> 33:39.520
black, there was a quote from another famous sport person,

33:40.560 --> 33:43.800
comparing him to a Lamborghini, clearly a compliment.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.400
And so somebody said, actually, here's a study,

33:47.400 --> 33:48.600
here's some interesting information

33:48.600 --> 33:53.120
about how black sports people are far more often

33:53.120 --> 33:55.720
compared to inanimate objects.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.040
And given that kind of analogy,

33:57.040 --> 34:00.720
and I think it's demeaning to compare a person to a car,

34:00.720 --> 34:01.600
et cetera, et cetera.

34:01.600 --> 34:05.520
But they said, I'm not deleting it, I'm not removing it,

34:05.520 --> 34:07.080
I just wanna raise the question.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.160
And then there's this really interesting conversation

34:09.160 --> 34:13.040
that goes on where I think the general consensus was,

34:13.040 --> 34:17.040
you know what, this isn't like the alarming headline,

34:17.040 --> 34:18.920
racist thing on the front page of Wikipedia,

34:18.920 --> 34:20.960
that sounds holy moly, that sounds bad.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.680
But it's sort of like, actually, yeah,

34:22.680 --> 34:24.480
this probably isn't the sort of analogy

34:24.480 --> 34:26.040
that we think is great.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.480
And so we should probably think about

34:27.480 --> 34:28.560
how to improve our language

34:28.560 --> 34:31.400
and not compare sports people to inanimate objects.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.680
And particularly be aware of certain racial sensitivities

34:35.680 --> 34:37.520
that there might be around that sort of thing

34:37.520 --> 34:39.200
if there is a disparity in the media

34:39.200 --> 34:40.520
of how people are called.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.960
And I just thought, you know what,

34:41.960 --> 34:43.360
nothing for me to weigh in on here,

34:43.360 --> 34:44.800
this is a good conversation.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.520
Like, nobody's saying, you know,

34:47.520 --> 34:50.640
people should be banned if they refer to,

34:50.640 --> 34:51.480
what was his name?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.000
The fridge, Refrigerator Perry,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.840
the very famous comparison to an inanimate object

34:56.840 --> 34:59.480
of a Chicago Bears player many years ago.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.320
But they're just saying, hey,

35:00.320 --> 35:02.240
let's be careful about analogies

35:02.240 --> 35:03.960
that we just pick up from the media.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.520
I said, yeah, you know, that's good.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.040
On the sort of deprecation of news sources,

35:09.040 --> 35:11.360
really interesting because I think what you're saying

35:11.360 --> 35:15.200
is ultimately you wanna make a article-by-article decision,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.520
kind of use your own judgment.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.640
And it's such a subtle thing because

35:22.680 --> 35:25.880
there's just a lot of hit pieces

35:25.880 --> 35:29.400
written about individuals like myself, for example,

35:29.400 --> 35:33.320
that masquerade as kind of an objective,

35:33.320 --> 35:35.480
thorough exploration of a human being.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.480
It's fascinating to watch because controversy

35:38.480 --> 35:41.200
and hit pieces just get more clicks.

35:41.200 --> 35:45.440
And this is, I guess as a Wikipedia contributor,

35:46.400 --> 35:50.000
you start to deeply become aware of that

35:50.000 --> 35:51.200
and start to have a sense,

35:51.200 --> 35:54.240
like a radar of clickbait versus truth,

35:54.240 --> 35:55.880
like to pick out the truth

35:55.880 --> 35:58.200
from the clickbaity type language.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.680
Oh yeah, I mean, it's really important.

36:00.680 --> 36:04.400
And, you know, we talk a lot about weasel words,

36:04.400 --> 36:07.120
you know, and, you know, actually,

36:07.120 --> 36:10.880
I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and ChatGBT,

36:10.880 --> 36:13.760
but just to quickly mention in this area,

36:13.760 --> 36:16.560
I think one of the potentially powerful tools

36:18.960 --> 36:20.440
because it is quite good at this.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.760
I've played around with and practiced it quite a lot,

36:23.760 --> 36:28.760
but ChatGBT 4 is really quite able to take a passage

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
and point out potentially biased terms

36:34.720 --> 36:37.240
to rewrite it to be more neutral.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.840
Now, it is a bit anodyne and it's a bit, you know, cliched.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.480
So sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something

36:44.480 --> 36:45.520
that's actually not bad.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.080
It's just like, you know, poetic language.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.320
And you're like, well, okay, that's not actually helping.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.800
But in many cases,

36:51.800 --> 36:53.160
I think that sort of thing is quite interesting.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.360
And I'm also interested in, you know,

36:57.360 --> 37:02.360
can you imagine where you feed in a Wikipedia entry

37:02.680 --> 37:06.360
and all the sources and you say,

37:06.360 --> 37:08.040
help me find anything in the article

37:08.040 --> 37:12.520
that is not accurately reflecting what's in the sources.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.440
And that doesn't have to be perfect.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.680
It only has to be good enough to be useful to community.

37:17.680 --> 37:21.720
So if it scans an article and all the sources and you say,

37:21.760 --> 37:25.320
oh, it came back with 10 suggestions

37:25.320 --> 37:26.520
and seven of them were decent

37:26.520 --> 37:28.600
and three of them it just didn't understand.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.960
Well, actually that's probably worth my time to do.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.720
And it can help us, you know,

37:33.720 --> 37:38.720
really more quickly get good people to sort of review

37:39.280 --> 37:41.920
obscure entries and things like that.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.080
So just as a small aside on that,

37:44.080 --> 37:46.680
and we'll probably talk about language models a little bit

37:46.680 --> 37:50.200
or a lot more, but one of the articles,

37:50.200 --> 37:52.440
one of the hit pieces about me,

37:52.440 --> 37:55.360
the journalist actually was very straightforward

37:55.360 --> 37:59.920
and honest about having used GPT to write part of the article

37:59.920 --> 38:01.880
and then finding that it made an error

38:01.880 --> 38:04.960
and apologized for the error that GPT-4 generated,

38:04.960 --> 38:07.920
which has this kind of interesting loop,

38:07.920 --> 38:12.040
which the articles are used to write Wikipedia pages.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.960
GPT is trained on Wikipedia.

38:13.960 --> 38:18.320
And there's like this interesting loop

38:18.320 --> 38:23.240
where the weasel words and the nuances can get lost

38:23.240 --> 38:27.920
or can propagate even though they're not grounded in reality.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.600
Somehow in the generation of the language model,

38:31.600 --> 38:35.320
new truths can be created and kind of linger.

38:35.320 --> 38:38.480
Yeah, there's a famous web comic

38:38.480 --> 38:40.800
that's titled Cytogenesis,

38:40.800 --> 38:45.800
which is about how something, an error is in Wikipedia

38:46.160 --> 38:47.320
and there's no source for it,

38:47.320 --> 38:50.840
and then a lazy journalist reads it and writes the source,

38:50.840 --> 38:53.880
and then some helpful Wikipedia spots that it has no source

38:53.880 --> 38:56.080
finds the source and adds it to Wikipedia,

38:56.080 --> 38:57.200
and voila, magic.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.920
This happened to me once, well, it nearly happened.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.400
There was this, I mean, it was really brief.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.760
I went back and researched it, I'm like, this is really odd.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.720
So Biography Magazine, which is a magazine published

39:09.720 --> 39:14.720
by the Biography TV channel, had a profile of me

39:14.720 --> 39:18.120
and it said, in his spare time,

39:18.120 --> 39:20.000
I'm not quoting exactly, it's been many years,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
but in his spare time, he enjoys playing chess with friends.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.480
I thought, wow, that sounds great.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.960
Like I would like to be that guy, but actually,

39:26.960 --> 39:28.800
I mean, I play chess with my kids sometimes,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.440
but no, it's not a hobby of mine.

39:31.440 --> 39:36.400
And I was like, where did they get that?

39:36.400 --> 39:37.880
And I contacted the magazine, I said,

39:37.880 --> 39:38.720
where did that come from?

39:38.720 --> 39:39.920
They said, oh, it was in Wikipedia.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.040
I looked in the history,

39:41.040 --> 39:42.440
there had been vandalism of Wikipedia,

39:42.440 --> 39:46.520
which is not damaging, it's just false.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.880
So, and it had already been removed.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.960
But then I thought, oh gosh, well,

39:49.960 --> 39:51.200
I better mention this to people,

39:51.200 --> 39:53.040
because otherwise, somebody's gonna read that

39:53.040 --> 39:54.000
and they're gonna add it to the entry

39:54.000 --> 39:56.200
and it's gonna take on a life of its own.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.040
And then sometimes I wonder if it has,

39:58.040 --> 40:00.600
because I was invited a few years ago

40:00.600 --> 40:02.320
to do the ceremonial first move

40:02.320 --> 40:03.720
in the World Chess Championship.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.160
And I thought, I wonder if they think

40:05.160 --> 40:07.040
I'm a really big chess enthusiast,

40:07.040 --> 40:09.760
because they read this Biography Magazine article.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.720
But that problem, when we think about

40:13.720 --> 40:15.560
large language models and the ability

40:15.560 --> 40:18.000
to quickly generate very plausible,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.840
but not true content, I think is something

40:20.840 --> 40:23.000
that there's gonna be a lot of shakeout,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.160
a lot of implications of that.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.480
What would be hilarious is because of

40:27.480 --> 40:30.320
the social pressure of Wikipedia and the momentum,

40:30.320 --> 40:32.920
you would actually start playing a lot more chess.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.440
Just to, not only the articles are written

40:37.440 --> 40:40.360
based on Wikipedia, but your own life trajectory changes

40:40.360 --> 40:43.560
because of the Wikipedia, just to make it more convenient.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.400
Yeah.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.240
Aspire to.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.200
Aspire to, yeah, that's my aspiration though.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.600
If we could just talk about that

40:50.600 --> 40:53.160
before we jump back to some other

40:53.160 --> 40:54.720
interesting topics on Wikipedia.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.200
Let's talk about GPT-4 and large language models.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.520
So they are in part trained on Wikipedia content.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.360
Yeah.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.640
What are the pros and cons of these language models?

41:06.640 --> 41:07.480
What are your thoughts?

41:07.480 --> 41:10.040
Yeah, so I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.400
Obviously, the technology has moved very quickly

41:12.400 --> 41:14.800
in the last six months and looks poised

41:14.800 --> 41:16.520
to do so for some time to come.

41:17.560 --> 41:22.520
So first things first, I mean, part of our philosophy

41:22.520 --> 41:25.640
is the open licensing, the free licensing,

41:25.640 --> 41:28.640
the idea that this is what we're here for.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.920
We are a volunteer community

41:30.920 --> 41:34.400
and we write this encyclopedia,

41:34.400 --> 41:37.120
we give it to the world to do what you like with.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.440
You can modify it, redistribute it,

41:39.440 --> 41:41.280
redistribute modified versions,

41:41.280 --> 41:44.320
commercially, non-commercially, this is the licensing.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.440
So in that sense, of course, it's completely fine.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.400
Now we do worry a bit about attribution

41:49.400 --> 41:52.600
because it is a Creative Commons attribution

41:52.600 --> 41:54.240
share-alike license.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.080
So attribution is important,

41:56.080 --> 41:57.680
not just because of our licensing model

41:57.680 --> 41:58.520
and things like that,

41:58.520 --> 42:00.360
but it's just proper attribution

42:00.360 --> 42:02.320
is just good intellectual practice.

42:02.320 --> 42:07.120
And that's a really hard, complicated question.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.960
If I were to write something about my visit here,

42:14.960 --> 42:16.800
I might say in a blog post,

42:16.800 --> 42:21.600
I was in Austin, which is a city in Texas.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.040
I'm not gonna put a source for Austin

42:23.040 --> 42:24.920
as a city in Texas, that's just general knowledge.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.960
I learned it somewhere, I can't tell you where.

42:26.960 --> 42:30.480
So you don't have to cite and reference every single thing.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.360
But if I actually did research

42:32.360 --> 42:33.760
and I use something very heavily,

42:33.760 --> 42:37.760
it's just morally proper to give your sources.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.560
So we would like to see that.

42:39.560 --> 42:43.800
And obviously, they call it grounding.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.280
So particularly people at Google

42:45.280 --> 42:48.920
are really keen on figuring out grounding.

42:48.920 --> 42:49.760
That's such a cool term.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.840
So any text that's generated trying to ground it

42:53.840 --> 42:58.120
to the Wikipedia quality source.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.960
I mean, the same kind of standard

42:59.960 --> 43:02.600
of what a source means that Wikipedia uses,

43:02.600 --> 43:05.280
the same kind of source will be generated.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.120
The same kind of thing.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.240
And of course, one of the biggest flaws

43:08.240 --> 43:12.840
in ChatGPD right now is that it just literally

43:12.840 --> 43:16.520
will make things up just to be amiable.

43:16.520 --> 43:19.400
I think it's programmed to be very hopeful and amiable

43:19.400 --> 43:21.600
and it doesn't really know or care about the truth.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.480
It can get bullied into, it can kind of be convinced into.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.920
Well, but like this morning,

43:28.000 --> 43:29.320
the story I was telling earlier

43:29.320 --> 43:32.680
about comparing a football player to a Lamborghini,

43:32.680 --> 43:34.440
and I thought, is that really racial?

43:34.440 --> 43:35.440
I don't know.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.640
But I'm just, I'm mulling it over

43:36.640 --> 43:39.200
and I thought, oh, I'm gonna go to ChatGPD.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.120
So I said to ChatGPD-4, I said,

43:42.520 --> 43:44.560
this happened in Wikipedia.

43:44.560 --> 43:48.160
Can you think of examples where a white athlete

43:48.160 --> 43:53.000
has been compared to a fast car inanimate object?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.560
And it comes back with a very plausible essay

43:55.560 --> 43:57.400
where it tells why these analogies

43:57.400 --> 43:58.640
are common in sport mobile.

43:58.640 --> 43:59.880
I said, no, no, I really,

43:59.880 --> 44:02.000
could you give me some specific examples?

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
So it gives me three specific examples, very plausible,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.520
correct names of athletes and contemporaries

44:07.520 --> 44:09.160
and all of that could have been true.

44:09.160 --> 44:12.000
Googled every single quote and none of them existed.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.120
And so I'm like, well, that's really not good.

44:14.120 --> 44:18.120
Like I wanted to explore a thought process I was in.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.560
I thought, first I thought, how do I Google?

44:20.560 --> 44:22.040
And I was like, well, it's kind of a hard thing to Google

44:22.040 --> 44:23.040
because unless somebody has written

44:23.040 --> 44:25.160
about this specific topic, it's,

44:25.160 --> 44:26.760
but I thought, oh, it's a large language model.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.120
It can, it's processed all this data.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.800
It can probably piece that together for me,

44:29.800 --> 44:30.680
but it just can't yet.

44:30.680 --> 44:35.680
So I think, I hope that ChatGPD-5,

44:36.640 --> 44:39.280
six, seven, three to five years,

44:39.280 --> 44:44.280
I'm hoping we'll see a much higher level of accuracy

44:45.280 --> 44:48.200
where when you ask a question like that,

44:48.200 --> 44:51.600
I think instead of being quite so eager to please

44:51.600 --> 44:53.320
by giving you a plausible sounding answer,

44:53.320 --> 44:55.040
it's just like, don't know.

44:55.040 --> 45:00.040
Or maybe display the, how much bullshit

45:00.320 --> 45:02.160
might be in this generated text.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.480
Like I'm really would like to make you happy right now,

45:05.480 --> 45:07.480
but I'm really stretched thin with this generation.

45:07.480 --> 45:10.280
Well, it's one of the things I've said for a long time.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.160
So in Wikipedia, one of the great things we do

45:13.160 --> 45:14.840
may not be great for our reputation,

45:14.840 --> 45:17.840
except in a deeper sense for the long-term, I think it is.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.520
But you know, we'll all be a notice that says

45:20.520 --> 45:22.600
the neutrality of this section has been disputed

45:22.600 --> 45:25.680
or the following section doesn't cite any sources.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.200
And I always joke, you know,

45:28.200 --> 45:30.680
sometimes I wish the New York Times would run a banner

45:30.680 --> 45:32.600
saying the neutrality of this has been disputed.

45:32.600 --> 45:33.480
They could give us an extra,

45:33.480 --> 45:34.720
we had a big fight in the newsroom

45:34.720 --> 45:36.880
as to whether to run this or not,

45:36.880 --> 45:38.480
but we thought it's important enough to bring it to,

45:38.480 --> 45:40.680
but just be aware that not all the journalists

45:40.680 --> 45:41.520
are on board with it.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.280
That's actually interesting and that's fine.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.880
I would trust them more for that level of transparency.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.120
So yeah, similarly, Chad GPT should say,

45:48.120 --> 45:50.040
yeah, 87% bullshit.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.800
Well, the neutrality one is really interesting

45:52.800 --> 45:56.600
because that's basically a summary of the discussions

45:56.600 --> 45:58.320
that are going on underneath.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.200
It would be amazing if, I should be honest,

46:01.200 --> 46:03.320
I don't look at the talk page often.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.800
It would be nice somehow if there was kind of a summary

46:07.840 --> 46:10.080
in this banner way of like,

46:10.080 --> 46:14.040
this, lots of wars have been fought on this here land

46:15.040 --> 46:16.400
for this here paragraph.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.480
It's really interesting.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.040
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that

46:19.040 --> 46:20.920
because one of the things I do spend a lot of time

46:20.920 --> 46:22.440
thinking about these days and, you know,

46:22.440 --> 46:24.720
people have found that we're moving slowly,

46:24.720 --> 46:26.840
but, you know, we are moving,

46:26.840 --> 46:30.040
thinking about, okay, these tools exist.

46:30.040 --> 46:32.560
Are there ways that this stuff can be useful

46:32.560 --> 46:34.240
to our community?

46:34.240 --> 46:36.160
Because a part of it is we do approach things

46:36.160 --> 46:39.320
in a non-commercial way in a really deep sense.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.960
It's like, it's been great that Wikimedia

46:41.960 --> 46:43.840
has become very popular, but really we're just,

46:43.840 --> 46:47.120
we're a community whose hobby is writing an encyclopedia.

46:47.120 --> 46:47.960
That's first.

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
And if it's popular, great.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.760
If it's not, okay, we might have trouble paying

46:50.760 --> 46:53.800
for more servers, but it'll be fine.

46:53.800 --> 46:57.120
And so how do we help the community use these tools?

46:57.120 --> 46:59.160
What are the ways that these tools can support people?

46:59.160 --> 47:01.520
One example I never thought about,

47:01.520 --> 47:03.600
I'm gonna start playing with it is, you know,

47:03.600 --> 47:06.000
feed in the article and feed in the talk page

47:06.000 --> 47:08.960
and say, can you suggest some warnings in the article

47:08.960 --> 47:11.160
based on the conversations in the talk page?

47:11.160 --> 47:12.760
I think it might be good at that.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.640
It might get it wrong sometimes.

47:14.640 --> 47:18.280
But again, if it's reasonably successful at doing that

47:18.280 --> 47:21.480
and you can say, oh, actually, yeah, it does suggest,

47:22.520 --> 47:24.760
you know, the neutrality of this has been disputed

47:24.760 --> 47:27.920
on a section that has a seven page discussion in the back,

47:27.920 --> 47:28.840
that might be useful.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.200
Don't know, we're playing with.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.080
I mean, some more color to the,

47:33.960 --> 47:38.960
not neutrality, but also the amount of emotion laden

47:40.040 --> 47:43.640
in the exploration of this particular part of the topic.

47:43.640 --> 47:48.640
It might actually help you look at more controversial pages,

47:49.120 --> 47:52.120
like on, you know, a page on a war in Ukraine

47:52.120 --> 47:54.380
or a page on Israel and Palestine.

47:54.380 --> 47:56.520
There could be parts that everyone agrees on

47:56.520 --> 47:59.440
and there's parts that are just like tough.

47:59.440 --> 48:00.280
The hard parts, yeah.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.240
It would be nice to, when looking at those beautiful,

48:03.240 --> 48:06.400
long articles to know like, all right,

48:06.400 --> 48:09.160
let me just take in some stuff where everybody agrees on.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.520
I can give an example that I haven't looked at

48:11.520 --> 48:13.520
in a long time, but I was really pleased

48:13.520 --> 48:15.480
with what I saw at the time.

48:15.480 --> 48:20.160
So the discussion was that they're building something

48:20.160 --> 48:24.300
in Israel and for their own political reasons,

48:25.200 --> 48:27.520
one side calls it a wall,

48:27.560 --> 48:30.920
hearkening back to Berlin wall, apartheid.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.920
The other calls it a security fence.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.920
So we can understand quite quickly

48:34.920 --> 48:36.620
if we give it a moment's thought, like, okay,

48:36.620 --> 48:40.200
I understand why people would have this grappling

48:40.200 --> 48:41.680
over the language, like, okay,

48:41.680 --> 48:45.040
you wanna highlight the negative aspects of this

48:45.040 --> 48:46.440
and you wanna highlight the positive aspects.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.760
So you're gonna try and choose a different name.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.600
And so there was this really fantastic Wikipedia discussion

48:52.600 --> 48:53.800
on the talk page.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.680
How do we word that paragraph to talk

48:55.680 --> 48:57.360
about the different naming?

48:57.360 --> 49:00.680
It's called this by Israelis, called this by Palestinians.

49:00.680 --> 49:04.000
And how you explain that to people

49:04.000 --> 49:05.540
could be quite charged, right?

49:05.540 --> 49:09.480
You could easily explain, oh, there's this difference

49:09.480 --> 49:11.360
and it's because this side's good and this side's bad

49:11.360 --> 49:12.320
and that's why there's a difference.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.660
Or you could say, actually, let's just,

49:15.660 --> 49:17.800
let's try and really stay as neutral as we can

49:17.800 --> 49:18.920
and try to explain the reasons.

49:18.920 --> 49:22.920
So you may come away from it with a concept.

49:22.920 --> 49:26.440
Oh, okay, I understand what this debate is about now.

49:26.440 --> 49:31.440
And just the term Israel-Palestine conflict

49:33.160 --> 49:36.820
is still the title of a page at Wikipedia.

49:36.820 --> 49:41.720
But the word conflict is something that is a charged word.

49:41.720 --> 49:42.560
Of course, yeah.

49:42.560 --> 49:47.560
Because from the Palestinian side or from certain sides,

49:47.560 --> 49:50.220
the word conflict doesn't accurately describe the situation

49:50.220 --> 49:52.800
because if you see it as a genocide,

49:53.800 --> 49:55.880
it's not a conflict because to that,

49:55.880 --> 50:00.880
to people that discuss, that challenge the word conflict,

50:01.680 --> 50:04.120
they see conflict is when there's two

50:04.120 --> 50:06.000
equally powerful sides fighting.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.760
Yeah, yeah, no, it's hard.

50:07.760 --> 50:11.720
And in a number of cases, so this actually speaks

50:11.720 --> 50:14.600
to a slightly broader phenomenon,

50:14.600 --> 50:16.560
which is there are a number of cases

50:16.560 --> 50:20.280
where there is no one word that can get consensus.

50:20.280 --> 50:23.280
And in the body of an article,

50:23.280 --> 50:26.600
that's usually okay because we can explain the whole thing.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.040
You can come away with an understanding

50:28.040 --> 50:30.520
of why each side wants to use a certain word.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.880
But there are some aspects like the page has to have a title.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.360
So there's that.

50:35.360 --> 50:40.160
Same thing with certain things like photos.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.840
It's like, well, there's different photos,

50:41.840 --> 50:44.560
which one's best, a lot of different views on that.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.000
But at the end of the day, you need the lead photo

50:47.000 --> 50:49.960
because there's one slot for a lead photo.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.320
Categories is another one.

50:52.320 --> 50:56.560
So at one point, I have no idea if it's in there today,

50:56.560 --> 50:57.640
but I don't think so.

50:59.400 --> 51:03.800
I was listed in American entrepreneurs, fine,

51:03.800 --> 51:04.960
American atheists.

51:04.960 --> 51:08.440
And I said, hmm, that doesn't feel right to me.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.400
Like just personally, it's true.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.960
I mean, I wouldn't disagree with the objective fact of it.

51:14.960 --> 51:18.320
But when you click the category and you see sort of

51:18.360 --> 51:20.680
a lot of people who are, you might say,

51:20.680 --> 51:23.760
American atheist activists, because that's their big issue.

51:23.760 --> 51:27.560
So Madeleine Murray O'Hare or various famous people who,

51:27.560 --> 51:29.480
Richard Dawkins, who make it a big part

51:29.480 --> 51:31.920
of their public argument and persona.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.760
But that's not true of me.

51:32.760 --> 51:34.480
It's just like my private personal belief.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.040
It doesn't really, it's not something I campaign about.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
So it felt weird to put me in the category,

51:39.040 --> 51:42.120
but what category would you put?

51:42.120 --> 51:42.960
And do you need that?

51:42.960 --> 51:46.120
In this case, I argued that doesn't need that category.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.200
I don't speak about it publicly,

51:48.200 --> 51:50.480
except incidentally from time to time,

51:50.480 --> 51:51.440
I don't campaign about it.

51:51.440 --> 51:54.240
So it's weird to put me with this group of people.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.680
And that argument carried the day.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.160
I hope not just because it was me,

51:57.160 --> 52:00.320
but categories can be like that,

52:00.320 --> 52:03.560
where you're either in the category or you're not.

52:03.560 --> 52:06.200
And sometimes it's a lot more complicated than that.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.280
And is it, again, we go back to, is it undue weight?

52:13.080 --> 52:15.760
Someone who is now prominent in public life

52:16.400 --> 52:18.400
and generally considered to be a good person

52:20.320 --> 52:25.320
was convicted of something, let's say DUI

52:25.360 --> 52:27.040
when they were young.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.400
Normally, in normal sort of discourse,

52:29.400 --> 52:31.280
we don't think, oh, this person should be in the category

52:31.280 --> 52:32.960
of American criminals.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.600
Because you think, oh, criminal, technically speaking,

52:35.600 --> 52:38.160
it's against the law to drive under the influence

52:38.160 --> 52:40.040
of alcohol, and you were arrested,

52:40.040 --> 52:43.440
and you spent a month in prison or whatever.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.280
But it's odd to say that's a criminal.

52:45.280 --> 52:50.280
So just as an example in this area is Mark Wahlberg,

52:50.800 --> 52:52.600
Marky Mark, is what I always think of him as,

52:52.600 --> 52:54.880
because that was his first sort of famous name,

52:54.880 --> 52:58.280
who I wouldn't think should be listed as,

52:58.280 --> 53:00.360
in the category, American criminal,

53:00.360 --> 53:03.840
even though he was convicted of quite a bad crime

53:03.840 --> 53:04.760
when he was a young person,

53:04.760 --> 53:07.080
but we don't think of him as a criminal.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.440
Should the entry talk about that?

53:08.440 --> 53:11.800
Yeah, that's actually an important part of his life story,

53:11.800 --> 53:13.160
that he had a very rough youth,

53:13.160 --> 53:15.840
and he could have gone down a really dark path,

53:15.840 --> 53:16.800
and he turned his life around.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.280
That's actually interesting.

53:18.280 --> 53:20.760
So categories are tricky.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.160
Especially with people,

53:24.240 --> 53:27.040
because we like to assign labels to people

53:27.040 --> 53:30.240
and to ideas somehow, and those labels stick.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.560
And there's certain words that have a lot of power,

53:32.560 --> 53:36.920
like criminal, like political, left, right, center,

53:37.920 --> 53:41.520
anarchist, objectivist,

53:43.080 --> 53:44.360
what other philosophies are there?

53:44.360 --> 53:47.240
Marxist, communist, social democrat,

53:47.240 --> 53:50.520
democratic socialist, socialist.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.640
And if you add that as a category,

53:52.640 --> 53:56.240
all of a sudden it's like, oh boy, you're that guy now.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.440
And I don't know if you want to be that guy.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.320
Well, there's definitely some really charged ones,

54:00.320 --> 54:04.040
like alt-right, I think is quite a complicated and tough,

54:04.800 --> 54:06.920
it's not a completely meaningless label,

54:06.920 --> 54:08.640
but boy, I think you really have to pause

54:08.640 --> 54:11.360
before you actually put that label on someone,

54:11.360 --> 54:14.200
partly because now you're putting them in a group of people,

54:14.200 --> 54:18.080
some of them are quite, you wouldn't want to be grouped with.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.960
So it's, yeah.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.880
Let's go into some, you mentioned the hot water of the pool

54:22.880 --> 54:25.840
that we're both tipping a toe in.

54:25.840 --> 54:29.320
Do you think Wikipedia has a left-leaning political bias,

54:29.320 --> 54:31.440
which is something it is sometimes accused of?

54:31.440 --> 54:34.240
Yeah, so I don't think so, not broadly.

54:35.760 --> 54:40.520
And I think you can always point to specific entries

54:40.520 --> 54:42.320
and talk about specific biases,

54:42.320 --> 54:44.880
but that's part of the process of Wikipedia,

54:44.880 --> 54:48.480
anyone can come and challenge and to go on about that.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.520
But I see fairly often on Twitter,

54:52.520 --> 54:57.520
some quite extreme accusations of bias.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.880
And I think, actually, I just, I don't see it,

55:00.880 --> 55:03.920
I don't buy that, and if you ask people for an example,

55:03.920 --> 55:05.240
they normally struggle,

55:06.440 --> 55:09.120
and depending on who they are and what it's about.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.440
So it's certainly true that some people

55:13.440 --> 55:16.000
who have quite fringe viewpoints,

55:17.360 --> 55:22.360
and who knows, the full rush of history in 500 years,

55:22.640 --> 55:24.920
they might be considered to be path-breaking geniuses,

55:24.920 --> 55:28.320
but at the moment, quite fringe views,

55:28.320 --> 55:29.920
and they're just unhappy that Wikipedia

55:29.920 --> 55:33.040
doesn't report on their fringe views as being mainstream.

55:33.040 --> 55:36.040
And that, by the way, goes across all kinds of fields.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.840
I mean, I was once accosted on the street

55:40.680 --> 55:42.800
outside the TED conference in Vancouver

55:42.800 --> 55:46.160
by a guy who was a homeopath, who was very upset

55:46.160 --> 55:48.640
that Wikipedia's entry on homeopathy

55:48.640 --> 55:51.200
basically says it's pseudoscience.

55:52.040 --> 55:53.920
And he felt that was biased, and I said,

55:53.920 --> 55:56.920
oh, I can't really help you because, you know,

55:56.920 --> 55:58.640
we cite good quality sources

55:58.640 --> 56:00.800
to talk about the scientific status,

56:00.800 --> 56:02.720
and it's not very good.

56:02.720 --> 56:05.520
So, you know, it depends, and, you know,

56:05.520 --> 56:07.520
I think it's something that we should always

56:07.520 --> 56:11.720
be vigilant about, but it's, you know,

56:11.720 --> 56:13.080
in general, I think we're pretty good,

56:13.080 --> 56:16.040
and I think any time you go to any serious

56:17.880 --> 56:19.880
political controversy,

56:19.880 --> 56:22.160
we should have a pretty balanced perspective

56:22.160 --> 56:26.320
on who's saying what, what the views are, and so forth.

56:26.320 --> 56:30.040
I would actually argue that the areas

56:30.040 --> 56:32.920
where we are more likely to have bias

56:32.920 --> 56:34.600
that persists for a long period of time

56:34.600 --> 56:37.320
are actually fairly obscure things,

56:37.320 --> 56:39.680
or maybe fairly non-political things.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.600
I just give, it's kind of a humorous example,

56:41.600 --> 56:43.640
but it's meaningful.

56:44.840 --> 56:49.280
If you read our entries about Japanese anime,

56:50.240 --> 56:52.720
they tend to be very, very positive and very favorable

56:52.720 --> 56:54.920
because almost no one knows about Japanese anime

56:54.920 --> 56:57.800
except for fans, and so the people who come

56:57.800 --> 57:00.760
and spend their days writing Japanese anime articles,

57:00.760 --> 57:02.720
they love it, they kind of have an inherent love

57:02.720 --> 57:05.240
for the whole area, and they'll, of course,

57:05.240 --> 57:07.000
being human beings, they'll have their internal debates

57:07.000 --> 57:09.560
and disputes about what's better or not, you know,

57:09.560 --> 57:11.640
but in general, they're quite positive

57:11.640 --> 57:13.280
because nobody actually cares.

57:13.280 --> 57:16.320
On anything that people are quite passionate about,

57:16.320 --> 57:19.520
then hopefully, you know, there's like quite a lot

57:19.520 --> 57:21.640
of interesting stuff, so I'll give an example,

57:21.640 --> 57:24.560
a contemporary example where I think we've done a good job

57:24.560 --> 57:27.640
as of my most recent sort of look at it,

57:27.640 --> 57:32.000
and that is the question about the efficacy of masks

57:32.000 --> 57:35.400
during the COVID pandemic, and that's an area where,

57:35.400 --> 57:39.680
I would say, the public authorities really kind of

57:39.680 --> 57:41.520
jerked us all around a bit, you know?

57:41.520 --> 57:43.200
In the very first days, they said whatever you do,

57:43.200 --> 57:47.760
don't rush on and buy masks, and their concern was

57:49.320 --> 57:52.040
shortages in hospitals, okay, fair enough.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
Later, it's like now everybody's got to wear a mask

57:54.040 --> 57:58.080
everywhere, it really works really well, and it's, you know.

57:58.080 --> 58:01.080
Then now, I think it's the evidence is mixed, right?

58:01.080 --> 58:04.400
Masks seem to help, in my personal view, masks seem to help,

58:04.400 --> 58:07.200
they're no huge burden, you know, you might as well

58:07.200 --> 58:09.840
wear a mask in any environment where you're with

58:09.840 --> 58:11.760
a giant crowd of people and so forth,

58:12.960 --> 58:15.280
but it's very politicized, that one,

58:15.280 --> 58:19.880
and it's very politicized where certainly in the US,

58:20.600 --> 58:23.080
much more so, I mean, I live in the UK, I live in London,

58:23.080 --> 58:26.120
I've never seen kind of on the streets sort of

58:27.120 --> 58:29.720
the kind of thing that there's a lot of reports of

58:29.720 --> 58:31.640
people actively angry because someone else

58:31.640 --> 58:35.400
is wearing a mask, that sort of thing, in public.

58:36.720 --> 58:39.000
And so, because it became very politicized,

58:39.000 --> 58:42.320
then clearly if Wikipedia, so anyway,

58:42.320 --> 58:44.280
if you go to Wikipedia and you research this topic,

58:44.280 --> 58:46.080
I think you'll find more or less what I've just said,

58:46.080 --> 58:49.200
I'm like, oh, actually, after it's all, you know,

58:49.200 --> 58:51.960
to this point in history, it's mixed evidence,

58:51.960 --> 58:53.960
like masks seem to help, but maybe not as much

58:53.960 --> 58:56.920
as some of the authorities said, and here we are.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.920
And that's kind of an example where I think,

58:58.920 --> 59:01.720
okay, we've done a good job, but I suspect there are people

59:01.720 --> 59:04.400
on both sides of that very emotional debate

59:04.400 --> 59:06.200
who think this is ridiculous,

59:06.200 --> 59:08.480
hopefully we've got quality sources,

59:08.480 --> 59:10.760
so then hopefully those people who read this can say,

59:10.760 --> 59:13.360
oh, actually, you know, it is complicated.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.040
If you can get to the point of saying,

59:16.040 --> 59:19.960
okay, I have my view, but I understand other views,

59:19.960 --> 59:22.520
and I do think it's a complicated question, great,

59:22.520 --> 59:24.840
now we're a little bit more mature as a society.

59:24.840 --> 59:25.960
Well, that one is an interesting one,

59:25.960 --> 59:29.200
because I feel like I hope that that article

59:29.200 --> 59:31.600
also contains the meta-conversation

59:31.600 --> 59:34.360
about the politicization of that topic.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.800
To me, it's almost more interesting

59:35.800 --> 59:39.000
than whether masks work or not, at least at this point,

59:39.000 --> 59:43.320
is like why it became, masks became a symbol

59:43.320 --> 59:46.000
of the oppression of a centralized government,

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
if you wear them, you're a sheep that follows

59:51.320 --> 59:53.920
the mask control, the mass hysteria

59:53.920 --> 59:57.960
of an authoritarian regime, and if you don't wear a mask,

59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.920
then you're a science denier, anti-vaxxer,

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.480
a alt-right, probably a Nazi.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.600
Exactly, and that whole politicization of society

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.600
is just so damaging, and I don't know in broader,

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.120
in the broader world, how do we start to fix that?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.840
That's a really hard question.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.880
Well, at every moment, because you mentioned

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.640
mainstream and fringe, there seems to be a tension here,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.040
and I wonder what your philosophy is on it,

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.000
because there's mainstream ideas and there's fringe ideas.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You look at lab leak theory for this virus,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.720
there could be other things we can discuss,

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.120
where there's a mainstream narrative,

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.120
where if you just look at the percent of the population,

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.560
or the population with platforms, what they say,

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.560
and then what is a small percentage in opposition to that,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.840
and what is Wikipedia's responsibility

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.160
to accurately represent both the mainstream

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.320
and the fringe, do you think?

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.240
Well, I mean, I think we have to try to do our best

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.760
to recognize both, but also to appropriately contextualize,

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.720
and so this can be quite hard,

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.160
particularly when emotions are high,

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.120
that's just a fact about human beings.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.120
I'll give a simpler example,

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.240
because there's not a lot of emotion around it.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.280
Our entry on the moon doesn't say,

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.160
some say the moon's made of rocks, some say cheese,

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.640
who knows, that kind of false neutrality

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.240
is not what we wanna get to.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.560
And that doesn't make any sense, but that one's easy.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.560
We all understand, I think there is a Wikipedia entry

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.960
called something like, the moon is made of cheese,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.280
where it talks about, this is a common sort of joke,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.520
or thing that children say,

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.040
or that people tell to children, or whatever,

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.440
it's just a thing, everybody's heard moon's made of cheese.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.440
But nobody thinks, wow, Wikipedia is so one-sided,

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.240
and we acknowledge the cheese theory.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.280
I'd say the same thing about flat earth, again.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.800
That's exactly what I'm looking up right now.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.200
Very little controversy.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.240
We will have an entry about flat earth theorizing,

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.520
flat earth people, my personal view is,

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.440
most of the people who claim to be flat earthers

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.640
are just having a laugh, trolling,

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.360
and more power to them, have some fun,

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.440
but let's not be ridiculous.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.000
Of course, for most of human history,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.440
people believe that the earth is flat,

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.160
so the article I'm looking at

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160
is actually kind of focusing on this history.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.480
Flat earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.280
conception of the earth's shape as a plane or disk.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.720
Many ancient cultures subscribe to a flat earth cosmography

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
with pretty cool pictures

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.800
of what a flat earth would look like.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.640
With dragon, is that dragon, no, angels on the edge?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.000
There's a lot of controversy about that.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.840
What is on the edge?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.440
Is it the wall, is it angels, is it dragons?

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.280
Is there a dome?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.800
And how can you fly from South Africa to Perth

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.280
because on a flat earth view,

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.480
that's really too far for any plane to make it.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.800
It's all spread out.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.400
What I wanna know is what's on the other side, Jimmy?

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.200
What's on the other side?

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.760
That's what all of us want to know.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.120
So there's some, I presume there's probably a small section

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.960
about the conspiracy theory of flat earth

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.480
because I think there's a sizable percent of the population

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.000
who at least will say they believe in a flat earth.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.640
I think it is a movement that just says

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.800
that the mainstream narrative,

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.720
to have distrust and skepticism

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.880
about the mainstream narrative,

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.240
which to a very small degree

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.080
is probably a very productive thing to do.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.200
It's part of the scientific process,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.760
but you can get a little silly and ridiculous with it.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.320
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's exactly right.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.200
And so, you know, I think I find

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.760
on many, many cases, and of course I,

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.560
like anybody else might quibble about this or that

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.080
in any Wikipedia article,

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.440
but in general, I think there is a pretty good

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.480
sort of willingness and indeed eagerness to say,

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.960
oh, let's fairly represent

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.840
all of the meaningfully important sides.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.480
So there's still a lot to unpack in that, right?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.640
So meaningfully important.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.480
So, you know, people who

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.560
are raising questions about the efficacy of masks,

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.680
okay, that's actually a reasonable thing

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680
to have a discussion about,

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.000
and hopefully we should treat that

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.040
as a fair conversation to have

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.360
and actually address which authorities have said what

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.520
and so on and so forth.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.560
And then, you know, there are other cases

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.440
where it's not meaningful opposition, you know?

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.760
Like you just wouldn't say,

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.680
I mean, I doubt if the main article, Moon,

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.200
it may mention cheese, but probably not even,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.880
because it's not credible

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.360
and it's not even meant to be serious by anyone.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.920
Or the article on the Earth

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.960
certainly won't have a paragraph that says,

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.760
well, most scientists think it's round,

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.880
but certain people think flat.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.120
Like that's just a silly thing to put in that article.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.400
You would wanna sort of address, you know,

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.440
that's an interesting cultural phenomenon.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.800
You wanna put it somewhere.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.800
So this goes into all kinds of things about politics.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.400
You wanna be really careful,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.520
really thoughtful about not getting caught up

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.520
in the anger of our times and really recognize.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.520
You know, I always thought,

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.080
I remember being really kind of proud of the US

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.920
at the time when it was McCain was running against Obama,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.960
because I thought, oh, I've got plenty of disagreements

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.120
with both of them,

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.360
but they both seem like thoughtful and interesting people

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.800
who I would have different disagreements with,

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.520
but I always felt like, yeah, like that's good.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.560
Now we can have a debate.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.920
Now we can have an interesting debate

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.520
and it isn't just sort of people slamming each other

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.040
personal attacks and so forth.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.160
And you're saying Wikipedia also represented that.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.000
I hope so, yeah.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.160
And I think so in the main.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.840
Obviously you can always find a debate

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.880
that went horribly wrong,

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.040
because there's humans involved.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.760
But speaking of those humans,

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.480
I would venture to guess, I don't know the data,

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.800
maybe you can let me know,

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.800
but the personal political leaning of the group of people

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.800
who edit Wikipedia probably leans left, I would guess.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.360
So to me, the question there is,

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.360
I mean, the same is true for Silicon Valley.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.200
The task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.880
that are not politically biased,

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.520
even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.120
And I think, I believe it's possible to do that.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.560
There's kind of a conspiracy theories

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.200
that it somehow is impossible

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.520
and there's this whole conspiracy

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.480
where the left is controlling it and so on.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.200
I think engineers for the most part

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.000
want to create platforms that are open and unbiased

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.480
that create all kinds of perspective,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.240
because that's super exciting

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.240
to have all kinds of perspectives battle it out,

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.960
but still, is there a degree

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.160
to which the personal political bias

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.080
of the editors might seep in,

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.720
in silly ways and in big ways?

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.760
Silly ways could be, I think,

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.680
hopefully I'm correct in saying this,

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.680
but the right will call it the Democrat Party

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.040
and the left will call it the Democratic Party, right?

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.480
Like subtle, it always hits my ear weird,

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.760
are we children here?

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.880
We're literally taking words

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.280
and just jabbing at each other.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.320
Yeah, I could capitalize a thing in a certain way

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.880
or I can just take a word and mess with them.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.080
That's a small way of how you use words,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.120
but you can also have a bigger way

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:02.280
about beliefs, about various perspectives

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.360
on political events, on Hunter Biden's laptop,

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.160
on how big of a story that is or not,

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.280
how big the censorship of that story is or not,

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.800
and then there's these camps that take very strong points

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.480
and they construct big narratives around that

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.160
and it's a very sizable percent of the population

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.240
believes the two narratives that compete with each other.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.160
Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.160
and it feels, it's hard to judge the sweep of history

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.760
within your own lifetime,

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.600
but it feels like it's gotten much worse,

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.760
that this idea of two parallel universes

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.880
where people can agree on certain basic facts

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.320
feels worse than it used to be.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.760
And I'm not sure if that's true or if it just feels that way,

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.760
but also I'm not sure what the causes are.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.760
I think I would lay a lot of the blame in recent years

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.480
on social media algorithms,

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.240
which reward clickbait headlines,

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.320
which reward tweets that go viral

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.160
and they go viral because they're cute and clever.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.320
I mean, my most successful tweet ever

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.400
by a fairly wide margin,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.480
some reporter tweeted at Elon Musk,

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.160
because he was complaining about Wikipedia or something,

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.960
you should buy Wikipedia and I just wrote not for sale.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.600
And 90 zillion retweets and people liked it

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.880
and it was all very good.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.440
But I'm like, you know what?

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.000
It's cute line, right?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.960
And it's a good like mic drop and all that.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.680
And I was pleased with myself.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.440
Like it's not really discourse, right?

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.640
It's not really sort of what I like to do,

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.440
but it's what social media really rewards,

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.320
which is kind of a, lets you and him have a fight, right?

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.160
And that's more interesting.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160
I mean, it's funny because at the time

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.240
I was texting with Elon who was very pleasant to me

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.960
and all of that.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.480
He might've been a little bit shitty.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.040
The reporter might've been a little bit shitty,

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.000
but you fed into the shitty with a snarky,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.320
funny response, not for sale.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.760
So that's a funny little exchange

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.840
and you can probably after that laugh it off and it's fun.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.520
Well, like that kind of mechanism that rewards the snark

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.800
can go into viciousness.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.520
Well, and we certainly see it online.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.960
A series of tweets,

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.080
sort of a tweet thread of 15 tweets

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.480
that assesses the quality of the evidence for masks,

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.760
pros and cons and sort of where this,

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.280
that's not gonna go viral, you know?

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.120
But a smack down for a famous politician

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.800
who was famously in favor of mask,

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.400
who also went to a dinner and didn't wear a mask,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.560
that's gonna go viral.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.000
And that's partly human nature.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.360
People love to call out hypocrisy and all of that,

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.440
but it's partly what these systems elevate automatically.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.520
I talk about this with respect to Facebook, for example.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.800
So I think Facebook has done a pretty good job,

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.840
although it's taken longer than it should in some cases.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:18.000
But you know, if you have a very large following

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.800
and you're really spouting hatred

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.080
or misinformation, disinformation,

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.400
they've kicked people off,

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.440
they've done some reasonable things there.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.520
But actually the deeper issue is of this,

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.840
the anger we're talking about,

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.920
of the contentiousness of everything.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.920
I make of a family example with two great stereotypes.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.840
So one, the crackpot racist uncle

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.080
and one, the sweet grandma.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.920
And I always wanna point out

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.360
all of my uncles in my family were wonderful people.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.160
So I didn't have a crackpot racist,

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.120
but everybody knows the stereotype.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.520
Grandma, she just posts sweet comments

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.760
on the kids' pictures and congratulates people

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.680
on their wedding anniversary.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.720
And crackpot uncle's posting his nonsense.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.400
And normally, sort of at Christmas dinner,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.480
everybody rolls their eyes,

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.600
oh yeah, Uncle Frank's here,

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.440
he's probably gonna say some racist comment

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.040
and we're gonna tell him to shut up

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.040
or maybe let's not invite him this year.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.920
You know, normal human drama.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.640
He's got his three mates down at the pub

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.080
who listen to him and all of that.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.480
But now, grandma's got 54 followers on Facebook,

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.760
which is the intimate family,

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.440
and racist uncle has 714.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.320
So he's not a massive influencer or whatever,

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.160
but how did that happen?

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.560
It's because the algorithm notices,

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.240
oh, when she posts, nothing happens,

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.640
he posts and then everybody jumps in to go,

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.000
gosh, shut up Uncle Frank, that's outrageous.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.400
And it's like, oh, there's engagement,

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.120
there's page views, there's ads, right?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.320
And those algorithms,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.120
I think they're working to improve that,

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.000
but it's really hard for them.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.200
It's hard to improve that if that actually is working.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.520
If the people who are saying things that get engagement,

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.000
if it's not too awful, but it's just, you know,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.880
like maybe it's not a racist uncle,

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.320
but maybe it's an uncle who posts a lot

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.120
about what an idiot Biden is, right?

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.840
Which isn't necessarily an offensive

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.720
or blockable or banable thing, and it shouldn't be.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.080
But if that's the discourse that gets elevated

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080
because it gets a rise out of people,

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.080
then suddenly in a society, it's like,

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.560
oh, this is, we get more of what we reward.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.720
So I think that's a piece of what's gone on.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.560
Well, if we could just take that tangent,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.960
I'm having a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg a second time.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.360
Is there something you can comment on

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.680
how to decrease toxicity

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.720
on that particular platform, Facebook?

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.760
You also have worked on creating a social network

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.600
that is less toxic yourself.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.800
So can we just talk about the different ideas

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.880
that these already big social networks can do

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.640
and what you have been trying to do?

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.520
So a piece of it is, it's hard.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.880
So I don't, the problem with making a recommendation

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.480
to Facebook is that I actually believe

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.480
their business model makes it really hard for them.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.840
And I'm not anti-capitalism.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.520
I'm not, you know, great, somebody's got business,

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.800
they're making money, that's not where I come from.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.600
But certain business models mean you are gonna prioritize

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.640
things that maybe aren't that long-term helpful.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.600
So that's a big piece of it.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.600
So certainly for Facebook, you could say, you know,

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.160
with vast resources, start to prioritize content

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.880
that's higher quality, that's healing, that's kind.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.680
Try not to prioritize content

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.160
that seems to be just getting a rise out of people.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.040
Now, those are vague human descriptions, right?

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.720
But I do believe good machine learning algorithms,

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.120
you can optimize in slightly different ways.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.760
But to do that, you may have to say,

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.240
actually, we're not necessarily gonna increase page views

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.200
to the maximum extent right now.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.320
And I've said this to people at Facebook.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.320
It's like, you know, if your actions are, you know,

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.840
convincing people that you're breaking Western civilization,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.200
that's really bad for business in the long run.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.040
Certainly these days, I'll say Twitter is the thing

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.440
that's on people's minds as being more upsetting

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.800
at the moment, but I think it's true.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.800
And so one of the things that's really interesting

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.520
about Facebook compared to a lot of companies

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.200
is that Mark has a pretty unprecedented amount of power.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.480
His ability to name members of the board,

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.760
his control of the company is pretty hard to break,

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.280
even if financial results aren't as good as they could be

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.720
because he's taken a step back from the perfect optimization

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.760
to say, actually, for the long-term health

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.720
in the next 50 years of this organization,

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.520
we need to rein in some of the things

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.080
that are working for us and making money

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.360
because they're actually giving us a bad reputation.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.000
So one of the recommendations I would say is,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.040
and this is not to do with the algorithms and all that,

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.120
but you know, how about just a moratorium

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.320
on all political advertising?

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.880
I don't think it's their most profitable segment,

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.600
but it's given rise to a lot of deep, hard questions

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.240
about dark money, about, you know,

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.840
ads that are run by questionable people

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.200
that push false narratives or, you know,

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.680
the classic kind of thing is you run,

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.800
I saw a study about Brexit in the UK

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.160
where people were talking about,

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.160
there were ads run to animal rights activists saying,

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.280
animal rights activists saying,

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.080
finally, when we're out from under Europe,

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.200
the UK can pass proper animal rights legislation.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.560
We're not constrained by the European process.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.480
Similarly, for people who are advocates of fox hunting

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.120
to say, finally, when we're out of Europe,

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.880
we can reimplement.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.080
So you're telling people what they wanna hear

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.080
and in some cases, it's really hard for journalists

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.760
to see that.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.840
So it used to be that for political advertising,

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.560
you really needed to find some kind of mainstream narrative

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.440
and this is still true to an extent,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.440
mainstream narrative that 60% of people can say,

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.400
oh, I can buy into that,

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.880
which meant it pushed you to the center,

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.440
it pushed you to sort of try and find some nuance balance.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.760
But if your main method of recruiting people

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.040
is a tiny little one-on-one conversation with them

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.840
because you're able to target using targeted advertising,

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.080
suddenly you don't need a consistent,

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:42.080
you just need a really good targeting operation,

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.640
really good Cambridge analytic style

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.440
machine learning algorithm data to convince people.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.960
And that just feels really problematic.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.640
So, I mean, until they can think about

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.000
how to solve that problem, I would just say, you know what?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.480
It's gonna cost us X amount,

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.240
but it's gonna be worth it to kind of say, you know what?

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.600
We actually think our political advertising policy

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.760
hasn't really helped contribute to discourse and dialogue

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.240
and finding reasoned, you know,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.960
middle ground and compromise solutions.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.920
So let's just not do that for a while

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.880
until we figure that out.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.640
So that's maybe a piece of advice.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.480
And coupled with, as you were saying,

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.800
recommender systems for the newsfeed and other contexts

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.080
that don't always optimize engagement,

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.320
but optimize the long-term mental wellbeing

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.520
and balance and growth of a human being.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.360
Yeah.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.600
It's a very difficult problem.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.800
It's a difficult problem, yeah.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.800
And, you know, so with WT Social, WikiTribune Social,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.440
we're launching in a few months time a completely new system,

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.760
new domain name, new lots of things.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.280
But the idea is to say, let's focus on trust.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.880
People can rate each other as trustworthy,

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.080
rate content as trustworthy.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.200
You have to start from somewhere.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.200
So we'll start with a core base of our tiny community

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.200
who I think are sensible, thoughtful people,

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.200
wanna recruit more.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.040
But to say, you know what,

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.800
actually let's have that as a pretty strong element

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.960
to say, let's not optimize

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.560
based on what gets the most page views in this session.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.560
Let's optimize on what sort of the feedback from people is,

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.800
this is meaningfully enhancing my life.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.000
And so part of that is,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.360
and it's probably not a good business model,

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.200
but part of that is say,

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.520
okay, we're not gonna pursue an advertising business model,

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.760
but a, you know, membership model

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.320
where, you know, you can, you don't have to be a member,

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.160
but you can pay to be a member.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.640
You maybe get some benefit from that,

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.920
but in general to say actually the problem with,

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.640
and actually the division I would say is,

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.440
and the analogy I would give is

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.400
broadcast television funded by advertising

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.360
gives you a different result

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.240
than paying for HBO, paying for Netflix,

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.400
paying for whatever.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.640
And the reason is, you know, if you think about it,

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.040
what is your incentive as a TV producer,

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:14.040
you're gonna make a comedy for ABC network in the US,

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.720
you basically say, I want something

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.080
that almost everybody will like and listen to.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.760
So it tends to be a little blander, you know,

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.840
family friendly, whatever.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.120
Whereas if you say, oh, actually,

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.320
I'm gonna use the HBO example and an old example,

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320
you say, you know what,

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.320
Sopranos isn't for everybody.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.080
Sex and the City isn't for everybody.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.920
But between the two shows,

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.080
we've got something for everybody

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.720
that they're willing to pay for.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.760
So you can get edgier, higher quality in my view,

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.280
content rather than saying,

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.520
it's gotta not offend anybody in the world.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.840
It's gotta be for everybody, which is really hard.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.880
So same thing, you know, here in a social network,

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.560
if your business model is advertising,

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560
it's gonna drive you in one direction.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.240
If your business model is membership,

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.800
I think it drives you in a different direction.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.040
I actually, and I've said this to Elon

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:00.880
about Twitter Blue,

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.360
which I think wasn't rolled out well and so forth.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.960
But it's like, the piece of that that I like is to say,

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.040
look, actually, if there's a model

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.240
where your revenue is coming from people

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.400
who are willing to pay for the service,

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.160
even if it's only part of your revenue,

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.880
if it's a substantial part,

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.120
that does change your broader incentives to say,

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.600
actually, are people gonna be willing to pay for something

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.880
that's actually just toxicity in their lives?

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.840
No, I'm not sure it's been rolled out well.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.120
I'm not sure how it's going.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.320
And maybe I'm wrong about that as a plausible business model.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.080
But I do think it's interesting to think about,

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.080
just in broad terms, business model drives outcomes

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.720
in sometimes surprising ways,

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.600
unless you really pause to think about it.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.760
So if we can just linger on Twitter and Elon

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.680
before I would love to talk to you

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.920
about the underlying business model, Wikipedia,

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.800
which is this brilliant bold move at the very beginning.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.720
But since you mentioned Twitter, what do you think works?

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.040
What do you think is broken about Twitter?

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.360
Well, it's a long conversation.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.640
But to start with, one of the things that I always say is,

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.040
it's a really hard problem.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.760
So I can see that right up front.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.200
I said this about the old ownership of Twitter

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.600
and the new ownership of Twitter.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.800
Because unlike Wikipedia,

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.600
and this is true actually for all social media,

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.160
there's a box and the box basically says,

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.000
what do you think?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.960
What's on your mind?

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.160
You can write whatever the hell you want, right?

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.600
This is true, by the way, even for YouTube.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.960
I mean, the box is to upload a video,

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.400
but again, it's just like an open-ended invitation

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.000
to express yourself.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.640
And what makes that hard is some people

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.880
have really toxic, really bad,

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.120
some people are very aggressive,

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.920
they're actually stalking, they're actually abusive.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.840
And suddenly you deal with a lot of problems.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.680
Whereas at Wikipedia,

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.720
there is no box that says what's on your mind.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.720
There's a box that says,

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.360
this is an entry about the moon.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.040
Please be neutral, please cite your facts.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.080
Then there's a talk page,

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.280
which is not coming rant about Donald Trump.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.280
If you go on the talk page of the Donald Trump entry

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.280
and you just start ranting about Donald Trump,

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.280
people would say, what are you doing?

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.160
Like, stop doing that.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.920
Like we're not here to discuss,

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.800
like there's a whole world of the internet out there

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.280
for you to go and rant about Donald Trump.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.960
It's just not fun to do on Wikipedia,

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.680
it somehow is fun on Twitter.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.040
Well, also on Wikipedia,

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.560
people are gonna say stop.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.680
And actually, are you here to tell us,

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.120
like how can we improve the article?

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.440
Or are you just here to rant about Trump?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.160
Because that's not actually interesting.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.360
So because the goal is different,

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.000
so that's just admitting and saying upfront,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.720
this is a hard problem.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.280
Certainly, I'm writing a book on trust.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.080
So the idea is, in the last 20 years,

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:51.080
we've lost trust in all kinds of institutions and politics.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.360
The Edelman Trust Barometer Survey

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.440
has been done for a long time.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.680
And trust in politicians, trust in journalism,

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.600
it's declined substantially,

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.080
and I think in many cases, deservedly.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.440
So how do we restore trust and how do we think about that?

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.440
And does that also include trust in the idea of truth?

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.960
Trust in the idea of truth,

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.760
even the concept of facts and truth is really,

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.200
really important and the idea of uncomfortable truths

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.040
is really important.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.040
Now, so when we look at Twitter,

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.040
and we say, we can see it, okay, this is really hard.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.800
So here's my story about Twitter.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.240
It's a two-part story,

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.680
and it's all pre-Elon Musk ownership.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.240
So many years back, somebody accused me

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.680
of horrible crimes on Twitter.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.360
And I, like anybody would, I'm in the public eye,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.520
people say bad things, I don't really,

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.720
I brush it off, whatever.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.520
But I'm like, this is actually really bad.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.880
Accusing me of pedophilia, that's just not okay.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.320
So I thought, I'm gonna report this.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.800
So I click report, and I report the tweet,

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.760
and there's five others, and I go through the process,

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.520
and then I get an email that says, whatever,

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.960
a couple hours later saying,

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.680
thank you for your report, we're looking into this.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.080
Great, okay, good.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.960
Then several hours further, I get an email back saying,

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.040
sorry, we don't see anything here

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.120
to violate our terms of use.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.760
And I'm like, okay, so I emailed Jack,

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.800
and I say, Jack, come on, this is ridiculous.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.760
And he emails back, roughly saying,

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.280
yeah, sorry, Jimmy, don't worry, we'll sort this out.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.080
And I just thought to myself, you know what?

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.360
That's not the point, right?

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.640
I'm Jimmy Wales, I know Jack Dorsey,

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.600
I can email Jack Dorsey, he'll listen to me

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.440
because he's got an email from me, and sorts it out for me.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.120
What about the teenager who's being bullied

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.680
and is getting abuse, right,

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.640
and getting accusations that aren't true?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.520
Are they getting the same kind of really poor result

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.840
in that case?

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.960
So, fast forward a few years, same thing happens.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.760
The exact quote I was gonna say,

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.800
please help me, I'm only 10 years old,

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.760
and Jimmy Wales raped me last week.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.640
I was like, come on, fuck off, that's ridiculous.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.640
So I report, I'm like, this time I'm reporting,

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.000
but I'm thinking, well, we'll see what happens.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.840
This one gets even worse because then I get the same result,

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.920
email back saying, sorry, we don't see any problems.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.680
So I raise it with other members of the board

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.880
who I know, and Jack, and like, this is really ridiculous.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.000
Like, this is outrageous.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.080
And some of the board members, friends of mine,

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.640
sympathetic, and so good for them.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.600
But I actually got an email back

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.040
then from the general counsel,

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.360
head of trust and safety saying,

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.720
actually, there's nothing in this tweet

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.120
that violates our terms of service.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.120
We don't regard, and gave reference to the Me Too movement.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.080
If we didn't allow accusations,

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.360
the Me Too movement, it's an important thing.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.680
And I was like, you know what?

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.640
Actually, if someone says I'm 10 years old

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.960
and someone raped me last week,

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.360
I think the advice should be,

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.200
here's the phone number of the police.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.840
Like, you need to get the police involved.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.160
Twitter's not the place for that accusation.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.000
So, even back then, by the way,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.520
they did delete those tweets,

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.840
I mean, the rationale they gave is spammy behavior.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.800
So, completely separate from abusing me,

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.200
it was just like, oh, well, they were retweeting too often.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.640
Okay, whatever.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.440
So, like, that's just broken.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.920
Like, that's a system that,

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.480
it's not working for people in the public eye.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.760
I'm sure it's not working for private people who get abuse.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.600
Really horrible abuse can happen.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.360
So, how is that today?

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.360
Well, it hasn't happened to me since Elon took over,

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.800
but I don't see why it couldn't.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.880
And I suspect now if I send a report

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.800
and email someone, there's no one there to email me back

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.240
because he's gotten rid of a lot

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.960
of the trust and safety staff.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.760
So, I suspect that problem is still really hard.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.960
Just content moderation at huge scales.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.360
At huge scales is really something.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.360
And I don't know the full answer to this.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.840
I mean, a piece of it could be,

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.920
to say, actually making specific allegations of crimes.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.160
This isn't the place to do that.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.480
We've got a huge database.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.600
If you've got an accusation of crime,

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.160
here's who you should call.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.560
The police, the FBI, whatever it is.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.320
It's not to be done in public.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.640
And then you do face really complicated questions

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.720
about MeToo movement and people coming forward in public

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.560
and all of that.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.040
But again, it's like,

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.960
probably you should talk to a journalist, right?

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.920
Probably there are better avenues than just tweeting

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.000
from an account that was created 10 days ago,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.160
obviously set up to abuse someone.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.240
So, I think they could do a lot better.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.080
But I also admit it's a hard problem.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.920
And there's also ways to indirectly,

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.440
or more humorously, or a more mocking way

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.360
to make the same kinds of accusations.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.280
In fact, the accusations you mentioned,

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.280
if I were to guess, don't go that viral

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.760
because they're not funny enough or cutting enough.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.520
But if you make it witty and cutting and meme it somehow,

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.840
sometimes actually indirectly making the accusation

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.400
versus directly making the accusation.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.280
That can go viral and that can destroy reputations.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.360
And you get to watch yourself

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.240
just all kinds of narratives take hold.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.440
Yeah, no, I mean, I remember another case

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.120
that didn't bother me because it wasn't of that nature.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.840
But somebody was saying,

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.800
I'm sure you're making millions off of Wikipedia.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.400
I'm like, no, actually, I don't even work there.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.680
I have no salary.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.360
And they're like, you're lying.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.120
I'm gonna check your 990 form,

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.160
which is the US form for tax reporting for charities.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.120
I was like, yeah, knock it.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.160
Here's the link, go read it and you'll see.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.440
I'm listed as a board member

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.080
and my salary is listed as zero.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:45.920
Things like that.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.240
It's like, okay, that feels like you're wrong,

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.640
but I can take that and we can have that debate

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.480
quite quickly.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.800
And again, it didn't go viral because it was kind of silly.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.320
And if anything would have gone viral,

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.240
it was me responding.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.200
But that's one where it's like,

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.400
actually I'm happy to respond

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.480
because a lot of people don't know that I don't work there

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.640
and that I don't make millions and I'm not a billionaire.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.400
They must know that because it's in most news media about me.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.680
But the other one I didn't respond to publicly

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.960
because it's like Barbra Streisand effect.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.680
Sometimes calling attention to someone who's abusing you

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.960
who basically has no followers and so on is just a waste.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.080
And everything you're describing now

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.080
is just something that all of us have to kind of learn

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.480
because everybody's in the public eye.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.040
I think when you have just two followers

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.640
and you get bullied by one of the followers,

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.880
it hurts just as much as when you have a large number.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.080
So it's not your situation I think is echoed

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.040
in the situations of millions of other,

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.000
especially teenagers and kids and so on.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah, I mean, it's actually an example.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.720
So we don't generally use my picture

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.160
and the banners anymore on Wikipedia, but we did.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.000
And then we did an experiment one year

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.960
where we tried other people's pictures.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.880
So one of our developers.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.800
One guy, lovely, very sweet guy.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.440
And he doesn't look like your immediate thought

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.080
of a nerdy Silicon Valley developer.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.040
He looks like a heavy metal dude because he's cool.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.520
And so suddenly here he is with long hair and tattoos

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.680
and there's his sort of say,

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.120
here's what your money goes for.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.680
Here's my letter asking for support.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.080
And he got massive abuse from Wikipedia,

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.400
like calling him creepy and really massive.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.360
And this was being shown to 80 million people a day.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.200
His picture, not the abuse, right?

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.440
The abuse was elsewhere on the internet.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.200
And he was bothered by it.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.120
And I thought, you know what?

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:40.960
There is a difference.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.360
I actually am in the public eye.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.800
I get huge benefits from being in the public eye.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.240
I go around and make public speeches.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.840
If any random thing I think of,

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.520
I can write and get it published in the New York Times

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.560
and have this interesting life.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.920
He's not a public figure.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.520
And so actually he wasn't mad at us.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.440
It was just like, yeah,

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.160
actually suddenly being thrust in the public eye

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.360
and you get suddenly lots of abuse,

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.080
which normally think, you know,

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.960
if you're a teenager and somebody in your class

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.240
is abusing you, it's not gonna go viral.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.080
So you're only gonna,

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.960
it's gonna be hurtful because it's local

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.360
and it's your classmates or whatever.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.760
But when sort of ordinary people go viral

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:24.040
in some abusive way, it's really, really quite tragic.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:24.880
I don't know.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.280
I mean, even at a small scale, it feels viral.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.200
When five people at your school and there's a rumor

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.640
and there's this feeling like you're surrounded

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.320
and nobody, and the feeling of loneliness, I think,

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.880
which you're speaking to when you don't have a plat,

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.520
when you at least feel like you don't have a platform

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.920
to defend yourself.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.800
And then this powerlessness

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.960
that I think a lot of teenagers definitely feel

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.400
and a lot of people.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.280
I think you're right.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.760
And that, I think even when just like two people

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.040
make up stuff about you or lie about you

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.400
or say mean things about you or bully you,

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.480
that can feel like a crowd.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.320
Yeah, yeah, no, it's true.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.080
And it's a, I mean, whatever that is in our genetics

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.760
and our biology and the way our brain works,

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.680
it just can be a terrifying experience.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.600
And somehow to correct that, I mean, I think,

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.200
because everybody feels the pain of that,

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.400
everybody suffers the pain of that,

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.520
I think we'll be forced to fix that as a society

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.920
to figure out a way around that.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.320
I think it's really hard to fix

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:27.520
because I don't think that problem isn't necessarily new.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.840
Someone in high school who writes graffiti

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.160
that says Becky has a slut

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.480
and spreads a rumor about what Becky did last weekend,

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.520
that's always been damaging, it's always been hurtful

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.080
and it's really hard.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.680
Those kinds of attacks are as old as time itself.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.080
They precede the internet.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.560
Now, what do you think about this technology

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.480
that feels Wikipedia-like,

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.800
which is community notes on Twitter?

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.560
Do you like it?

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.400
Yeah.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.080
Pros and cons, do you think it's scalable?

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.920
I do like it.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.960
I don't know enough about specifically how it's implemented

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.840
to really have a very deep view,

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.560
but I do think it's quite,

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.720
it's the uses I've seen of it, I've found quite good.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.720
And in some cases, changed my mind.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.800
You know, it's like, I see something.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.640
And of course, you know, the sort of human tendency is

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.280
to retweet something that you hope is true

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.040
or that you are afraid is true,

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.800
or, you know, it's like that kind of quick mental action.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.840
And then, you know, I saw something that I liked

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.080
and agreed with, and then a community note under it

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.120
that made me think, oh, actually,

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.840
this is a more nuanced issue.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.240
So I like that.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.120
I think that's really important.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.640
Now, how is it specifically implemented?

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.520
Is it scalable, all that?

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.800
I don't really know how they've done it.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.840
So I can't really comment on that.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.800
But in general, I do think it's, you know,

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.840
when you're only mechanisms on Twitter,

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.160
and you're a big Twitter user, you know,

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.960
we know the platform and you've got plenty of followers

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.240
and all of that.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.240
The only mechanisms are retweeting, replying, blocking.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.520
It's a pretty limited scope,

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.560
and it's kind of good if there's a way to elevate

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.360
a specific thoughtful response.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.120
And it kind of goes to, again, like,

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.120
does the algorithm just pick the retweet or the,

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.000
I mean, retweeting, it's not even the algorithm

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.680
that makes it viral.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.680
Like, you know, if Paulo Coelho, very famous author,

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.000
I think he's got like, I don't know,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.840
I haven't looked lately.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.120
He used to have 8 million Twitter followers.

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.600
I think I looked, he's got 16 million now or whatever.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.520
Well, if he retweets something, it's gonna get seen a lot,

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.120
Elon Musk, if he retweets something,

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.240
it's gonna get seen a lot.

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:48.240
That's not an algorithm.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.480
That's just the way the platform works.

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.920
So it is kind of nice if you have something else

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.320
and how that something else is designed.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.960
That's obviously a complicated question.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.480
Well, there's this interesting thing

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.240
that I think Twitter is doing,

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.320
but I know Facebook is doing for sure,

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.480
which is really interesting.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.520
So you have, what are the signals

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.560
that a human can provide at scale?

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.320
Like in Twitter, it's retweet.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.440
In Facebook, I think you can share.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.000
I think, yeah, but there's basic interactions.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.760
You can have comment and so on.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.040
But there's also in Facebook, and YouTube has this too,

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.360
is would you like to see more of this

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.720
or would you like to see less of this?

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.200
They post that sometimes.

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.240
And the thing that the neural net that's learning from that

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.720
has to figure out is the intent behind you saying,

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.160
I wanna see less of this.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.120
Did you see too much of this content already?

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.400
You like it, but you don't wanna see so much of it.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.680
You already figured it out, great, great.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.600
Or does this content not make you feel good?

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.960
There's so many interpretations

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.400
that I'd like to see less of this.

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.960
But if you get that kind of signal,

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.720
this actually can create a really

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.080
powerfully curated list of content

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.480
that is fed to you every day.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.680
That doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.880
It actually just makes you feel good in the good way,

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.560
which is like it challenges you,

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.920
but it doesn't exhaust you and make you

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.240
kind of this weird animal.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.680
I've been saying for a long time,

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.360
if I went on Facebook one morning

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.640
and they said, oh, we're testing a new option.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.200
Rather than showing you things

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.040
we think you're going to like,

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.120
we wanna show you some things

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.560
that we think you will disagree with,

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.680
but which we have some signals

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.760
that suggest it's of quality.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.120
Like, now that sounds interesting.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.280
Yeah, that sounds really interesting.

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.840
I wanna see something where like,

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.320
oh, I don't agree with,

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.960
so Larry Lessig is a good friend of mine,

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.080
founder of Creative Commons,

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.280
and he's moved on to doing stuff

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.360
about corruption and politics and so on.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.400
And I don't always agree with Larry,

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.720
but I always grapple with Larry

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.920
because he's so interesting and he's so thoughtful

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.920
that even when we don't agree,

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.800
I'm like, actually, I wanna hear him out, right?

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.680
Because I'm gonna learn from it.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.160
And that doesn't mean I always come around

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.000
to agree with him,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.240
but I'm gonna understand a perspective

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.680
and that's really a great feeling.

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.480
Yeah, there's this interesting thing on social media

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.840
where people kind of accuse others of saying,

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.240
well, you don't wanna hear opinions

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.600
that you disagree with or ideas you disagree with.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.400
I think this is something

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.000
that's thrown at me all the time.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.080
The reality is there's literally

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.760
almost nothing I enjoy more.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.200
See, it's an odd thing to accuse you of

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.080
because you have quite a wide range

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.880
of long conversations with a very diverse bunch of people.

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.880
But there is a very harsh drop off

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.520
because what I like is high quality disagreement

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.960
that really makes me think.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.840
And at a certain point, there's a threshold,

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.080
it's kind of a gray area

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.960
when the quality of the disagreement,

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.400
it just sounds like mocking

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.560
and you're not really interested

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.520
in a deep understanding of the topic

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.040
or you yourself don't seem to carry

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.120
deep understanding of the topic.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.800
There's something called Intelligence Squared Debates.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.960
The main one is the British version.

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.480
With the British accent, everything always sounds better.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.880
And the Brits seem to argue more intensely,

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.480
like they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.960
Those people I often disagree

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:20.920
with basically everybody involved and it's so fun.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.320
I learned something, that's high quality.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.200
If we could do that, if there's some way for me

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.240
to click a button that says filter out lower quality,

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.400
just today, just sometimes show it to me

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.680
because I want to be able to,

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.320
but today I'm just not in the mood for the mockery.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.720
Just high quality stuff.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.360
Even flat earth, I want to get high quality arguments

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360
for the flat earth.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.880
It would make me feel good

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.600
because I would see, oh, that's really interesting.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.800
Like I never really thought in my mind

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.880
to challenge the mainstream narrative

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.000
of general relativity, of a perception of physics.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.200
Maybe all of reality,

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.480
maybe all of space time is an illusion.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.560
That's really interesting.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.880
I never really thought about,

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.120
let me consider that fully, okay, what's the evidence?

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.320
How do you test that?

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.240
What are the alternatives?

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.280
How would you be able to have such consistent perception

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.480
of a physical reality if it's all of it is an illusion?

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.840
All of us seem to share the same kind of perception

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.680
of reality.

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.080
Like that's the kind of stuff I love,

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.720
but not like the mockery of it,

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.600
you know, that it seems that social media

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.800
can kind of inspire.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.720
Yeah, I talk sometimes about how people assume

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.600
that like the big debates in Wikipedia

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.600
or the sort of arguments are between the party of the left

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.920
and the party of the right.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.800
And I would say, no, it's actually the party

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.640
of the kind and thoughtful and the party of the jerks

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.000
is really it.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.880
I mean, left and right, like, yeah, bring me somebody

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:57.880
I disagree with politically

01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.880
as long as they're thoughtful, kind.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.880
We're gonna have a real discussion.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:06.880
I give an example of our article on abortion.

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.800
So, you know, if you can bring together

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.640
a kind and thoughtful Catholic priest

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.680
and a kind and thoughtful Planned Parenthood activist,

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.840
and they're gonna work together on the article on abortion,

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.880
that can be a really great thing

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.080
if they're both kind and thoughtful.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.600
Like that's the important part.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.440
They're never gonna agree on the topic,

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.760
but they will understand, okay,

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.440
like Wikipedia is not gonna take a side,

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.720
but Wikipedia is gonna explain what the debate is about.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.840
And we're gonna try to characterize it fairly.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.560
And it turns out like you're kind and thoughtful people,

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.320
even if they're quite ideological,

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.840
like a Catholic priest is generally gonna be quite ideological

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.760
on the subject of abortion,

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.680
but they can grapple with ideas and they can discuss.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.560
And they may feel very proud of the entry

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.720
at the end of the day,

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.320
not because they suppress the other side's views,

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:58.200
but because they think the case has been stated very well

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.400
that other people can come to understand it.

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.840
And if you're highly ideological,

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.240
you assume, I think naturally,

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.480
if people understood as much about this as I do,

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.640
they'll probably agree with me.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.680
You may be wrong about that, but that's often the case.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.280
So that's where, you know,

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.800
that's what I think we need to encourage more of

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.840
in society generally is grappling with ideas

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.920
in a really, you know, thoughtful way.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.880
So is it possible if the majority of volunteers,

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.880
editors of Wikipedia really dislike Donald Trump,

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.440
are they still able to write an article

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.520
that empathizes with the perspective of,

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.680
for a time at least,

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.920
a very large percentage of the United States

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.760
that were supporters of Donald Trump

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.280
and to have a full, broad representation

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:50.440
of him as a human being, him as a political leader,

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.320
him as a set of policies promised

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.640
and implemented, all that kind of stuff?

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.640
Yeah, I think so.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.400
And I think if you read the article, it's pretty good.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:05.760
And I think a piece of that is within our community,

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.120
if people have the self-awareness to understand.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.760
So I personally wouldn't go and edit the entry

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.600
on Donald Trump.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.760
I get emotional about it.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.240
And I'm like, I'm not good at this.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.720
And if I tried to do it, I would fail.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.600
I wouldn't be a good Wikipedian.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.200
So it's better if I just step back

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.520
and let people who are more dispassionate

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.600
on this topic edit it.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:30.920
Whereas there are other topics

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.920
that are incredibly emotional to some people

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.320
where I can actually do quite well.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.040
Like I'm gonna be okay.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.600
Maybe we were discussing earlier the efficacy of masks.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.480
I'm like, oh, I think that's an interesting problem.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.840
And I don't know the answer,

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.440
but I can help kind of catalog what's the best evidence

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.280
and so on.

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:50.680
And I'm not gonna get upset.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.960
I'm not gonna get angry.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.320
I'm able to be a good Wikipedian.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.640
So I think that's important.

01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.640
And I do think though in a related framework

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:07.160
that the composition of the community is really important,

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.200
not because Wikipedia is or should be a battleground,

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.040
but because blind spots.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.480
Like maybe I don't even realize what's biased

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.240
if I'm particularly of a certain point of view

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.080
and I've never thought much about it.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.080
So one of the things we focus on a lot,

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.640
the Wikipedia volunteers are,

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.720
we don't know the exact number,

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.320
but let's say 80% plus male.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.000
And there are certain demographic,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
they tend to be college-educated,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.920
heavier on tech geeks than not, et cetera, et cetera.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.160
So there is a demographic to the community

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.240
and that's pretty much global.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.880
I mean, somebody said to me once,

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.280
why is it only white men who edit Wikipedia?

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.160
And I said, we've obviously not met

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.440
the Japanese Wikipedia community.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.280
It's kind of a joke

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:54.560
because the broader principle still stands.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.280
Who edits Japanese Wikipedia?

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.520
A bunch of geeky men, right?

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.800
And women as well.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.000
So we do have women in the community

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.240
and that's very important.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:04.720
But we do think, okay, you know what?

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.800
That does lead to some problems.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.120
It leads to some content issues

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:13.280
simply because people write more about what they know

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.880
and what they're interested in.

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.760
They'll tend to be dismissive of things

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.600
as being unimportant if it's not something

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.720
that they personally have an interest in.

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.920
I like the example as a parent,

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.760
I would say our entries on early childhood development

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.640
probably aren't as good as they should be

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.680
because a lot of the Wikipedia volunteers,

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.800
actually we're getting older, the Wikipedians,

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:38.360
so the demographic has changed a bit.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.320
But it's like if you've got a bunch of 25 year old

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.800
tech geek dudes who don't have kids,

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.200
they're just not gonna be interested

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.680
in early childhood development.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.800
And if they tried to write about it,

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.880
they probably wouldn't do a good job

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.320
because they don't know anything about it.

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:56.680
And somebody did a look at our entries

01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.600
on novelists who've won a major literary prize.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:03.520
And they looked at the male novelists versus the female.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.360
And the male novelists had longer

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.240
and higher quality entries.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:08.080
And why is that?

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.160
Well, it's not because,

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:12.040
because I know hundreds of Wikipedians,

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.840
it's not because these are a bunch of biased,

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.160
sexist men who are like books by women are not important.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.160
It's like, no, actually there is a gender

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.240
kind of breakdown of readership.

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.320
There are books like hard science fiction

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.240
is a classic example.

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:35.360
Hard science fiction, mostly read by men.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.240
Other types of novels, more read by women.

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.040
And if we don't have women in the community,

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.920
then these award-winning clearly important novelists

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.000
may have less coverage.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.520
And not because anybody consciously thinks,

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.720
oh, we don't like what a book by Maya Angelou,

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.800
like who cares?

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.120
She's a poet, like that's not interesting.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.360
No, but just because people write what they know,

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.720
they write what they're interested in.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.640
So we do think diversity in the community

01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.800
is really important.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.120
And that's one area where I do think it's really clear.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.520
But I can also say, you know what,

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.720
actually that also applies in the political sphere.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.840
Like to say, actually we do want kind

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.600
and thoughtful Catholic priests,

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.080
kind and thoughtful conservatives,

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.960
kind and thoughtful libertarians,

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.520
kind and thoughtful Marxists to come in.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.440
The key is the kind and thoughtful piece.

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.360
So when people sometimes come to Wikipedia,

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.000
outraged by some dramatic thing that's happened on Twitter,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
they come to Wikipedia with a chip on their shoulder

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.600
ready to do battle,

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.760
and it just doesn't work out very well.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.320
And there's tribes in general

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.320
where I think there's a responsibility on the larger group

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.840
to be even kinder and more welcoming to the smaller group.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.840
Yeah, we think that's really important.

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.040
And so, you know, oftentimes people come in and,

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.880
you know, there's a lot,

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.600
when I talk about community health,

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.880
one of the aspects of that that we do think about a lot

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.440
that I think about a lot is not about politics.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.920
It's just like, how are we treating newcomers

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.480
to the community?

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:13.480
And so I can tell you what our ideals are,

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.200
what our philosophy is, but do we live up to that?

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.320
So, you know, the ideal is you come to Wikipedia,

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.120
we have rules, like one of our fundamental rules

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.440
is ignore all rules, which is partly written that way

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.080
because it kind of piques people's attention,

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.080
like what the hell kind of rule is that, you know?

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.680
But basically says, look, don't get nervous and depressed

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.480
about a bunch of, you know,

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.680
what's the formatting of your footnote, right?

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.280
So you shouldn't come to Wikipedia, add a link,

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.840
and then get banned or yelled at

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.480
because it's not the right format.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.920
Instead, somebody should go,

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.360
oh, hey, yeah, thanks for helping,

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:55.000
but, you know, here's the link to how to format,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.320
you know, if you want to keep going,

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.560
you might want to learn how to format a footnote

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.600
and to be friendly and to be open and to say,

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.960
oh, right, oh, you're new,

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.280
and you clearly don't know everything about Wikipedia.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.440
And, you know, sometimes in any community

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.280
that can be quite hard.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.840
So people come in and they've got a great big idea

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.760
and they're gonna propose this to the Wikipedia community

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.360
and they have no idea.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.040
That's basically a perennial discussion

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.920
we've had 7,000 times before.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:23.600
And so then ideally you would say to the person,

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.360
oh, yeah, great, thanks.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.880
Like a lot of people have, and here's where we got to,

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.080
and here's the nuanced conversation

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.240
we've had about that in the past

01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.000
that I think you'll find interesting.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:33.960
And sometimes people are just like,

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.400
oh God, another one, you know,

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.560
who's come in with this idea which doesn't work

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.080
and they don't understand why.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.760
You can lose patience, but you shouldn't.

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.640
And that's kind of human, you know.

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:46.280
But I think it just does require really thinking, you know,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
in a self-aware manner of like, oh, I was once a newbie.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.280
Actually, we do have, we have a great,

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.200
I just did an interview with Emily Temple Woods

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:00.320
who she was Wikipedia of the year.

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.200
She's just like a great, well-known Wikipedia.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.680
And I interviewed her for my book

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:07.000
and she told me something I never knew.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Apparently it's not a secret,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.400
like she didn't reveal it to me,

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.600
but is that when she started at Wikipedia, she was a vandal.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.880
She came in and vandalized Wikipedia

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.600
and then basically what happened was

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.360
she'd done some sort of vandalized a couple of articles.

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.000
And then somebody popped up on her talk page and said,

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.360
hey, like, why are you doing this?

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.520
Like, we're trying to make an encyclopedia here

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.240
and this wasn't very kind.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:31.040
And she felt so bad.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.640
She's like, oh, right, I didn't really think of it that way.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.640
She just was coming in as, she was like 13 years old,

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.760
combative and, you know, like having fun and trolling a bit.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.440
And then she's like, oh, actually, oh, I see your point

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.680
and became a great Wikipedian.

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.680
So that's the ideal really,

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:48.800
is that you don't just go, throw a block, fuck off.

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.360
You go, hey, you know, like what gives, you know,

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:56.120
which is I think the way we tend to treat things

01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:57.720
in real life, you know,

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.080
if you've got somebody who's doing something obnoxious

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:05.480
in your friend group, you probably go, hey, like, really,

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.040
I don't know if you've noticed,

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.640
but I think this person is actually quite hurt

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.640
that you keep making that joke about them.

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.400
And then they usually go, oh, you know what,

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.080
I thought that was okay, I didn't, and then they stop

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.320
or they keep it up and then everybody goes,

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.560
well, you're the asshole.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.760
Well, yeah, I mean, that's just an example

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:25.680
that gives me faith in humanity

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.680
that we're all capable and wanting to be kind to each other.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.000
And in general, the fact that there's a small group

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.480
of volunteers, they're able to contribute so much

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.360
to the organization, the collection,

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:45.720
the discussion of all of human knowledge.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.720
It's so, it makes me so grateful

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.360
to be part of this whole human project.

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.520
That's one of the reasons I love Wikipedia

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.400
is gives me faith in humanity.

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:59.400
No, I once was at Wikimani is our annual conference

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:02.600
and people come from all around the world,

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.560
really active volunteers.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.760
I was at the dinner, we were in Egypt

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:08.360
at Wikimani in Alexandria.

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.040
I was at the sort of closing dinner or whatever,

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.720
and a friend of mine came and sat at the table

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.800
and she's sort of been in the movement

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.720
more broadly, Creative Commons.

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.800
She's not really a Wikipedian.

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.640
She'd come to the conference

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:21.280
because she's into Creative Commons and all that.

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.840
So we have dinner and it just turned out,

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.280
I sat down at the table with most of the members

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.600
of the English Language Arbitration Committee.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.320
And they're a bunch of very sweet, geeky Wikipedians.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.800
And as we left the table, I said to her,

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.640
it's really like, I still find this kind of sense

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.040
of amazement, like we just had dinner

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.920
with some of the most powerful people

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.800
in English language media.

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.400
Because they're the people who are like the final

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:48.000
court of appeal in English Wikipedia.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.920
And thank goodness they're not media moguls, right?

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.840
They're just a bunch of geeks who are just like

01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.560
well-liked in the community because they're kind

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.200
and they're thoughtful and they really, you know,

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.200
sort of think about things.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:01.960
I was like, this is great, love Wikipedia.

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.120
It's like to the degree that geeks run the best aspect

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.880
of human civilization brings me joy in all aspects.

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:14.160
And this is true in programming, like Linux,

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:18.120
like programmers, like people that kind of specialize

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:21.520
in a thing and they don't really get caught up

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:25.720
into the mess of the bickering of society.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.200
They just kind of do their thing

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.760
and they value the craftsmanship of it,

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.600
the competence of it.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:33.520
If you've never heard of this or looked into it,

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.760
you'll enjoy it.

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:36.800
I read something recently that I didn't even know about,

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.800
but like the fundamental like time zones

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.440
and they change from time to time.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.720
Sometimes a country will pass daylight savings

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.080
or move it by a week, whatever.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.080
There's a file that's on all sort of Unix based computers

01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.920
and basically all computers end up using this file.

01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:59.840
It's the official time zone file, but why is it official?

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.680
It's just this one guy.

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.640
It's like this guy and a group, a community around him.

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.720
And basically something weird happened

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:11.080
and it broke something because he was on vacation.

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.560
And I'm just like, isn't that wild, right?

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.360
That you would think, I mean, first of all,

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.600
most people never even think about like,

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.960
how do computers know about time zones?

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.080
Well, they know because they just use this file

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.360
which tells all the time zones

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.800
and which dates they change and all of that.

01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:28.280
But there's this one guy and he doesn't get paid for it.

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.640
It's just, he's like, you know,

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.280
with all the billions of people on the planet,

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.840
he sort of put his hand up and goes,

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.080
yo, I'll take care of the time zones.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.960
And there's a lot, a lot, a lot of programmers

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.520
listening to this right now with PTSD about time zones.

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.680
And then there, I mean, there's on top of this one guy,

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.880
there's other libraries, the different programming languages

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.480
that help manage the time zones for you,

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.040
but still there's just within those,

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.080
it's amazing just the packages, the libraries,

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.000
how few people build them out of their own love

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.200
for building, for creating, for community and all of that.

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.080
It's, I almost like don't want to interfere

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.480
with the natural habitat of the geek.

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.920
Like when you spot them in the wild,

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.160
you just want to be like, whoa, careful.

01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:16.960
That thing needs to be treasured.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.760
I met a guy many years ago, lovely, really sweet guy.

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.440
And he was running a bot on English Wikipedia

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.640
that I thought, wow, that's actually super clever.

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.280
And what he had done is, his bot was like spell checking,

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:33.320
but rather than simple spell checking,

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.520
what he had done is create a database of words

01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.280
that are commonly mistaken for other words.

01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.040
They're spelled wrong, so I can't even give an example.

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.000
And so the word is, people often spell it wrong,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
but no spell checker catches it because it is another word.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.840
And so what he did is he wrote a bot

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.360
that looks for these words and then checks the sentence

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.440
around it for certain keywords.

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.440
So in some context, this isn't correct, but buoy and boy.

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:11.720
People sometimes type B-O-Y when they mean B-O-U-Y.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.560
So if he sees the word boy, B-O-Y in an article,

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.920
he would look in the context and see,

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.480
is this a nautical reference?

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:19.800
And if it was, he didn't auto correct,

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.920
he just would flag it up to himself to go,

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.080
oh, check this one out.

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.400
And that's not a great example,

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.600
but he had thousands of examples.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.160
I was like, oh, that's amazing.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.200
Like I would have never thought to do that.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.560
And I'm glad that somebody did.

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.720
And that's also part of the openness of the system.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.160
And also I think being a charity,

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.280
being this idea of like, actually,

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.000
this is a gift to the world that makes someone go,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.040
oh, oh, well, I'll put my hand up.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.840
Like I see a little piece of things that I can make better

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:49.840
because I'm a good programmer

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.440
and I can write this script to do this thing

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.560
and I'll find it fun.

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.360
Amazing.

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:58.480
Well, I gotta ask about this big, bold decision

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.360
at the very beginning to not do advertisements

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.840
on the website and just in general,

01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.960
the philosophy of the business model, Wikipedia,

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:06.400
what went behind that?

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:07.240
Yeah.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.040
So I think most people know this, but we're a charity.

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.760
So in the US, you know, registered as a charity

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.080
and we don't have any ads on the site.

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.040
And the vast majority of the money is from donations,

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.640
but the vast majority from small donors.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.200
So people giving 25 bucks or whatever.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:30.960
If you're listening to this, go donate.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.800
Go donate.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:32.640
Donate now.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.480
25 bucks.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480
I've donated so many times.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.680
And we have, you know, millions of donors every year,

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.640
but it's like a small percentage of people.

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.880
I would say in the early days,

01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:42.880
a big part of it was aesthetic almost

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.960
as much as anything else.

01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:46.080
It was just like, I just think,

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.360
I don't really want ads in Wikipedia.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.160
I just think it would be,

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.040
there's a lot of reasons why it might not be good.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.040
And even back then, I didn't think as much as I have since

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.840
about a business model can tend to drive you

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.280
in a certain place.

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.680
And really thinking that through in advance

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.840
is really important because you might say,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.080
yeah, we're really, really keen

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.800
on community control and neutrality.

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:17.840
But if we had an advertising-based business model,

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.840
probably that would begin to erode.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.120
Even if I believe in it very strongly,

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.320
organizations tend to follow the money

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.680
in the DNA in the long run.

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:29.920
And so things like, I mean, it's easy to think about

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.080
some of the immediate problems.

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:36.080
So like if you go to read about, I don't know,

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:44.160
Nissan car company, and if you saw an ad

01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:45.880
for the new Nissan at the top of the page,

01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.800
you might be like, did they pay for this?

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:51.000
Do the advertisers have influence over the content?

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.200
Because you kind of wonder about that

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.640
for all kinds of media.

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.400
And that undermines trust.

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:56.920
Undermines trust, right?

01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:01.560
But also things like, we don't have clickbait headlines

01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:05.000
in Wikipedia, you've never seen Wikipedia entries

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.640
with all this kind of listicles,

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:11.240
sort of the 10 funniest cat pictures,

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:13.080
number seven make you cry.

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:14.000
None of that kind of stuff,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.440
because there's no incentive, no reason to do that.

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:21.400
Also, there's no reason to have an algorithm to say,

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:25.040
actually, we're gonna use our algorithm to drive you

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.600
to stay on the website longer.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.160
We're gonna use the algorithm to drive you to,

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.680
it's like, oh, you're reading about Queen Victoria.

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:33.680
There's nothing to sell you

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:34.840
when you're reading about Queen Victoria.

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.160
Let's move you on to Las Vegas,

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.440
because actually the ad revenue around hotels

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.040
in Las Vegas is quite good.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:42.320
So we don't have that sort of,

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:44.360
there's no incentive for the organization to go,

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.080
oh, let's move people around

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.000
to things that have better ad revenue.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.040
Instead, it's just like, oh, well,

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:51.920
what's most interesting to the community

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.080
just to make those links.

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:58.080
So that decision just seemed obvious to me,

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:03.200
but as I say, it was less of a business decision

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.680
and more of an aesthetic.

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:07.480
It's like, oh, this is how I like Wikipedia,

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.320
it doesn't have ads.

02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:11.200
I don't really want these early days,

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.040
like a lot of the ads,

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.760
that was well before the era

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:16.960
of really quality ad targeting and all that.

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:19.720
So you get a lot of banners,

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:22.600
punch the monkey ads and all that kind of nonsense.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:27.600
And so, but there was no guarantee.

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:30.200
There was no, it was not really clear

02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.240
how could we fund this?

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:34.640
Like it was pretty cheap,

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:38.800
it still is quite cheap compared to most,

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.360
we don't have 100,000 employees and all of that.

02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.840
But would we be able to raise money through donations?

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.240
And so I remember the first time that we did,

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.080
like really did a donation campaign

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.080
was on a Christmas day in 2003, I think it was,

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.760
there was, we had three servers,

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.560
database servers and two front end servers,

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.880
and they were all the same size or whatever.

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:12.040
And two of them crashed, they broke.

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.320
Like I don't even know, remember now,

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.880
like the hard drive, it was like, it's Christmas day.

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.480
So I scrambled on Christmas day

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.200
to sort of go onto the database server,

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.400
which fortunately survived,

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.720
and have it become a front end server as well.

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.800
And then the site was really slow

02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.200
and it wasn't working very well.

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.360
And I was like, okay, it's time,

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.400
we need to do a fundraiser.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:36.400
And so I was hoping to raise $20,000 in a month's time,

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:41.400
but we raised nearly 30,000 within two, three weeks time.

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.160
So that was the first proof point of like,

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.280
oh, like we put a banner up and people will donate.

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.840
Like we just explained we need the money

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.320
and people are like, already,

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.520
we were very small back then,

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:51.840
and people were like, oh yeah,

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.200
like I love this, I wanna contribute.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.600
Then over the years, we've become more sophisticated

02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.440
about the fundraising campaigns

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.080
and we've tested a lot of different messaging and so forth.

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.280
What we used to think,

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.320
I remember one year we really went heavy with,

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.440
we have great ambitions to,

02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.200
the idea of Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.560
for every single person on the planet.

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:20.760
So what about the languages of Sub-Saharan Africa?

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:22.600
So I thought, okay, we're trying to raise money.

02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.280
We need to talk about that

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:26.720
because it's really important and near and dear to my heart.

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:29.160
And just instinctively knowing nothing

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:31.360
about charity fundraising, you see it all around.

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.880
It's like, oh, charities always mention

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:35.800
like the poor people they're helping.

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.160
So let's talk about that.

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.880
Didn't really work as well.

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.600
The pitch that, like this is very vague

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:42.480
and very sort of broad,

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:45.760
but the pitch that works better than any other in general

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.480
is a fairness pitch of like,

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.280
you use it all the time, you should probably chip in.

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.200
And most people are like, yeah, you know what?

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:56.000
My life would suck without Wikipedia.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.160
I use it constantly and whatever, I should chip in.

02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:01.080
Like it just seems like the right thing to do.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.520
And that, and there's many variants on that obviously.

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.840
And that's really, it works.

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.640
And like people are like, oh yeah, like Wikipedia.

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.520
I love Wikipedia and you know, I shouldn't.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:13.440
And so sometimes people say,

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.680
you know, why are you always begging for money

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:17.600
on the website?

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.600
And you know, it's not that often.

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:22.280
It's not that much, but it does happen.

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.320
They're like, why don't you just get Google

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.760
and Facebook and Microsoft?

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.520
Why don't they pay for it?

02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:31.800
And I'm like, hmm,

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:33.960
I don't think that's really the right answer

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:35.520
because it starts to creep in.

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.880
Influence starts to creep in

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.760
and questions start to creep in.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:42.400
Like the best funding for Wikipedia is the small donors.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.960
We also have major donors, right?

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:46.280
We have high net worth people who donate,

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.360
but we always are very careful about that sort of thing

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:52.640
to say, wow, that's really great and really important,

02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.240
but we can't let that become influence

02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.800
because that would just be really quite, yeah,

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:01.040
not good for Wikipedia.

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:03.760
I would love to know how many times I visited Wikipedia,

02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.640
how much time I spent on it

02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.680
because I have a general sense

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.280
that it's the most useful site I've ever used

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.920
competing maybe with Google search,

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.680
which ultimately lands on Wikipedia.

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:16.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.560
But if I were just reminded of like,

02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:21.480
hey, remember all those times your life

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:23.440
was made better because of the site?

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.880
I think I would be much more like, yeah,

02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:30.000
why did I waste money on site XYZ

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.080
when I could be like, I should be giving a lot here?

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:37.280
Well, the Guardian newspaper has a similar model,

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.800
which is they have ads, but they also,

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:40.640
there's no paywall,

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.440
but they just encourage people to donate and they do that.

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.640
I've sometimes seen a banner saying,

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:51.880
oh, this is your 134th article you've read this year.

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.960
Would you like to donate?

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.600
And I think that's, I think it's effective.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.920
I mean, they're testing,

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.240
but also I wonder just for some people,

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:01.360
if they just don't feel like guilty and then think,

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.400
well, I shouldn't bother them so much, I don't know.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.240
It's a good question.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.400
I don't know the answer.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.040
I guess that's the thing I could also turn on

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.400
because that would make me happy.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.760
I feel like legitimately there's some sites

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:15.000
and it speaks to our social media discussion.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.760
Wikipedia unquestionably makes me feel better about myself

02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.880
if I spent time on it.

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.920
Like there's some websites where I'm like,

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.600
if I spent time on Twitter,

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.280
sometimes I'm like, I regret.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.120
There's, I think Ilan talks about this,

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.280
minimize the number of regretted minutes.

02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.880
My number of regretted minutes on Wikipedia is like zero.

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.600
I don't remember a time,

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:41.640
I've just discovered this,

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:44.720
I started following on Instagram a page,

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:46.720
depth of Wikipedia.

02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:47.560
Oh yeah.

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:49.320
There's like crazy Wikipedia page.

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:51.160
There's no Wikipedia page that-

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.800
Yeah, I gave her a media contributor

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.800
of the year award this year because she's so great.

02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.640
Yeah, she's amazing.

02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:58.400
Depth of Wikipedia is so fun.

02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:02.680
Yeah, so that's the kind of interesting point that I,

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:05.720
I don't even know if there's a competitor.

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:08.440
There may be the sort of programming stack overflow

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.320
type of websites, but everything else,

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.600
there's always a trade off.

02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:14.520
There's a, it's probably because of the ad driven model

02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.760
because there's an incentive to pull you into click bait

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.440
and Wikipedia has no click bait.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.600
It's all about the quality of the knowledge

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:22.760
and the wisdom and so on.

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:23.600
No, that's right.

02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.000
And I also like Stack Overflow, although I wonder,

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.600
I wonder what you think of this.

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.680
I've, I, so I only program for fun as a hobby

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.040
and I don't have enough time to do it, but I do.

02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.600
And I'm not very good at it.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.080
So therefore I end up on Stack Overflow quite a lot,

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.080
trying to figure out what's gone wrong.

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:44.080
And I have really transitioned to using ChatGBT

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:49.400
much more for that because I can often find

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:52.680
the answer clearly explained and it just,

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.720
it works better than sifting through threads.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.040
And I kind of feel bad about that

02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:58.520
because I do love Stack Overflow and their community.

02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.400
I mean, I'm assuming I haven't read anything about

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.240
in the news about it.

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:03.640
I'm assuming they are keenly aware of this

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.080
and they're thinking about how can we sort of use

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:10.320
this chunk of knowledge that we've got here

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.680
and provide a new type of interface where you can query it

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:17.000
with a question and actually get an answer

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.800
that's based on the answers that we've had.

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.280
I don't know.

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:25.000
And I think Stack Overflow currently has policies

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.280
against using GPT, like there's a contentious

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.120
kind of tension.

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:28.960
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:31.280
But they're trying to figure that out.

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:33.520
And so we are similar in that regard.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.840
Like obviously all the things we've talked about,

02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:38.720
like ChatGBT makes stuff up and it makes up references.

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:41.160
So our community has already put into place

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:43.720
some policies about it, but roughly speaking,

02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:45.840
there's always more nuance, but roughly speaking,

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.560
it's sort of like you, the human,

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:51.280
are responsible for what you put into Wikipedia.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.920
So if you use ChatGBT, you better check it.

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.040
There's a lot of great use cases of like,

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.720
oh, well, I'm not a native speaker of German,

02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.000
but I kind of am pretty good.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:03.840
I'm not talking about myself,

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.680
a hypothetical me that's pretty good.

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:10.280
And I kind of just want to run my edit through ChatGBT

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:13.680
in German to go make sure my grammar's okay.

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.720
That's actually cool.

02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:20.480
Does it make you sad that people might use,

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:24.120
increasingly use ChatGBT for something

02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.720
where they would previously use Wikipedia?

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:29.720
So basically use it to answer basic questions

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:32.320
about the Eiffel Tower.

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:36.080
And where the answer really comes at the source of it

02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:38.800
from Wikipedia, but they're using this as an interface.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.680
Yeah, no, no, that's completely fine.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:43.600
I mean, part of it is our ethos has always been,

02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:45.560
here's our gift to the world, make something.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:49.200
So if the knowledge is more accessible to people,

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:52.800
even if they're not coming through us, that's fine.

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:53.960
Now, obviously we do have

02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:55.960
certain business model concerns, right?

02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.720
Like if, and we've talked,

02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.400
where we've had more conversation about this,

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:01.840
this whole GPT thing is new.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:04.440
Things like, if you ask Alexa,

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.520
what is the Eiffel Tower?

02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:11.040
And she reads you the first two sentences from Wikipedia

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.240
and doesn't say it's from Wikipedia.

02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:15.520
And they've recently started citing Wikipedia.

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.520
Then we worry like, oh, if people don't know

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.280
they're getting the knowledge from us,

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.520
are they gonna donate money?

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:22.280
Or are they just thinking, oh, what's Wikipedia for?

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:23.440
I can just ask Alexa.

02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.600
It's like, well, Alexa only knows anything

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.040
because she read Wikipedia.

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:28.240
So we do think about that,

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:30.800
but it doesn't bother me in the sense of like,

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.720
oh, I want people to always come to Wikipedia first.

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.920
But we're also, you know, had a great demo,

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.960
literally just hacked together over a weekend

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.120
by our head of machine learning,

02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:44.120
where he did this little thing to say,

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.120
you could ask any question.

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:48.520
And he was just knocking it together.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:53.520
So he used the OpenAI's API just to make a demo,

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:58.400
ask you a question, why do ducks fly south for winter?

02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.640
Just the kind of thing you think,

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.120
oh, I might just Google for that.

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.880
I might start looking in Wikipedia, I don't know.

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:08.280
And so what he does, he asks, judge me,

02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.920
what are some Wikipedia entries that might answer this?

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:13.640
Then he grabbed those Wikipedia entries,

02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.240
said, here's some Wikipedia entries,

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:18.480
answer this question based only on the information in this.

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.840
And he had pretty good results

02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:22.680
and it kind of prevented the making stuff up.

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.880
It's just, he hacked together a weekend,

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.080
but what it made me think about was,

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.560
oh, okay, so now we've got this huge body of knowledge

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.800
that in many cases, you're like, oh, I'm really,

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:37.800
I want to know about Queen Victoria.

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:39.320
I'm just going to go read the Wikipedia entry

02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:44.320
and it's going to take me through her life and so forth.

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:46.600
But other times you've got a specific question

02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.280
and you have a better search experience

02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.760
where you can come to Wikipedia, ask your specific question,

02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:54.200
get your specific answer that's from Wikipedia,

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.800
including links to the articles you might want to read next.

02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.200
And that's just a step forward.

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.560
That's just using a new type of technology

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.200
to make the extraction of information

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:08.760
from this body of text into my brain faster and easier.

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.720
So I think that's kind of cool.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:15.120
I would love to see a chat GPT grounding

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.440
into websites like Wikipedia

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.880
and the other comparable website to me

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:21.920
will be like Wolfram Alpha

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.480
for more mathematical knowledge, that kind of stuff.

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.040
So grounding, taking you to a page that is really crafted.

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:32.320
As opposed to, the moment you start actually taking you

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.640
to like journalist websites, like news websites,

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.080
it starts getting a little iffy.

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.120
It's getting a little, because they have,

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.240
you're now in a land that has a wrong incentive.

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.480
Right, yeah, and you need somebody

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:48.080
to have filtered through that

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.040
and sort of tried to knock off the rough edges.

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:53.480
Yeah, no, it's very, I think that's exactly right.

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.480
And I think that kind of grounding is,

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.480
I think they're working really hard on it.

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:03.680
I think that's really important.

02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:06.800
And that actually, so if you asked me to step back

02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:09.680
and be like very business-like about our business model

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.520
and where's it gonna go for us

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.760
and are we gonna lose half our donations

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.400
because everybody's just gonna stop coming to Wikipedia

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:16.480
and go to CHPT.

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.840
I think grounding will help a lot

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.160
because frankly, most questions people have,

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.880
if they provide proper links,

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:24.880
we're gonna be at the top of that

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.360
just like we are in Google.

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.120
So we're still gonna get tons of recognition

02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:30.280
and tons of traffic just from,

02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:35.040
even if it's just the moral properness of saying,

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.840
here's my source.

02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:39.200
So I think we're gonna be all right in that.

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.680
Yeah, and the close partnership of,

02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:43.760
if the model is fine-tuned, is constantly retrained,

02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.680
that Wikipedia is one of the primary places

02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.600
where if you want to change what the model knows,

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:52.000
one of the things you should do is contribute to Wikipedia

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.040
or clarify Wikipedia.

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:54.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.280
Or elaborate, expand, all that kind of stuff.

02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:58.880
You mentioned all of us have controversies.

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.320
I have to ask, do you find the controversy

02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:04.080
of whether you are the sole founder

02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.640
or the co-founder of Wikipedia ironic, absurd,

02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.520
interesting, important?

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.080
What are your comments?

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.560
I would say unimportant, not that interesting.

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:19.840
I mean, one of the things that people

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.720
are sometimes surprised to hear me say is,

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:25.120
I actually think Larry Sanger doesn't get enough credit

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:27.120
for his early work in Wikipedia,

02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.280
even though I think co-founder's

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.240
not the right title for that.

02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:33.480
So, you know, like he had a lot of impact

02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.120
and a lot of great work,

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:37.080
and I disagree with him about a lot of things since

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:38.600
and all that, and that's fine.

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:42.280
To me, that's like, it's one of these things

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.760
that the media love a falling out story,

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.480
so they wanna make a big deal out of it,

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.080
and I'm just like, yeah, no.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:52.240
So there's a lot of interesting

02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:54.360
engineering contributions in the early days,

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.600
like you were saying, there's debates

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:57.320
about how to structure it,

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.400
what the heck is this thing that we're doing,

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:02.240
and there's important people that contributed to that.

02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.480
Yeah, definitely.

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:06.480
So he also, you said you had some disagreements.

02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.520
Larry Sanger said that nobody should trust

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.600
Wikipedia, and that Wikipedia seems to assume

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.800
that there's only one legitimate defensible version

02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:16.480
of the truth on any controversial question.

02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:18.800
That's not how Wikipedia used to be.

02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.120
I presume you disagree with that analysis.

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:22.760
Yeah, I mean, just straight up, I disagree.

02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.840
Like, go and read any Wikipedia entry

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.800
on a controversial topic, and what you'll see

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:29.560
is a really diligent effort to explain

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:32.320
all the relevant sides, so yeah, just disagree.

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.960
So on controversial questions,

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.280
you think perspectives are generally represented?

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:37.120
Yeah.

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:39.240
It has to do with kind of the tension

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:42.440
between the mainstream and the non-mainstream

02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:43.520
that we were talking about.

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:45.280
Yeah, no, I mean, for sure.

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.160
Like, to take this area of discussion seriously

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:54.720
is to say, yeah, you know what, actually,

02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.800
that is a big part of what Wikipedians

02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.800
spend their time grappling with,

02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.640
is to say, you know, how do we figure out

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:09.640
whether a less popular view is pseudoscience?

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:13.600
Is it just a less popular view

02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:16.120
that's gaining acceptance in the mainstream?

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.720
Is it fringe versus crackpot, et cetera, et cetera?

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:22.240
And that debate is what you've gotta do.

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:24.160
There's no choice about having that debate

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.840
of grappling with something, and I think we do,

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:29.000
and I think that's really important,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.560
and I think if anybody said to the Wikipedia community,

02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.520
gee, you should stop sort of covering minority viewpoints

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:40.400
on this issue, I think they would say,

02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:42.360
I don't even understand why you would say that.

02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:45.440
Like, we have to sort of grapple with minority viewpoints

02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:47.560
in science and politics and so on,

02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:52.800
but it's, and like, this is one of the reasons why,

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:56.320
there is no magic simple answer to all these things.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.880
It's really contextual.

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:01.800
It's case by case.

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:03.440
It's like, you know, you've gotta really say,

02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.280
okay, what is the context here?

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.120
How do you do it?

02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.280
And you've always gotta be open to correction

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.840
and to change and to sort of challenge

02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:13.120
and always be sort of serious about that.

02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:15.160
I think what happens, again, with social media,

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.080
is when there is that grappling process in Wikipedia

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.680
and a decision is made to remove a paragraph

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:24.320
or to remove a thing or to say a thing,

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.480
you're gonna notice the one direction of the oscillation

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.840
of the grappling and not the correction,

02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.080
and you're gonna highlight that and say,

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:36.160
how come this person, I don't know,

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.760
I want maybe legitimacy of elections.

02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:40.160
That's the thing that comes up.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:42.600
Donald Trump may be previous.

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.120
I can give a really good example,

02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:47.720
which is there was this sort of dust-up

02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:52.720
about the definition of recession in Wikipedia.

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:55.200
So the accusation was,

02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:58.240
and the accusation was often quite ridiculous and extreme,

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.400
which is under pressure from the Biden administration,

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:04.160
Wikipedia changed the definition of recession

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:07.360
to make Biden look good, or we did it not under pressure,

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.400
but because we're a bunch of lunatic leftists and so on.

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.880
And then when I see something like that in the press,

02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:15.560
I'm like, oh dear, what's happened here?

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:16.440
How did we do that?

02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:19.480
Because I always just accept things for five seconds first.

02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.560
And then I go and I look and I'm like,

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.480
you know what, that's literally completely

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.880
not what happened.

02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:27.200
What happened was one editor thought

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:28.680
the article needed restructuring.

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.640
So the article is always said,

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.480
and so the traditional kind of loose definition

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:35.920
of recession is two quarters of negative growth.

02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.600
But there's always been within economics,

02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:40.440
within important agencies

02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:42.040
in different countries around the world,

02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:43.280
a lot of nuance around that.

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:45.880
And there's other like factors that go into it and so forth.

02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.000
And it's just an interesting, complicated topic.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.760
And so the article has always had the definition

02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.120
of two quarters.

02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.200
And the only thing that really changed was moving that

02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.720
from the lead from the top paragraph to further down.

02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:02.400
And then new stories appeared saying,

02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.840
Wikipedia has changed the definition of recession.

02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:07.040
And then we got a huge rush of trolls coming in.

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.840
So the article was temporarily protected.

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:10.720
I think only semi-protected.

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:13.120
And people were told, go to the talk page to discuss.

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.400
So it was a dust up that was,

02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:17.080
when you look at it as a Wikipedia and you're like,

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.480
oh, like this is a really routine kind of editorial debate.

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.800
Another example, which unfortunately our friend,

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:28.200
Elon fell for, I would say, is the Twitter files.

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.800
So there was an article called the Twitter files,

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.560
which is about these files that were released

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.480
once Elon took control of Twitter

02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:36.560
and he released internal documents.

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:41.560
And what happened was somebody nominated it for deletion,

02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:44.440
but even the nomination said,

02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:47.320
this is actually, this is mainly about

02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.480
the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.

02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:52.080
Shouldn't this information be there instead?

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:55.040
So anyone can, like it takes exactly one human being

02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.840
anywhere on the planet to propose something for deletion.

02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:00.240
And that triggers a process where people discuss it,

02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.920
which within a few hours,

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.880
it was what we call snowball closed,

02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:06.160
i.e. this doesn't have a snowball's chance

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.280
in hell of passing.

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:11.240
So an admin goes, yeah, wrong,

02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:12.920
and closed the debate and that was it.

02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:15.640
That was the whole thing that happened.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.440
And so nobody proposed suppressing the information.

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:19.960
Nobody proposed it wasn't important.

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.000
It was just like editorially boring internal question.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.720
And so sometimes people read stuff like that

02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.240
and they're like, oh, you see, look at these leftists.

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:31.160
They're trying to suppress the truth again.

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.080
It's like, well, slow down a second and come and look.

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:34.960
Like literally it's not what happened.

02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.680
Yeah, so I think the right is more sensitive to censorship.

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.360
And so they will more likely highlight,

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.760
there's more virality to highlighting something

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.160
that looks like censorship in any walks of life.

02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.680
And this moving a paragraph from one place to another

02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:57.520
or removing it and so on as part of the regular grappling

02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:00.680
of Wikipedia can make a hell of a good article

02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:01.520
or a good video.

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:04.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it sounds really enticing

02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:07.440
and intriguing and surprising to most people

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:10.080
because they're like, I'm reading Wikipedia.

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:12.560
It doesn't seem like a crackpot leftist website.

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:17.560
It seems pretty kind of dull really in its own geeky way.

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:18.680
So that makes a good story.

02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:20.240
It's like, oh, am I being misled

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.760
because there's a shadowy cabal of Jimmy Wales.

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.880
You know, I generally, I read political stuff.

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:29.840
I mentioned to you that I'm traveling

02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.760
to have some very difficult conversation

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:36.560
with high profile figures, both in the war in Ukraine

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.000
and in Israel and Palestine.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.080
And, you know, I read the Wikipedia articles around that

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:46.400
and I also read books on the conflict

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.480
and the history of the different regions.

02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.680
And I find the Wikipedia articles to be very balanced

02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:53.960
and there's many perspectives being represented.

02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:56.320
But then I ask myself, well, am I one of them

02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:58.400
leftist crackpots?

02:20:58.400 --> 02:20:59.640
They can't see the truth.

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:02.080
I mean, it's something I ask myself all the time.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.960
Forget the leftists, just crackpot.

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:08.960
Am I just being a sheep and accepting it?

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.720
I think that's an important question to always ask,

02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:12.120
but not too much.

02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:13.480
Yeah, no, I agree completely.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.080
A little bit, but not too much.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:17.400
No, I think we always have to challenge ourselves

02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:20.640
of like, what do I potentially have wrong?

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:23.000
Well, you mentioned pressure from government.

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:29.280
You've criticized Twitter for the allowing,

02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:33.120
giving in to Turkey's government censorship.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:36.320
There's also conspiracy theories or accusations

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.040
of Wikipedia being open to pressure

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:44.160
from government to government organizations, FBI,

02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:45.560
and all this kind of stuff.

02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.640
What is the philosophy about pressure

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:50.320
from government and censorship?

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.920
So we're super hardcore on this.

02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:56.080
We've never bowed down to government pressure

02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:58.080
anywhere in the world and we never will.

02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:02.080
And we understand that we're hardcore.

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.680
And actually there is a bit of nuance

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:06.800
about how different companies respond to this,

02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:10.320
but our response has always been just to say no.

02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:13.000
And if they threaten to block, well, knock yourself out.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.440
You're gonna lose Wikipedia.

02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:17.160
And that's been very successful for us as a strategy

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:22.120
because governments know they can't just casually threaten

02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:24.280
to block Wikipedia or block us for two days

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.600
and we're gonna cave in immediately

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:27.680
to get back into the market.

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:29.440
And that's what a lot of companies have done.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:31.400
And I don't think that's good.

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:34.280
That we can go one level deeper and say,

02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:35.480
I'm actually quite sympathetic.

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:39.320
Like if you have staff members in a certain country

02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.320
and they are at physical risk,

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.160
you've got to put that into your equation.

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:44.200
So I understand that.

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:47.760
If Elon said, actually I've got a hundred staff members

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:50.200
on the ground in such and such a country.

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:53.440
And if we don't comply, somebody's gonna get arrested

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:54.880
and it could be quite serious.

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:57.120
Okay, that's a tough one, right?

02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:58.920
That's actually really hard.

02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:01.760
But yeah, no.

02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:05.280
And then the FBI one, no, no.

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:07.640
The criticism I saw, I kind of prepared for this

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:10.240
because I saw people responding to your request

02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:12.920
for questions and I was like, somebody's like,

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.600
oh, well, don't you think it was really bad

02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:15.920
that you da, da, da, da, da?

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.720
And I actually reached out to staffs

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.240
and can you just make sure I've got my facts right?

02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:25.240
And the answer is we received zero requests of any kind

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:28.400
from the FBI or any of the other government agencies

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:31.280
for any changes to content in Wikipedia.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:33.320
And had we received those requests

02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:35.040
at the level of the Wikimedia Foundation,

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.320
we would have said, it's not our,

02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:38.360
like we can't do anything

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.800
because Wikipedia is written by the community.

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.840
And so the Wikimedia Foundation

02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:45.520
can't change the content of Wikipedia without causing,

02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.400
I mean, God, that would be a massive controversy

02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:48.560
you can't even imagine.

02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:51.720
What we did do, and this is what I've done,

02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:56.440
I've been to China and met with the Minister of Propaganda.

02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:00.000
We've had discussions with governments all around the world,

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.480
not because we wanna do their bidding,

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:04.040
but because we don't wanna do their bidding,

02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:05.400
but we also don't wanna be blocked.

02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:07.400
And we think actually having these conversations

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:08.240
are really important.

02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:10.240
Now there's no threat of being blocked in the US.

02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:11.320
That's just never gonna happen.

02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:12.800
There is the First Amendment.

02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.160
But in other countries around the world,

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.720
it's like, okay, what are you upset about?

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.280
Let's have the conversation.

02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:21.320
Let's understand and let's have a dialogue about it

02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:24.080
so that you can understand where we come from

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:26.360
and what we're doing and why.

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.520
And then sometimes it's like, gee,

02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.240
if somebody complains that something's bad in Wikipedia,

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:36.760
whoever they are, don't care who they are,

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:39.640
could be you, could be the government,

02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:41.840
could be the Pope, I don't care who they are.

02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:43.440
It's like, oh, okay, well, our responsibility

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:46.240
as Wikipedia is to go, oh, hold on, let's check.

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.120
Is that right or wrong?

02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:49.440
Is there something that we've got wrong in Wikipedia?

02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:50.920
Not because you're threatening to block us,

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:53.760
but because we want Wikipedia to be correct.

02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.920
So we do have these dialogues with people.

02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.920
And a big part of what was going on with,

02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:06.280
you might call it pressure on social media companies

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.200
or dialogue with, depending on,

02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:10.360
as we talked earlier, grapple with the language,

02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:11.920
depending on what your view is.

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:17.200
In our case, it was really just about, oh, okay, right,

02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.040
they wanna have a dialogue about COVID information,

02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:22.720
misinformation.

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:25.400
We are this enormous source of information

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:27.600
which the world depends on.

02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:29.440
We're gonna have that conversation, right?

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:33.520
We're happy to say, if they say, how do you know

02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:36.360
that Wikipedia is not gonna be pushing

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.760
some crazy anti-vax narrative?

02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:42.320
First, I mean, I think it's somewhat inappropriate

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:45.360
for a government to be asking pointed questions

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:48.360
in a way that implies possible penalties.

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.200
I'm not sure that ever happened because we would just go,

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:52.640
I don't know, the Chinese blocked us,

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.440
and so it goes, right?

02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.680
We're not gonna cave into any kind of government pressure,

02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:03.480
but whatever the appropriateness of what they were doing,

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:05.000
I think there is a role for government

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.040
in just saying, let's understand the information ecosystem,

02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.400
let's think about the problem of misinformation,

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:13.240
disinformation in society,

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.560
particularly around election security,

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:17.920
all these kinds of things.

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.720
So, I think it would be irresponsible of us

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:25.560
to get a call from a government agency and say,

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:26.920
yeah, why don't you just fuck off?

02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:28.800
You're the government.

02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:30.360
But it would also be irresponsible to go,

02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:32.560
oh dear, government agents not happy,

02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.600
let's fix Wikipedia so the FBI loves us.

02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:37.720
When you say you wanna have discussions

02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:40.560
with the Chinese government or with organizations

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:44.080
like CDC and WHO, it's to thoroughly understand

02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.040
what the mainstream narrative is

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:48.120
so that it can be properly represented

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.800
but not drive what the articles are.

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.280
Well, it's actually important to say,

02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:57.080
whatever the Wikimedia Foundation thinks

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.080
has no impact on what's in Wikipedia.

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:03.400
So, it's more about saying to them,

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.440
right, we understand you're the World Health Organization

02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:08.680
or you're whoever and part of your job

02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:13.160
is just sort of public health is about communications.

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:14.640
You wanna understand the world.

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:16.160
So, it's more about, oh, well,

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.000
let's explain how Wikipedia works.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.880
So, it's more about explaining how Wikipedia works

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:22.360
and like, hey, it's the volunteers.

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:23.560
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:28.560
It's a battle of ideas and here's how the sources are used.

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:30.360
Yeah, exactly.

02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.200
What are the legitimate sources

02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:32.520
and what are not the legitimate sources.

02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:33.360
Yeah, exactly.

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:35.000
I mean, I suppose there's some battle

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.920
about what is a legitimate source.

02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:39.680
There could be statements made that CDC,

02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.680
I mean, like there's government organizations

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.640
in general have sold themselves to be the place

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:50.840
where you go for expertise.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.160
And some of that has been to a small degree

02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:57.640
raised in question over the response to the pandemic.

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:00.400
Well, I think in many cases,

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:03.920
and this goes back to my topic of trust.

02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:06.800
So, there were definitely cases

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:11.120
of public officials, public organizations

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:14.400
where I felt like they lost the trust of the public

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.920
because they didn't trust the public.

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:19.960
And so, the idea is like, we really need people

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:21.920
to take this seriously and take actions.

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.600
Therefore, we're gonna put out some overblown claims

02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.400
because it's gonna scare people into behaving correctly.

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.600
You know what, that might work for a little while,

02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.120
but it doesn't work in the long run

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:37.080
because suddenly people go from a default stance

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.440
of like the Center for Disease Control,

02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:43.480
very well respected scientific organization,

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:47.240
sort of, I don't know, they've got fault in Atlanta

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.680
with the last file of smallpox or whatever it is

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.280
that people think about them.

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.600
And to go, oh, right, these are scientists

02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:55.520
we should actually take seriously and listen to

02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:00.000
and they're not politicized and it's like, okay.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.240
And if you put out statements,

02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:02.360
and I don't know if the CDC did,

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:04.680
but a health organization, whoever,

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:08.800
that are provably false and also provably,

02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:09.920
you kind of knew they were false

02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:11.120
but you did it to scare people

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.280
because you wanted them to do the right thing.

02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:14.640
It's like, no, you know what,

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.320
that's not gonna work in the long run.

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:17.560
Like you're gonna lose people

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.400
and now you've got a bigger problem

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:21.320
which is a lack of trust in science,

02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:24.640
a lack of trust in authorities who are,

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:27.360
by and large, they're like quite boring

02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:28.880
government bureaucrat scientists

02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:31.240
who just are trying to help the world.

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:36.240
Well, I've been criticized and I've been torn on this.

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:39.920
I've been criticized for criticizing Anthony Fauci too hard.

02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:42.560
The degree to which I criticized him

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.760
is because he's a leader

02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:48.720
and I'm just observing the effect

02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:53.080
in the loss of trust in the institutions like the NIH

02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:54.240
that where I personally know

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:57.440
there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work

02:29:57.440 --> 02:29:58.800
and I have to blame the leaders

02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:00.480
for the effects on the distrust

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:02.960
and the scientific work that they're doing

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:07.960
because of what I perceive as basic human flaws

02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:11.440
of communication, of arrogance, of ego,

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.280
of politics, all those kinds of things.

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:16.160
Now you could say you're being too harsh, possible,

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.440
but I think that's the whole point of free speech

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:22.440
is you can criticize the people who lead.

02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:24.200
Leaders, unfortunately, or fortunately,

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.280
are responsible for the effects on society.

02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:31.880
To me, Anthony Fauci, or whoever in the scientific position

02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:36.880
or on the pandemic, had an opportunity to have a FDR moment

02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.280
or to get everybody together,

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:42.240
inspire about the power of science

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:45.120
to rapidly develop a vaccine that saves us

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:47.000
from this pandemic and future pandemic

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.920
that can threaten the wellbeing of human civilization.

02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:53.040
This was epic and awesome and sexy.

02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:56.040
And to me, when I talk to people about science,

02:30:56.040 --> 02:30:58.720
it's anything but sexy in terms of the virology

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:02.480
and biology development because it's been politicized,

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.920
it's icky, and people just don't want to,

02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:06.600
don't talk to me about the vaccine.

02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:07.760
I understand, I understand.

02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.440
I got vaccinated, let's just switch topics, quick.

02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:13.280
Yeah.

02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:14.960
Well, it's interesting because as I said,

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:17.320
I live in the UK and I think it's,

02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:20.080
all these things are a little less politicized there.

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:24.920
And I haven't paid close enough attention to Fauci

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:27.160
to have a really strong view.

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:29.040
I'm sure I would disagree with some things.

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:33.120
I definitely, you know, I remember hearing

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.280
at the beginning of the pandemic

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:36.160
as I'm unwrapping my Amazon package

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:38.320
with the masks I bought,

02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:39.520
because I heard there's a pandemic

02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:42.760
and I just was like, I want some N95 mask, please.

02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:45.960
And they were saying, don't buy masks.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.440
And the motivation was,

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:48.720
because they didn't want there to be shortages

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:50.760
in hospitals, fine.

02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:53.840
But they were also statements of masks won't,

02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:55.200
they're not effective and they won't help you.

02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:58.240
And then the complete about face to,

02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:00.480
you're ridiculous if you're not wearing them.

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:01.720
You know, it's just like, no,

02:32:01.720 --> 02:32:06.240
like that about face just lost people from day one.

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.200
The distrust and the intelligence of the public

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:11.520
to deal with nuance, to deal with the uncertainty.

02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:13.640
Yeah, this is exactly what, you know,

02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:17.600
I think this is where the Wikipedia neutral point of view

02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:20.560
is and should be an ideal.

02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:22.920
And obviously every article and everything we could,

02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:25.480
you know me now and you know how I am about these things.

02:32:25.480 --> 02:32:27.920
But like, ideally is to say, look,

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:29.800
we're happy to show you all the perspectives.

02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.000
This is Planned Parenthood's view

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.880
and this is Catholic Church view.

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:35.040
And we're gonna explain that

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:36.240
and we're gonna try to be thoughtful

02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:40.840
and put in the best arguments from all sides.

02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:43.400
Cause I trust you, like you read that

02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:44.920
and you're gonna be more educated

02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:46.600
and you're gonna begin to make a decision.

02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:50.000
I mean, I can just talk in the UK,

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.720
the government, when we found out in the UK

02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:56.480
that very high level government officials

02:32:56.480 --> 02:33:00.200
were not following the rules they had put on everyone else.

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:03.200
I moved from, I had just become a UK citizen

02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.400
just a little while before the pandemic.

02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:06.920
And you know, it's kind of emotional.

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:08.440
Like you get a passport in a new country

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.320
and you feel quite good.

02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:10.960
And I did my oath to the queen

02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:13.160
and then they dragged the poor old lady out

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:14.760
and they tried to tell us all to be good.

02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:15.800
And I was like, we're British

02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:17.120
and we're gonna do the right things.

02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:19.000
And you know, it's gonna be tough,

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.160
but we're gonna, you know.

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.600
So you have that kind of Dunkirk spirit moment

02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:25.880
and you're like following the rules to a T.

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:26.880
And then suddenly it's like,

02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:28.680
well, they're not following the rules.

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:31.800
And so suddenly I shifted personally from,

02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:32.720
I'm gonna follow the rules,

02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:35.320
even if I don't completely agree with them,

02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:36.160
but I'll still follow

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.280
cause I think we've got all chip in together to like,

02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:39.120
you know what?

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:40.880
I'm gonna make wise and thoughtful decisions

02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:42.960
for myself and my family.

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:45.120
And that generally is gonna mean following the rules,

02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:48.480
but it's basically, you know, when they're,

02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:50.360
you know, at certain moments in time,

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:52.600
like you're not allowed to be in an outside space

02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.400
unless you're exercising.

02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:58.240
I'm like, I think I can sit in a park and read a book.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:33:59.600
Like it's gonna be fine.

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:01.280
Like that's irrational rule,

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:03.640
which I would have been following just personally

02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:05.720
of like, I'm just gonna do the right thing.

02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:06.560
Yeah.

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.080
And the loss of trust, I think at scale

02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:10.760
was probably harmful to science.

02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:13.680
And to me, the scientific method

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.440
and the scientific communities is one of the biggest hopes,

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:20.400
at least to me for the survival

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.560
and the thriving of human civilization.

02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.400
Absolutely.

02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:25.880
And I, you know, I think you see

02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:28.160
some of the ramifications of this.

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:31.640
There's always been like pretty anti-science,

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.520
anti-vax people.

02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:34.560
Okay, that's always been a thing,

02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:36.160
but I feel like it's bigger now

02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:41.120
simply because of that lowering of trust.

02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:43.880
So a lot of people, yeah, maybe it's like you say,

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.680
a lot of people are like, yeah, I got vaccinated

02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:46.960
and I really don't wanna talk about this

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:49.320
because it's so toxic, you know?

02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:50.520
And that's unfortunate

02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:53.880
because I think people should say, what an amazing thing.

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.880
And, you know, there's also a whole range of discourse

02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:03.880
around if this were a disease that were primarily,

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:07.560
that was primarily killing babies.

02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:09.080
I think people's emotions about it

02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:11.920
would have been very different, right or wrong.

02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:15.840
Then the fact that when you really looked at the sort of

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:19.480
death rate of getting COVID,

02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:21.720
wow, it's really dramatically different.

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:26.720
If you're late in life, this was really dangerous.

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:31.360
And if you're 23 years old, yeah, well, it's not great.

02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:33.320
Like, and long COVID is a thing and all of that,

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:36.920
and I think some of the public communications,

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.320
again, we're failing to properly contextualize it.

02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:43.800
Not all of it, you know, it's a complicated matter,

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:45.480
but yeah.

02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:48.960
Let me read your Reddit comment that received two likes.

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:52.360
Two whole people liked it.

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:53.640
Yeah, two people liked it.

02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:57.360
And I don't know, maybe you can comment on

02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:58.320
whether there's truth to it,

02:35:58.320 --> 02:35:59.760
but I just found it interesting

02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:01.040
because I've been doing a lot of research

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:02.480
on World War II recently.

02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:04.200
So this is about Hitler.

02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:05.400
Oh, okay.

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:07.480
It's a long statement.

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:09.440
I was there when a big push was made

02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:11.320
to fight bias at Wikipedia.

02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:13.600
Our target became getting the Hitler article

02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.720
to be Wiki's featured article.

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:18.480
The idea was that the voting body only wanted articles

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:20.760
that were good PR and especially articles

02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.040
about socially liberal topics.

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:26.960
So the Hitler article had to be two to three times better

02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:29.720
and more academically researched to beat the competition.

02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:31.480
This bias seems to hold today.

02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:34.560
For example, the current list of political featured articles

02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:37.200
at a glance seems to have only two books,

02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:40.680
one on anarchism and one on Karl Marx.

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.280
Surely we're not going to say

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.120
there have only ever been two articles

02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:48.760
about political non-biography books worth being featured,

02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:51.760
especially compared to 200 plus video games.

02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.960
That's the only topics with good books

02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:56.520
are socialism and anarchy.

02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:59.880
Do you have any interesting comments on this kind of

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:02.920
featured, how the featured are selected,

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.920
maybe Hitler because he's a special figure, you know.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.280
I love that.

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:10.120
I love that.

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:13.120
No, I love the comparison to how many video games

02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:15.920
have been, and that definitely speaks to my earlier

02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.840
as like, if you've got a lot of young geeky men

02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:21.720
who really like video games,

02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:24.760
that doesn't necessarily get you to the right place

02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:25.840
in every respect.

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.240
Certainly, yeah.

02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:33.280
So here's a funny story.

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:37.320
I woke up one morning to a bunch of journalists

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:39.720
in Germany trying to get in touch with me

02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:42.200
because German language Wikipedia chose to have

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:46.520
as the featured article of the day Swastika,

02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:48.440
and people were going crazy about it.

02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:51.920
And some people were saying, it's illegal.

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:53.840
Has German Wikipedia been taken over

02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:56.720
by Nazi sympathizers and so on?

02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:58.840
And it turned out it's not illegal.

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:02.760
Like discussing the Swastika, using the Swastika

02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:06.120
as a political campaign and using it in certain ways

02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:08.120
is illegal in Germany in a way that it wouldn't be

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:10.560
in the US because of first amendment.

02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:13.000
But in this case, it was like, actually,

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.080
part of the point is the Swastika symbol

02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:17.120
is from other cultures as well,

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.920
and they just thought it was interesting.

02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:20.840
And I did joke to the committee, I'm like,

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:23.240
please don't put the Swastika on the front page

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:25.400
without warning me because I'm going to get a lock on.

02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.080
Now it wouldn't be me, it's the foundation.

02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:29.560
I'm not that much on the front lines.

02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:32.080
And so I would say that to put Hitler

02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:35.240
on the front page of Wikipedia, it is a special topic

02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.000
and you would want to say, yeah, let's be really careful

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.320
that it's really, really good before we do that

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:43.280
because if we put it on the front page and it's got,

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.720
and it's not good enough, that could be a problem.

02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:46.880
There's no inherent reason.

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.880
Like clearly World War II is a very popular topic

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.120
in Wikipedia.

02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.040
It's like, turn on the history channel.

02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:58.360
Like people, it's a fascinating period of history

02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:00.400
that people are very interested in.

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.400
And then on the other piece, like anarchism and Karl Marx?

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:06.840
Karl Marx, yeah.

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:08.320
Oh yeah, I mean, that's interesting.

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.640
I'm surprised to hear that not more political books

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:15.120
or topics have made it to the front page.

02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:16.840
Now we're taking this Reddit comment.

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:19.400
I mean, as if it's completely, as if it's like,

02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:20.280
yeah, but I'm trusting.

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:21.640
So I think that's probably is right.

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:23.320
They probably did have the list up.

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.200
No, I think it's, I think that piece,

02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:28.080
the piece about how many of those featured articles

02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:31.600
have been video games and if it's disproportionate,

02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:33.680
I think we should, the community should go,

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:37.080
actually what's gone, like that doesn't seem quite right.

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:41.280
You know, I mean, you can imagine

02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:45.800
that because you're looking for an article

02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:47.900
to be on the front page of Wikipedia,

02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:51.660
you wanna have a bit of diversity in it.

02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:54.660
You want it to be not always something

02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:56.140
that's really popular that week.

02:39:56.140 --> 02:39:57.820
So like, I don't know, the last couple of weeks,

02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:00.060
maybe succession, a big finale of succession

02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:01.980
might lead you to think, oh, let's put succession

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:04.020
on the front page, that's gonna be popular.

02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:06.340
In other cases, you kind of want,

02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:08.420
pick something super obscure and quirky

02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:11.180
because people also find that interesting and fun.

02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:12.700
So yeah, don't know, but you don't want it

02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:15.380
to be video games most of the time.

02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:16.580
That sounds quite bad.

02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:20.540
Well, let me ask you just for,

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:25.460
as somebody who's seen the whole thing,

02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:28.340
the development of the millions of articles,

02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:33.500
big impossible question, what's your favorite article?

02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:34.940
My favorite article.

02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:38.080
Well, I've got an amusing answer,

02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:40.980
which is possibly also true.

02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:44.460
There's an article in Wikipedia

02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:47.260
called inherently funny words.

02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:49.380
And one of the reasons I love it is

02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:54.340
when it was created early in the history of Wikipedia,

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:56.180
it kind of became like a dumping ground.

02:40:56.180 --> 02:40:57.940
People would just come by and write in any word

02:40:57.940 --> 02:40:59.980
that they thought sounded funny.

02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:01.700
And then it was nominated for deletion

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:03.740
because somebody's like, this is just a dumping ground,

02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:06.340
like people are putting all kinds of nonsense in.

02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:08.620
And in that deletion debate, somebody came forward

02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:11.300
and said, essentially, wait a second, hold on,

02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:14.060
this is actually a legitimate concept

02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:16.060
in the theory of humor and comedy.

02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:17.420
And a lot of famous comedians

02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:19.780
and humorists have written about it.

02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:23.660
And it's actually a legitimate topic.

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:26.340
So then they went through and they meticulously referenced

02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:27.580
every word that was in there

02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:29.500
and threw out a bunch that weren't.

02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:31.020
And so it becomes this really interesting.

02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.780
Now, my biggest disappointment,

02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:35.420
and it's the right decision to make

02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:38.180
because there was no source,

02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:41.980
but it was a picture of a cow,

02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:47.300
but there was a rope around its head

02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:50.220
tying on some horns onto the cow.

02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:52.820
So it was kind of a funny looking picture.

02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:55.540
It looked like a bull with horns,

02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:58.740
but it's just like a normal milk cow.

02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:00.620
And below it, the caption said,

02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:04.380
according to some cow is an inherently funny word,

02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:05.900
which is just hilarious to me,

02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:07.540
partly because the according to some

02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:10.100
sounds a lot like Wikipedia, but there was no source.

02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:12.660
So it went away and I feel very sad about that,

02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:14.660
but I've always liked that.

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:16.900
And I actually, the reason Depths of Wikipedia

02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:21.500
amuses me so greatly is because it does highlight

02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:24.260
really interesting, obscure stuff.

02:42:24.260 --> 02:42:27.060
And you're like, wow, I can't believe somebody wrote

02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:29.580
about that in Wikipedia, it's quite amusing.

02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:32.300
And sometimes there's a bit of wry humor in Wikipedia.

02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:33.700
There's always a struggle.

02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.460
You're not trying to be funny,

02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:38.740
but occasionally a little inside humor

02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:40.620
can be quite healthy and fun.

02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:43.900
Apparently words with the letter K are funny.

02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:46.740
There's a lot of really well researched stuff on this page.

02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:49.540
That's actually exciting.

02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:51.740
And I should mention for Depths of Wikipedia,

02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:56.620
it's run by Annie Rowerda.

02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:57.620
That's right, Annie.

02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:01.460
And let me just read off some of the pages.

02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:06.660
Octopolis and Octolantis are two separate

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:08.220
non-human underwater settlements

02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:12.340
built by the gloomy octopuses in Jervis Bay, East Australia.

02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:15.820
The first settlement named Octopolis by biologists

02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.700
was founded in 2009.

02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:19.380
The individual structures in Octopolis

02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:23.260
consist of burrows around a piece of human detritus

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:25.260
believed to be scrap metal.

02:43:25.260 --> 02:43:26.740
And it goes on in this way.

02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:30.140
That's great.

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:33.660
Satiric misspelling, least concerned species,

02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:35.820
humans were formally assessed as a species

02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:40.900
of least concern in 2008.

02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:43.460
I think Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:45.700
would slightly disagree.

02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:47.700
And last one, let me just say friendship paradox

02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:50.420
is the phenomena first observed

02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:53.140
by the sociologist Scott Feld in 1991

02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:55.500
that on average an individual's friends

02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:58.100
have more friends than that individual.

02:43:58.100 --> 02:43:59.940
Oh, that's really interesting.

02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:03.100
That's the kind of thing that makes you want to,

02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:04.820
like it sounds implausible at first

02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:06.980
because shouldn't everybody have on average

02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:09.340
about the same number of friends as all their friends?

02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:11.300
So you really want to dig into the math of that

02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:13.620
and really think, oh, why would that be true?

02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:17.180
And it's one way to feel more lonely

02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:19.940
in a mathematically rigorous way.

02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:22.540
Somebody also on Reddit asks,

02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:25.500
I would love to hear some war stories from behind the scenes.

02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:26.940
Is there something that we haven't mentioned

02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:28.180
that was particularly difficult

02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:32.140
in this entire journey you're on with Wikipedia?

02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:33.980
I mean, it's hard to say.

02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:38.140
I mean, so part of what I always say about myself

02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:41.100
is that I'm a pathological optimist.

02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:42.980
So I always think everything is fine.

02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:46.580
And so things that other people might find a struggle,

02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:48.540
I'm just like, oh, well, this is the thing we're doing today.

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:50.100
So that's kind of about me.

02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:52.740
And it's actually, I'm aware of this about myself.

02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:55.540
So I do like to have a few pessimistic people around me

02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:57.780
to keep me a bit on balance.

02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:01.940
Yeah, I mean, I would say some of the hard things,

02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:03.380
I mean, there were hard moments

02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:06.260
like when two out of three servers crashed on Christmas day

02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:09.420
and then we needed to do a fundraiser

02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:12.100
and no idea what was gonna happen.

02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:18.140
I would say as well, like in that early period of time,

02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:22.300
the growth of the website

02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:24.820
and the traffic to the website was phenomenal and great.

02:45:24.820 --> 02:45:26.100
The growth of the community,

02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:28.940
and in fact, the healthy growth of the community was fine.

02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:31.260
And then the Wikimedia Foundation,

02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:34.100
the nonprofit I set up to own and operate Wikipedia

02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:37.580
as a small organization, it had a lot of growing pains.

02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:43.780
And that was the piece that's just like many companies

02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:46.500
or many organizations that are in a fast growth.

02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:48.940
It's like, you've hired the wrong people

02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:50.580
or there's this conflict that's arisen

02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:53.500
and nobody's got experience to do this and all that.

02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.620
So no specific stories to tell,

02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:58.780
but I would say growing the organization was harder

02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:01.380
than growing the community and growing the website,

02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:02.780
which is interesting.

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:05.420
Well, yeah, it's kind of miraculous and inspiring

02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:08.700
that a community can emerge and be stable

02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:13.700
and that has so much kind of productive positive output.

02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:16.420
It kind of makes you think.

02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:17.860
I mean, it's one of those things

02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:19.620
you don't want to analyze too much

02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:23.820
because you don't want to mess with a beautiful thing,

02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:25.620
but it gives me faith in communities

02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:28.900
that they can spring up in other domains as well.

02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:30.340
Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:34.940
And at Fandom, my for-profit Wiki company,

02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:38.620
where it's like all these communities about pop culture,

02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:43.140
mainly sort of entertainment, gaming, and so on,

02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:46.260
there's a lot of small communities.

02:46:46.260 --> 02:46:50.260
And so I went last year to our Community Connect Conference

02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:52.580
and just met some of these people and like,

02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:55.620
here's one of the leaders of the Star Wars Wiki,

02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:58.380
which is called Wookiepedia, which I think is great.

02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:01.460
And he's telling me about his community and all that.

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:03.820
And I'm like, oh, right, yeah, I love this.

02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:07.500
So it's not the same purpose as Wikipedia

02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:11.060
of a neutral, high quality encyclopedia,

02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:13.340
but a lot of the same values are there of like,

02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:15.580
oh, people should be nice to each other.

02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:17.620
It's like, when people get upset, it's like,

02:47:17.620 --> 02:47:19.660
just remember, we're working on Star Wars Wiki together.

02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:22.220
Like, there's no reason to get too outraged

02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:26.100
and just kind people, just like geeky people with a hobby.

02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:31.060
Where do you see Wookiepedia in 10 years,

02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:34.020
100 years, and 1,000 years?

02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:37.620
Right, so 10 years.

02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:41.700
I would say pretty much the same.

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:46.020
Like, we're not gonna have, we're not gonna become TikTok,

02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:50.100
with entertainment, scroll by video,

02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:54.340
humor, and blah, blah, blah, an encyclopedia.

02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:56.980
I think in 10 years, we probably will have

02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:02.180
a lot more AI supporting tools, like I've talked about.

02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:04.940
And probably your search experience would be,

02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:06.780
you can ask a question and get the answer

02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:09.460
rather than from our body of work.

02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:12.420
So search and discovery, a little bit improved interface,

02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:14.060
some of that. Yeah, all that.

02:48:14.060 --> 02:48:16.060
I always say one of the things that people,

02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:18.020
most people won't notice,

02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:20.820
because already they don't notice it,

02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:23.220
is the growth of Wikipedia

02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:25.540
in the languages of the developing world.

02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:29.340
So you probably don't speak Swahili,

02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:30.980
so you're probably not checking out

02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.180
that Swahili Wikipedia is doing very well.

02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:36.220
And it is doing very well.

02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:37.420
And I think that kind of growth

02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:40.460
is actually super important, it's super interesting.

02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:41.820
But most people won't notice that.

02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:44.020
If we can just look on that, if we could,

02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:47.860
do you think there's so much incredible translation work

02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:50.220
is being done with AI, with language models?

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:55.220
Do you think that can accelerate Wikipedia

02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:56.780
so you start with the basic draft

02:48:56.780 --> 02:48:59.540
of the translation of articles and then build on that?

02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:03.860
So what I used to say is,

02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:05.780
like machine translation for many years

02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:07.380
wasn't much use to the community

02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.020
because it just wasn't good enough.

02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:13.300
As it's gotten better, it's tended to be a lot better

02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:17.100
in what we might call economically important languages.

02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:19.060
That's because the corpus that they train on

02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:20.100
and all of that.

02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:24.020
So to translate from English to Spanish,

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.260
if you've tried Google Translate recently,

02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:28.380
Spanish to English is what I would do.

02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:30.300
It's pretty good, like it's actually not bad.

02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:32.220
It used to be half a joke and then for a while

02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:33.980
it was kind of like, well, you can get the gist of something.

02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:36.460
And now it's like, actually it's pretty good.

02:49:36.460 --> 02:49:38.300
However, we've got a huge Spanish community

02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:40.060
who write in native Spanish.

02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:42.340
So they're able to use it and they find it useful,

02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:43.980
but they're writing.

02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:47.340
But if you tried to do English to Zulu

02:49:48.740 --> 02:49:50.700
where there's not that much investment,

02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:53.100
like there's loads of reasons to invest in English to Spanish

02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:55.860
because they're both huge economically important languages,

02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:56.700
Zulu not so much.

02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:00.220
So for those smaller languages, it was just still terrible.

02:50:00.220 --> 02:50:03.380
My understanding is it's improved dramatically

02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:05.900
and also because the new methods of training

02:50:05.900 --> 02:50:10.900
don't necessarily involve identical corpuses

02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:13.260
to try to match things up,

02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:16.820
but rather reading and understanding with tokens

02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:18.420
and large language models

02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:19.660
and then reading and understanding

02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:22.100
and then you get a much richer.

02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:23.500
Anyway, apparently it's quite improved.

02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:26.780
So I think that now it is quite possible

02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:29.660
that these smaller language communities are gonna say,

02:50:29.660 --> 02:50:32.900
oh, well, finally I can put something in English

02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:36.540
and I can get out Zulu that I feel comfortable sharing

02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:38.900
with my community because it's actually good enough

02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:40.700
or I can edit it a bit here and there.

02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:41.780
So I think that's huge.

02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:43.300
So I do think that's gonna happen a lot

02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:44.700
and that's gonna accelerate,

02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:47.180
again, what will remain to most people in an invisible trend,

02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:50.100
but that's the growth in all these other languages.

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:52.620
So then move on to a hundred years.

02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.900
I was starting to get scary.

02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:58.380
Well, the only thing I say about a hundred years is like,

02:50:58.380 --> 02:51:02.900
we've built the Wikimedia Foundation

02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:06.660
and we run it in a quite cautious

02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:10.100
and financially conservative and careful way.

02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:12.940
So every year we build our reserves,

02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:15.460
every year we put aside a little bit of more money.

02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:17.220
We also have the endowment fund,

02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:18.940
which we just passed a hundred million.

02:51:18.940 --> 02:51:22.660
That's a completely separate fund with a separate board

02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:24.820
so that it's not just like a big fat bank account

02:51:24.820 --> 02:51:27.540
for some future profligate CEO to blow through.

02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:30.660
The foundation will have to get the approval

02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:34.220
of a second order board to be able to access that money

02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:36.260
and that board can make other grants

02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:38.500
through the community and things like that.

02:51:38.500 --> 02:51:41.940
So the point of all that is I hope and believe

02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:46.860
that we're building in a financially stable way,

02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:49.580
that we can weather various storms along the way

02:51:49.580 --> 02:51:54.580
so that hopefully we're not taking the kind of risks.

02:51:54.700 --> 02:51:57.260
And by the way, we're not taking too few risks either.

02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:00.620
I think the Wikimedia Foundation

02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:02.660
and Wikimedia will exist in a hundred years.

02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:05.940
If anybody exists in a hundred years, we'll be there.

02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:07.980
You think the internet just looks

02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:10.940
unpredictably different than just the web?

02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:11.900
I do, I do.

02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:16.900
I mean, I think right now this sort of enormous step forward

02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:20.780
we've seen has become public in the last year

02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:25.780
of the large language models really is something else.

02:52:25.980 --> 02:52:26.820
It's really interesting.

02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:28.660
And you and I have both talked today

02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:30.860
about the flaws and the limitations,

02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:33.540
but still as someone who's been around technology

02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:36.420
for a long time, it's sort of that feeling

02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:38.780
of the first time I saw a web browser,

02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:40.740
the first time I saw the iPhone,

02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:41.900
like the first time the internet

02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:43.500
was like really usable on a phone.

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:47.020
And it's like, wow, that's a step change difference.

02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:48.700
And there's a few other, you know.

02:52:48.700 --> 02:52:50.100
Maybe a Google search.

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:51.860
Google search was actually the first search.

02:52:51.860 --> 02:52:54.260
Because I remember AltaVista was kind of cool for a while

02:52:54.260 --> 02:52:55.700
and then it just got more and more useless

02:52:55.700 --> 02:52:57.300
because the algorithm wasn't good.

02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:58.380
And it's like, oh, Google search.

02:52:58.380 --> 02:52:59.980
Now like the internet works again.

02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:04.020
And so large language model, it feels like that to me.

02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:06.460
Like, oh, wow, this is something new

02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:08.580
and like really pretty remarkable.

02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:09.620
And it's gonna have some downsides.

02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:14.340
Like, you know, the negative use case.

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.140
You know, people in the area who are experts,

02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:17.740
they're giving a lot of warnings

02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:19.820
and I don't know enough to, I'm not that worried,

02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:22.300
but I'm a pathological optimist.

02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:25.260
But I do see some like really low hanging fruit

02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:26.540
bad things that can happen.

02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:31.540
So my example is, how about some highly customized spam

02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:38.620
where the email that you receive isn't just like

02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:40.940
misspelled words and like trying to get through filters,

02:53:40.940 --> 02:53:42.900
but actually is a targeted email to you

02:53:42.900 --> 02:53:44.820
that knows something about you

02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:46.940
by reading your LinkedIn profile

02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:48.380
and writes a plausible email

02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:49.660
that will get through the filters.

02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:52.900
And it's like suddenly, oh, that's a new problem.

02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:55.060
That's gonna be interesting.

02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:58.460
Is there just on the Wikipedia editing side,

02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:00.340
does it make the job of the volunteer

02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:03.740
of the editor more difficult if in a world

02:54:03.740 --> 02:54:07.060
where larger and larger percentage of the internet

02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:08.540
is written by an LLM?

02:54:08.540 --> 02:54:11.900
So one of my predictions and we'll see, you know,

02:54:11.900 --> 02:54:14.540
ask me again in five years how this panned out

02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:19.300
is that in a way this will strengthen

02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:24.060
the value and importance of some traditional brands.

02:54:24.060 --> 02:54:29.060
So if I see a news story and it's from

02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:33.220
the Wall Street Journal, from the New York Times,

02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:36.660
from Fox News, I know what I'm getting

02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:40.020
and I trust it to whatever extent I might have,

02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:42.980
you know, trust or distrust on any of those.

02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:46.780
And if I see a brand new website that looks plausible,

02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:48.060
but I've never heard of it,

02:54:48.060 --> 02:54:50.380
and it could be machine generated content

02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:52.060
that may be full of errors,

02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:52.980
I think I'll be more cautious.

02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:54.220
I think I'm more interested.

02:54:54.220 --> 02:54:58.620
And we can also talk about this around photographic evidence.

02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:00.260
So obviously there will be scandals

02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:04.140
where major media organizations get fooled by fake photo.

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:07.820
However, if I see a photo of,

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:12.300
the recent was the Pope wearing an expensive puffer jacket,

02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:14.380
I'm gonna go, yeah, that's amazing

02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:16.420
that a fake like that could be generated,

02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:18.300
but my immediate thought is not,

02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:21.300
oh, so the Pope's dipping into the money, eh?

02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:23.100
Partly because this particular Pope

02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:25.180
doesn't seem like he'd be the type.

02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:27.700
My favorite is extensive pictures

02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:29.540
of Joe Biden and Donald Trump

02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:31.020
hanging out and having fun together.

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:33.180
Yeah, brilliant.

02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:37.900
So I think people will care about the provenance of a photo.

02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:40.380
And if you show me a photo and you say,

02:55:40.380 --> 02:55:45.380
yeah, this photo is from Fox News,

02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:47.820
even though I don't necessarily think that's the highest,

02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:50.060
but I'm like, wow, it's a news organization

02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:50.900
and they're gonna have journalists

02:55:50.900 --> 02:55:52.780
and they're gonna make sure the photo

02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:54.460
is what it purports to be.

02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:56.660
That's very different from a photo

02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:57.980
randomly circulating on Twitter.

02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:00.180
Whereas I would say 15 years ago,

02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:02.340
a photo randomly circulating on Twitter,

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:05.940
in most cases, the worst you could do,

02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:09.980
and this did happen, is misrepresent the battlefield.

02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:13.260
So like, oh, here's a bunch of injured children.

02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:14.300
Look what Israel's done,

02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:15.700
but actually it wasn't Israel,

02:56:15.700 --> 02:56:17.940
it was another case 10 years ago.

02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:20.980
That has happened, that has always been around.

02:56:20.980 --> 02:56:25.180
But now we can have much more specifically constructed,

02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:26.700
plausible looking photos,

02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:28.340
that if I just see them circulating on Twitter,

02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:30.940
I'm gonna go, just don't know, not sure.

02:56:30.940 --> 02:56:32.780
I can make that in five minutes.

02:56:32.780 --> 02:56:35.260
Well, I also hope that it's kind of like

02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:36.380
what you're writing about in your book,

02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:38.780
that we could also have citizen journalists

02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:43.780
that have a stable, verifiable trust that builds up.

02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:45.860
So it doesn't have to be New York Times,

02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:46.980
with this organization,

02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:48.940
it could be an organization of one,

02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:50.900
as long as it's stable and carries through time,

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:52.620
and it builds up or builds up.

02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:56.020
I agree, but the one thing I've said in the past,

02:56:56.020 --> 02:56:57.740
and this depends on who that person is

02:56:57.740 --> 02:56:58.580
and what they're doing,

02:56:58.580 --> 02:57:00.820
but it's like, I think my credibility,

02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:02.300
my general credibility in the world

02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:05.380
should be the equal of a New York Times reporter.

02:57:05.380 --> 02:57:08.660
So if something happens and I witness it

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.420
and I write about it, people are gonna go,

02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:12.340
well, Jimmy Wells said it,

02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:15.220
that's just like if a New York Times reporter said it,

02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:18.020
I'm gonna tend to think he didn't just make it up.

02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:20.300
Truth is, nothing interesting ever happens around me.

02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:21.660
I don't go to war zones,

02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:23.060
I don't go to big press conferences,

02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:27.980
I don't interview Putin and Zelensky, right?

02:57:27.980 --> 02:57:30.420
So just to an extent, yes,

02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:32.420
whereas I do think for other people,

02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:36.380
those traditional models of credibility

02:57:38.260 --> 02:57:39.340
are really, really important.

02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:42.100
And then there is this sort of citizen journalism.

02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:44.860
I don't know if you think of what you do as journalism,

02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:46.820
I kind of think it is, but you do interviews,

02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:48.940
you do long-form interviews.

02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:52.060
And I think people, like if you come and you say,

02:57:52.060 --> 02:57:55.180
here's my tape, but you wouldn't hand out a tape,

02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:56.140
like I just gestured to you

02:57:56.140 --> 02:57:57.620
as if I'm handing you a cassette tape,

02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:00.020
but if you put it into your podcast,

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:03.100
here's my interview with Zelensky,

02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:06.820
and people aren't gonna go, yeah, how do we know?

02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:08.340
That could be a deep fake.

02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:09.300
You could have faked that,

02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:10.140
because people are like,

02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:12.860
well, no, like you're a well-known podcaster,

02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:14.500
and you do interview interesting people,

02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:17.060
and yeah, like you wouldn't think that.

02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:19.020
So that your brand becomes really important,

02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:21.700
whereas if suddenly, and I've seen this already,

02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:26.660
I've seen sort of video with subtitles in English,

02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:29.580
and apparently the Ukrainian was the same,

02:58:29.580 --> 02:58:32.780
and it was Zelensky saying something really outrageous.

02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:34.140
And I'm like, yeah, I don't believe that.

02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:35.780
Like I don't think he said that

02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:38.780
in a meeting with, you know, whatever.

02:58:38.820 --> 02:58:42.300
I think that's Russian propaganda, or probably just trolls.

02:58:42.300 --> 02:58:44.580
Yeah, and then building platforms and mechanisms

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:46.900
of how that trust can be verified.

02:58:46.900 --> 02:58:48.740
You know, if something appears on a Wikipedia page,

02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:50.020
that means something.

02:58:50.020 --> 02:58:52.780
If something appears on, like say,

02:58:52.780 --> 02:58:54.380
my Twitter account, that means something.

02:58:54.380 --> 02:58:58.380
That means I, this particular human, have signed off on it,

02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:02.660
and then the trust you have in this particular human

02:59:02.660 --> 02:59:04.740
transfers to the piece of content,

02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:07.820
and then each, hopefully there's millions of people

02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:10.140
with different metrics of trust.

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:12.460
And then you could see that there's a certain kind of bias

02:59:12.460 --> 02:59:14.420
in the set of conversations you're having.

02:59:14.420 --> 02:59:17.020
So maybe, okay, I trust this person of this kind of bias,

02:59:17.020 --> 02:59:19.140
and I'll go to this other person of this other kind of bias

02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:21.140
that I can integrate them in this kind of way,

02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:23.460
just like you said with Fox News and whatever else.

02:59:23.460 --> 02:59:24.740
Yeah, and Wall Street Journal, New York Times,

02:59:24.740 --> 02:59:29.500
like they've all got their, like where they sit, yeah.

02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:34.500
So you have built, I would say one of,

02:59:34.780 --> 02:59:37.940
if not the most impactful website

02:59:37.940 --> 02:59:39.900
in the history of human civilization.

02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:44.260
So let me ask for you to give advice to young people

02:59:44.260 --> 02:59:46.100
how to have impact in this world.

02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:48.940
High schoolers, college students wanting to have

02:59:48.940 --> 02:59:50.020
a big positive impact in the world.

02:59:50.020 --> 02:59:51.220
Yeah, great.

02:59:51.220 --> 02:59:53.100
If you wanna be successful,

02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:54.980
do something you're really passionate about,

02:59:54.980 --> 02:59:56.980
rather than some kind of cold calculation

02:59:56.980 --> 02:59:58.700
of what can make you the most money.

02:59:58.700 --> 03:00:00.780
Because if you go and try to do something,

03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:02.060
and you're like, I'm not that interested,

03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:03.700
but I'm gonna make a lot of money doing it,

03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:05.540
you're probably not gonna be that good at it.

03:00:05.540 --> 03:00:07.740
And so that is a big piece of it.

03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:14.420
I also like, so for startups, I give this advice.

03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:17.300
So young, and this is a career startup,

03:00:17.300 --> 03:00:19.940
any kind of like young person just starting out,

03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:24.860
is like, be persistent, right?

03:00:24.860 --> 03:00:27.340
There'll be moments when it's not working out

03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:29.340
and you can't just give up too easily.

03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.100
You've gotta persist through some hard times,

03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:33.060
maybe two servers crash on a Sunday,

03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:35.300
and you've gotta sort of scramble to figure it out,

03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:36.540
but persist through that.

03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:41.180
And then also be prepared to pivot.

03:00:41.180 --> 03:00:43.100
That's a newer word, new for me.

03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:48.100
But when I pivoted from Newpedia to Wikipedia,

03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:51.180
it's like, this isn't working, I've gotta completely change.

03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:53.380
So be willing to completely change direction

03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:54.460
when something's not working.

03:00:54.460 --> 03:00:58.420
Now the problem with these two wonderful pieces of advice

03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:01.180
is which situation am I in today, right?

03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:03.580
Is this a moment when I need to just power through

03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:06.540
and persist because I'm gonna find a way to make this work?

03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:07.980
Or is this a moment where I need to go,

03:01:07.980 --> 03:01:09.460
actually, this is totally not working

03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:11.540
and I need to change direction?

03:01:11.540 --> 03:01:13.900
But also I think for me, that always gives me a framework

03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:17.900
of like, okay, here's a problem.

03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:19.580
Do we need to change direction

03:01:19.580 --> 03:01:21.300
or do we need to kind of power through it?

03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:25.060
And just knowing like those are the choices,

03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:27.860
not always the only choices, but those are choices,

03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:29.580
I think can be helpful to say,

03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:34.580
okay, am I checking it out?

03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:36.100
Because I'm having a little bump

03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:37.060
and I'm feeling an emotional

03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:38.580
and I'm just gonna give up too soon.

03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:40.780
Okay, ask yourself that question.

03:01:40.780 --> 03:01:42.980
And also it's like, am I being pigheaded

03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:45.300
and trying to do something that actually doesn't make sense?

03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:46.420
Okay, ask yourself that question too.

03:01:46.420 --> 03:01:48.660
Even though they're contradictory questions,

03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:51.660
sometimes it'll be one, sometimes it'll be the other

03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:53.580
and you gotta really think it through.

03:01:53.580 --> 03:01:55.540
I think persisting with the business model

03:01:55.540 --> 03:01:59.980
behind Wikipedia is such an inspiring story

03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:03.140
because we live in a capitalist world.

03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:07.060
We live in a scary world, I think,

03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:08.460
for an internet business.

03:02:10.140 --> 03:02:12.460
And so like to do things differently

03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:14.220
than a lot of websites are doing,

03:02:14.220 --> 03:02:18.140
like Wikipedia has lived through the successive explosion

03:02:18.140 --> 03:02:20.900
of many websites that are basically ad-driven.

03:02:20.900 --> 03:02:24.940
Google is ad-driven, Facebook, Twitter,

03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:26.820
all of these websites are ad-driven.

03:02:26.820 --> 03:02:29.980
And to see them succeed become these like

03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:34.500
incredibly rich, powerful companies

03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:37.020
that if I could just have that money,

03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:39.260
you would think as somebody running Wikipedia,

03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:41.140
I could do so much positive stuff, right?

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:43.780
And so to persist through that is,

03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:46.980
I think is from my perspective now,

03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:50.380
Monday night quarterback or whatever,

03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:53.420
is the right decision.

03:02:53.420 --> 03:02:55.580
But boy, is that a tough decision.

03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:58.420
It seemed easy at the time, so.

03:02:58.420 --> 03:02:59.860
And then you just kind of stay with it.

03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:01.820
Yeah, just stay with it, it's working.

03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:03.420
So now when you chose Persistent.

03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:07.380
Yeah, well, yeah.

03:03:07.380 --> 03:03:11.420
I mean, I always like to give an example of MySpace

03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:13.380
because I just think it's an amusing story.

03:03:13.380 --> 03:03:17.660
So MySpace was poised, I would say, to be Facebook, right?

03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:21.020
It was huge, it was viral, it was lots of things.

03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:23.420
Kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even TikTok

03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:26.420
because it was like a lot of entertainment content, casual.

03:03:28.140 --> 03:03:30.940
And then Rupert Murdoch bought it

03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:33.580
and it collapsed within a few years.

03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:36.340
And part of that, I think, was because they were really,

03:03:36.340 --> 03:03:40.820
really heavy on ads and less heavy on the customer experience.

03:03:40.820 --> 03:03:43.180
So I remember to accept a friend request

03:03:43.180 --> 03:03:45.940
was like three clicks where you saw three ads.

03:03:45.940 --> 03:03:47.940
And on Facebook, you accept the friend request,

03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:49.060
you didn't even leave the page.

03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:51.460
That just accepted.

03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:53.740
But what is interesting, so I used to give this example

03:03:53.740 --> 03:03:57.020
of like, yeah, well, Rupert Murdoch really screwed that one up

03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:58.220
and in a sense, maybe he did.

03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:00.220
But somebody said, you know what, actually,

03:04:00.220 --> 03:04:02.060
he bought it for, and I don't remember the numbers,

03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:03.100
he bought it for 800 million

03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:06.940
and it was very profitable through its decline.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:09.060
He actually made his money back and more.

03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:11.220
So it wasn't like from a financial point of view,

03:04:11.220 --> 03:04:12.740
it was a bad investment in the sense of

03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:14.460
you could have been Facebook,

03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:17.020
but on sort of more mundane metrics, it's like,

03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:18.140
actually worked out okay for him.

03:04:18.140 --> 03:04:20.140
It all matters how you define success.

03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:23.900
It does, and that is also advice to young people.

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:27.260
One of the things I would say,

03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:31.620
like when we have our mental models of success,

03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:33.660
as an entrepreneur, for example,

03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:37.580
and your examples in your mind are Bill Gates,

03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:39.180
Mark Zuckerberg.

03:04:39.180 --> 03:04:43.180
So people who at a very young age

03:04:43.180 --> 03:04:45.860
had one really great idea that just went straight to the moon

03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:47.900
and became one of the richest people in the world,

03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:52.020
that is really unusual, like really, really rare.

03:04:52.020 --> 03:04:53.500
And for most entrepreneurs,

03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:55.540
that is not the life path you're gonna take.

03:04:55.540 --> 03:04:57.620
You're gonna fail, you're gonna reboot,

03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:59.380
you're gonna learn from what you failed at,

03:04:59.380 --> 03:05:01.300
you're gonna try something different.

03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:02.740
And that is really important

03:05:02.740 --> 03:05:05.820
because if your standard of success is,

03:05:05.820 --> 03:05:09.260
well, I feel sad because I'm not as rich as Elon Musk,

03:05:09.260 --> 03:05:12.940
it's like, well, so should almost everyone,

03:05:12.940 --> 03:05:14.740
possibly everyone except Elon Musk

03:05:14.740 --> 03:05:16.020
is not as rich as Elon Musk.

03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:18.740
And so that, like realistically,

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.660
you can set a standard of success,

03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:22.300
even in a really narrow sense,

03:05:22.300 --> 03:05:25.220
which I don't recommend of thinking

03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:27.580
about your financial success.

03:05:27.580 --> 03:05:30.020
It's like, if you measure your financial success

03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:32.780
by thinking about billionaires,

03:05:32.780 --> 03:05:37.220
like that's heavy, like that's probably not good.

03:05:37.220 --> 03:05:38.500
I don't recommend it.

03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:42.740
Whereas like I personally, like for me,

03:05:42.740 --> 03:05:44.220
when people, when journalists say,

03:05:44.220 --> 03:05:45.740
oh, how does it feel to not be a billionaire?

03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:48.500
I usually say, I don't know, how does it feel to you?

03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:49.500
Because they're not.

03:05:50.460 --> 03:05:53.940
But also I'm like, I live in London.

03:05:53.940 --> 03:05:57.020
The number of bankers that no one's ever heard of

03:05:57.020 --> 03:05:58.660
who live in London who make far more money

03:05:58.660 --> 03:06:01.500
than I ever will is quite a large number.

03:06:01.500 --> 03:06:05.020
And I wouldn't trade my life for theirs at all, right?

03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:06.820
Because mine is so interesting.

03:06:06.820 --> 03:06:11.180
Like, oh, right, Jimmy, we need you to go

03:06:11.180 --> 03:06:13.860
and meet the Chinese propaganda minister.

03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:15.620
Oh, okay, that's super interesting.

03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:18.620
Like, yeah, Jimmy, you know, like here's the situation.

03:06:18.620 --> 03:06:22.660
Like you can go to this country and while you're there,

03:06:22.660 --> 03:06:24.100
the president has asked to see you.

03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:26.140
I was like, God, that's super interesting.

03:06:26.140 --> 03:06:28.620
Jimmy, you're going to this place

03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:30.620
and there's a local Wikipedia who said,

03:06:30.620 --> 03:06:32.860
do you wanna stay with me and my family?

03:06:32.860 --> 03:06:35.020
And I'm like, yeah, like, that's really cool.

03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:36.140
Like, I would like to do that.

03:06:36.140 --> 03:06:37.340
That's really interesting.

03:06:38.260 --> 03:06:39.100
Don't do that all the time,

03:06:39.100 --> 03:06:40.220
but I've done it and it's great.

03:06:40.220 --> 03:06:43.420
So like for me, that's like arranging your life

03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:48.420
so that you have interesting experiences is just great.

03:06:49.540 --> 03:06:51.580
Well, this is more to the question

03:06:51.580 --> 03:06:53.940
of what Wikipedia looks like in a thousand years.

03:06:53.940 --> 03:06:56.460
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:06:56.460 --> 03:06:58.700
Why are we here, human civilization?

03:06:58.700 --> 03:07:00.140
What's the meaning of life?

03:07:00.140 --> 03:07:02.220
Yeah, I don't think there is

03:07:03.260 --> 03:07:05.220
an external answer to that question.

03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:09.940
And I should mention that there's a very good Wikipedia page

03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:11.660
on the different philosophies of the meaning of life.

03:07:11.660 --> 03:07:12.500
Oh, interesting.

03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:14.300
I have to read that and see what I think.

03:07:14.300 --> 03:07:16.660
Hopefully it's neutral and gives a wide frame.

03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:18.420
Oh, it's a really good reference

03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:21.340
to a lot of different philosophies about meaning.

03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:23.820
The 20th century philosophy in general,

03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:26.380
from Nietzsche to the existentialists,

03:07:26.380 --> 03:07:30.900
to some of the Boir, all of them have an idea of meaning.

03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:33.380
They really struggled systematically, rigorously,

03:07:33.380 --> 03:07:34.820
and that's what the page.

03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:37.060
And obviously a shout out to the Hitchhiker's Guide

03:07:37.060 --> 03:07:37.900
and all that kind of stuff.

03:07:37.900 --> 03:07:38.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:41.820
No, so I think there's no external answer to that.

03:07:41.820 --> 03:07:43.020
I think it's internal.

03:07:43.020 --> 03:07:48.020
I think we decide what meaning we will have in our lives

03:07:48.380 --> 03:07:50.380
and what we're gonna do with ourselves.

03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:53.900
And so when I think, you know,

03:07:53.900 --> 03:07:57.340
if we're talking about thousand years, millions of years,

03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:01.860
Uri Milner wrote a book.

03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:03.900
He's a big internet investor guy.

03:08:03.900 --> 03:08:07.580
He wrote a book advocating quite strongly

03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:12.700
for humans exploring the universe

03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:14.300
and getting off the planet.

03:08:14.300 --> 03:08:18.060
And he funds projects to like using lasers

03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:20.620
to send little cameras and interesting stuff.

03:08:22.180 --> 03:08:24.100
And he talks a lot in the book about meaning.

03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:27.500
It's like his view is that the purpose of the human species

03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:31.300
is to broadly survive and get off the planet.

03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:33.540
Well, I don't agree with everything he has to say

03:08:33.540 --> 03:08:35.380
because I think that's not a meaning

03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:37.940
that can motivate most people in their own lives.

03:08:37.940 --> 03:08:39.380
It's like, okay, great.

03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:43.260
Like the distances of space are absolutely enormous.

03:08:43.260 --> 03:08:47.020
So I don't know, should we build generation ships

03:08:47.020 --> 03:08:48.100
to start flying places?

03:08:48.100 --> 03:08:49.340
Well, I can't do that.

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:51.660
And I'm not, even if I could, even if I'm Elon Musk

03:08:51.660 --> 03:08:53.820
and I could devote all my wealth to building,

03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:55.620
I'll be dead on the ship on the way.

03:08:55.620 --> 03:08:57.700
So is that really meaning?

03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:00.740
But I think it's really interesting to think about.

03:09:00.740 --> 03:09:02.420
And reading his little book,

03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:03.780
it's quite a short little book.

03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:06.860
Reading his book, it did make me think about,

03:09:06.860 --> 03:09:07.900
wow, like this is big.

03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:09.140
Like this is not what you think about

03:09:09.140 --> 03:09:11.420
in your day-to-day life is like,

03:09:11.420 --> 03:09:15.700
where is the human species going to be in 10 million years?

03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:18.820
And it does make you sort of turn back to earth

03:09:18.820 --> 03:09:23.300
and say, gee, let's not destroy the planet.

03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:26.380
Like we kind of, we're stuck here for at least a while.

03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:31.180
And therefore we should really think about sustainability.

03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:36.380
And I mean, one million years sustainability.

03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:38.220
And we don't have all the answers.

03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:40.060
We have nothing close to the answers.

03:09:40.060 --> 03:09:43.300
I'm actually excited about AI in this regard

03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:44.660
while also bracketing.

03:09:44.660 --> 03:09:45.980
Yeah, I understand there's also risks

03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:48.340
and people are terrified of AI.

03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:50.300
But I actually think it is quite interesting

03:09:50.300 --> 03:09:54.180
this moment in time that we may have in the next 50 years

03:09:55.100 --> 03:10:00.100
to really, really solve some really long-term human problems,

03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:02.140
for example, in health.

03:10:02.140 --> 03:10:06.620
I think the progress that's being made in cancer treatment

03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:08.900
because we were able to at scale,

03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:15.260
model molecules and genetics and things like this,

03:10:15.260 --> 03:10:16.100
it gets huge.

03:10:16.100 --> 03:10:16.940
It's really exciting.

03:10:17.980 --> 03:10:22.500
So if we can hang on for a little while

03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:27.260
and certain problems that seem completely intractable today

03:10:27.260 --> 03:10:30.180
like climate change may end up being actually not that hard.

03:10:30.180 --> 03:10:33.340
And we just might be able to alleviate

03:10:33.340 --> 03:10:35.740
the full diversity of human suffering.

03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:36.860
For sure, yeah.

03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:41.420
And in so doing help increase the chance

03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:44.340
that we can propagate the flame of human consciousness

03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:46.620
out towards the stars.

03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:51.220
And I think another important one, if we fail to do that,

03:10:51.220 --> 03:10:54.380
for me is propagating and maintaining

03:10:54.540 --> 03:10:58.740
the full diversity and richness and complexity

03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:02.220
and expansiveness of human knowledge.

03:11:02.220 --> 03:11:03.980
So if we destroy ourselves,

03:11:03.980 --> 03:11:07.420
it would make me feel a little bit okay.

03:11:07.420 --> 03:11:08.500
Yeah, you just-

03:11:08.500 --> 03:11:09.460
If the human knowledge-

03:11:09.460 --> 03:11:12.540
Just triggered me to say something really interesting,

03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:16.860
which is when we talked earlier about translating

03:11:16.860 --> 03:11:18.940
and using machines to translate,

03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:21.500
we mostly talked about small languages

03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:22.780
and translating into English.

03:11:22.780 --> 03:11:25.020
But I always like to tell this story of

03:11:25.020 --> 03:11:26.860
it's something inconsequential really.

03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:30.940
But there's, I was in Norway, in Bergen, Norway,

03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:32.900
where every year they've got this annual festival

03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:37.620
called Buekor, which is young groups drumming

03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:39.140
and they have a drumming competition.

03:11:39.140 --> 03:11:40.660
It's the 17 sectors of the city.

03:11:40.660 --> 03:11:42.340
And they've been doing it for a couple hundred years

03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:43.580
or whatever.

03:11:43.580 --> 03:11:48.060
They wrote about it in the three languages of Norway.

03:11:48.060 --> 03:11:50.740
And then from there, it was translated into English,

03:11:50.820 --> 03:11:53.100
into German, et cetera, et cetera.

03:11:53.100 --> 03:11:55.500
And so what I love about that story is,

03:11:55.500 --> 03:11:57.060
what it reminds me is,

03:11:57.060 --> 03:12:00.820
this machine translation goes both ways.

03:12:00.820 --> 03:12:02.860
And when you talk about the richness

03:12:02.860 --> 03:12:04.940
and broadness of human culture,

03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:08.340
we're already seeing some really great pieces of this.

03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:12.140
So Korean soap operas, really popular,

03:12:12.140 --> 03:12:13.940
not with me, but with people.

03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:18.940
And the ability to, imagine taking a very famous,

03:12:19.580 --> 03:12:23.820
very popular, very well-known Korean drama.

03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:26.260
And now, I mean, and I literally mean now,

03:12:26.260 --> 03:12:29.060
we're just about there technologically,

03:12:29.060 --> 03:12:33.420
where we use a machine to redub it in English

03:12:33.420 --> 03:12:34.260
in an automated way,

03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:37.060
including digitally editing the faces

03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:38.900
so it doesn't look dubbed.

03:12:38.900 --> 03:12:41.620
And so suddenly you say, oh, wow,

03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:45.860
like here's a piece of, it's the Korean equivalent

03:12:45.860 --> 03:12:48.140
of maybe it's friends as a comedy

03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:50.780
or maybe it's succession, just to be very contemporary.

03:12:50.780 --> 03:12:52.700
It's something that really impacted a lot of people

03:12:52.700 --> 03:12:53.540
and they really loved it.

03:12:53.540 --> 03:12:56.140
And we have literally no idea what it's about.

03:12:56.140 --> 03:12:57.660
And suddenly it's like, wow,

03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:03.700
like music, street music from wherever in the world

03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:08.260
can suddenly become accessible to us all in new ways.

03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:09.700
It's so cool.

03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:11.540
It's really exciting to get access

03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:14.740
to the richness of culture in China,

03:13:14.740 --> 03:13:17.780
in the many different subcultures of Africa,

03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:19.020
South America.

03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:21.340
One of my unsuccessful arguments

03:13:21.340 --> 03:13:25.900
with the Chinese government is by blocking Wikipedia, right?

03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:28.500
You aren't just stopping people in China

03:13:28.500 --> 03:13:31.060
from reading Chinese Wikipedia

03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:32.460
and other language versions of Wikipedia.

03:13:32.460 --> 03:13:34.900
You're also preventing the Chinese people

03:13:34.900 --> 03:13:36.940
from telling their story.

03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:40.580
So is there a small festival in a small town in China

03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:42.380
like Buoy Corp?

03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:44.060
I don't know, but by the way,

03:13:44.060 --> 03:13:45.940
the people who live in that village,

03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:48.380
that small town of 50,000,

03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:49.780
they can't put that in Wikipedia

03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:51.540
and get it translated into other places.

03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:54.300
They can't share their culture and their knowledge.

03:13:54.300 --> 03:13:55.420
And I think for China,

03:13:55.420 --> 03:13:57.620
this should be a somewhat influential argument

03:13:57.620 --> 03:14:00.620
because China does feel misunderstood in the world.

03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:02.060
It's like, okay, well, there's one way

03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:05.060
if you wanna help people understand,

03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:06.060
put it in Wikipedia.

03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:08.380
That's what people go to when they wanna understand.

03:14:08.380 --> 03:14:13.300
And give the amazing, incredible people of China a voice.

03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:14.740
Exactly.

03:14:14.740 --> 03:14:16.100
Jimmy, thank you so much.

03:14:16.100 --> 03:14:17.980
I'm such a huge fan of everything you've done.

03:14:17.980 --> 03:14:18.820
Oh, thank you.

03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:19.660
I keep saying Wikipedia.

03:14:19.660 --> 03:14:23.060
I'm deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for Wikipedia.

03:14:23.060 --> 03:14:23.900
I love it.

03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:24.860
It brings me joy.

03:14:24.860 --> 03:14:26.100
I donate all the time.

03:14:26.100 --> 03:14:27.660
You should donate too.

03:14:27.660 --> 03:14:29.140
It's a huge honor to finally talk with you

03:14:29.140 --> 03:14:30.540
and this is amazing.

03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:31.580
Thank you so much for today.

03:14:31.580 --> 03:14:32.580
Thanks for having me.

03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:36.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Wales.

And now, let me leave you with some words

03:14:43.060 --> 03:14:46.380
from the world historian, Daniel Borsten.

03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:50.380
The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance.

03:14:50.380 --> 03:14:53.220
It is the illusion of knowledge.

03:14:54.340 --> 03:14:57.740
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
