00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
The following is a conversation with Tom Brands, Olympic champion and world champion in freestyle wrestling, three time NCAA wrestling champion at University of Iowa and one of the greatest coaches in the history of wrestling, leading the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for 15 years, including in 2021 winning the national championships and getting a coach of the year award, his third.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
He's known for his intensity, focus and mental toughness, embodying both as a wrestler and coach, the culture and spirit of Iowa wrestling.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
We recorded this conversation almost exactly three years ago after I attended the University of Iowa versus Iowa State wrestling meet in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
Tom graciously invited me to his home or his family, a couple of friends and me spent several hours chatting about wrestling and life.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
We recorded this brief podcast conversation that evening and I wasn't sure where, how or whether we'll publish it.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
But returning to it now three years later, I realized just how meaningful that evening was for me.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
And even though I was nervous, didn't even put on my jacket, it's a moment I would love to share with others.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
The mix of intensity and heartfelt kindness from Tom and his family made me want to stay in Iowa forever.

01:25.000 --> 01:37.000
I think I will return there soon enough because of the amazing people there and because Iowa is still in many ways the heart of the indomitable spirit of American wrestling.

01:37.000 --> 01:48.000
A sport I love and to which I'm deeply grateful for humbling me early in life and helping me and many others build character through hard work.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
And now here's my conversation with Tom Brands.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
What's the best motivator for you or for your athletes?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Hatred of losing or love of winning?

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing. I was not a guy that was about pageantry.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I was not a guy that was about the parade.

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
When I wrestled in Atlanta, I rented a three-cylinder GEO with my wife, drove home and mowed the lawn because it hadn't been mowed for a month.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And I remember one of our neighbors driving by and they were like, they did a double take.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
I thought he was in Atlanta. Well, I was in Atlanta yesterday. I just sat on the stand and got a gold medal put around my neck.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
That's how I was. That doesn't mean that it was the right approach or the wrong approach. It's just what worked for me.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
But when you were a kid, you and Terry, you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, so there is the lure of winning.

02:52.000 --> 03:03.000
But what drives you is that as you move forward, there's just no reason that you have to settle for anything but being the best.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
And it would get to you to the point where that's not going to happen to me again.

03:10.000 --> 03:19.000
So the thing that keeps you up at night is the losses. And that's not going to happen to me again. That's the thought that keeps you up at night.

03:19.000 --> 03:28.000
That's the thought that drives you in your training. That's why you do nine ropes when Gable says do three ropes and buddy pushups and you're out of here.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And you do nine or you do them until you can't do any more.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
And it's a very rare ingredient. The older I get, the more rare I find it is.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
The ingredient of loss feeding, feeding the drive of hard training?

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Maybe that because everybody's so worried about the negative whatever and you're putting too much pressure on yourself.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
So maybe that. But what I meant was it's when a coach says, OK, finish with four ropes and buddy pushups and four way neck.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
You know, I would do 12 or 10. That's rare.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
It's no longer about what the coach says. It's your own demons that you're trying to exercise out.

04:09.000 --> 04:18.000
What's the few losses you've had in your life? Are all of them just melt together or is there something that stands out in your mind?

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm I'm a guy that remembers my career that well.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
I know that I am judged on a very small portion of my life and that's minutes of wrestling matches.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You know, a lot of a lot of winning, but there's some losing in there too.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
And, you know, people think they know you because of that and they think they know you because they see you in a press conference.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
But, you know, to go back to the original question, you know, I don't know how to answer that.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
So there's no losses that just that eat at you still.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
There's opponents that I have learned a great deal from.

04:57.000 --> 05:08.000
I mean, my loss to John Smith in 1991 US Open was something that I learned a lot about.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
I learned a lot about positioning. I learned a lot about the importance of parterre.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
You know, in a certain kind of crazy way, I learned that I could go with the best guy in the world, even though it was 14 to 4.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
And this is when tech falls were 15 or 12 points. I didn't get tech fall.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
That wasn't a badge of honor for me, but I knew I could go with him because it was one point takedowns.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
I scored four takedowns on him. And I learned that I had to move my feet.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
And I learned what it meant to move your feet constantly. And there's no break.

05:39.000 --> 05:49.000
John Smith is a very, very intense competitor that people know that now, six time world Olympic champion, and I felt that firsthand.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
But I did not go in there taking a back seat, even though the score was very lopsided.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But you knew you could stand with the best of the world.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
I knew that. This is what this is about. And you know what? You move your feet.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And you don't give up a lace that's so damn tight that you can't, you know, feel your calf muscle.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
You know, and I had to get ready for the consolation side of the bracket because I believe that was in the semis.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You know, you know, you just learn from that.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.000
And it was it was better than learning from, you know, a win over a second ranked senior level guy when you're a junior in college.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
You know, you rest on the best on a stage.

06:33.000 --> 06:43.000
So if you look back, you probably spent tens of thousands of hours on the mat, spilled sweat, blood, even tears, maybe, maybe a few times.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
So technically or philosophically, how would you do any of those hours differently?

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
Just looking back at the tens of thousands of hours, I would be more probably in my older age.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
I probably would have been more relaxed in my training and probably would have went another cycle if I could do it over again.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
In 96, I really thought that when Gable retired that I would be the next guy in line.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And I was wrong. And that was immature of me.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
In terms of the coach, in terms of the coach, yes.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And I knew that Gable was close.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
I mean, I didn't know when, but it just so happens, you know, 97 was his record breaking year and then he retired.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But I didn't know how close he was.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
But I knew that he had, you know, he went down with a bad hip injury.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
And so, you know, you're just you're not going to.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So what is what is a relaxed Tom Brands looks like?

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
You're saying you would have been a little more relaxed or like where, you know what?

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
I was pretty dang good and I was getting better every day, but maybe do it a little bit different, a little bit smarter.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And Terry actually did that going through 2000.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
He had to do it.

07:52.000 --> 08:04.000
And he would have been in the, you know, the funny farm, let alone, you know, the physical farm, whatever you want to say, mentally and physically beat up.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
But he had to learn to less is more type approach.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
And how it came around was is, you know, you work hard at feeling good.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You work hard in your recovery.

08:18.000 --> 08:30.000
So even when you're not wrestling hard in that wrestling room and looking for the toughest partner to go, you're still working hard in your recovery.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
And massage could be that stretching could be that thing.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Things like that that are more fluffy.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And that's something you weren't as good at.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Never, never.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
There's not a place for it with young people, because in my opinion, there's so much development have happened.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I mean, when you need to learn wrestling, you need to be wrestling.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
And as you get older, your body won't do it anymore.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And so to learn wrestling, it's more of a probably a relaxed approach.

09:08.000 --> 09:22.000
So if you had to choose between two athletes who would dominate competition, one who drills 100,000 reps of a specific takedown, specific technique, or one that spends that time live wrestling?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Both.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
It's the same.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And I like to live wrestling.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I was always wanting to live wrestle, bring the warm up into the live wrestle.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Let's go.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
But where I got really, really good was a repetition.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
And I was disciplined enough to know that the things that you hate to do in this sport are the things that make you the very best.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And that is a rare ingredient as I've gotten older.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
And you spend a lot of time communicating that to younger athletes.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
So the thing, if you feel yourself hating something, that's probably the thing you should be doing.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes. As a matter of fact, I had a strength coach when I was really young.

09:58.000 --> 10:08.000
He was just a frickin guy that when he wore white, like he was almost like a nurse, nurse's clothes, he wore all white from head to toe.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And his first name was Walt.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
And he taught Terry and I to hate the bar away from you on that last rep when you're dead.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And whether it's a curl, you hate it up.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
And then you do the negative and you hate it down and you hate that bench up and you hate it.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
You look at the bar and you hate it away from you.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So, you know, I learned and I was young.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I was young.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And I remember being bored.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
My mom's sister lived out there and we were dropped off to stay out there with our cousins.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And I was bored a little bit and they always treated us really good.

10:40.000 --> 10:50.000
But this was like the the single most bright spot in a weightlifting, like enlightenment, even though I lifted weights.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
But I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It's just to look good.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And so you can flex and look in the mirror or is it for performance?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
And this guy was about performance.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And you said repetition.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Do you mean technique?

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm talking repetition, technique, technique, technique, drill, drill, drill, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
So you believe in that?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I believe in that wholeheartedly.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So, I mean.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
And I believe that you have to do it on your own.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.

11:21.000 --> 11:32.000
So in the guys today or in yourself, how often do you see people that grow the belief of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I think it's rare.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I think it's very rare and I think it's especially rare.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
I mean, you can talk about that as a coach, but it's especially rare to bring a guy to that understanding.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But you never stop trying.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
You're always trying to reach him.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I mean, we didn't have a good performance out there tonight.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
But you know what?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
You don't stop communicating.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
And there's a lot of programs out there that put their head down when things aren't going their way.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And then as things start going their way, then they rise with the tide.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
There was no difference in the demeanor of our corner.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And we talk about that's a philosophy.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And so you're reaching your guys that way.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So go back to your point or your question.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Do you believe in the 10,000 reps?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And yes, I do.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
How do you inspire people to do that?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
By example, but communication.

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
But I mean, in my experience, what I've seen, communicating the value of repetition and drilling is a hard thing to communicate.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
It's hard and it's very rare to have somebody that goes in there and will do it on their own.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Do you have young guys that step up and do that?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
We do.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
And it's rare.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
And the guys that do it on their own and have done it on their own are the guys that are in that lineup and doing well.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
The other thing is, is that when you talk about getting to that next level, a lot of times it's, you know,

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
what held you back was I did everything the coach asked of me and nothing more.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, you could be a great guy for a coach as an athlete.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And you did everything that coach asked, but you did nothing more.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
So you're really looking for the guys that go way beyond what the coach says.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
We don't want guys that are looking at their watch running out of the room when practice is over.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
We want guys that know what they have to get done and they might leave early, but they're not looking at their watch.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
They might be done early.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
They might be, we might be on a whole different path and this guy just excuses himself.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm all about that.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
We are not, we are not autocrats.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
There's an internal engine in there.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Is that something you're born with or is that something you can develop?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I think you are born with it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
You develop it also.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And I think that there has to be comfort.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
And I go back to the communication that young people are comfortable enough to communicate that I need to take the day off.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
So what do you mean by communication?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Exactly.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
So letting athletes be part of their own development.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
Communication to me is letting them know what they need to do to get themselves in contention to be the starting quarterback.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
And then to give them boosts and compliments when they earn them.

14:24.000 --> 14:34.000
And I don't have time to waste with lies and cheating.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And when I say cheating, I'm talking about when they cheat themselves.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
And so those become very direct conversations and the conversation starts like this.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I don't have time to waste and neither do you.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And so why are we wasting our time?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And here's what I mean by that.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
We're having a conversation about your accountability.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
If you look in the mirror and you're accountable, then we aren't taking the time to go through this.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
We're already on our way to solving the problem.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Problem can't be solved without that understanding.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
And that has to do with symptoms that you see in the wrestling room.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
There's something where the fire's not quite there.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
That has to do with mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, everything.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Everything that you know about.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I had a boss and our athletic director is a great athletic director.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And he gives us everything we need to be successful.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But I had a boss, his name was Fred Mims.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I didn't think anybody could be better than him.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And then all of a sudden this Gene Taylor guy came in.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And then he was pretty doggone good too.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
And he actually was just like Fred and maybe even a little bit more current.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And then he ended up taking a job at Kansas State where he's the athletic director now.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And then this lady Barbara Burke comes in.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
And I didn't think anybody could be better than Gene Taylor or Fred Mims.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
And this Barbara Burke, she's better than both of them.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And the reason why is because she's a problem solver.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
She doesn't waste time.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
She's direct and she's a problem solver.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
And that's what we need.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You need problem solvers.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
So on the flip side of problems and technique and repetition,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
here's a thing called toughness, mental toughness.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general is a little bit known for.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
So how do you train mental toughness as a coach?

16:18.000 --> 16:27.000
You train mental toughness by putting them in situations that they're willing to go through

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
but don't think they can make it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
And then they go through it.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And then all of a sudden those barriers are down.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Does that have to do with physical, usually exhaustion?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Or wraps on the ropes?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It has to do with that.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
And it has to do with understanding why we're doing it.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
And sometimes understanding why we're doing it might not come for months,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
but there's blind faith.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
And we have a heavyweight in the room right now, this young guy that he's like that.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
He doesn't necessarily understand it.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
He asks a lot of questions, but he does it.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And he's been here four months now, four and a half months now,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and he's getting better every day.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
So mental toughness, too, is a matter of repetition.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Mental toughness is a matter of repetition and having an open mind

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and being extremely accountable.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
And not only accountable that when something doesn't go your way

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
that you look in the mirror and own it,

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
but accountable to the point of view that I've got to get tough in this situation,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
right here, right now, and this is what's going to make or break me.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
And I talked about my own career being defined by a couple of minutes on the mat,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
but that's when you're going to be defined.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That's how you're going to be defined.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
That's okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So people are going to talk about you,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
so you might as well have them talking about how doggone tough you are.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
What about, we live in a world now, I've often in my own work,

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
I hear about these concepts of work-life balance or overtraining.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
So you've been one of the hardest workers ever on the mat.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
You've coached some of the hardest workers ever.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Do you think it's possible to overtrain, train too much?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
How big of a concern is it?

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
I think peaking and burnout are frames of mind,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
or burnout is like you let things probably get to the point

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
where you could have arrested them with a good frame of mind.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
But peaking is a frame of mind, and you have to know, be able to read,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
and that's a lot of it.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
And the individual athlete also has to know that it's a frame of mind.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
And so when you have a coach that's reading that the right way,

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
and you have an athlete that is knowing that when zero hour comes

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
that you're going to be ready to go,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and knowing that there's light at the end of the tunnel

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
if you feel like you're burning that candle at both ends,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
light's coming at the end of the tunnel.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I mean, you're good to go.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
So you think about Gable and that whole dream of being carried off the mat

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
because you worked so hard.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Again, do you think it's possible to overtrain?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
So you said it's mental.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I do think it's possible to overtrain if you have a lot of distractions.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
And if you're looking at your watch running out of the room,

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
then yeah, that frame of mind isn't going to lend itself to excellency.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
And the thing is we have to accomplish what we need to get accomplished

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
because you can't get better every day.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You can't kind of accomplish what you need to accomplish.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
You have to accomplish it.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
And when you're in that mindset, then the clock is irrelevant.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
There's no place for a clock in the wrestling room.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And maybe a clock that times a match.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And maybe a clock if, you know, we're student athletes here,

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
but that's why we encourage our, you know, when you schedule your classes,

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
that you don't have a class that comes right up to, you know, practice time

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
or starts as a night class and it starts at 5.30.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
You know, go to get the 6.30 class or the seven o'clock.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
So you leave it all behind your heart, your passions completely,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
and then there's no problem.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
And when you walk in that wrestling room, there's no distractions.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And it's never eternal.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
The only thing that's eternal is death.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You know, there's nothing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Sometimes guys come in there and they wig out.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Oh, it's an hour and 25 minutes.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, or an hour and 45 minutes.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
You have to be willing to go as long as it takes.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
There's no clock.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
There's no clock.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Again, wrestlers are some of the hardest, some of the toughest people in all sports,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
but weight cutting often breaks people.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
So what's your thought on weight cutting, both nutrition-wise, mental-wise?

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
How do you approach and think of it as a coach in your own career too?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
It's a lot of discipline and it's a lot of discipline

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
during a very uncomfortable time period that really doesn't last that long,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
but it feels like it lasts long and it's painful.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
But once you shrink your body down and if you're hydrated, you'll get through it.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
If you're a little hungry, but you're eating, but you're hydrated,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
once you break that sweat, your energy depletion goes away.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
That's a fact.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I've practiced that.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
You come in and you're yawning and you're starting to shrink your body down.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And it's that time of year where, hey, I got to get my body shrunk down

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
and you're dehydrated, you are dead in the water.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
But if you're hungry and hydrated, when you break that sweat...

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Have people gotten better with that over the years or the past few decades?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I think that coaches' science is better.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I think that coaches communicate it.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I think they always have.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I think the bottom line is having the energy to implement that

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
and taking a guy by the hand when he doesn't understand

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
and he's new in your program and he's essential

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
or he's unwilling to and not disciplined enough

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
because when you take them by the hand enough, they will learn that discipline.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
This is an important aspect of wrestling, buddy.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You know what I'm saying?

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
So it's not just go and show up for the match.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I mean, it's not about just making weight either.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
You got to be able to make weight.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's part of the warm-up.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
That's part of the process, getting ready to wrestle.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's a whole thing. It's a lifestyle, yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
When did you first start believing you're going to win Olympic gold?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I don't know.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I mean, I found out...

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
I got really addicted to wrestling really, really fast.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Started late, but looking back at my life,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
wrestled my whole life with my twin brother.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
And when Terry and I would fight, it was wrestling and it was to maim.

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
And so if you're trying to maim me, I'd better be tough

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
because if I roll over and expect you to scratch my belly

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
when you're trying to maim me, I won't lose my head.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
And Tom and Terry Brands, there was no alpha male.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
And when it was on, it was on for real.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
What do you mean there's no alpha male?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
There's a lot of twins.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
There's a dominant twin, a lot of them.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Very few times is there a situation

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
where I'm going to win every time in everything

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and then he's thinking the same exact way.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And Terry used to describe it,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
when we used to get interviewed a lot about our careers,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
it'd be like you grabbing a steering wheel

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
and me grabbing a steering wheel and fighting.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
And that's what it was like when you would wrestle him or fight him.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
And so I had that benefit.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
So when did I know?

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Well, I got addicted to wrestling really, really fast in fifth grade.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And started to research it and I don't know why

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
and talked about the Olympics and put it in my head.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
And I remember I said something about being an Olympic champion in fifth grade

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
and somebody made fun of me and I got in a fight in a playground.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
And I remember getting pulled in, getting in trouble for that.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And the people that got me in trouble for that

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
were smart enough to not rank me over the coals,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
but they researched or they actually found out what the fight was about.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And I was distraught.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
I was really emotional, like crying or whatever you want to say.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
You don't want to admit that to me.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
But it wasn't because I got beat up or got my nose bloodied

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
or got punched in the face or broke my arm or there was any pain.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It was because they stomped on my dream and they doubted me.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And so I fought for that.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And that was a lesson.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
That was a lesson.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
There's going to be a lot of doubters.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
And one thing we talk about as a staff is our staff has to be lockstep

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
in that hallway, in our offices.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
And when you deviate outside of that, that is heresy.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
So everybody has to be on board confident that you're going to be number one in the country.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
When we go forward and we go put our public foot forward,

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
there is a decision we are unified and there is no backbiting.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And we have great people right now.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
We hadn't had that before.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
We've had detractors in our Hawkeye Wrestling Club.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
We've had guys that would go out and get rolled up in ankle laces and not care in our club.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
And we got Brandon Sorensen who got rolled up by James Green last night.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
But I'll tell you what, I don't have a problem with that.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
You know why?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Because I know it means a lot to him.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
He didn't roll over.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
He didn't quit because he was on the consolation side of a racket.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And so when you have that and then you have, you know,

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
if there's a disagreement it's behind closed doors and then you're moving forward.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And when you have people that when they're meeting your fans and your supporters,

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
you know, they're talking the right way with the right message.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
And anything that's catty wonkish to that, you got to be careful there.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You got to be careful there.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
So that in terms of affirmation, in terms of really believing as a team,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
as an individual believing that you're the best in the world,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
did you, I'm sure you had detractors.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
You had people that continued after fifth grade.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
And that's probably where my hatred of losing trumps my love for winning

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
because I wanted to shove it up their rear end bad.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Yeah.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
And the thing is, is we maintain a high level and there's very few programs.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Oklahoma State, Ohio State now, Penn State.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
I mean, there's four programs that try to win a national title every year.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
And that's it.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
And these other teams, they get up and they got a good team

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
and they get up and they get going.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
And then when things don't go well, okay, we're going to do it next year.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Or this is a down year.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
We're going to get right.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
We're three years out.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
So no matter what you're fighting for first.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
We do.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
And we haven't won and you say, well, we haven't won in eight years.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Well, you're right.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
We haven't.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Look at our results are better, better than anybody out there.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And it's besides Penn State.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
And it's because of our mentality and because we have great people.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Ryan Morningstar, Bobby Telfer, Terry Brands, our medical team, even our strength

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
coach, Quinn Holland, we're all on the same page.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
And when I send something, I hit it immediately.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I don't have time to waste.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
There will not be dissension in that hallway.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Everybody's in together.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
Can you take me through the day when you're going for the 62 kg gold?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
What did you eat, drink?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
What did you think?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It really doesn't matter.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
I have a routine that I had a routine as a competitor that I could run through right now.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
It was a lot of self-talk, very, very positive self-talk.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Visualization.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yes.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Visualization, self-talk.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
And that's how I was able to relax and getting ready for matches my whole life.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
Learned that very early age at a camp, at a developmental camp, at a young age, Terry and I did.

27:51.000 --> 27:58.000
And I could tell you what I ate and I could tell you what I did to relax.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And it doesn't matter.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
What you have to do is you have to find that peace.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
And I just know that when I was getting ready for the finals match, I had gone back to my

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
room.

28:10.000 --> 28:18.000
I had my relaxed material, you know, and I was able to relax because I prepared for it.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Hopefully I'm right on this, but just looking at the insane bracket you had to go through,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
you had to beat, just to get to the finals, you had to be three world champions.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Eventually world champion.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I mean, Dave, and you know what?

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't talk about that and nobody else does either, but everybody talks about it in their own career.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So now you're making my head big.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But yeah, I had a road.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I had a road.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
You're right.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
That is the hardest bracket I've seen.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So I've talked to a lot of Olympic champions.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
That is the hardest bracket I've seen of any champion.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
So maybe I'm confused on this, but it seemed like a really tough day for you.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Did you have, did you know the bracket ahead of time?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Did you know who you faced?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
You see the draw and it's a two day tournament.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
So psychology comes into it as much as physical shape.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
Because there's those, you got to sleep the night before after the weigh in,

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
then you got to sleep again that next night after your semi-final match is going to be in the morning.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
And then you have to go back and rest because your final match isn't until whatever time it was.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that you just talked about,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
that visualization and self-talk, that's what helps.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
It's your routine.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
And was there any doubt, any fear, anything there?

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
The fear is the type of fear.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Jack Dempsey talked about fear.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
And the fear of losing is what motivated him to try to take his opponent's head off.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
He was a boxer and that's okay.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
So fear of competition, fear of screwing up, fear of, oh, I don't feel good.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
No, no.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
But that little fear that, you know what?

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
There's somebody out there that thinks that, you know what?

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
They're going to revel in my, they're going to eat it up in my misery.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
They're going to love, they're going to be thriving because I fail.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
And I'm not going to let that happen.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
You're identical twin, brother, Terry.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
You've been at him, like you said, your whole life.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
And you're both some of the greatest wrestlers of all time.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
You won the gold medal.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
He won the bronze medal.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
You've mentioned, you know, all that really matters is the six minutes or, you know,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
just a few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to find your whole career.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
So how do you think about that thin line, the tragic line at the Olympic level

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
between winning and losing?

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
I think you come to peace that in the end, when it's over, that you did the best you could.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
And that's certainly the case with Terry.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
His career credentials are better than mine internationally.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
You know, he won two world championships.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I won one and he won an Olympic bronze medal.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
And, you know, I won an Olympic gold medal, but I only won one.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
And the thing is, is that's not what's important anyway.

31:09.000 --> 31:18.000
What's important is, is that when it's all over, you know, how do you look back on it?

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
And you're kind of like, well, you just said that you made sure that you weren't going to leave anything undone.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
But you know what?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
There were tournaments where I did leave things undone.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
And so how do you come back from that?

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Well, Terry never came back from 2000 because he retired.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Well, you know what?

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
You duplicate and exceed when you're communicating to these young athletes.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And because of that experience, that makes Terry a better coach.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
Because of, you know, 1995, that makes me a better coach.

31:46.000 --> 31:52.000
You know, realizing that there are certain things that unraveled in that year

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
that I could have controlled looking back on it.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
And when you have that perspective, you can communicate.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
So what control is there?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Can you control everything?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
How big of a role is luck?

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Control how you react to an injury.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Control that.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So you can't, you don't have any control over it.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It's over.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
You know, you have whatever and whatever happened.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
But relax and you learn to deal with injuries better because of that.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
You have that experience that you let this thing maybe get the best of you.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And that's just an example.

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
And, you know, Terry put a lot of demons to rest with that bronze medal.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
So becoming an Olympic medalist, a few demons could relax.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, a little.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
He'll never admit that.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
And he probably is truthful.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And I should, I'm speaking for him, but he's truthful when he says that.

32:46.000 --> 32:55.000
But if I look at it and bronze sucks, but if I look at it, he did put some demons to rest.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And I'm proud of him for it.

32:57.000 --> 33:06.000
There's something there that is a consolation in the fact that he won the consolation medal.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
The consolation medal sucks, but there is a consolation that he won the consolation medal.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
That's a tough medal to win, by the way.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah.

33:13.000 --> 33:20.000
But do you see the Shakespearean tragedy of it all, that the line between winning and losing?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So you often say that, you know, winning is everything.

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
But it feels like, especially at the Olympic level, or you talk about NCAA finals or that tournament,

33:29.000 --> 33:38.000
you know, a split second mis-move can result in a loss where you dominated all the way up to there.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
That's where your psychology comes in, and that's where the repetition and all of the self-talk

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
and visualization and the physical shape and everything comes together.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And so that doesn't happen.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
And tonight, we got beat twice, actually three times, and we out-wrestled those.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
We lost three matches, and we out-wrestled the guy for six minutes and 30 seconds.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Or one match went to overtime.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
And if our guys can move forward with the right perspective, I'm confident that they'll be better.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
I'll tell you what, I'd take our guy over their guy any day.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Any day, because our guys get up for every match.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
And now we got a lot to work on.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Right.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Got a lot to work on.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
But you know what, I can say all that, and I'll take our guy and blah, blah, blah.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
But what are they going to do tonight in their meal?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
How are they going to grow?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
What are they going to do tonight in their rest?

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
What are they going to do tomorrow in their recovery on their own necessarily?

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
What are they going to do Monday?

34:40.000 --> 34:50.000
Great wrestlers can use their imagination with a win that they're not satisfied with

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
and go forward as if it was a loss.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
But it's still easier to go forward with that win.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
But they don't just, oh, I won, I'm fine, goes on.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
But then when they lose the exact same way that they could have lost before,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
then they go off the deep end.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
And then that's when they're going to make the change in their life.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And we talked about that to our team tonight.

35:12.000 --> 35:21.000
And the mature, rare ingredient is guys that can get better even with success

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
like it was a loss without beating themselves up.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
That's complicated.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It is. It's a balance.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.000
You often talk about Iowa's focus on creating individual champions like Spencer Lee.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
Can you explain the philosophy of focusing on individuals versus the team?

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
I think that we need to put them both together.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
And the individual impacts the team.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
And we haven't done that since 2010.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
And we need to do a better job of putting 10 weight classes out there that contribute to the team.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
And if it's not 10, then it's nine.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
And if it's not nine, it can't be four.

36:02.000 --> 36:11.000
And that takes a lot of pride and it takes a lot of where the coach is on top of it.

36:11.000 --> 36:19.000
And you're not just working on the easy things, the glaring things.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You're working on everything.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
What do you mean by everything?

36:24.000 --> 36:36.000
There's ideas that when you're a coach, they're beneath the surface and you've got to find them.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
And that's where communication comes in.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah, but you're talking about, yeah, we've got to move forward.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
What does that mean?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Well, I know what that means.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
But how many guys really know what that means in their program?

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
There's so many levels of that.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
You've said before that winning is everything.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
And that means people lose.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Most people lose.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
There's really, in whatever the context, there's only one winner.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.000
In many parts of our world today, outside of wrestling, that concept, the brutal honesty of that is uncomfortable for people.

37:15.000 --> 37:28.000
So how do you think about this very philosophical, difficult concept of there only being one winner, that winning is everything?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This kind of really painful idea.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
I don't think that that's a bad thing to have that mentality.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I mean, I think Akutakov.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I remember a story I read about him.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
He comes to mind.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
You know, Sargouache.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I remember when he lost in London.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
And I remember the look on his face.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
And those are some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport, freestyle wrestling.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And you know what?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It's what works for you.

37:58.000 --> 38:06.000
And you can talk about being at peace with your results and that the approach and the journey is what it's about.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And that's great.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And that relaxes some champions and that makes some champions really, really tick.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
But not everybody.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So it's okay.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It's okay.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
And if that wigs you out and that really makes you uptight, then go the other route.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You have to find what works for you.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And that takes a lot of work.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
If you're lazy, forget it.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Forget it.

38:33.000 --> 38:43.000
So you and Terry, but in general, how do you find the line between extremely physical, extreme physical wrestling and rough wrestling or angry wrestling?

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
To which degree has anger, whether it's in your wrestling room these days or in your own career, entered wrestling?

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Do you see it as a tool that can be used in the wrestling match?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
I think there's a balance or not even a balance.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
There's a line that you go up to and you can't cross it.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Sportsmanship is everything.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
You can get dinged for points.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You can get thrown out of tournaments.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
There's rules with flagrant misconduct where you're kicked out of the match.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Other team gets the points and then you have to sit the next meet.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
So it's very serious.

39:17.000 --> 39:23.000
The NCAA sends a message, a very serious message about sportsmanship.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
And so we talk about that.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
The other thing with wrestling is there's rules in wrestling.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
These guys that are tough guys outside of the rules, that's what you want in your opponent.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
That means they're frustrated.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
You've got to be a tough guy inside the rules of the sport.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
That's more honorable than cold cocking somebody and knocking them out.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So yeah, anger doesn't mean breaking the rules.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
But I mean, you know, a lot of people know you just watching you as a coach.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
There's quite a bit of passion there.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Well, come and do what you're doing tonight.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
I mean, break bread with me in my kitchen and see how big of a jackass I am.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
You're a pretty nice guy.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Well, I'm not asking for that necessarily, but thanks.

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm saying, you know what, as a coach, I mean, come spend a month in our program

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
and you'll see really what kind of people we are.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
And there's a stigma out there because they are very threatened by our program.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
There's nobody else that threatens the sport of wrestling like we do.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
And that's the truth.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
There's a legend to Iowa wrestling.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
It's one of the most intimidating.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
There's a legend to John Smith.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
It's the same thing.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
They get up for John Smith.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
They get up for Oklahoma State.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
They get up for Penn State.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
My question is, okay, I'll answer it this way.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I'll give you an example in my coaching career.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I coached at Virginia Tech for 22 months.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
We recruited the number one recruiting class.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
We got the administration to change 100% 180 how they looked at wrestling.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Here's the thing.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
And because of how serious we were and because we weren't idiots,

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
we were able to do that with our administration.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
But my point is this, we tried to win.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
We tried to win.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Even at Virginia Tech, it wasn't a stepping stone for me.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It ended up being one quickly.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
And looking back on it, I was a fool to think that I'd be there for 20 years.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
But you believed you would be.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I did.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I did.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
I did.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
So do you remember a time that you really pushed yourself to your limits?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
So Gable talks about having to be carried off the mat.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Have you really found that level?

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
I said something about that too in a book, and I think I was misquoted one time.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And actually it was Gable's quote.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I was trying to make the point that Gable's quote was like this.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
And they were making it like it was my own words.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I think it was a first wrestling tough book.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
It's a good book.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
It's a good book.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But the story is Gable's.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
And I don't know if there's anybody that has done that besides him.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
And I think that's a very rare quality.

42:10.000 --> 42:19.000
But I've definitely been in that nirvana level of, you know, you could go all day long.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And you have to shoot me to stop me.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Yeah.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
But there's a balance because you're not going hard with and holding your breath.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
It's not a, it's a relaxed.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
And like you got a guy cornered.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And who's most dangerous?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Well, the guy that's cornered.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
And so that's where you relax.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I'm not bum rushing him.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I'm relaxed.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I'm still moving fake and very fluid.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Guy falls down on his face.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I run around behind him.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
That's offense.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
You don't have to just grunt to the leg and call that offense.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
Offense is a in and out, smooth.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Now you sound like a Russian wrestler.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah. Well, that's, they're the best.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
In a certain light, looking at the history of wrestling,

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
wrestling is much bigger than folk style, freestyle, Greco.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
It's, it's one of the oldest forms of combat period.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
There's been cave drawings 15,000 years ago.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
Do you ever see, so you're, you're one of the great coaches of all time.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
You're now focused on a particular rule style right now,

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
but do you ever see wrestling as bigger than all of the, this, you know,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
as, as a, one of the pure combats.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I do.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
And we're raising $20 million for a facility to make it the best facility

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
on the planet.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
We have a vision to build the best facility on planet earth and put the

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
best wrestlers in it.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
And that is bigger than wrestling.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
It's for the university of Iowa.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
And our donors are doing it for the university of Iowa,

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
but it is about the value of wrestling to me.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Also, there is so much value to wrestling.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Blind, blind people don't play football.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
They wrestle.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Blind people don't play basketball.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
I mean, maybe they do, but it'd be very difficult.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
They can wrestle.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Wrestling is a feel sport.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah, there's no ball.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
There's nothing.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's just two guys or two girls and that's it.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
That's right.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
And, and I mean, I'm not going to say you can't because somebody will get a

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
hold of this and I'll get an email or a letter that says,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
you said blind people can't play baseball and blah, blah.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
I'm just saying that blind people can wrestle very effectively.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I've wrestled with my eyes shut.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I mean, was honest about it too.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
And it was, I was effective.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Why was I able to be effective?

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
Because wrestling is a sport that you can overcome a lot.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Your demons that you're overcoming,

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
they're not limited with whether I'm blind or not.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
The demons that are overcoming are inside you.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
You have to overcome those demons from within.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
So what's the future of Iowa wrestling look like with this facility and this

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
momentum you have now and this great group of guys you have now?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
We have a good young group of guys and you know,

45:13.000 --> 45:19.000
there is a lot of buzz in the program and probably hasn't been this much buzz

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
for quite some time.

45:21.000 --> 45:30.000
And our job is to be relaxed and be focused and not get caught up in the buzz.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
But we have to put it together.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
And we have a catalyst, Spencer Lee, but he's going to have to get better.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
And we have some other catalysts as well that are going to help us in the future.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
But they got to get better.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
And so all this stuff about independence and accountability and being able to get

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
better every day under duress and not knowing that you're getting better,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
but you are, you know what I mean by that?

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
The great thing about Gable was, wrestling for him was,

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
you were getting better and you didn't know you were getting better.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
Just like you said, grow from success.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
So you never allow yourself to think that you're getting good.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
All of a sudden you do something in the practice room that you've been working on

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and all of a sudden you hit it and it's like it was automatic.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
And then that multiplies success.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
So if I may say so, you're a bit of a man of the Bible.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
Where do you go?

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
What do you go to the Bible for, your faith, strength, love, patience?

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
Same things I talked about, things that you can't control, you turn them over.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
So the biggest thing for me is I got to turn over the things that I can't control,

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
turn them over to that power and I'm going to be a lot better off.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
And that's the reason why I'm not in the funny farm.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
It's very competitive to me.

47:00.000 --> 47:07.000
It's very serious that we know that these young wrestlers come to school here

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
to be the best that they can be and to accomplish goals that like me when I was young,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
they've set out to accomplish.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And they chose Iowa to do that.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So we have to deliver.

47:18.000 --> 47:26.000
And because of that peace with God, it's pure.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
It's a pure motivation.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
It's a pure platform.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
It's not doing this for my ego.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
We're not corrupt people.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
We're not liars and cheaters.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
And so often that gets in the way of a decent person.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah, first and foremost, you're a good person and God helps you be that.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, and we're serious about wrestling.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
So a couple more questions.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
What's the role of family in wrestling?

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
You mentioned your wife, who I read turned you down when you asked her for a phone number,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
said it's in the phone book.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
That's pretty smooth.

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
Her story of that is that she didn't want me to have to remember the number.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
And I say at this point, and I say there's no way.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
And I remember it very clearly like, hey, it's in the phone book.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And I was like, OK, she's blowing me off.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
That's OK.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
But luckily, anyway, here's the thing with family.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
I mean, we have great people in our program.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
We have great parents.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
We have a culture of parents that that's part of the buzz.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
And this class that you see wrestling right now that's been here a year now,

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
Lee, Mirren, Costello, Warner, and then Lugo was a transfer.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
And I'm forgetting somebody.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
I don't want to forget anybody.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
But these parents are phenomenal.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
And that's a different parental culture.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
So the Kemmerer's dad is the same.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
And so there's a lot of good there.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
And that's a big, that's a big, a big move because how we talk to parents,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
we don't talk to parents to get along with them.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
We talk to parents to help them understand where we're at with their sons.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
And when you can have a direct conversation with a parent who is helping his son

49:21.000 --> 49:27.000
or her son, the mom, helping her son to be accountable and to own it,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
then you can get a lot accomplished.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
And that's what we've been able to do.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
And so you're solving problems like I talked about earlier.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
That's part of the family.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
The other part of the family is the coaches are like family.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
The other part of the family is the coaches, significant others and wives are part of the family.

49:46.000 --> 49:55.000
And we fed 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and wives and their children here at Thanksgiving.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
And that equals 70 people.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
And it's fun.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
It's fun.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
So family means administration.

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
Gary Barta, my athletic director, gives us everything that we need to be successful.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
And he has an open mind for the sport of wrestling.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
And wrestling is important in Iowa, so that's a no-brainer.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
But not if you're not a wrestling guy, but he sees we do it the right way.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
And so the commitment is there from him.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
If we were doofuses, the commitment wouldn't be there.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So family is everybody's all in.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I mean, it's from the wrestlers to the family.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
It goes back to what I said earlier about our people.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Our people are great.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Ryan Mortistar is great.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Bobby Telford is great.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Bobby Telford took over for a guy named Ben Burhow, who is great.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Our medical team is great.

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, Jesse Donaworth, our athletic trainer, is great.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Terry Brands is great.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
Mariah Stickley and Elise Owens, our managers, are great.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
My daughter's a manager as well.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It's great.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
They're hardworking young women.

51:05.000 --> 51:13.000
Our Hawkeye Wrestling Club is where it needs to be in terms of how they help in their role.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
And now we have four women in there.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And that's great.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
And at least one of their dads is super involved with us.

51:22.000 --> 51:29.000
And so one thing that I've learned is that you have to have that.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
And if you don't have that, then you have to address it quickly.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
And those outliers, let's solve that problem.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Let's get it out in the open here.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
And if it doesn't work out, it's not going to work out.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
That's a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah, next year.

51:45.000 --> 51:52.000
Well, I don't know if it'd be legal, but I'd have to check with our compliance and they'd have to vet you.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
You can come.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
You can come and see what it's all about.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
This room is full.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Oh, man.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Well, yeah, I'll be back next year then.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
All right. Awesome.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Last question.

52:02.000 --> 52:15.000
In 2014, I watched this video four years ago of you competing in, I believe, your first swim meet against your brother Terry.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
And you came out victorious.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Not really.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
OK, so I won the race.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Did you cheat?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Here's what happened.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
I researched this thing because that's how I am.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
You practiced.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
No, I didn't.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
But I researched it.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
In swimming, if you flinch on that starter block, it's a false start.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
You can't twitch a finger because they would be doing that to get their buddy to move or the guy next to them.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
So you have to be rock solid.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Well, when we went, Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
So he's moving.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And so I was like, no, no, no, false start.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
No, no, no, no.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
And he couldn't hear me.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
He was already in the water.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
And so he took off like a bat out of you know where for the end of the pool and couldn't hear me and got to the end of the pool.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
And it was a down and back.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
Well, that's a hard thing to do with a guy with no body fat.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end of the pool and he was like, where's he at?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
He didn't see me.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
And so we stopped him and then he came back and then we went another one and I beat him.

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
But it's the only time that, you know, I would say that he was tuckered out and that's the reason why.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
And I'll also say this.

53:28.000 --> 53:38.000
We did a time where we timed my race, the one I won, and then we timed his first down to the wall.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
And then we timed his actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the way back and he'd beat me.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Now, how's that for me?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
That's pretty honest.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
That's pretty honest.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Accountable person.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
And I'm going to tell you something else, getting in those shorts, those swim trunks.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
That's impressive.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
They are tight.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Yeah.

53:58.000 --> 54:05.000
So is there, outside of wrestling, is there a thing that Terry got the better of you?

54:05.000 --> 54:12.000
I mean, I guess this could count as one that you're still really bitter about that you need to avenge.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
I mean, that's past.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I mean, he's got an UNO title.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
We have UNO World Championships.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
He's got an UNO title.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I have yet to have one.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Morningstar has two titles.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
That's unprecedented.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
So there's only four trophies out there and Terry's got one of those and I don't have one yet.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Yeah.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Well, it's still time.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Tom, thank you so much for letting a Russian with a tie into your home.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
