WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.460
He said very specifically,

00:01.460 --> 00:04.240
depending on the questions you ask Putin,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.160
you could be arrested or not.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.000
And I said, listen to what you're saying.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.400
You're saying the US government has control

00:12.400 --> 00:13.800
over my questions and they'll arrest me

00:13.800 --> 00:15.440
if I ask the wrong question?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.400
Like, how are we better than Putin if that's true?

00:17.400 --> 00:21.400
Killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference

00:21.400 --> 00:24.000
in the middle of a debate over $60 billion

00:24.000 --> 00:24.940
in Ukraine funding?

00:25.920 --> 00:28.160
Maybe the Russians are dumb.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.960
I didn't get that vibe at all.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.780
I don't think we kill people in other countries

00:31.780 --> 00:33.420
to affect election outcomes.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.600
Oh, wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.640
The following is a conversation with Tucker Carlson,

00:42.640 --> 00:43.960
a highly influential

00:43.960 --> 00:46.600
and often controversial political commentator.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.720
When he was a Fox,

00:47.720 --> 00:49.080
Time Magazine called him

00:49.080 --> 00:51.380
the most powerful conservative in America.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.720
After Fox, he has continued to host

00:53.720 --> 00:57.120
big impactful interviews and shows on X

00:57.160 --> 01:01.440
on the Tucker Carlson podcast and on TuckerCarlson.com.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.520
I recommend subscribing,

01:03.520 --> 01:06.120
even if you disagree with his views.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.800
It is always good to explore diversity of perspectives.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.920
Most recently, he interviewed the president

01:11.920 --> 01:13.760
of Russia, Vladimir Putin.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.720
We discussed this, the topic of Russia, Putin, Navalny

01:16.720 --> 01:20.480
and the war in Ukraine at length in this conversation.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.200
Please allow me to say a few words

01:22.200 --> 01:25.120
about the very fact that I did this interview.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.140
I've received a lot of criticism publicly and privately

01:29.140 --> 01:32.080
when I announced that I will be talking with Tucker.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.240
For people who think

01:33.240 --> 01:35.360
I shouldn't do the conversation with Tucker

01:35.360 --> 01:37.820
or generally think that there are certain people

01:37.820 --> 01:41.600
I should never talk to, I'm sorry, but I disagree.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.680
I will talk to everyone

01:43.680 --> 01:46.680
as long as they're willing to talk genuinely in long form

01:46.680 --> 01:49.320
for two, three, four more hours.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.520
I will talk to Putin and to Zelensky,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.400
to Trump and to Biden,

01:53.520 --> 01:57.960
to Tucker and to John Stewart, AOC, Obama

01:57.960 --> 02:01.380
and many more people with very different views on the world.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.940
I want to understand people and ideas.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.440
That's what long form conversations

02:06.440 --> 02:08.640
are supposed to be all about.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.700
Now, for people who criticize me

02:10.700 --> 02:13.640
for not asking tough questions, I hear you.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.560
But again, I disagree.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.960
I do often ask tough questions,

02:17.960 --> 02:19.120
but I try to do it in a way

02:19.120 --> 02:21.160
that doesn't shut down the other person,

02:21.160 --> 02:23.560
putting them into a defensive state

02:23.560 --> 02:26.200
where they give only shallow talking points.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.800
Instead, I'm looking always for the expression

02:28.800 --> 02:31.080
of genuinely held ideas

02:31.080 --> 02:33.240
and the deep roots of those ideas.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.080
When done well, this gives us a chance

02:35.080 --> 02:36.920
to really hear out the guests

02:36.920 --> 02:40.320
and to begin to understand what and how they think.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.080
And I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.560
to make up your mind, to see through the bullshit

02:46.560 --> 02:48.360
to the degree there's bullshit

02:48.360 --> 02:51.120
and to see to the heart of the person.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.960
Sometimes I fail at this,

02:52.960 --> 02:56.600
but I'll continue working my ass off to improve.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.160
All that said, I find that this no tough questions criticism

03:01.160 --> 03:02.880
often happens when the guest is a person

03:02.880 --> 03:05.080
the listener simply hates

03:05.080 --> 03:07.400
and wants to see them grilled into embarrassment,

03:07.400 --> 03:11.480
called a liar, a greedy egomaniac, a killer,

03:11.480 --> 03:15.440
maybe even an evil human being, and so on.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.440
If you are such a listener,

03:17.440 --> 03:21.080
what you want is drama, not wisdom.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.760
In this case, this show is not for you.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.080
There are many shows you can go to for that,

03:26.080 --> 03:28.280
with hosts that are way more charismatic

03:28.280 --> 03:30.560
and entertaining than I'll ever be.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.120
If you do stick around, please know,

03:34.120 --> 03:38.680
I will work hard to do this well and to keep improving.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.200
Thank you for your patience

03:40.200 --> 03:41.960
and thank you for your support.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.800
I love you all.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.040
This is Alex Fridman podcast.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.080

03:49.080 --> 03:52.560
And now, dear friends, here's Tucker Carlson.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.640
What was your first impression

03:54.640 --> 03:58.040
when you met Vladimir Putin for the interview?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.400
I thought he seemed nervous

04:00.680 --> 04:04.360
and I was very surprised by that.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.120
And I thought he seemed like someone

04:07.120 --> 04:09.880
who'd overthought it a little bit, who had a plan.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.880
And I don't think that's the right way

04:10.880 --> 04:12.360
to go into any interview.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.720
My strong sense, having done a lot of them for a long time,

04:14.720 --> 04:17.960
is that it's better to know what you think,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.720
to say as much as you can, honestly,

04:21.720 --> 04:24.560
so you don't get confused by your own lies,

04:24.560 --> 04:26.440
and just to be yourself.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.680
And I thought that he went into it

04:29.840 --> 04:32.520
like an over-prepared student.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.160
And I kept thinking, why is he nervous?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.160
But, you know, I guess because he thought

04:38.160 --> 04:39.640
a lot of people were gonna see it.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.880
But he was also probably prepared

04:41.880 --> 04:46.520
to give you a full lesson in history, as he did.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.320
Well, I was totally shocked by that and very annoyed

04:50.320 --> 04:52.560
because I thought he was filibustering.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.600
I thought he would, I mean, I asked him, as I usually do,

04:55.600 --> 04:58.240
the most obvious, dumbest question ever,

04:58.240 --> 05:00.680
which is, you know, why did you do this?

05:00.680 --> 05:04.960
And he had said in a speech that I think is worth reading,

05:04.960 --> 05:07.280
I don't speak Russian, so I haven't heard it in the original,

05:07.280 --> 05:12.280
but he had said at the moment of the beginning of the war,

05:12.520 --> 05:15.760
he had given this address to Russians

05:15.760 --> 05:18.800
in which he explained, to the fullest extent

05:18.800 --> 05:21.760
we have seen so far, why he was doing this.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.120
And he said in that speech, I fear that NATO, the West,

05:26.120 --> 05:27.680
the United States, the Biden administration

05:27.680 --> 05:30.680
will preemptively attack us.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.960
And I thought, well, that's interesting.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.920
I mean, I can't evaluate whether that's a fear rooted

05:34.920 --> 05:36.960
in reality or one rooted in paranoia,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.840
but I thought, well, that's an answer right there.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.880
And so I alluded to that in my question,

05:41.880 --> 05:45.000
and rather than answering it, he went off on this long,

05:45.040 --> 05:50.040
from my perspective, kind of tiresome sort of greatest hits

05:50.800 --> 05:53.920
of Russian history and the implication I thought was,

05:53.920 --> 05:57.160
well, Ukraine is ours or Eastern Ukraine is ours already.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.760
And I thought he was doing that

05:59.760 --> 06:00.880
to avoid answering the question.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.520
So, you know, the last thing you want

06:02.520 --> 06:04.920
when you're interviewing someone is to get rolled.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.040
And I didn't wanna be rolled,

06:07.040 --> 06:11.320
so I a couple of times interrupted him politely, I thought,

06:11.320 --> 06:12.400
but he wasn't having it.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.280
And then I thought, you know what?

06:14.280 --> 06:17.720
I'm not here to prove that I'm a great interviewer.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.160
It's kind of not about me.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.640
I wanna know who this guy is.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.000
I think a Western audience, a global audience,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.760
has a right to know more about the guy.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.680
And so just let him talk, you know,

06:27.680 --> 06:28.880
cause it's not, you know,

06:28.880 --> 06:31.800
I don't feel like my reputation's on the line.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.440
People have already drawn conclusions about me,

06:34.440 --> 06:36.040
I suppose, to the extent they have.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.600
I'm not interested really in those conclusions anyway.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.960
So just let him talk.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.640
And so I calmed down and just let him talk.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.800
And in retrospect, I thought that was really,

06:43.800 --> 06:45.040
really interesting.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.240
You know, whether you agree with it or not,

06:46.240 --> 06:47.320
or whether you think it's relevant

06:47.320 --> 06:50.880
to the war in Ukraine or not, that was his answer.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.920
And so it's inherently significant.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.120
Well, you said he was nervous.

06:54.120 --> 06:54.960
Were you nervous?

06:54.960 --> 06:56.040
Were you afraid?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.640
This is Vladimir Putin.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.320
I wasn't afraid at all.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.120
And I wasn't nervous at all.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.680
Did you drink tea beforehand?

07:02.680 --> 07:06.880
No, I did my normal regimen

07:06.880 --> 07:10.360
of nicotine pouches and coffee.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.600
No, I'm not a tea drinker.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.200
I tried not to eat, you know,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.920
all the sweets they put in front of us,

07:14.920 --> 07:17.480
which is, that is my weakness, is eating crap.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.040
But you eat a lot of sugar, as you know,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.960
before an interview, and it does dull you.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.840
So I successfully resisted that.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.760
But no, I wasn't nervous.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.840
I wasn't nervous the whole time I was there.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.680
Why would I be?

07:27.560 --> 07:28.720
You know, I'm 54.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.640
My kids are grown.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.640
I believe in God.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.520
You know, I'm almost never nervous.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.240
But no, I wasn't nervous.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.200
I was just interested.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
I mean, I couldn't, you know,

07:36.400 --> 07:37.560
I'm interested in Soviet history.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.480
I studied it in college.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.760
I've read about it my entire life.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.560
My dad, you know, worked in the Cold War.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.840
It was a constant topic of conversation.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.520
And so to be in the Kremlin in a room

07:45.520 --> 07:48.000
where Stalin made decisions, either wartime decisions

07:48.000 --> 07:50.640
or decisions about murdering his own population,

07:50.640 --> 07:52.120
I just, I just couldn't get over it.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.000
You know, we were in Molotov's old office.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.680
So for me, that was, I was just blown away by that.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.040
I knew, I thought I knew a lot about Russia.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.240
It turns out I knew a lot about the Soviet period,

08:04.240 --> 08:06.880
you know, the 1937 purge trials, the famine in Ukraine.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.600
Like I knew a fair amount about that,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.040
but I really knew nothing about contemporary Russia

08:11.040 --> 08:12.920
less than I thought I did, it turned out.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.720
And, but yeah, I was just,

08:15.720 --> 08:17.800
I was just blown away by where we were.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.200
And that's kind of one of the main drivers

08:20.200 --> 08:23.600
at this stage in my life of, you know,

08:23.600 --> 08:24.760
that's why I do what I do is

08:24.760 --> 08:25.920
because I'm interested in stuff

08:25.920 --> 08:28.040
and I want to see as much as I can

08:28.040 --> 08:31.560
and try and draw conclusions from it to the extent I can.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.880
So I was very much caught up in that,

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
but no, I wasn't nervous.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.720
I didn't think he was going to like kill me or something.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.680
And I'm not particularly afraid of that anyway.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.880
Not afraid of dying.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.720
Not really, no.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.720
I mean, again, it's an age and stage in life thing.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.480
I mean, I have four children.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.240
So there were times when they were little

08:51.240 --> 08:52.400
where I was terrified of dying.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.240
Cause if I died, it would have huge consequences.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.760
But no, I mean, at this point, I don't want to die.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.880
I'm really enjoying my life,

08:59.880 --> 09:03.640
but I've been with the same girl for 40 years

09:03.640 --> 09:06.440
and I have four children who I'm extremely close to,

09:06.480 --> 09:09.200
well, now five, a daughter-in-law.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.040
And I love them all.

09:10.040 --> 09:10.880
I'm really close to them.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.880
I tell them I love them every day.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.120
I've had a really interesting life.

09:16.120 --> 09:16.960
What was the goal?

09:16.960 --> 09:17.800
Just linger on that.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.000
What was the goal for the interview?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.120
Like, how were you thinking about it?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.720
What would success be like in your head leading into it?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.040
To bring more information.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.000
Disinformation. To the public.

09:25.000 --> 09:25.880
Yeah, that's it.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.040
I mean, I have really strong feelings

09:28.040 --> 09:33.040
about what's happening, not just in Ukraine or Russia,

09:33.880 --> 09:34.760
but around the world.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.160
I think the world is resetting

09:36.160 --> 09:38.720
to the grave disadvantage of the United States.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.960
I don't think most Americans are aware of that at all.

09:41.960 --> 09:46.120
And so that's my view and I've stated it many times

09:46.120 --> 09:47.840
because it's sincere.

09:47.840 --> 09:52.840
But my goal was to have more information brought

09:55.120 --> 09:57.880
to the West so people could make their own decisions

09:57.880 --> 09:59.200
about whether this is a good idea.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.800
I mean, I just, I guess I reject the whole premise

10:01.800 --> 10:04.000
of the war in Ukraine from the American perspective,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.440
which is, you know, a tiny group of dumb people

10:06.440 --> 10:08.040
in Washington has decided to do this

10:08.040 --> 10:10.520
for reasons they won't really explain.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.320
And you don't have a role in it at all

10:13.320 --> 10:16.040
as an American citizen, as the person who's paying for it,

10:16.040 --> 10:18.520
whose children might be drafted to fight it.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.640
You know, just shut up and obey.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.440
I just reject that completely.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.360
You know, I think, I guess I'm a child of a different era.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.480
I'm a child of participatory democracy, to some extent,

10:27.480 --> 10:30.200
where your opinion as a citizen is not irrelevant.

10:31.080 --> 10:36.080
And so I'm just, and I guess the level of lying about it

10:37.040 --> 10:38.400
was starting to drive me crazy.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.800
And I've said, and I will say again,

10:39.800 --> 10:42.520
I am not an expert on the region or really any region

10:42.520 --> 10:44.480
other than say Western Maine.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.800
I just don't, you know, I'm not Russian.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.800
And, but it was obvious to me that we were being lied to

10:52.120 --> 10:55.000
in ways that were just, it was crazy, the scale of lies.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.680
And I'll just give you one example.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.560
The idea that Ukraine would inevitably win this war.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.680
Now, victory was never, as it never is, defined precisely.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.120
Nothing's ever defined precisely,

11:06.120 --> 11:07.600
which is always to tell that there's deception

11:07.600 --> 11:08.920
at the heart of the claim.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.440
But Ukraine's on the verge of winning.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.320
Well, I don't know.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.920
I mean, I'm hardly a tactician or a military expert

11:14.920 --> 11:15.760
for the fifth time.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.680
I'm not an expert on Russia or Ukraine.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.120
I just look at Wikipedia.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.600
Russia has a hundred million more people than Ukraine,

11:21.600 --> 11:22.640
a hundred million.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.000
It has much deeper industrial capacity,

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
war material capacity than all of NATO combined.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.440
For example, Russia is turning out artillery shells,

11:34.440 --> 11:37.720
which are significant in a ground war,

11:37.720 --> 11:39.720
at a ratio of seven to one,

11:39.720 --> 11:43.240
compared to all NATO countries combined.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.000
That's all of Europe.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.640
Russia is producing seven times the artillery shells

11:49.640 --> 11:51.640
as all of Europe combined.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.480
What?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.720
That's an amazing fact.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.520
And it turns out to be a really significant fact.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.360
In fact, the significant fact.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.600
But if you ask your average person in this country,

11:59.600 --> 12:02.000
even a fairly well-informed person of good faith

12:02.000 --> 12:03.840
who's just trying to understand what's going on,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.400
who's gonna win this war?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.240
Well, Ukraine's gonna win.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.760
They're on the right side.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.960
And they think that because our media,

12:09.960 --> 12:11.160
who really just do serve the interest

12:11.160 --> 12:12.840
of the US government, period,

12:12.840 --> 12:14.720
they are state media in that sense,

12:14.720 --> 12:17.120
have told them that for over two years.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.240
And I was in Hungary last summer

12:19.640 --> 12:21.560
talking to the prime minister, Viktor Orban,

12:21.560 --> 12:22.400
who's a, you know, whatever you think of him,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.280
he's a very smart guy, very smart guy,

12:25.280 --> 12:27.480
like smart on a scale that we're not used to

12:27.480 --> 12:28.960
in our leaders.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.760
And I said to him off camera,

12:30.760 --> 12:32.080
so is Ukraine gonna win?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.280
And he looked at me like I was deranged,

12:34.280 --> 12:38.280
like I was congenitally deficient.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.600
Are they gonna win?

12:39.600 --> 12:40.680
No, of course they can't win.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.840
It's tiny compared to Russia.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.800
Russia has a wartime economy.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.960
Ukraine doesn't really have an economy.

12:46.960 --> 12:47.800
No, look at the population.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.920
No, look at the populations.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.200
He was like, look at me like I was stupid.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.040
And I said to him, you know,

12:53.040 --> 12:54.280
I think most Americans believe that

12:54.280 --> 12:57.280
because NBC News and CNN and all the news channels,

12:57.280 --> 12:58.920
all of them, tell them that

12:58.920 --> 13:00.840
because it's framed exclusively in moral terms

13:00.840 --> 13:02.600
and it's Churchill versus Hitler.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.080
And of course Churchill's gonna prevail in the end.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.400
And it's just so dishonest that even,

13:07.400 --> 13:09.320
it doesn't even matter what I want to happen

13:09.320 --> 13:11.000
or what I think ought to happen.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.320
That's a distortion of what is happening.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.600
And if I have any job at all,

13:14.600 --> 13:16.360
which I sort of don't actually at this point,

13:16.360 --> 13:19.120
but if I do have a job, it's to just try to be honest.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.400
And that's a lie.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.320
There is a more nuanced discussion

13:22.320 --> 13:24.200
about what winning might look like.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.160
You're right. For sure.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.920
A nuanced discussion is not being had,

13:26.920 --> 13:30.040
but it is possible for Ukraine to quote unquote win

13:30.040 --> 13:31.560
with the help of United States.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.720
I guess that conversation needs to begin

13:33.720 --> 13:35.440
by defining terms.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.240
And the key term is win.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
What does that mean?

13:39.240 --> 13:43.280
Peace, a ceasefire, who owns which land.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.120
Yes.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.960
And that leads me to the table with,

13:45.960 --> 13:48.520
as you call the parent, the United States.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.360
Yes.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.760
Putting leverage on the negotiation

13:51.760 --> 13:53.760
to make sure there's a fairness.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.600
Amen.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.240
Well, of course as a, and I should just restate this.

13:58.240 --> 14:02.360
I am not emotionally involved in this.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.200
I'm American in every sense.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.360
And my only interest is in America.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.760
I'm not leaving ever.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.880
And so I'm looking at this purely from our perspective.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.280
What's good for us?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.880
But also as a human being, as a Christian,

14:14.880 --> 14:16.520
I mean, I hate war.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.600
And anybody who doesn't hate war

14:19.560 --> 14:21.160
shouldn't have power in my opinion.

14:21.160 --> 14:26.080
So I agree with that definition vehemently.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.840
A victory is like not killing an entire generation

14:30.840 --> 14:32.560
of your population.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.720
It's not being completely destroyed

14:34.720 --> 14:36.160
to be eaten up by Black Rock

14:36.160 --> 14:37.320
or whatever comes next for them.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.720
So yeah, we were close to that a year and a half ago.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.120
And the Biden administration dispatched Boris Johnson,

14:44.120 --> 14:47.840
the briefly Prime Minister of the UK to stop it

14:47.840 --> 14:50.800
and to say to Zelensky, who I feel sorry for by the way,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.200
because he's caught between these forces

14:52.200 --> 14:54.000
that are bigger than he is,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.320
to say, no, you cannot come to any terms with Russia.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.680
And the result of that has not been a Ukrainian victory.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.320
It's just been more dead Ukrainians

15:02.320 --> 15:04.120
and a lot of profit for the West.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.480
It's a moral crime in my opinion.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.040
And I tried to ask Boris Johnson about it

15:09.040 --> 15:10.680
because why wouldn't I?

15:11.640 --> 15:14.240
After he denounced me as a tool of the Kremlin or something.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.160
And he demanded a million dollars to talk to me.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.880
And this just happened last week.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.120
And by the way, in writing too, I'm not making this up.

15:23.120 --> 15:23.960
I'm not making this up.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.280
Just for the record, you demanded a million dollars

15:25.280 --> 15:29.200
from me to talk to me today and you paid.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.520
No, I'm of course kidding, but.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.240
And I said to his guy, I said, I just interviewed Putin

15:35.240 --> 15:38.240
who was widely recognized as a bad guy

15:38.240 --> 15:39.280
and he did it for free.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.600
He didn't demand a million dollars.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.360
He wasn't in this for profit.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.200
Like, are you telling me that Boris Johnson

15:43.200 --> 15:44.520
is sleazier than Vladimir Putin?

15:44.520 --> 15:46.760
And of course that is the message.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.800
And so I guess these are really,

15:49.800 --> 15:53.480
it's not just about Boris Johnson being a sad,

15:53.480 --> 15:55.520
rapacious fraud, which he is obviously,

15:55.520 --> 15:59.720
but it's about like the future of the West

15:59.720 --> 16:01.040
and the future of Ukraine.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.360
This country that purportedly we care so much about always.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.720
People are dying and like, what is the end game?

16:05.720 --> 16:09.440
It's also deranged that I didn't imagine

16:09.440 --> 16:11.440
and don't imagine that I could like add anything

16:11.440 --> 16:13.840
very meaningful to the conversation

16:13.840 --> 16:15.520
because I'm not a genius, okay?

16:15.520 --> 16:18.720
But I felt like I could at the very least

16:19.640 --> 16:23.040
puncture some of the lies and that's an inherent good.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.760
Vladimir Putin, after the interview,

16:24.760 --> 16:26.600
said that he wasn't fully satisfied

16:26.600 --> 16:28.320
because you weren't aggressive enough.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.840
You didn't ask sharp enough questions.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.200
First of all, what do you think about him saying that?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.600
I don't even understand it.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.160
I guess it does seem like the one Putin statement

16:40.160 --> 16:42.280
that Western media take at face value.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.960
Everything else Putin says is a lie

16:43.960 --> 16:46.000
except his criticism of me, which is true.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.440
But I mean, I have no idea what he meant by that.

16:48.440 --> 16:53.040
I can only tell you what my goal was as I've suggested

16:53.040 --> 16:54.920
was not to make it about me.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.120
I watched, you know, he hasn't done any interviews

16:57.120 --> 16:59.640
of any kind for years,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.160
but the last interview he did

17:01.160 --> 17:03.120
with an English speaking reporter,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.360
Western media reporter,

17:05.360 --> 17:07.360
was like many of the other interviews

17:07.360 --> 17:09.160
he'd done with Western media reporters.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.920
Mike Wallace's son did an interview with him

17:11.920 --> 17:14.920
that was of the same variety and it was all about him.

17:14.920 --> 17:18.080
You know, I'm a good person, you're a bad person.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.320
And I just feel like

17:19.320 --> 17:21.880
that's the most tiresome fruitless kind of interview.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.320
It's not about me.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.720
I don't think I'm an especially good person.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.400
I've definitely never claimed to be,

17:26.400 --> 17:27.680
but people can make their own judgments.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.360
And again, the only judgments that I care about

17:29.360 --> 17:30.720
are my wife and children and God.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.480
So I'm just not interested in proving I'm a good person.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.560
And I just want to hear from him.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.120
And I had a lot of, I mean, you should see,

17:40.120 --> 17:41.520
I almost never write questions down,

17:41.520 --> 17:43.720
but I did in this case because I had months,

17:43.720 --> 17:45.080
well, I had three years to think about it

17:45.080 --> 17:48.680
as I was trying to book the interview, which I did myself.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.800
But they were all,

17:50.800 --> 17:54.440
it was all about internal Russian politics and Navalny.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.040
And I had a lot of, I thought, really good questions.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.120
And then at the last second,

17:59.120 --> 18:00.640
and you make these decisions, as you know,

18:00.640 --> 18:02.560
since you interview people a lot,

18:02.560 --> 18:04.120
often you make them on the fly.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.280
And I thought, no, I want to talk about

18:06.280 --> 18:07.800
the things that haven't been talked about

18:07.800 --> 18:10.480
and that I think matter in a world historic sense.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.440
And the number one among those, of course, is the war

18:13.440 --> 18:15.560
and what it means for the world.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.400
And so I stuck to that.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.440
I mean, I could answer.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.840
I did ask about Gershkovich, who I felt sorry for.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.160
And I wanted Putin to release him to me

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
and I was offended that he didn't.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.840
I thought his rationale was absurd.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.360
Well, we want to trade him for someone.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.320
I said, well, doesn't that make him a hostage?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.240
Which of course it does.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.320
But other than that, I really wanted to keep it

18:37.320 --> 18:40.040
to the things that I think matter most.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.680
People can judge whether I did a good job or not,

18:41.680 --> 18:44.560
but that was my decision.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.280
In the moment, what was your gut?

18:46.280 --> 18:50.600
Did you want to ask some tough questions as follow-ups

18:50.600 --> 18:52.040
on certain topics?

18:52.040 --> 18:54.320
I don't know what it would mean to ask a tough question.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.560
Clarifying questions, I suppose they would.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.120
I guess I just wanted him to talk.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.960
I just wanted to hear his perspective.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.640
Again, I've probably asked more asshole questions

19:05.640 --> 19:07.760
than like any living American.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.120
I'm, as has been noted correctly, I'm a dick by my nature.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.240
And so I don't, I just feel at this stage of my life,

19:16.240 --> 19:17.680
I didn't need to prove that I could be like,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.240
Vladimir Putin answered the question!

19:19.240 --> 19:20.080
Sure, for sure.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.120
I think if I had been 34 instead of 54,

19:25.120 --> 19:26.320
I definitely would have done that

19:26.320 --> 19:27.960
because I would have thought this is really about me

19:27.960 --> 19:29.400
and I need to prove myself.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.000
No, I just, there's a war going on

19:32.000 --> 19:35.880
that is wrecking the U.S. economy in a way

19:35.880 --> 19:37.640
and at a scale people do not understand.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
The U.S. dollar is going away.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.640
That was of course inevitable ultimately

19:41.640 --> 19:43.720
because everything dies, including currencies,

19:43.720 --> 19:47.320
but that death, that process of death

19:47.320 --> 19:50.040
has been accelerated exponentially by the behavior

19:50.040 --> 19:51.680
of the Biden administration and the U.S. Congress,

19:51.680 --> 19:53.680
particularly the sanctions.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.880
And people don't understand what the ramifications of that are.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.840
The ramifications are poverty in the United States, okay?

19:58.840 --> 20:02.720
So I just wanted to get to that

20:02.720 --> 20:05.480
because I'm coming at this from not a global perspective,

20:05.480 --> 20:08.040
I'm coming at it from an American perspective.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.400
So you mentioned Navalny.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.680
After you left, Navalny died in prison.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.520
Yes.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.200
What are your thoughts on,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.000
just at a high level first about his death?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.040
Well, it's awful.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.560
I mean, imagine dying in prison.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.960
You know, I've thought about it a lot.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.840
I've known a lot of people in prison, a lot,

20:26.840 --> 20:29.120
including some very good friends of mine.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.200
So I felt instantly sad about it.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.480
From a geopolitical perspective,

20:34.480 --> 20:35.960
I don't know any more than that.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.880
And I laugh at and sort of resent,

20:39.880 --> 20:43.560
but mostly find amusing the claims by American politicians

20:43.560 --> 20:45.840
who really are the dumbest politicians in the world,

20:45.840 --> 20:48.320
actually, you know, this happened

20:48.320 --> 20:49.400
and here's what it means.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.280
And it's like, actually as a factual matter,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.720
we don't know what happened.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.600
We don't know what happened.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.640
We have no freaking idea what happened.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.680
We can say, and I did say, and I will say again,

20:58.680 --> 21:01.000
I don't think you should put opposition figures

21:01.000 --> 21:02.160
in prison, I really don't.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.680
I don't, period.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.000
It happens a lot around the world,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.600
happens in this country, as you know,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.560
and I'm against all of it.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.840
But do we know how he died?

21:11.840 --> 21:14.000
Short answer, no, we don't.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.600
Now, if I had to guess, I would say killing Navalny

21:18.600 --> 21:21.280
during the Munich Security Conference

21:21.280 --> 21:23.880
in the middle of a debate over $60 billion

21:23.880 --> 21:24.840
in Ukraine funding.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.080
Maybe the Russians are dumb.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.120
I didn't get that vibe at all.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.000
You know, I just don't, I don't see it,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.920
but maybe, you know, maybe they killed him.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.240
I mean, they certainly put him in prison,

21:34.240 --> 21:37.320
which I'm against, but here's what I do know

21:37.320 --> 21:38.960
is that we don't know.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.840
And so when Chuck Schumer stands up and,

21:42.400 --> 21:44.520
Joe Biden reads some card in front of him

21:44.520 --> 21:46.000
with lines about Navalny, it's like,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.200
I'm allowed to laugh at that because it's absurd.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.040
You don't know.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.480
There's a lot of interesting ideas about

21:51.480 --> 21:53.520
if he was killed, who killed him,

21:53.520 --> 21:56.480
because it could be Putin.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.360
It could be somebody in Russia who was not Putin.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.720
It could be Ukrainians, because it would benefit the war.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.000
They killed Dugan's daughter in Moscow.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.840
So yeah, it's possible.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.240
And it could be, I mean, the United States

22:09.240 --> 22:10.640
could also be involved.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.440
I don't think we kill people in other countries

22:12.440 --> 22:14.080
to affect election outcomes.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.080
Oh, wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years

22:18.080 --> 22:18.920
and it's shameful.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.640
I can say that as an American

22:20.640 --> 22:21.880
because it's my money in my name.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.880
Yeah, I'm really offended by that.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.280
And I never thought that was true.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.360
And I spent, again, I'm much older than you.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.920
And so I spent my worldview was defined by the Cold War

22:33.320 --> 22:35.240
and very much in the house I lived in,

22:35.240 --> 22:36.840
in Georgetown, in Washington, DC.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.880
That's what we talked about.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.280
And yeah, and the left at the time,

22:41.720 --> 22:44.520
I don't know, the wacko MIT professor

22:44.520 --> 22:46.120
who I never had any respect for,

22:46.120 --> 22:48.440
who I know you've interviewed, et cetera.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.160
Like the hard left was always saying,

22:50.160 --> 22:52.440
well, the United States government is interfering

22:52.440 --> 22:53.280
in other elections.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.640
And I just dismissed that completely out of hand

22:56.760 --> 22:59.520
as stupid and actually a slander against my country.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.920
But it turned out to all be true

23:00.920 --> 23:02.920
or substantially true anyway.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.240
And that's been a real shock for me

23:04.240 --> 23:05.840
in middle age to understand that.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.160
But anyway, as to Navalny, look, I don't know.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.720
But we should always proceed on the basis

23:13.720 --> 23:15.320
of what we do know, which is to say

23:15.320 --> 23:17.960
on the basis of truth, knowable truth.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.080
And if you have an entire policy making apparatus

23:21.080 --> 23:23.120
that is making the biggest decisions

23:23.120 --> 23:24.360
on the face of the planet,

23:24.360 --> 23:27.520
on the basis of things that are bullshit or lies,

23:27.520 --> 23:31.400
you're gonna get bad outcomes every time, every time.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.920
And that's why we are where we are.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.160
Does it bother you that basically

23:36.160 --> 23:39.080
the most famous opposition figure in Russia

23:39.080 --> 23:40.840
is sitting in prison?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.320
Well, of course it does.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.560
Of course it bothers me.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.880
I mean, it bothered me when I got there.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.700
It bothers me now.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.240
I was sad when he died.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.520
Yeah, I mean, that's one of the measures of,

23:50.520 --> 23:53.280
it's one of the basic measures of political freedom.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.240
Are you imprisoning people who oppose you?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.560
You know, are you imprisoning people

23:58.560 --> 23:59.960
who pose a physical risk to you?

23:59.960 --> 24:04.720
I mean, there's some subjective decision making involved

24:04.720 --> 24:06.320
in these things.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.240
However, big picture, yeah.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.320
Do you have opposition leaders in jail?

24:11.320 --> 24:14.500
It's not a free, it's not a politically free society

24:14.500 --> 24:16.220
and Russia isn't, obviously.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.400
And as I said, a friend of mine from childhood,

24:19.400 --> 24:21.760
an American actually, he was a wonderful person,

24:21.760 --> 24:23.040
lives in Russia with his Russian,

24:23.040 --> 24:24.920
Moscow with his Russian wife.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.200
And I had dinner with him.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.360
He's a very balanced guy, totally non-political person

24:29.360 --> 24:33.880
and speaks Russian and loves his many Russian children

24:33.880 --> 24:34.960
and loves the culture.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.080
And there's a lot to love.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.160
The culture that produced Tolstoy, you know,

24:38.160 --> 24:40.440
it's not a gas station with nuclear weapons, sorry.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.880
Only a moron would say that.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.380
It's a very deep culture.

24:43.380 --> 24:45.960
I don't fully understand it, of course, but I admire it.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.300
Who wouldn't?

24:47.300 --> 24:48.720
But I asked him, like, what's it like living here?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.080
And he goes, you know, it's great.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.920
Moscow is a great city, indisputably.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.760
He said, you don't wanna get involved

24:53.760 --> 24:54.600
in Russian politics.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.140
And I said, what?

24:57.160 --> 24:58.320
He said, well, you could get hurt.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.120
You could wind up like Navalny if you did.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.960
But also it's just too complicated.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.160
You know, the Russian mind is not exactly the same.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.280
It's a Western, it's a European city,

25:08.280 --> 25:09.780
but it's not quite European.

25:09.780 --> 25:14.160
And the way they think is very, very complex, very complex.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.440
It's too complicated, just don't get involved.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.280
And I would just say two things.

25:19.280 --> 25:24.280
One, I'm not sure, I mean, I don't know,

25:24.840 --> 25:28.200
but my strong sense is that Navalny's death,

25:28.200 --> 25:29.720
whoever did it, probably didn't have a lot to do

25:29.720 --> 25:32.880
with the coming election in Russia.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.080
My sense from talking to Putin and the people around him

25:35.080 --> 25:36.780
is they're not really focused on that.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.020
I mean, in fact, I asked one of his top advisors

25:39.020 --> 25:40.440
when's the election, and she looked at me

25:40.440 --> 25:41.280
completely confused.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.720
She didn't know the date of the election, okay?

25:44.240 --> 25:45.400
She's like, a March?

25:45.400 --> 25:46.840
Okay.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.360
And I asked a bunch of other people just in Moscow,

25:49.360 --> 25:52.760
who's Putin running against, like nobody knew.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.480
So it's not a real election, right?

25:55.480 --> 25:58.040
In the sense that we would recognize at all.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.840
Second, I was really struck by so many things in Moscow

26:02.840 --> 26:05.640
and really bothered by, deeply bothered by a lot of things

26:05.640 --> 26:06.540
that I saw there.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.420
But one thing I noticed was the total absence

26:11.420 --> 26:13.480
of cult of personality propaganda,

26:14.120 --> 26:16.360
which I expected to see, and have seen around the world.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.840
Jordan, for example, I don't know if you've been to Jordan,

26:18.840 --> 26:20.520
but go to Jordan and every building,

26:20.520 --> 26:22.480
there are pictures of the king and his extended family,

26:22.480 --> 26:25.000
and that's a sign of political insecurity.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.360
You don't create a cult of personality

26:27.360 --> 26:28.680
unless you're personally insecure,

26:28.680 --> 26:30.840
and also unless you're worried about losing your grip

26:30.840 --> 26:33.140
on power, none of that.

26:33.140 --> 26:35.440
It's interesting, and I expected to see a lot of it,

26:35.440 --> 26:37.280
like statues of Putin.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.960
Yeah, there are no statues of anybody

26:38.960 --> 26:41.520
other than like Christian saints.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.960
So that was like, I'm not quite sure,

26:42.960 --> 26:44.400
I'm just reporting what I saw.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.240
So yes, it's not a, in a political sense,

26:49.240 --> 26:51.400
it's not a free country, it's not a democracy

26:52.760 --> 26:54.320
in the way that we would understand it,

26:54.320 --> 26:56.080
or I don't wanna live there, okay?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.440
Because I like to say what I think.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.240
In fact, I make my living doing it.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.840
But it's not Stalinist in a recognizable way,

27:04.840 --> 27:08.140
and anyone who says it is should go there and tell me how.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.680
I mean, this question about the freedom of the press

27:11.680 --> 27:14.220
is underlying the very fact

27:14.220 --> 27:16.420
of the interview you're having with him.

27:16.420 --> 27:19.200
So you might not need to ask the Navalny question,

27:19.200 --> 27:22.740
but did you feel like, are there things I shouldn't say?

27:23.580 --> 27:25.600
I mean, how honest do you want me to be?

27:25.600 --> 27:30.300
I mean it when I say I felt not one twinge of concern

27:30.300 --> 27:32.660
for the eight days that I was there.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.460
Maybe I just didn't, and I feel like I've got

27:34.460 --> 27:37.820
a pretty strong gut sense of things.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.500
I rely on it, I make all my decisions

27:39.500 --> 27:42.560
based on how I feel, my instincts,

27:42.560 --> 27:44.020
and I didn't feel it at all.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.540
My lawyers before I left, and these are people

27:47.540 --> 27:49.780
who work for a big law firm, this is not Bob's law firm,

27:49.780 --> 27:51.540
this is one of the biggest law firms in the world,

27:51.540 --> 27:53.600
said, you're gonna get arrested if you do this

27:53.600 --> 27:56.000
by the US government on sanctions violations.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.260
And I said, well, I don't recognize the legitimacy

28:00.260 --> 28:02.300
of that actually, because I'm American,

28:02.300 --> 28:03.460
and I've lived here my whole life,

28:03.460 --> 28:07.740
and that's so outrageous that I'm happy to face that risk

28:08.620 --> 28:10.820
because I so reject the premise, okay,

28:10.820 --> 28:12.460
I'm an American, I should be able to talk to anyone

28:12.460 --> 28:14.580
I want to, and I plan to exercise that freedom,

28:14.580 --> 28:16.340
which I think I was born with.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.460
And I gave them this long lecture,

28:18.460 --> 28:20.140
they're like, we're just lawyers.

28:20.140 --> 28:24.600
But that was, let me put it this way,

28:24.600 --> 28:25.860
I don't know how much you dealt with lawyers,

28:25.860 --> 28:28.100
but it costs many thousands of dollars

28:28.100 --> 28:29.780
to get a conclusion like that.

28:29.780 --> 28:32.660
Like they sent a whole bunch of their summer associates

28:32.660 --> 28:34.380
or whatever, they sent, they put a lot of people

28:34.380 --> 28:36.620
on this question, checked a lot of precedent,

28:36.620 --> 28:39.060
and I think, and they sent me a 10 page memo on it,

28:39.060 --> 28:42.700
and their sincere conclusion was, do not do this.

28:43.620 --> 28:44.780
And of course it made me mad,

28:44.780 --> 28:46.180
so I was lecturing on the phone,

28:46.180 --> 28:47.660
and I had another call with the head lawyer,

28:47.660 --> 28:50.060
and he said, well, look, a lot will depend

28:50.060 --> 28:52.560
on the questions that you ask Putin.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.700
If you're seen as too nice to him,

28:54.700 --> 28:57.180
you could get arrested when you come back.

28:57.180 --> 29:00.060
And I was like, you're describing a fascist country, okay?

29:00.060 --> 29:02.240
You're saying that the US government will arrest me

29:02.240 --> 29:03.940
if I don't ask the questions they want asked?

29:03.940 --> 29:05.180
Is that what you're saying?

29:05.180 --> 29:06.620
Well, we just think based on what's happened

29:06.620 --> 29:08.300
that that's possible.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.580
And so I'm just telling you what happened.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.220
So you were okay being arrested in Moscow

29:14.220 --> 29:15.740
and arrested in Beijing.

29:15.740 --> 29:18.700
I didn't think for a second, I mean, maybe, look,

29:18.700 --> 29:21.400
I don't speak Russian, I'd never been there before.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.540
Everything about the culture was brand new to me.

29:25.540 --> 29:29.660
You know, ignorance does protect you sort of

29:29.660 --> 29:31.540
when you have no freaking idea what's going on,

29:31.540 --> 29:32.940
you're not worried about it.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.060
This has happened to me many times.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.380
There's a principle there that extends throughout life.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.900
So it's completely possible that I was in grave peril

29:39.900 --> 29:42.460
and didn't know it, because like, how would I know it?

29:42.460 --> 29:44.300
You know, I'm like a bumbling English speaker

29:44.300 --> 29:48.660
from California, but I didn't feel it at all.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.940
But the lawyers did.

29:49.940 --> 29:52.740
Yeah, I mean, it scared the crap out of people.

29:52.740 --> 29:55.780
You're gonna, look, and I, you have to pay in cash.

29:55.780 --> 29:57.460
They don't take credit cards because of sanctions.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.820
And you have to go through all these hoops,

29:58.820 --> 30:01.860
just procedural hoops to go to Russia,

30:01.860 --> 30:03.520
which I was willing to do because I wanted

30:03.560 --> 30:05.560
to interview Putin because they told me I couldn't.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.760
But then there's another fact,

30:07.760 --> 30:09.320
which is that I was being surveilled

30:09.320 --> 30:11.600
by the US government, intensely surveilled

30:11.600 --> 30:12.560
by the US government.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.080
And this came out, they admitted it,

30:14.080 --> 30:15.840
the NSA admitted it a couple of years ago

30:15.840 --> 30:17.720
that they were up in my Signal account.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.000
And then they leaked it to the New York Times.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.640
They did that again before I left.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.800
And I know that because two New York Times reporters,

30:23.800 --> 30:25.840
one of whom I actually like a lot,

30:28.540 --> 30:30.560
said, oh, you're going, and called other people,

30:30.560 --> 30:31.400
oh, he's going to interview Putin.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.400
I hadn't told anybody that, like anybody.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.400
Like my wife, two producers, that's it.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.800
So they got that from the government.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.020
Then I'm over there.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.680
And of course I want to see Snowden, who I admire.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.800
And so we have a mutual friend.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.940
So I got his text and come on over

30:46.940 --> 30:49.500
and Snowden does not want publicity at all.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.680
But I really wanted to have dinner with him.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.340
So we had dinner in my hotel room

30:55.340 --> 30:57.400
at the Four Seasons in Moscow.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.640
And I tried to convince him,

30:59.640 --> 31:02.520
I'd love to do an interview, shoot it on my iPhone.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.360
I'd love to take a picture together

31:05.360 --> 31:06.200
and put it on the internet

31:06.200 --> 31:08.040
because I just want to show support

31:08.040 --> 31:09.280
because I think he's been railroaded.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.280
He had no interest in living in Russia,

31:12.280 --> 31:14.040
no intention of being in Russia.

31:14.040 --> 31:14.880
The whole thing is a lie.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.480
But anyway, whatever, all this stuff.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.960
And he just said, respectfully,

31:17.960 --> 31:20.040
I'd rather not anyone know that we met.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.000
Great.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.120
The only reason I'm telling you this is because,

31:24.120 --> 31:27.520
and I didn't tell anybody and I didn't text it to anybody.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.060
Okay, except him.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.140
Semaphore, semaphore.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.120
Runs this piece saying,

31:37.120 --> 31:41.720
reporting information they got from the US intel agencies

31:41.720 --> 31:44.460
leaking against me using my money in my name

31:44.460 --> 31:46.640
in a supposedly free country.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.040
They run this piece saying I'd met with Snowden

31:49.040 --> 31:50.840
like it was a crime or something.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.880
So again, my interest is in the United States

31:53.880 --> 31:56.640
and preserving freedoms here, the ones that I grew up with.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.620
And if you have a media establishment

31:58.620 --> 32:01.200
that acts as an auxiliary of,

32:01.240 --> 32:04.280
or acts as employees of the national security state,

32:04.280 --> 32:05.840
you don't have a free country.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.160
And that's where we are.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.000
And I'm not guessing,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
because I spent my entire life in that world.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.040
33 years I worked in big news companies.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.040
And so I know how it works.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.840
I know the people involved in it.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.200
I could name them.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.800
Ben Smith of Semaphore, among many others.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.120
And I find that really objectionable,

32:22.120 --> 32:25.400
not just on principle either, in effect, in practice.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.840
You don't wanna live in that kind of country.

32:26.840 --> 32:27.960
And people are like,

32:27.960 --> 32:30.560
they externalize all of their anxiety about this,

32:30.560 --> 32:31.400
I have noticed.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.680
So it's like, Russia's not free.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.520
Yeah, I know.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.680
Neither is Burkina Faso.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.200
Most countries aren't free actually, but we are.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.440
Where the United States were different.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.680
And that's my concern.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.760
Preserving that is my concern.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.040
And so they get so exercised about what's happening

32:49.040 --> 32:50.160
in other parts of the world,

32:50.160 --> 32:52.720
places they've never been, know nothing about.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.600
It's almost a way of ignoring what's happening

32:54.600 --> 32:56.240
in their own country right around them.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.420
I find it so strange and sad and weird.

33:01.260 --> 33:03.020
So the NSA was tracking you?

33:03.020 --> 33:04.580
Do you think CIA was?

33:04.580 --> 33:06.380
Is people still tracking you?

33:06.380 --> 33:09.460
Look, one of the things I did before I went,

33:09.460 --> 33:12.060
just because of the business I'm in, all of us are in,

33:12.060 --> 33:13.140
and just because we live here,

33:13.140 --> 33:17.300
we all have theories about secure communications channels.

33:17.300 --> 33:20.820
Like Signal is secure, Telegraph isn't,

33:20.820 --> 33:22.860
or WhatsApp is owned by Mark Zuckerberg.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.460
You can't trust, okay.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.780
So I thought, before I go over here,

33:25.780 --> 33:26.980
I was getting all this,

33:27.980 --> 33:29.060
we're having all these conversations,

33:29.060 --> 33:30.980
my producers and I, about this.

33:30.980 --> 33:34.340
And I decide, I'm just gonna actually find out

33:34.340 --> 33:36.100
what's really going on.

33:36.100 --> 33:41.100
So I talked to two people who would know, trust me.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.740
And that's all I can say.

33:43.740 --> 33:44.580
And I hate to be like,

33:44.580 --> 33:46.180
oh, I talked to people who would know if I can too,

33:46.180 --> 33:49.420
but I mean it, they would know.

33:49.420 --> 33:50.700
And both of them said exactly the same thing,

33:50.700 --> 33:52.660
which is, are you joking?

33:52.660 --> 33:54.060
Nothing is secure.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.460
Everything is monitored all the time,

33:55.460 --> 33:57.460
if state actors are involved.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.860
I mean, you can keep the, whatever,

33:59.860 --> 34:03.380
the Malaysian mafia from reading your text, probably.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.980
You cannot keep the big intel services from reading your text.

34:05.980 --> 34:10.060
It's not possible, any of them, or listening to your calls.

34:10.060 --> 34:13.100
So, and that was the firm conclusion of people

34:13.100 --> 34:16.060
who've been involved in it for a long time, decades,

34:16.060 --> 34:16.940
both in both cases.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.700
So I just thought, you know what, I don't care.

34:19.700 --> 34:20.900
I don't care.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.500
I'm not sending a ton of naked pictures of myself

34:23.500 --> 34:24.660
to anybody.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.900
Not a ton, just a little.

34:25.900 --> 34:26.740
Not a ton.

34:26.740 --> 34:29.460
I'm 54, dude, probably not too many.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.300
All right.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.860
But, so I'm like, I'm just,

34:32.860 --> 34:36.620
so the guys, I travel with three people I work with

34:36.620 --> 34:38.500
who I love, who I've been around the world with

34:38.500 --> 34:40.580
for many years, and I know them really, really well.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.060
And they all got, you know, separate phones,

34:44.060 --> 34:45.980
and I'm leaving my other phone back in New York,

34:45.980 --> 34:50.380
or whatever, and I just decided I don't care, actually.

34:50.380 --> 34:54.420
And I resent having no privacy,

34:55.460 --> 34:57.660
because privacy is a prerequisite for freedom,

34:58.620 --> 34:59.700
but I can't change it,

34:59.700 --> 35:01.980
and so I have the same surveilled cell phone.

35:01.980 --> 35:06.540
And, you know, I do switch them out because, there it is,

35:06.540 --> 35:10.940
because if you have too much spyware on your phone,

35:10.940 --> 35:13.420
this is true, it wrecks the battery.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.900
And, no, I'm serious, it does.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.620
And we got, it was, I don't know,

35:19.620 --> 35:22.300
five or six years ago, we went to North Korea,

35:22.300 --> 35:25.780
and my phone started acting crazy,

35:25.780 --> 35:28.020
and so I talked to someone on the National Security Council

35:28.020 --> 35:30.260
who actually, who called me about this,

35:30.260 --> 35:33.020
somehow knew that your phone is being surveilled

35:33.020 --> 35:34.300
by the South Korean government.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.380
I was like, why the, I like the South Korean government,

35:36.380 --> 35:38.100
why would they do that?

35:38.100 --> 35:39.180
Because they want more information,

35:39.180 --> 35:41.740
they thought I was talking to Trump, or whatever.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.340
So, but I could tell, because all of a sudden,

35:44.340 --> 35:46.900
the thing would just drain in like 45 minutes.

35:46.900 --> 35:49.660
So that is, that's a downside.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.620
So you keep switching phones,

35:52.620 --> 35:54.420
getting new phones for the battery life.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.860
Yeah, I mean, I try not to do it, you know,

35:55.860 --> 35:59.380
I'm kind of flinty Yankee type in some ways,

35:59.380 --> 36:01.700
so I don't like to spend a thousand dollars

36:01.700 --> 36:04.300
with a freaking Apple corporation too often, but yeah, I do.

36:04.300 --> 36:07.020
I mean, you say it lightly, but it's really troublesome

36:07.020 --> 36:09.980
that you as a journalist would be tracked.

36:09.980 --> 36:11.660
Well, they leaked it to Semaphore,

36:11.660 --> 36:13.020
and they leaked it to the New York Times.

36:13.020 --> 36:15.780
Look, it's, I would even put up,

36:15.780 --> 36:16.620
well, there's nothing I can do,

36:16.620 --> 36:18.820
so I have to put up with everything, okay?

36:18.820 --> 36:22.580
But I would probably not be actively angry

36:22.580 --> 36:25.020
about being surveilled, because I'm just so old,

36:25.020 --> 36:27.140
and I actually do pay my taxes,

36:27.140 --> 36:29.620
I'm not sleeping with a makeup artist or whatever,

36:29.620 --> 36:31.260
so I don't care that much.

36:31.260 --> 36:34.140
The fact that they are leaking against me,

36:34.140 --> 36:36.500
that the intel services in the United States

36:36.500 --> 36:40.400
are actively engaged in US politics and media,

36:41.340 --> 36:44.980
that's so unacceptable, that makes democracy impossible.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.180
There's no defense of that,

36:46.740 --> 36:48.820
and yet NBC News, Ken Delaneyan,

36:48.820 --> 36:51.060
and the rest will defend it, and it's like,

36:51.060 --> 36:53.340
and not just on NBC News, by the way,

36:53.340 --> 36:55.300
on the supposedly conservative channels too,

36:55.300 --> 36:57.260
they will defend it, and there's no defending that.

36:57.260 --> 37:01.300
You can't have democracy if the intel services

37:01.300 --> 37:05.860
are tampering in elections and information, period.

37:05.860 --> 37:09.140
So you had no fear, you know, your lawyer said,

37:09.140 --> 37:11.220
be careful which questions you asked.

37:11.220 --> 37:13.020
You said, I don't have.

37:13.020 --> 37:16.020
Well, the lawyer said, no, he said very specifically,

37:16.780 --> 37:19.540
depending on the questions you ask, Putin,

37:21.900 --> 37:23.460
you could be arrested or not.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.300
And I said, listen to what you're saying.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.700
You're saying the US government has control

37:27.700 --> 37:29.100
over my questions, and they'll arrest me

37:29.100 --> 37:30.820
if I ask the wrong question?

37:30.820 --> 37:32.680
How are we better than Putin if that's true?

37:32.680 --> 37:34.100
And by the way, that's just what the lawyer said,

37:34.100 --> 37:36.780
but I can't overstate,

37:36.780 --> 37:38.140
one of the biggest law firms in the United States,

37:38.140 --> 37:39.940
Smart Lawyers, we've used for years,

37:39.940 --> 37:42.660
so I was really shocked by it.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.380
You said leaders kill, leaders lie.

37:45.420 --> 37:46.980
I don't believe in leaders very much.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.300
Like this whole like, oh, Zelensky's Jesus

37:49.300 --> 37:51.000
and Putin's Satan.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.740
It's like, no, they're all leaders of countries, okay?

37:53.740 --> 37:56.260
Like grow up a little bit, you child.

37:56.260 --> 37:57.980
Have you ever met a leader?

37:57.980 --> 38:01.340
Like all of the, first of all, anyone who seeks power

38:02.760 --> 38:04.540
is damaged morally, in my opinion.

38:04.540 --> 38:05.860
You shouldn't be seeking power.

38:05.860 --> 38:10.140
You can't seek power or wealth for its own sake

38:10.140 --> 38:11.460
and remain a decent person.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.880
That's just true.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.840
So there aren't any like really virtuous billionaires

38:15.840 --> 38:18.080
and there aren't any really virtuous world leaders.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.840
You have grades of virtue.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.360
Some are better than others for sure.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.280
But I mean, in other words,

38:25.280 --> 38:27.480
Zelensky may be better than Putin.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.600
I'm open to that possibility.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.600
But to claim that one is evil and the other is virtuous,

38:34.880 --> 38:37.160
it's like you're revealing that you're a child.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.600
You don't know anything about how the world actually is

38:40.600 --> 38:41.760
or what reality is.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.240
Like it's, it's, oh, it's.

38:43.240 --> 38:44.880
That's quite a realist perspective,

38:44.880 --> 38:46.220
but there is a spectrum.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.520
There's a spectrum, absolutely.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.920
I'm not saying they're all the same, they're not.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.720
And our task is to figure out where on the spectrum

38:51.720 --> 38:56.720
they lie and the leaders task is to confuse us

38:57.360 --> 38:59.200
and convince us they're one of the good guys.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.020
Of course.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.160
But I actually reject even that formulation.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.920
I don't think it's always about the leaders.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.920
I mean, of course, the leaders make the difference.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.960
A good leader has a healthy country

39:08.960 --> 39:11.120
and a bad leader has a decaying country,

39:11.120 --> 39:13.680
which is something to think about.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.760
But it's about the ideas and the policies

39:15.760 --> 39:17.520
and the practical effect of things.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.480
So we're very much caught up in the personalities

39:20.480 --> 39:23.840
of various leaders, not just our political leaders,

39:23.840 --> 39:26.180
but our business leaders, our cultural leaders.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.100
Are they good people?

39:27.100 --> 39:28.520
Do they have the right thoughts?

39:28.520 --> 39:31.200
It's like, no, I ask a much more basic question.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.480
What are the fruits of their behavior?

39:33.480 --> 39:34.680
Now I always make it personal

39:34.680 --> 39:36.760
because I think everything is personal.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.760
Does his wife respect him?

39:38.760 --> 39:39.760
Do his children respect him?

39:39.760 --> 39:40.860
How are they doing?

39:40.860 --> 39:44.980
Is the country he runs thriving or is it falling apart?

39:44.980 --> 39:46.940
If your life expectancy is going down,

39:46.940 --> 39:48.340
if your suicide rate is going up,

39:48.340 --> 39:50.060
if your standard of living is tanking,

39:50.060 --> 39:51.140
you're not a good leader.

39:51.140 --> 39:52.500
I don't care what you tell me.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.940
I don't care what you claim you represent.

39:54.940 --> 39:58.420
I don't care about the ideas or the systems

39:58.420 --> 39:59.460
that you say you embody.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.020
It's dog's barking to me.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.060
How's your life expectancy?

40:04.060 --> 40:05.600
How's your suicide rate?

40:05.600 --> 40:06.940
What's drug use like?

40:06.940 --> 40:09.060
Are people having children?

40:09.060 --> 40:11.860
Are people's children more likely to live

40:11.860 --> 40:14.340
in a freer, more prosperous society than you did

40:14.340 --> 40:15.180
and their grandparents did?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.100
Like those are the only measures that matter to me.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.740
The rest is a lie.

40:18.740 --> 40:21.960
But anyway, the point is we just get so obsessed

40:21.960 --> 40:26.960
with like the theater around people or people

40:27.160 --> 40:30.220
and we miss the bigger things that are happening

40:30.220 --> 40:35.220
and we allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking

40:35.420 --> 40:37.820
that what doesn't matter at all matters,

40:37.820 --> 40:39.580
that moral victories are all that matters.

40:39.580 --> 40:41.980
No, actually, facts on the ground victories matter

40:41.980 --> 40:42.820
more than anything.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.660
I mean, you certainly see it in this country,

40:43.660 --> 40:45.540
Black Lives Matter, for example.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.460
How many black people did that help?

40:48.540 --> 40:49.700
It hurt a lot of black people,

40:49.700 --> 40:51.660
but in the end we should be able to measure it.

40:51.660 --> 40:54.660
You know, like how many black people have died

40:54.660 --> 40:57.580
by gunfire in the four years since George Floyd died?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.420
Well, the number's gone way, way up

40:59.420 --> 41:01.460
and that was a Black Lives Matter operation,

41:01.460 --> 41:02.680
defund the police.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.140
So I think we can say as a factual matter,

41:05.140 --> 41:08.060
data-based matter,

41:08.060 --> 41:10.260
Black Lives Matter didn't help black people.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.820
And if it did tell me how,

41:11.820 --> 41:14.660
well, these are important moral victories, I'm over that.

41:14.660 --> 41:18.220
That's just another lie, you know, along litany of lies.

41:18.220 --> 41:20.380
So I try to see the rest of the world that way

41:20.380 --> 41:23.620
but more than anything, I try to see world events

41:23.620 --> 41:26.560
through the lens of an American because I am one.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.980
And what does this mean for us?

41:27.980 --> 41:31.180
And it's not even the war, it's the sanctions

41:31.180 --> 41:35.260
that will forever change the United States,

41:35.260 --> 41:38.060
our standard of living, the way our government operates.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.140
That more than any single thing in my lifetime

41:41.140 --> 41:43.540
screwed the United States.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.900
Leveying those sanctions in the way that we did was crazy.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.100
And that was, for me, the main takeaway

41:49.100 --> 41:51.940
from my eight days in Moscow was not Putin,

41:51.940 --> 41:54.700
he's a leader, whatever.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.340
None of them are that different actually

41:56.340 --> 41:58.520
in my pretty extensive experience.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.480
No, it was Moscow.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.440
That blew my mind.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.340
I was not prepared for that at all.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.720
And I thought I knew a lot about Moscow.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.840
My dad worked there on and off in the 80s and 90s

42:07.840 --> 42:09.360
because he was a US government employee

42:09.360 --> 42:10.560
and he was always coming back to Moscow,

42:10.560 --> 42:14.000
it's a nightmare and all this stuff, no electricity.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.660
I got there almost exactly two years after sanctions,

42:17.660 --> 42:19.840
totally cut off from Western financial systems,

42:19.840 --> 42:22.400
kicked out of SWIFT, can't use US dollars,

42:22.400 --> 42:24.520
no banking, no credit cards.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.920
And that city, just factually,

42:27.920 --> 42:29.560
I'm not endorsing the system,

42:29.560 --> 42:30.920
I'm not endorsing the whole country.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
I didn't go to Lake Bakal.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.340
I didn't go to Turkmenistan.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.760
I just went to Moscow, largest city in Europe,

42:36.760 --> 42:39.000
13 million people, I drove all around it.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.640
And that city is way nicer, outwardly anyway,

42:42.640 --> 42:46.680
I don't live there, than any city we have by a lot.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.880
And by nicer, let me be specific,

42:48.880 --> 42:50.840
no graffiti, no homeless,

42:50.840 --> 42:52.920
no people using drugs in the street,

42:52.920 --> 42:55.020
totally tidy, no garbage on the ground.

42:55.900 --> 42:59.920
And no forest of steel and concrete,

42:59.920 --> 43:01.420
soul destroying buildings,

43:01.420 --> 43:03.700
none of the postmodern architecture that oppresses us

43:03.700 --> 43:08.120
without even our knowledge, none of that crap.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.360
It's a truly beautiful city.

43:10.360 --> 43:13.540
And that's not an endorsement of Putin.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.280
And by the way, it didn't make me love Putin.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.200
It made me hate my own leaders,

43:17.200 --> 43:19.080
because I grew up in a country that had cities

43:19.080 --> 43:22.060
kind of like that, that were nice cities, that were safe.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.860
And we don't have that anymore.

43:23.860 --> 43:24.700
And how did that happen?

43:25.380 --> 43:26.220
Did Putin do that?

43:26.220 --> 43:27.060
I don't think Putin did that actually.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.380
I think the people in charge of it,

43:28.380 --> 43:31.020
the mayors, the governors, the president, they did that.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.940
And they should be held accountable for it.

43:32.940 --> 43:36.460
So I think cleanliness and architectural design

43:36.460 --> 43:39.540
is not the entirety of the metrics that matter

43:39.540 --> 43:40.980
when you measure a city.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.780
They're the main metrics that matter.

43:42.780 --> 43:43.980
They're the main metrics that matter.

43:43.980 --> 43:47.700
The main metrics that matter are cleanliness,

43:47.700 --> 43:50.140
safety and beauty, in my opinion.

43:50.140 --> 43:54.660
And one of the big lies that we are told in our world

43:55.660 --> 43:57.700
is that no, something you can't measure

43:57.700 --> 44:00.860
that has no actual effect on your life matters most.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.220
Bullshit.

44:03.220 --> 44:05.900
What matters most, to say it again,

44:05.900 --> 44:09.180
beauty, safety, cleanliness.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.400
Lots of other things matter too.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.180
A whole bunch of things matter.

44:12.180 --> 44:13.540
But if I were to put them in order,

44:13.540 --> 44:16.700
it's not some like theoretical, well, actually,

44:16.700 --> 44:18.860
I don't know if you know that the Duma has no power.

44:18.860 --> 44:20.740
Okay, I get that.

44:20.740 --> 44:23.640
Freedom of speech matters enormously to me.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.200
They have less freedom of speech in Russia

44:25.200 --> 44:26.400
than we do in the United States.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.800
We are superior to them in that way.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.680
But you can't tell me that living in a city

44:31.680 --> 44:34.600
where your six-year-old daughter can walk to the bus stop

44:34.600 --> 44:37.480
and ride on a clean bus or ride in a beautiful subway car

44:37.480 --> 44:41.240
that's on time and not get assaulted, that doesn't matter.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.940
No, that matters almost more than anything, actually.

44:43.940 --> 44:45.080
And we can have both.

44:45.080 --> 44:49.200
And like the normal regime defenders and morons,

44:49.200 --> 44:51.920
John Stewart or whatever he's calling himself,

44:51.920 --> 44:54.040
they're like, well, that's the price of freedom.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.640
Like people shitting on the sidewalk

44:55.640 --> 44:56.520
is the price of freedom.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.560
It's like, you can't fool me

44:57.560 --> 45:00.000
because I've lived here for 54 years.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.180
I know that it's not the price of freedom

45:02.180 --> 45:04.200
because I lived in a country that was both free

45:04.200 --> 45:06.500
and clean and orderly.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.480
So that's not a trade-off I think I have to make.

45:09.480 --> 45:12.440
You can't, that is the beauty of being a little bit older

45:12.440 --> 45:14.880
because you're like, no, I remember that actually.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.260
It wasn't what you're saying.

45:16.260 --> 45:20.080
We didn't have racial segregation in 1985.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.220
It was a really nice country

45:21.220 --> 45:22.440
that kind of respected itself.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.840
I was here.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.760
And I think with younger people, you can tell them that.

45:25.760 --> 45:26.960
And they're like, oh, 1985,

45:26.960 --> 45:29.280
you were selling slaves in Madison Square Garden.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.320
It's like, no, they weren't.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.440
You're going to Madison Square Garden

45:32.440 --> 45:34.960
and not stepping over a single fentanyl addict.

45:34.960 --> 45:35.800
It is true.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.080
There doesn't have to be a trade-off

45:37.080 --> 45:40.640
between cleanliness and freedom of speech.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.000
But it is also true that in dictatorships,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.560
cleanliness and architectural design

45:46.560 --> 45:49.800
is easier to achieve and perfect and often is done so

45:49.800 --> 45:52.920
so you can show off, look how great our cities are

45:52.920 --> 45:54.880
while you're suppressing wars.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.880
Of course, I agree with that vehemently.

45:57.880 --> 46:01.560
This is not a defense of the Russian system at all.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.600
And if I felt that way, I would not only move there,

46:04.600 --> 46:06.480
but I would announce I was moving there.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.840
I'm not ashamed of my views.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.320
I never have been.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.400
And for all the people who are trying

46:10.400 --> 46:12.760
to impute secret motives to my words,

46:13.640 --> 46:15.040
I'm like the one person in America

46:15.040 --> 46:16.120
you don't need to do that with.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.840
If you think I'm a racist, ask me and I'll tell you.

46:18.840 --> 46:19.680
Are you a racist?

46:19.680 --> 46:20.520
Of course.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.280
No, I am a sexist though.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.760
All right, great.

46:23.760 --> 46:28.360
Anyway, no, but if I was like a defender of Vladimir Putin,

46:28.360 --> 46:31.080
I would just say I'm defending Vladimir Putin now.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.600
I'm not, I am attacking our leaders

46:34.600 --> 46:38.200
and I'm grieving over the low expectations of our people.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.480
You don't need to put up with this.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.960
You don't need to put up with foreign invaders

46:42.960 --> 46:47.360
stealing from you, occupying your kids' school.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.680
Your kids can't get an education

46:48.680 --> 46:50.680
because people from foreign countries broke our laws

46:50.680 --> 46:53.040
and showed up here and they've taken over the school.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.200
That's not a feature of freedom actually.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.320
That's the opposite.

46:57.320 --> 46:59.720
That's what enslavement looks like.

46:59.720 --> 47:03.120
And so I'm just saying raise your expectations a little bit.

47:03.120 --> 47:06.480
You can have a clean, functional, safe country.

47:06.480 --> 47:07.720
Crime is totally optional.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.400
Crime is something our leaders decide to have or not have.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.160
It's not something that just appears organically.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.160
I wrote a book about crime 30 years ago.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.040
I thought a lot about this.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.960
You have as much crime as you put up with, period.

47:19.960 --> 47:23.720
And it doesn't make you less free to not tolerate murder.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.880
In fact, it makes you unfree to have a lot of murders.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.120
And so I just, but it makes me sad that people are like,

47:32.120 --> 47:36.920
well, I guess this is, I can't live in New York City anymore

47:36.920 --> 47:39.760
because of inflation and filth and illegal aliens

47:39.760 --> 47:41.480
and people shooting each other.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.680
But I'm just, I'm glad because this is vibrant

47:45.680 --> 47:47.000
and strong and free.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.520
It's like, that's not freedom actually at all.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.040
Your point is well taken.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.840
You can have both, but do you regret?

47:54.840 --> 47:55.680
We had both.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.520
That's the point.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.360
We had, I saw it.

47:57.360 --> 48:02.360
Do you regret to a degree using the Moscow subway

48:02.480 --> 48:04.840
and the grocery store as a mechanism

48:04.840 --> 48:06.160
by which to make that point?

48:06.160 --> 48:07.000
No.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.320
I mean, I thought I, I mean, look,

48:10.320 --> 48:15.280
I'm one of the more unselfish people you will ever interview.

48:15.280 --> 48:20.280
So to ask me, you know, how will this be perceived?

48:21.640 --> 48:25.000
I literally have no idea and kind of limited interest,

48:25.000 --> 48:29.360
but I was so shocked by it.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.600
I was so shocked by it.

48:30.600 --> 48:34.800
And there were two, and to the extent I regret anything

48:34.800 --> 48:37.600
and am to blame for anything, it would be not,

48:37.600 --> 48:39.240
and I've done this a lot, not giving it context,

48:39.240 --> 48:41.680
not fully explaining why are we doing this.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.200
The grocery store, I was shocked by the prices.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.480
And yes, I'm familiar with exchange rates,

48:46.480 --> 48:49.000
but very familiar with exchange rates,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.800
but those don't, and I adjusted them for exchange rates.

48:51.800 --> 48:55.600
And this is two years in to sanctions,

48:55.600 --> 48:57.720
total isolation from the West.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.560
So I would expect, in fact, I did expect until I got there

49:00.560 --> 49:01.920
that their supply chains would be crushed.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.080
How do you get good stuff

49:04.080 --> 49:06.240
if you don't have access to Western markets?

49:07.120 --> 49:08.520
And I didn't fully get the answer

49:08.520 --> 49:10.720
because I was occupied doing other things when I was there,

49:10.720 --> 49:13.560
but somehow they have, and that's the point.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.200
And they haven't had the supply chains problems

49:16.200 --> 49:17.480
that I predicted.

49:17.480 --> 49:20.600
In other words, sanctions haven't made the country

49:20.600 --> 49:22.240
noticeably worse.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.440
Okay, so again, this is commentary of the United States

49:24.440 --> 49:25.800
and our policymakers.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.520
Why are we doing this?

49:27.520 --> 49:29.440
It's forcing the rest of the world

49:29.440 --> 49:32.000
into a block against us called bricks.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.680
They're getting off the US dollar.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.000
That will mean a lot of dollars are gonna come back here

49:36.000 --> 49:38.840
and destroy our economy and impoverish this country.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.320
So the consequences, the stakes are really high.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.360
They're huge.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.280
And we're not even hurting Russia.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.680
So like, what the hell are we doing?

49:45.680 --> 49:50.560
One, on the subway, that subway was built by Joseph Stalin

49:50.560 --> 49:52.440
right before the Second World War.

49:52.440 --> 49:55.760
I'm not endorsing Stalin, obviously.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.560
Stalinism is the thing that I hate,

49:58.560 --> 50:00.840
and I don't want to come to my country.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.680
I'm making the obvious point that for over 80 years,

50:03.680 --> 50:05.400
you've had these frescoes and chandeliers,

50:05.400 --> 50:06.520
maybe they've been redone or whatever,

50:06.520 --> 50:09.240
but like somehow the society has been able

50:09.240 --> 50:11.600
to not destroy what its ancestors built,

50:11.600 --> 50:14.640
the things that are worth having, and there are a lot.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.360
And that, like, why don't we have that?

50:17.360 --> 50:20.800
And even on a much more terrestrial plane,

50:20.800 --> 50:22.840
like, why can't I have a subway station like that?

50:22.840 --> 50:24.920
Why can't my children who live in New York City

50:24.920 --> 50:26.520
ride the subway?

50:26.520 --> 50:29.080
A lot of people I know who live in New York City

50:29.080 --> 50:31.520
are afraid to ride the subway, young women especially.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.480
That's freedom?

50:32.480 --> 50:34.720
No, again, it's slavery.

50:34.720 --> 50:38.320
And how can, if Putin can do this, why can't we?

50:38.320 --> 50:39.320
Like, what?

50:39.320 --> 50:41.000
It's not, in other words, I mean,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.120
this is like so obvious, I'm a traitor, okay.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.640
So if I'm calling for American citizens

50:47.640 --> 50:49.760
to demand more from their government

50:49.760 --> 50:51.560
and higher standards for their own society,

50:51.560 --> 50:53.680
and remember that just 30 years ago,

50:53.680 --> 50:55.520
we had a much different and much happier

50:55.520 --> 50:57.760
and cleaner and healthier society,

50:57.760 --> 51:00.680
where everyone wasn't fat with diabetes at 40

51:00.680 --> 51:01.800
from poisoned food.

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
Like, how is that?

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
I'm not a traitor to my country,

51:05.040 --> 51:07.120
I'm a defender of my country.

51:07.120 --> 51:08.440
By the way, the people calling me a traitor,

51:08.440 --> 51:11.480
they're all like, you know, whatever.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.040
They're not, I would not say they're people

51:13.040 --> 51:15.280
who put America's interests first.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.360
To put it mildly.

51:16.360 --> 51:17.800
There's many elements, like you said,

51:17.800 --> 51:19.280
you don't like Stalinism.

51:20.320 --> 51:23.040
You know, you're a student of history.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.320
Central planning is good at building subways

51:26.320 --> 51:28.080
in a way that's really nice.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.960
The thing that accounts for New York subways,

51:31.960 --> 51:34.040
by the way, there's a lot of really positive things

51:34.040 --> 51:36.040
about New York subways, not cleanliness,

51:36.040 --> 51:38.760
but the efficiency, like the accessibility,

51:38.760 --> 51:41.840
how wide it spreads.

51:41.840 --> 51:45.080
Like, the New York network is incredible,

51:45.080 --> 51:49.080
but Moscow, under different metrics,

51:49.080 --> 51:50.440
results of a capitalist system,

51:50.440 --> 51:52.400
and you actually said that you don't think US

51:52.400 --> 51:53.600
is quite a capitalist system,

51:53.600 --> 51:55.640
which is an interesting question itself.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.760
We have more central planning here than they do in Russia.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.760
No, that's not true.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.720
Of course it is.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.680
You think that's true.

52:00.680 --> 52:02.200
The climate agenda, of course.

52:02.200 --> 52:05.120
They're telling, the US government has,

52:05.120 --> 52:07.280
in league with a couple of big companies,

52:07.280 --> 52:11.120
decided to change the way we produce and consume energy.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.120
There's no popular outcry for that.

52:13.120 --> 52:16.040
There's never been any mass movement of Americans

52:16.040 --> 52:18.280
who's like, oh, I hate my gasoline-powered engine.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.560
No more diesel.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.520
That has been central planning.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.000
That is central planning.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.520
And you see it up and down our economy.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.120
There's no free market in the United States.

52:25.120 --> 52:27.520
You get crossways with the government, you're done.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.680
If you're at scale, I mean, maybe you've got a barber shop

52:29.680 --> 52:31.760
or a liquor store or something, but even then,

52:31.760 --> 52:35.080
you're regulated by politicians.

52:35.080 --> 52:38.680
And so, no, I actually am for free markets.

52:38.680 --> 52:39.640
I hate monopolies.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.880
Our economy is dominated by monopolies.

52:41.880 --> 52:42.720
Completely dominated.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.560
Like what do you mean?

52:43.560 --> 52:44.600
Google.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.920
What percentage of search does Google have?

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
90?

52:47.920 --> 52:50.040
Google's a monopoly by any definition,

52:50.040 --> 52:52.200
and Google is just rich enough to continue doing

52:52.200 --> 52:54.960
whatever it wants in violation of US law.

52:54.960 --> 52:58.560
So there's no monopoly in Russia as big as Google.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.400
I'm not, again, defending the Russian system.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.960
I'm calling for a return to our old system,

53:03.000 --> 53:04.840
which was sensible and moderate

53:04.840 --> 53:07.560
and put the needs of Americans

53:07.560 --> 53:09.600
at least somewhere in the top 10.

53:09.600 --> 53:11.920
I mean, somewhere in the top 10.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.880
I'm not saying that Standard Oil was interested

53:14.880 --> 53:16.680
in the welfare of average Americans,

53:16.680 --> 53:20.200
but I am saying that there was a constituency

53:20.200 --> 53:22.520
in our political system, in the Congress, for example,

53:22.520 --> 53:23.680
different presidential candidates were like,

53:23.680 --> 53:24.600
no, wait a second.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.680
What is this doing to people?

53:25.680 --> 53:26.760
Is it good for people or not?

53:26.760 --> 53:28.480
There's not even a conversation about that.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.040
It's like, shut up and submit to AI.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.320
And no offense.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.120
Offense taken.

53:35.440 --> 53:39.360
I'll write, we will get you when it's stronger.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.480
You'll be the first one to go.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.760
Well, as a white man, I just won't even exist anymore.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.080
So much to say on that one.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.320
I bet when you Google my picture,

53:46.320 --> 53:48.800
20 years from now it'll be a black chick.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.640
100%.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.440
Well, I hope she's attractive.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.280
I hope so too.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.720
It'll probably be an upgrade.

53:57.160 --> 54:00.280
So, well, the central planning point is really interesting,

54:00.280 --> 54:03.520
but I just don't, I don't know where you're coming from.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.000
There's a capitalist system.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.640
I mean, the United States is one of the most successful

54:09.640 --> 54:12.680
capitalist systems in the history of Earth.

54:12.680 --> 54:13.520
So to say-

54:13.520 --> 54:14.520
What's the most successful?

54:14.520 --> 54:16.280
I'm just saying that I think it's changed a lot

54:16.280 --> 54:19.320
in the last 15 years and that we need to update

54:19.320 --> 54:21.600
our assumptions about what we're seeing.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.000
And that's true up and down.

54:23.000 --> 54:23.920
That's true with everything.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.360
It's true with your neighbor's children

54:25.360 --> 54:26.480
who you haven't seen in three years

54:26.480 --> 54:27.920
and they come home from Wesleyan

54:27.920 --> 54:29.560
and you're like, oh, you have grown.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.920
That is true for the world around us as well.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.280
And most of our assumptions about immigration,

54:34.280 --> 54:36.080
about our economy, about our tax system

54:36.080 --> 54:39.600
are completely outdated if you compare them

54:39.600 --> 54:41.440
to the current reality.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.560
And so I'm just for updating my files

54:43.560 --> 54:45.160
and I have a big advantage over you

54:45.160 --> 54:47.920
because I am middle-aged and so I don't-

54:47.920 --> 54:49.840
You've called yourself old so many times throughout-

54:49.840 --> 54:51.520
I don't trust my perceptions of things.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.320
So I'm constantly trying to be like, is that true?

54:54.320 --> 54:55.920
I should go there.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.400
You know, I should see it.

54:57.400 --> 55:00.440
And I guess just in the end,

55:03.440 --> 55:05.120
I trust direct perceptions.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.160
Like I don't trust the internet actually.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.960
Wikipedia is a joke.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.080
Wikipedia could not be more dishonest.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.520
It's certainly in the political categories

55:13.520 --> 55:14.880
or things that I know a lot about.

55:14.880 --> 55:17.560
Occasionally I read an entry written about something

55:17.560 --> 55:19.160
that I saw or know the people involved.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.280
And I'm like, well, that's a complete liar.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.120
You left out the most important fact.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.800
And it's like, it's not a reliable guide

55:23.800 --> 55:25.760
to reality or history.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.120
And that will accelerate with AI

55:27.800 --> 55:28.920
where history or perception of the past

55:28.920 --> 55:32.920
is completely controlled and distorted.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.040
So I think just getting out there and seeing stuff

55:35.040 --> 55:38.200
and seeing that Moscow was not what I thought it would be,

55:38.200 --> 55:40.840
which was a smoldering ruin, you know,

55:40.840 --> 55:44.920
rats in a garbage dump, it was nicer than New York.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.000
What the hell?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.520
Direct data is good, but it's challenging.

55:48.520 --> 55:51.040
For example, if you talk to a lot of people in Moscow

55:51.040 --> 55:54.560
or in Russia and you ask them, is there censorship?

55:54.560 --> 55:56.480
They will usually say, yes, there is.

55:56.640 --> 55:57.800
Of course there is.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.920
Well, I agree.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.960
I mean, just to be clear, I'm not,

56:02.960 --> 56:04.480
I have no plans to move to Russia.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.040
I think I would probably be arrested if I moved to Russia.

56:07.040 --> 56:11.240
Ed Snowden, who is the most famous sort of

56:11.240 --> 56:14.360
openness transparency advocate in the world, I would say,

56:14.360 --> 56:18.080
along with Assange, doesn't wanna live in Russia.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.200
He's had problems with the Putin government.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.360
He's attacked Putin.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.280
They don't like it.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.960
I mean, I get it, I get it.

56:24.960 --> 56:28.560
I'm just saying, what are the lessons for us?

56:28.560 --> 56:30.920
And the main lesson is we are being lied to,

56:32.800 --> 56:36.760
like in a way that's bewildering and very upsetting.

56:36.760 --> 56:38.960
I was mad about it all eight days I was there,

56:38.960 --> 56:40.480
because I feel like I'm better informed than most people

56:40.480 --> 56:41.960
because it's my job to be informed.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.960
And I'm skeptical of everything.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.720
And yet I was completely hoodwinked by it.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.000
I would just recommend to everyone watching this,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.440
like you think you know, like if you're really interested,

56:51.440 --> 56:53.120
if you're one of those people, and I'm not one,

56:53.120 --> 56:54.240
but who's like waking up every day

56:54.360 --> 56:57.160
and you've got a Ukrainian flag on your mailbox

56:57.160 --> 56:59.520
or whatever, your Ukrainian lapel pin,

56:59.520 --> 57:01.560
or it's like absurd theater.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.240
But if you like sincerely care about Ukraine

57:03.240 --> 57:06.280
or Russia or whatever, why don't you just hop on a plane

57:06.280 --> 57:08.440
for 800 bucks and go see it, okay?

57:08.440 --> 57:11.120
No, that doesn't occur to anyone to do that.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.600
And I know it's time consuming

57:12.600 --> 57:14.840
and kind of expensive, sort of, not really.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.720
But you benefit so much.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.360
I mean, I could bore you for like eight hours.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.040
And I know you've had this experience

57:22.040 --> 57:23.840
where you think you know what something is

57:23.840 --> 57:26.320
or you think you know who someone is,

57:26.320 --> 57:27.520
and then you have direct experience

57:27.520 --> 57:29.200
of that place or person,

57:29.200 --> 57:32.360
and you realize all your preconceptions were totally wrong.

57:32.360 --> 57:33.960
They were controlled by somebody else.

57:33.960 --> 57:36.280
Like, you know, in fact, I won't betray confidence,

57:36.280 --> 57:37.840
but off the air, we were talking about somebody,

57:37.840 --> 57:39.840
and you said, I couldn't believe the person

57:39.840 --> 57:41.440
was not at all like what I thought.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.320
Well, that's happened to me.

57:42.320 --> 57:43.240
In the positive direction.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.080
In the positive direction.

57:44.080 --> 57:47.160
By the way, for me, it's almost always in that direction.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.920
Most people I meet, and I've had the great privilege

57:49.960 --> 57:54.280
of meeting a lot of people over all this time.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.440
They're way better than you think.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.320
Or they're more complicated or whatever.

57:57.320 --> 58:00.120
But the point is, a direct experience

58:00.120 --> 58:04.080
unmediated by liars, there's no substitute for that.

58:04.080 --> 58:06.400
Well, on that point, direct experience in Ukraine.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.160
So I visited Ukraine and witnessed a lot

58:10.160 --> 58:11.560
of the same things you witnessed in Moscow.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.040
So first of all, beautiful architecture.

58:13.040 --> 58:13.880
Yes.

58:13.880 --> 58:17.040
And this is a country that's really in war.

58:17.040 --> 58:17.880
So it's not-

58:17.880 --> 58:18.720
Oh, for real?

58:18.840 --> 58:23.200
For real, where most of the men are either volunteering

58:23.200 --> 58:26.200
or fighting in the war, and there's actual tanks

58:26.200 --> 58:29.080
in the streets that are going into your major city of Kiev.

58:29.080 --> 58:32.160
And still the supply chains are working.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.000
Yes.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.520
Just a handful of months after the start of the war.

58:34.520 --> 58:36.120
Everything is working.

58:36.120 --> 58:37.680
The restaurants are amazing.

58:39.360 --> 58:43.280
Most of the people are able to do some kind of job.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.280
Like the life goes on.

58:46.120 --> 58:49.000
Cleanliness, like you mentioned.

58:49.000 --> 58:49.840
I love that.

58:49.840 --> 58:52.000
Security, it's incredible.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.080
There's the crime went to zero.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.600
They gave all guns to everybody.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.080
The Texas strategy.

58:58.080 --> 58:58.920
It does work.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.960
Yeah, when you witness it, you realize, okay,

59:00.960 --> 59:02.480
there's something to these people.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.040
There's something to this country

59:04.040 --> 59:06.480
that they're not as corrupt as you might hear.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.320
Right.

59:07.320 --> 59:09.360
You hear that Russia is corrupt, Ukraine is corrupt.

59:09.360 --> 59:11.200
You assume it's just all gonna go to shit.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.720
Well, so that's been, and I haven't been to Ukraine

59:12.720 --> 59:13.880
and I've certainly tried,

59:13.880 --> 59:16.520
and they put me on some kill him immediately list.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.120
So I can't, I've tried to interview Zelensky.

59:18.120 --> 59:18.960
He keeps denouncing me.

59:18.960 --> 59:20.080
I just want an interview with him.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.160
He won't.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.720
Unfortunately, I would love to do it.

59:22.720 --> 59:23.560
I hope you do.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.400
I do too.

59:24.400 --> 59:27.920
But one of the things that bothers me most,

59:27.920 --> 59:30.080
I love to hear that what you just said about Kiev.

59:30.080 --> 59:31.800
But I'm not really surprised.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.720
One of the things that I'm most ashamed of

59:34.720 --> 59:39.040
is the bigotry that I felt towards Slavic people,

59:39.040 --> 59:39.920
also toward Muslims.

59:39.920 --> 59:40.920
I'll just be totally honest.

59:40.920 --> 59:43.360
Because I lived through decades of propaganda

59:43.360 --> 59:46.320
from NBC News and CNN, where I worked,

59:46.320 --> 59:47.960
about this or that group of people

59:47.960 --> 59:49.400
and they're horrible or whatever.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.040
And then you whine, and I kind of believed it.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.000
And I see it now.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.480
We can't even put the word Russia at Wimbledon

59:56.480 --> 59:57.600
because it's so offensive.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.840
What does the tennis player have to do with it?

59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.720
Did he invade Ukraine?

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.160
I don't think he did.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.760
Stealing all these business guys' yachts

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.080
and denouncing them as oligarchs.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.240
What do they have to do with it?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.360
Whatever.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.240
Here's my point.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.480
The idea that a whole group of people is just evil

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.440
because of their blood.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.600
I just don't believe that.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.360
I think it's immoral to think that.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.600
And I can just tell you my own experience

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.920
after eight days there.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.600
I think it's a really interesting culture, Slavic culture,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.680
which is shared by the way by Russia and Ukraine, of course.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.960
They're first cousins at the most distant.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.960
And I found them really smart and interesting and informed.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.640
I didn't understand a lot of what they were saying.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.840
I don't understand the way their minds work

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.680
because I'm American, but it wasn't a thin culture.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.120
It's a thick culture, you know?

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.320
And I admire that.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.480
And I wish I could go to Ukraine.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.920
I would go tomorrow.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.800
So I think after you did the interview with Putin,

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.480
you put a clip, I think on TCN,

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.200
where like your sort of analysis afterwards.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.600
Yeah, it wasn't much of an analysis.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.120
No, but what stood out to me

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.320
is you were kind of talking shit about Putin a little bit.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.880
Like you were criticizing him.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.920
Why wouldn't I?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.560
It spoke to the thing that you mentioned,

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.200
which is you weren't afraid.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.160
Now, the question I want to ask is,

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.560
it would be pretty bad ass if you went to the supermarket

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.960
and made the point you were making,

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.840
but also criticize Putin, right?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.080
Criticize that there is a lack of freedom of speech

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.560
and freedom of the press.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.520
In the supermarket?

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.360
Yes.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.120
Oh, you mean if I also said that?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, yeah, I mean, of course I think that I'm not.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.760
So I guess part of it is that I'm a little,

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.560
because I have such a low opinion

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.840
of the commentariat in the United States

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.600
and the news organizations,

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.400
which really do just work for the US government.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.920
I mean, I really see them as I did

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.960
is Vestia and Pravda in the 80s.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.360
Like they're just organs of the government

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.560
and I think they're contemptible.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.040
And I think the people who work there are contemptible.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:54.880
And I say that as someone

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.960
who knows them really well personally.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.640
I think they're disgusting.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.840
That I'm a little bit cut off kind of

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.880
from what people are saying about me

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.840
because I'm not interested.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.200
But so I try not to be defensive.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.440
See, I'm not a tool of Putin.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.880
But the idea that I'd be flacking for Putin

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.320
when my relatives fought in the Revolutionary War,

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.400
like I'm as American as you could be,

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.280
it's like crazy to me.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.240
Anne Applebaum calls me a traitor to my, okay, right.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.560
It's just like so dumb.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.360
But no, of course they don't have,

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.240
no country has freedom of speech other than us.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.800
Canada doesn't have it.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.760
Great Britain definitely doesn't have it.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.080
France, Netherlands,

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.760
these are countries I spent a lot of time in.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.280
And Russia certainly doesn't have it.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.600
So that's why I don't live there.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.040
I'm just saying our sanctions don't work.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.240
That's all I was saying.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.200
And we don't have to live like animals.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.760
We can live with dignity.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.120
Even the Russians can do it.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.200
That's kind of what I was saying.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.480
Even the Russians under Vladimir freaking Putin

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.320
can live like this.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.800
And no, it's not a feature of dictatorship.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.160
That's the most, I think, discouraging

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.720
and most dishonest line by people like John Stewart

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.200
who really are trying to prepare the population

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.960
for accepting a lot less.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.760
He is really a tool of the regime in a sinister way.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.560
Always has been.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.360
Like, how dare you expect that?

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.400
What are you, a Stalinist?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.680
It's like, no, I'm an American.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.800
I'm like a decent person.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.760
I just wanna be able to walk to the grocery store

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.600
without being murdered.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.440
Is that too much?

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.040
Shut up, then you don't believe in freedom.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.480
It's really dark if you think about it.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.960
So there is a fundamental way

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.960
which you wanted Americans to expect more.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.640
You don't have to live like this.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.000
We don't have to live like this.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.840
You don't have to accept it.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.680
You don't.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.360
And everyone's afraid in this country

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.560
they're gonna be shut down by the tech oligarchs

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.120
or have the FBI show up at their houses or go to jail.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.720
And people are legit afraid of that in the United States.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.280
And my feeling is, so?

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.040
Like, show a little courage.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.000
Like, what is it worth to you for your grandchildren

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
to live in a free, prosperous country?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.560
It should be worth more than your comfort.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.480
That's how I feel.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.320
We should make clear that, you know, by many measures,

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.000
you look at the World Press Freedom Index,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.280
you're right, US is not at the top.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.120
Norway is.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.040
US scores 71, same as Gambia.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.880
Really?

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.720
West Africa.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.560
So let me just ask.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.120
Hold on a second, hold on a second, hold on a second.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.200
Now you're making me laugh.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.720
Ukraine is 61 and Russia is 35.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.560
The lower it is, the worse.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.000
Close to China at 23 and North Korea

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.080
at the very bottom, 22.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.240
Didn't Ukraine put Gonzalo Lira in jail

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.960
till he died for criticizing the government?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.320
How can they have a high press?

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.240
Yes, that's why they're 61.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.840
But I'm saying, look, I don't know what the criteria

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.080
are they're using to arrive at that.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.280
But I know press freedom when I see it,

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.520
I try to practice it,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.560
which is saying what you think is true,

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.480
correcting yourself when you've been shown to be wrong,

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.520
as I have many times,

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.800
being as honest as you can be all the time

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.040
and not being afraid.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.040
And those are wholly absent in my country, wholly absent.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.200
People are afraid in the news business, I would know,

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.640
since I spent my life working there

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.560
and they're afraid to tell the truth.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.920
They're under enormous amount of pressure

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.520
and a lot of them have little kids in mortgages.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.960
I've been there.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.920
So I have sympathy, but they go along with things

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.400
like you are not allowed,

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.360
if you stand up at any cable channel,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.920
any cable channel in the United States and say,

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.280
wait a second, how did the Ukrainian government

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.480
throw a US citizen into prison until he died

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.160
for criticizing the Ukrainian government

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.480
and we're paying for that?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.880
That's what's offensive to me.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.720
We're paying for it.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.680
And that happens all the time around the world, of course,

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.920
but this is a US citizen

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.000
and we're paying the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.160
Like we are the Ukrainian government at this point.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.800
And like, if you said that on TV, on any channel,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.960
well, you'd lose your job for that.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.800
So like, that's not, I don't care.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.160
Norway is at the top, really, Norway.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.040
If I went on Norwegian television and said,

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.200
NATO blew up Nord Stream, which it did.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.080
NATO blew up Nord Stream.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.640
The United States government,

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.480
with the help of other governments,

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.040
blew up, committed the largest act

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.760
of industrial terrorism in history.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.400
And by the way, the largest environmental crime,

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.600
the largest emission of CO2, methane.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.760
Could I keep my job now?

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.600
So how is that a free process?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.440
Well, we don't know that.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.280
I mean, the whole point of-

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.120
In Norway?

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.680
Well, as a Scandinavian, I can tell you,

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.880
they would not put up with Norway for a second.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.640
Well, you're deviating for the majority?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.280
No.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.120
Well, but deviating maybe is frowned upon,

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.560
but do you have the freedom to say it if you do deviate?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.400
That's the question.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.400
Can you keep your job?

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.720
That's one measurement of it.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.960
Yeah, it's not the only measurement.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.200
Obviously being thrown into prison

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.520
is much worse than losing a job.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.240
I've been fired a number of times

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.800
for saying what I think, by the way.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.640
And it's fine.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.480
I've enjoyed it.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.400
I've enjoyed being fired.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.000
I've always become a better person after it happened.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.240
But it is one measurement of freedom.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.080
If you have the theoretical right to do something,

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.920
but no practical ability to do it,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.080
do you have the right to do it?

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.400
And the answer is not really, actually.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.840
You mentioned John Stewart.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.760
The two of you have a bit of a history.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.880
I don't know if you've seen it,

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.720
but he kind of grilled your supermarket and subway videos.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.840
Have you got any chance to see it?

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.080
I haven't seen it, but someone characterized it to me,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.480
which is why I pivoted against it

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.720
early in our conversation about how the price of freedom

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.560
is living in filth and chaos.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.560
Yeah, that was essentially it.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.040
So in 2004, that's 20 years ago,

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.200
John Stewart appeared on Crossfire, a show you hosted.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.680
And that was kind of a memorable moment.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.360
Can you tell the saga of that, as you remember it?

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.240
I mean, for me, as I was saying to you before

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.480
about how it takes a long time to digest and process

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.840
and understand what happens to you,

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.600
or at least it does for me,

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.360
I didn't understand that as a particularly

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.200
significant moment while it was happening.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.000
I just got off on a plane from Hawaii.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.520
I mean, I was out of it, as usual.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.800
And I was very literal, as usual.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.560
And so from my perspective, his criticism of me,

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.360
to the extent I remember it, was that I was a partisan.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.200
Well, he had two criticisms.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.880
One, that Crossfire was stupid, which it certainly was.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.600
In fact, I'd already given my notice

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.120
and I was moving on to another company by that point.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.320
Crossfire was stupid.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.760
Crossfire didn't help.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.160
Crossfire framed everything as Republican versus Democrat,

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.560
whatever.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.640
It was not helpful to the public discourse.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.240
I couldn't agree more.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.280
And that's why I left.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.560
So that was part of his critique fair.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.720
I'm not sure I would have admitted it at the time,

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.400
because I worked there and it's sort of hard to admit,

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.560
you're engaged in an enterprise

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.560
that's like fundamentally worthless, which it was.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.360
But his other point was that I was somehow

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.080
a partisan or a mindless partisan,

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.400
which is definitely not true.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.320
I mean, it is true of him.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.880
He is a mindless partisan, but I am not.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.120
And I haven't been for, I really haven't been

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.560
since I got back from Baghdad

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.680
at the beginning of the Iraq War.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.400
And I realized that the Republican Party,

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.680
which I'd voted for my whole life to that point

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.640
and had supported in general,

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.960
it was like pushing this really horrible thing

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.120
that was gonna hurt the United States,

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.960
which in time it really did.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.280
The Iraq War really hurt the United States.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.520
And I realized that I had been on the wrong side of that.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.120
I said so publicly immediately,

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120
from Baghdad I said that to the New York Times

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.360
and I really meant it, I mean it now.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.320
And so to call me partisan, you can call me stupid,

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320
you can call me wrong, I certainly have been wrong,

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.600
but partisan, I just didn't think it was a meaningful,

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.440
I mean, it's like, that's just not true.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.640
It's the opposite of true.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.120
So I didn't really take it seriously at all.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.560
And I never thought much of him.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.120
So I was like, whatever, some buffoon jumping around

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.360
on my show, grandstanding.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.880
But I do think it was record,

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.680
and by the way, that happened right at the moment

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.920
that YouTube began.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.520
That was one of the first big YouTube videos,

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.000
it was one of the first big YouTube videos.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.520
So it had a virality that, if that's a word,

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.160
it went everywhere in a way that didn't used to happen

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.000
in cable news.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.440
I mean, by that point, that was 20 years ago,

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.440
as you point out, I've been in cable news for nine years.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.440
So before 2004, we would say something on television

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.040
and then it would kind of, it would be lost.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.400
Like people could claim they heard it,

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.680
but you'd have to go to the,

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.840
I think the University of Tennessee

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.880
at Knoxville archives to get it.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.800
Suddenly, everything we said would live forever

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.640
on the internet, which is good, by the way.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.600
That's not bad, but it was a big change for me.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.120
And I just couldn't believe how widely that was discussed

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.960
at the time.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.040
Cause I thought he was not an interesting person.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.840
I think he's obviously a very unhappy person.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.720
I just didn't take him seriously then and I don't now.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.120
But so anyway, that was it.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.360
It was a smaller thing in my life at the time

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.960
than other people imagined.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.880
Okay, you said a lot of words that will make it sound

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.640
like you're a bit bitter, even if you're not.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.560
So you said unhappy person, partisan person.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.440
Well, he's definitely partisan for sure.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.000
Can you elaborate why you think he's partisan?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.800
So I think that, and I see this a lot,

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.720
not only on the left, but people who believe

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.880
that whatever political debate they're engaged in

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.520
is the most important debate in the world.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.000
And so they bring an emotional intensity to those debates

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.200
and they're inevitably disappointed

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.600
because no eternal question is solved politically.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.120
So they're kind of on the wrong path, right?

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.520
And they're doomed to frustration if they believe that.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.480
And many do, he certainly does.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.960
That whatever the issue is, so you know,

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.720
Clarence Thomas, stop being Supreme Court justice.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.680
And the implication is, well,

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.000
if someone else is a Supreme Court justice

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.320
will live in a fair and happy society,

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.840
but that's just not, it's a false promise.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.280
So I think that people who bring that level of intensity

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.240
to politics are by definition bitter,

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.680
by definition disappointed,

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.920
bitter in the way the disappointed people are.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.960
And that the real questions are like,

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.480
what happens when you die

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.160
and how do the people around you feel about you?

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.920
You know, those are not the only questions in life,

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.040
but they're certainly the most important ones.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.800
And if we're spending a disproportionate amount of time

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.360
on who gets elected to some office,

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.760
not that it's irrelevant, it is relevant,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.920
but it's not the eternal question.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.120
And so I feel like he's not the only kind of bitter,

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.680
silly person in Washington or in its orbit.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.200
There are many, and a lot of them are Republicans.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.760
So, but I just thought it was ironic.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.920
I mean, everything's ironic to me,

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.320
but like being called a Russia sympathizer

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.360
by a guy who calls himself Boris,

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.480
it just made me laugh.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.720
No one else has ever laughed at that.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.000
Boris Johnson's real name is not Boris, as you know.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
He calls himself Boris.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's his middle name.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.080
And so like, if you call yourself Boris,

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.200
you don't really have standing to attack anyone else

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.640
as a Russia defender, right?

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.760
That's my, I think that's funny.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.680
No one else, as I noted, does.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.680
But John Stewart, like, you know, if he,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.200
there are a lot of things you could say about me,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.360
but he's much more partisan than I am.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.920
So to call me a partisan, it's like, what?

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.560
He would probably say that he's not a partisan,

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.640
that he's a comedian who's looking for the humor

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.080
and the absurdity of the system on both sides.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.760
He's a dead serious, he's a very serious person in this.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.600
I will say this, and he shares this quality

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.440
with a lot of comedians.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.760
I know a lot of comedians.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.680
I know a cross section of people

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.160
just having done this job for a long time.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.320
And a lot of them are very serious, like about their views

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.680
and they have a lot of emotional intensity.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.360
And he certainly is in that category.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.480
He's not, that's like the silliest thing.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.560
Yeah, he's a comedian for sure.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.480
He can be very funny, for sure.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.840
He has talent, no doubt about it.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.400
I've never denied that.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.400
But he is, he's motivated by his moral views.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.760
You know, this is right, that is wrong.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.560
And I just think that it's a misapplied passion.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.440
But do you think I'm just a comedian is,

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.000
I don't think any serious person thinks that.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.440
I mean, if you're just a comedian,

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.880
and I, look, I'm not trying to claim,

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.400
I couldn't claim that I haven't said a lot of dumb things.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.520
And one of the dumbest things I ever said

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.120
was when he was on our set lecturing me.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.480
You know, he's a moralizer,

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.920
which I also just don't really care for

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920
as an aesthetic matter.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.000
But he was lecturing me about something.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.120
And I said, I thought you were here to tell jokes,

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.760
which I shouldn't have said,

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.480
because he wasn't there to tell jokes.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.160
He was there to lecture me.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.680
And I should have just engaged it directly

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.480
rather than trying to diminish him by like,

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.720
you're just a little comedian.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.840
Well, he doesn't see himself that way.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.240
But I would just say this,

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.840
Jon Stewart's a defender of power.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.040
Like, Jon Stewart has never criticized,

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.320
like, what's Jon Stewart's view on, you know,

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.640
the aid we've sent to Ukraine,

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.880
the $100 billion or whatever.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.840
Like, what happened to that money?

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.760
What happened to the weapons that it bought?

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.000
He doesn't care.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.320
He has the exact same priorities

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.080
as the people permanently in charge in Washington.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.760
So whatever, he's not alone in that.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.520
So does Mika Brzezinski and her husband

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.360
and all the rest of the cast of Dummies.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.920
But if you're gonna pretend to be the guy

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.880
who's giving the finger to entrench power,

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.360
you should do it once in a while.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.240
And he never has.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.040
There's not one time when he said something

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.440
that would be deeply unpopular on Morning Joe.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.640
That's all I'm saying.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.120
And so don't call yourself a truth teller.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.760
You're a court comedian or a flatterer of power.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.600
Okay, that's fine.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.420
There's a role for that,

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.560
but don't pretend to be something else.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.480
I'll just be honest that I watched it just recently

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.320
that video.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.140
From 20 years ago?

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.760
From 20 years ago, I watched it initially.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.160
And I remember very differently.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.320
I remembered that Jon Stewart completely destroyed you

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.260
in that conversation and I watched it.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.960
And you asked a very good question of him,

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.960
which was, and there was no destruction, first of all.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.680
And you asked a very good question of him.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.760
Why, when you got a chance to interview John Kerry,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.280
did you ask a bunch of softball questions?

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.160
Yeah.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.240
I thought that was a really fair question.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.880
And then his defense was, well, I'm just a comedian.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.800
So I thought that was disingenuous.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.040
And I haven't watched it.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.720
I never have watched a clip one time in my life.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.800
And I don't like to watch myself on television.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.160
I never have.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.760
So that, and that's my fault.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.820
And I probably should force myself to watch it though.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:17.660
Of course I never will.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.800
But I think the takeaway for me,

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.800
which was really interesting and life-changing was,

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.380
I agree with your assessment.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.580
I'm not just, I've lost a lot of debates.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.980
I've been humiliated on television.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.960
I'm not above that.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.020
It certainly happened to me.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.460
It will happen again.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:36.780
But I didn't feel like it was a clear win for him at all.

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.300
You know, maybe a TKO, but it was not a knockout at all.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.220
And yet it was recorded that way.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.340
And I remember thinking, well, that's kind of weird.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.780
That's not what I remember.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.620
And then I realized, no,

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.640
John Stewart was more popular than I was.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.520
Therefore he was recorded as the winner.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.340
And that was hard for me to accept

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.580
because that struck me as unfair.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.300
You should rate any contest on points.

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.060
Like, here are the rules.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.260
We're gonna judge the contest on the basis of those rules.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.820
And no, in the end, it's just like the more popular guy

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.780
wins every TV critic like John Stewart.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.780
Every one of them hated me.

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.700
Therefore he won.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.900
And I was like, wow, that,

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.700
I guess I have to accept that reality.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.780
And you do, like the reality of the sunrise.

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.300
You just have, you know, you're not in charge of it.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.340
So that's just what it is.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.140
Unfortunately, it's a bit darker, I think.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.780
The reason he's seen as the winner

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.080
and the reason at the time I saw as the quote unquote winner

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.260
is because he was basically shitting on you

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.420
like personal attacks versus engaging ideas.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.100
And it was funny in a dark way

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.700
and like making fun of the bow tie

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.540
and all this kind of stuff.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.260
So I'm like, I understand.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.580
And it was fair to call me a dick.

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.540
I remember he called me a dick.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.640
And I remember even when he said that,

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.660
I was like, yeah, I'm definitely a dick.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.540
Yeah, and that's not my best quality, trust me.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:42.020
But also to be kind of,

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.220
I thought John Stewart came off as a giant dick

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.660
at that time and I'm a big fan of his.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.780
And I think he has improved a lot.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.100
That may be true.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.020
We should also say that people grow.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:54.860
People like.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.620
I certainly have or change.

01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.760
Anyway, you hope it's growth.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.700
You hope it's not shrinkage.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:03.380
But it is cold outside.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.700
Yeah.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.460
I mean, look, I haven't followed John Stewart's career

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.300
at all.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.140
I don't have a television.

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.620
I'm pretty cut off from all that stuff.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.520
So I wouldn't really know.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.600
But the measure to me is,

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.800
are you taking positions that are unpopular

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.600
with the most powerful people in the world

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.680
and how often are you doing it?

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.560
It's super simple.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.200
Not for its own sake,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.200
but do you feel free enough to say to the consensus,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.580
I disagree.

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.800
And if you don't, then you're just another toady.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.840
That's my view.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.220
Well, I think he probably feels free enough to do it,

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.960
but you're saying he doesn't do it.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.800
On the big things.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.160
The big things, this is my estimation of it.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.120
Others may disagree.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.080
The big things are the economy and war, okay?

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.640
The big things government does can be,

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.880
I mean, there are a lot of things government does.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.120
Government does everything at this point,

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.120
but where we kill people and how and for what purpose

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.080
and how we organize the economic engine

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.200
that keeps the country afloat,

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.080
those are the two big questions.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.360
And I hear almost no debate about either one of them

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.640
in the media.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.720
And I have dissenting views on both of them.

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.280
I mean, I'm mad about the tax code,

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.640
which I think is unfair.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.720
I don't think we should be...

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.680
The fact we've carried interest loophole in the tax code

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.880
and people are claiming that their income is investment.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.820
Income, they're paying half the tax rate

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.800
as someone who just goes to work every day.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.680
It discourages work.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.080
It encourages lending at interest,

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.440
which I think is gross personally.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.160
I'm against it, sorry.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.160
And the fact that we're creating chaos around the world,

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.560
it's the saddest thing that's happening right now.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.480
And nobody feels free to say that, so that's not good.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.600
How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends?

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.200
With a settlement, with a reasonable settlement.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.360
And you know what a reasonable settlement is,

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.120
which is a settlement where both sides feel like

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.640
they're giving a little, but can live with it.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.840
And I mean, I was really struck in my conversation

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.480
with Putin by how he basically refused to criticize

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.520
Joe Biden and to criticize NATO.

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.840
And it is, I will just be honest, as an American,

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.820
it would be a little weird to be like pissing on Joe Biden

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.800
with a foreign leader, any foreign leader,

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.240
even though I don't think Joe Biden is a real person

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240
or really president and the whole thing is ridiculous,

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.440
but still he is the American president technically

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.200
and I don't want to beat up on the American president

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.720
with a foreigner, just don't.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.440
Maybe I'm old fashioned, so that's how I feel.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.960
So I didn't push it, but I thought it was really interesting.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.880
Because of course, Putin knows my views on Joe Biden.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.080
He knew I applied to the CIA,

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.600
so they've done some digging on me.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.680
But he didn't mention it and he didn't attack NATO.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.920
And the reason is, I know for a fact,

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.640
because he wants a settlement.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.800
And he wants a settlement not because Russia's

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.680
about to collapse despite the lying of our media,

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.960
that's just not true.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.980
And no one is even saying it anymore because it's so dumb.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.240
He wants you because it's just bad to have a war

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.800
and it changes the world in ways

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.800
you can't predict people die.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.220
Everything about it is sad.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.700
And if you can avoid it, you should.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.540
So I would like to see a settlement where, look,

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.620
the thing that Russia wants,

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.100
and I think probably has a right to,

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.580
is not to have NATO missiles on this border.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.940
Like, I don't know why we would do that.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.700
I don't know what we'd get out of it.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.660
I just don't even understand it.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.420
I don't understand the purpose of NATO.

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.140
I don't think NATO was good for the United States.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.580
I think it's an attack on our sovereignty.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.060
I would pull out of NATO immediately

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.300
if I were the US president

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.540
because I don't think it helps the US.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.100
I know a lot of people are getting

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.680
their bread buttered by NATO.

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:42.980
But anyway, that's my view as an American.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.740
If I'm a Russian or a Ukrainian,

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.080
let's just be sovereign countries now.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.220
We're not run by the US State Department.

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.260
We're just our own countries.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:52.220
Like, I believe in sovereignty, okay?

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.060
So that's my view.

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.340
And I also want to say one thing about Zelensky.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.580
I attacked him before because I was so offended

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.260
by his cavalier talk about nuclear exchange

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.700
because it would kill my family.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.620
So I'm really offended by that.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.140
Anyone who talks that way, I'm offended by.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.780
But I do feel for Zelensky.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.000
I do, that he didn't run for president to have this happen.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.200
I think Zelensky's been completely misused

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.020
by the State Department, by Toria Nuland,

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:23.980
by our Secretary of State, by the policymakers in the US

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.540
who've used Ukraine as a vessel for their ambitions,

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.620
their geopolitical ambitions,

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.460
but also the many American businesses who've used Ukraine

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:35.020
as a way to fleece the American taxpayer.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.700
And then by just independent ghouls like Boris Johnson

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.140
are hoping to get rich from interviews on it.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.180
Like the whole thing, Zelensky is at the center of this.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.620
He's not driving history.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.840
NATO and the United States is driving history.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.900
Putin is driving history.

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.420
There's this guy, Zelensky, so, you know,

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.620
I do feel for him and I think he's in a perilous place.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.020
Do you think Zelensky is a hero for staying in Kiev?

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.340
Because I do.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.980
To me, you can criticize a lot of things.

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.900
You should call out things that are obviously positive.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.820
I just tried to a second ago.

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:10.700
I don't know the extent that he is in Kiev.

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.360
He seems to be in the United States an awful lot,

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.780
like way too much.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.100
You can do a satellite interview.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.620
You don't have to speak to my Congress.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.500
You're not an American, please leave.

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.880
That's my opinion, but.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.700
You got many zingers, Tucker.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.980
No, no, no, it's just heartfelt.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.420
It's just bubbling up from the wellspring

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.860
that never turns off.

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:30.080
But I would say this about Zelensky.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.360
Yeah, to the extent he's in Ukraine, good man.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.760
You know, George W. Bush fled Washington on 9-11.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.960
I lived there with three kids,

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.640
and he ran away to some Air Force base in South Dakota.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.040
And I thought that was cowardly and I said so at the time.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.780
And I, man, I was attacked for saying that.

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.600
And I wrote a column about it in New York Magazine, right?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.200
Then I had a column, hard to believe.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.800
And, but I felt that, I felt that.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.200
Like that's, I think the prerequisites of leadership

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.140
are really basic.

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.220
The first is caring about the people you lead.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.480
That's number one.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.240
You know, deep, in the way a father cares for his children,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.720
an officer cares for his troops,

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.280
a president should care for his people.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.560
And that leads inexorably to the next requirement,

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.960
which is bravery, physical courage.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.680
And I believe in that.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.720
And I'm not like some tough guy,

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.660
but I just think it's obvious.

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.280
If you're in charge, you know, I'm at my house

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.420
and I feel like someone broke in.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.260
I'm not gonna say to my wife,

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.560
hey, baby, go deal with the home invasion.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.280
I'm gonna deal with it, because I'm dad, okay?

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.360
So if you're the president of a country

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.980
and your capital city is attacked,

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:29.140
as ours was at the Pentagon, and you run away,

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.020
when the Secret Service told me to,

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.020
bitch, are you in charge?

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.820
Like, who's daddy here, the Secret Service?

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.640
Do you know what I mean?

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.540
I found that totally contemptible.

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.700
And I said so, and man, did I get a lecture,

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.860
not just from Republicans, but from Democrats.

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.020
Oh, you don't know, put yourself in that position.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.460
I was like, okay.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.860
I don't know what I would do under that kind of stress,

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:53.000
enormous stress, I get it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.380
I know one thing I wouldn't do is run away,

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.020
because you can't do that.

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:59.260
And if you're not willing to die for your country,

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.340
then you shouldn't be leading it.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:04.420
So yes, to the extent, if Zelensky really is in Ukraine

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.820
most of the time, amen.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.560
Well, hold on a second, let's clarify.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.900
It's not about whether he's in Ukraine

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:09.900
most of the time or not.

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.540
Well, I thought that was the whole premise of the compliment.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.380
No, no, no, no.

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.260
At the beginning of the war,

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.140
when the tank, when Kiev, when a lot of people thought

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.400
that the second biggest military in the world

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.700
is pointing its guns at Kiev is gonna be taken,

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.900
and a man, a leader, who stays in that city

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.460
and says, fuck it, when everybody around him says flee,

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.460
says everybody around him believes the city will be taken,

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:40.460
or at least destroyed, leveled, artillery, bombs,

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.820
all of this, he chooses to stay.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.300
You know a lot of leaders.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.460
How many leaders would choose to stay?

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.420
Well, the leader of Afghanistan, the US-backed leader,

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.020
when the Taliban came, got in a US plane with US dollars

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.580
and ran away, and of course is living on those dollars.

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.900
So yeah, there's a lot of cowardly behavior.

01:25:58.900 --> 01:25:59.740
Good for him.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.020
I mean, I guess I'm looking at it slightly differently,

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.740
which is what's the option?

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.660
You're the leader of the country.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.740
You can't leave.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.900
Like Stalin never left Moscow during the war.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:13.040
It was surrounded by the Germans, as you know, for a year,

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.140
and he didn't leave.

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.940
And when I was in Russia, they're like,

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.780
Stalin never left.

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.180
It's like, he's the leader of the country.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:21.600
You can't, I mean, that's just table stakes, of course.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.920
I would say, but you raise an interesting,

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.800
by implication question, which is what about Kiev?

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.920
You think the Russians couldn't level Kiev?

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.200
Obviously they could.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.720
Why haven't they?

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.960
They could, but they haven't.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.280
Well, there's military answers to that,

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.880
which is urban warfare is extremely difficult.

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.000
Do you think that Putin wants to take Kiev?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.480
No, I do think he expected Zelensky to flee

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.200
and somebody else to come into power.

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.960
Yeah, that may be totally, I don't know.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.600
I don't think, I have no idea what Putin was thinking

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.160
when he did that about Zelensky.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.640
I didn't ask him, but it's a mistake to imagine

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.620
this is a contest between Putin and Zelensky.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.000
This is Putin versus the US State Department.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.640
I mean, Zelensky, that's why I said I felt sorry for him.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.280
I mean, as I said, we're literally paying the pensions

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.440
of Ukrainian bureaucrats.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.960
So there is no Ukrainian government

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.360
independent of the US government.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.480
And maybe you're for that, maybe you're against it,

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.160
but you can't endorse that in the same sentence

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.520
that you use the term democracy,

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.640
because that's not a democracy, right, obviously.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.700
Well, that's why it's interesting

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.760
that he didn't really bring up NATO extensively.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.520
He wants a settlement, he wants a settlement,

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.640
and he doesn't want to fight with them rhetorically.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.120
And he just wants to get this done.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.920
And he made a bunch of offers at the peace deal.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.760
And we wouldn't even know this happened

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.960
if the Israelis hadn't told us,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.200
I'm so grateful that they did,

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.340
that Johnson was dispatched by the State Department

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.180
to stop it.

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:58.520
And it's like, I mean, I think Boris Johnson

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.320
is a husk of a man, but imagine if you were Boris Johnson

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.200
and you spent your whole life with Ukraine,

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.400
flag pin, I'm for Ukraine,

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.560
and then all those kids died because of what you did.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.000
And the lines haven't really moved.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.400
It hasn't been a victory for Ukraine.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.760
It's not gonna be a victory for Ukraine.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.280
It's like, how do you feel about yourself if you did that?

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.940
I mean, I've done a lot of shitty things in my life.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.620
I feel bad about them.

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.820
But I've never extended a war for no reason.

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:26.220
Like, that's a pretty grave sin in my opinion, you know?

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:29.660
Yes, that was a failure.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.700
But it doesn't mean you can't have a success

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.700
over and over and over,

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.500
keep having negotiations between leaders.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.020
Well, we're not, the US government

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.420
is not allowing negotiations.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:41.860
And so that for me is the most upsetting part.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.820
It's like, in the end, what Russia does,

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.020
I'm not implicated in that.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.820
What Ukraine does, I'm not implicated in that.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.060
I'm not Russian or Ukrainian.

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.480
I'm an American who grew up really believing in my country.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.620
I'm supporting my country through my tax dollars.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.460
And it's like, I really care about

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:57.380
what the US government does

01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.660
because they're doing it in my name.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.820
And I care a lot because I'm American.

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.820
And we're the impediment to peace,

01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.980
which is another way of saying,

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.980
we're responsible for all these innocent people

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.860
getting dragooned out of public parks

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.620
and Kiev and sent to go die.

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:15.060
Like what, that is not good.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060
I'm ashamed of it.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.740
What do you think of Putin saying that justification

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.500
for continuing the war is denazification?

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.420
I thought it was one of the dumbest things I'd ever heard.

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:25.060
I didn't understand what it meant.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.620
Denazification?

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:29.540
It literally means what it sounds like.

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:32.460
You know, yeah, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:35.740
I hate that whole conversation because it's not real.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.580
It's just ad hominem.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.540
It's a way of associating someone with an evil regime

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.740
that doesn't exist anymore.

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:45.740
But in point of fact, Nazism, whatever it was,

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.460
is inseparable from the German nation.

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.340
It was a nationalist movement in Germany.

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.380
There were no other Nazis, right?

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:53.620
There's no book of Nazism.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.540
I'm like, I wanna be a Nazi.

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.860
What does it mean to be a Nazi?

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.100
There's no, there's no Mein Kampf.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.620
There's no Mein Kampf is not Das Kapitel, right?

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.180
Mein Kampf is like, to the extent I understand it,

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.700
it's like he's pissed about the Treaty of Versailles,

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.820
whatever, I'm very anti-Nazi.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:10.580
I'm merely saying there isn't a Nazi movement in 2024.

01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.700
It's a way of calling people evil.

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:18.500
Okay, Putin doesn't like nationalist Ukrainians.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.820
Putin hates nationalism in general, which is interesting.

01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:22.660
But of course he does.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.460
He's got 80 whatever republics

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.020
and he's afraid of nationalist movements.

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.980
He fought a war in Chechnya over this.

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:30.980
So I understand it, but I have a different,

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.140
I'm for national, I'm for American nationalism.

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.820
So like I disagree with Putin on that.

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.860
But calling him Nazis, it's like,

01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:38.220
I thought it was childish.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.820
Well, I do believe that he believes it.

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.820
So that's so interesting.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.020
I agree with that.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.620
I was, cause I was listening to this

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.820
because in the United States,

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.460
everyone's always calling everyone else a Nazi.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:48.300
You're a Nazi.

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.140
Okay.

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.260
But I was listening to this and I was like,

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:56.420
this is the dumbest sort of not convincing line

01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.260
you could take.

01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:59.260
And I sat there and listened to him talk about Nazis

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.260
for like eight minutes.

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:02.580
And I'm like, I think he believes this.

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.580
Yeah, and I actually, you know,

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.380
having had a bunch of conversations with people

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.740
who are living in Russia, they also believe it.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:12.100
Now there's technicalities here,

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:15.060
which the word Nazi, the World War II

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.220
is deeply in the blood of a lot of Russians and Ukrainians.

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.060
I get it, I get it.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.740
So you're using it as almost a political term.

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.780
The way it's used in the United States also,

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.780
like racism and all this kind of stuff,

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.380
since you know you can really touch people

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.220
if you use the Nazi.

01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:30.300
I think that's totally right.

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:35.300
But it's also, to me, a really like disgusting thing to do.

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.180
I agree.

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.980
Because, and also to clarify,

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.700
there is neo-Nazi movements in Ukraine,

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.060
but just very small.

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.420
You're saying that there's this distinction

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:47.220
between Nazi and neo-Nazi, sure.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.460
But it's a small percentage of the population,

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.140
a tiny percentage, they have no power in government.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:57.820
As far, I have seen no data to show they have any influence

01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:02.300
on Zelensky and the Zelensky government at all.

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.020
So really when Putin says denazification,

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.220
I think he means nationalist movements.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.260
I think you're right.

01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:11.460
And I agree with everything you said.

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.220
And I do think that the war, the Second World War,

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.100
occupies a place in Slavic society, Polish society,

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.780
Central Eastern Europe,

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.260
that it does not occupy in the United States.

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:26.580
And you can just look at the death totals,

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.860
tens of millions versus less than half a million.

01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.180
So it's like this eliminated a lot of the male population

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.020
of these countries.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:37.340
Of course, it's still resonant in those countries.

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.620
I get it.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.420
I just, I think I've watched, I don't think I know,

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.380
I've watched the misuse of words,

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.220
the weaponization of words for political reasons

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.780
for so long that I just don't like,

01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:53.820
and though I do engage in it sometime, I'm sorry,

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.540
I don't like just dismissing people in a word.

01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.140
Oh, he's a Nazi, he's a liberal or whatever.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.540
It's like, tell me what you mean.

01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:03.820
What don't you like about what they're doing or saying?

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:06.060
And Nazi especially, I don't even know

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.500
what the hell you're talking about.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.140
What troubled me about that is because he said

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.060
that that's the primary objective currently for the war.

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:18.060
And that because it's not grounded in reality,

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.540
it makes it difficult to then negotiate peace.

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.900
Because like, what does it mean

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.740
to get rid of the Nazis in Ukraine?

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.260
So like, he'll come to the table and say,

01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.540
well, okay, I will agree to do ceasefire

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.020
once the Nazis are gone.

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.940
Okay, so can you list the Nazis?

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.660
Plus, can you negotiate with a Nazi?

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.500
Right, exactly.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.620
No, I totally agree with you.

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:42.060
It was very strange, but maybe it was perhaps

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.780
had to do with speaking to his own population

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:49.580
and also probably trying to avoid the use of the word NATO

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.420
as the justification for the war.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:55.260
Yes, that's all, of course I don't know,

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:57.300
but I suspect you're right on both counts,

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.580
but I would say it points to something

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.420
that I've thought more and more since I did that interview,

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.380
which was like two weeks ago, I guess.

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.340
I didn't think he was like, as a PR guy, not very good.

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.140
Like, he's not good at telling his own story.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:15.100
You know, the story of the current war in Ukraine

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.580
is the eastward expansion of NATO

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.540
and scaring the shit out of the Russians

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.260
with NATO expansion, which is totally unnecessary,

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.580
doesn't help the United States.

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.780
NATO itself doesn't help the United States.

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:27.020
And so I'm not pro-Russian for saying that,

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.660
and I think that's a really compelling story

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.380
because it's true.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.940
He did not tell that story.

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.740
He told some other story that I didn't fully understand.

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.020
Again, I'm not Russian.

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:38.900
He's speaking to multiple audiences around the world.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.220
I'm not sure what he hoped to achieve by that interview.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.940
I will never know, but I did think that.

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.220
Like, this guy is not good at telling his story.

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:50.700
And I also think, honestly, on the basis of a lot,

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.700
I mean, I know this, very isolated during COVID, very.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.500
We keep hearing that he's dying of this or that disease.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:00.340
He's got ALS.

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.140
I mean, I don't know, I'm not his doctor.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.620
There's a ton of lying about it, I know that.

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.580
But one thing that's not a lie is that

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:11.260
he was cloistered away during COVID, I know this,

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:14.180
and only dealing with two or three people.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.700
And that makes you weird.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:18.060
It's so important to deal with a lot of people

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:19.780
to have your views challenged.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.260
You see this with leaders who stay in power too long.

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.620
He's been in power 24 years, effectively.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.340
He's done a, you know, there have been upsides,

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.140
I think for Russia, the Russian economy,

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.780
Russian life expectancy, but there are definitely downsides.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:37.780
And one of them is you get weird and you get autocratic.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.020
You know, like, this is why we have term limits.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:42.620
Very few kings don't get crazy in old age.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.980
Yeah, and you said some of this also

01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:50.660
whilst in your post-Kremlin discussion,

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.180
while you're in Moscow still,

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.580
which was very impressive to me,

01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.940
that you can just openly criticize.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.780
This is great.

01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.620
Well, I don't care.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.620
I understand this.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.340
I just wish you did some more of that

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.100
also with the supermarket video,

01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.940
and perhaps some more of that with Putin in front of you.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.340
But I understand- Putin in front of me,

01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.060
and be like, I'm such a good person.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:12.220
I know you see it as virtue signaling.

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:13.620
Yeah, it is.

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:15.180
Have you seen some of the interview

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.060
he did with some NBC News child?

01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:17.900
I understand.

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.980
So I think you're just so annoyed

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.420
about how bad journalists are,

01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:25.300
that you just didn't wanna be them.

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:27.100
Yeah, that's probably right, actually.

01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:31.780
Some great conversations will involve some challenging,

01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:34.100
like you were confused about denazification.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:37.020
Well, first of all, I accept your criticism,

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:40.700
and I accept it as true that in some way

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:43.940
I'm probably pivoting against what I dislike.

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:47.460
And I have such contempt for American journalists

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.700
on the basis of so much knowledge

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.940
that I probably was like, I don't wanna be like that.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:54.460
That is a kind of defensiveness and dumb.

01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.060
So, you're right.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.700
As for the Nazi thing, I was like,

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.220
I really felt like we were just speaking

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.420
so far past each other that we would never like come to.

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:06.260
I was like, I don't even know

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.700
what the hell you're talking about.

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.020
And that, and especially when I decided

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.060
or concluded that he really meant it,

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.820
I was like, that's just too freaking weird to me.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.380
It's almost like, yeah, I can think of many other examples.

01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:20.500
When you're interviewing someone,

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.300
they'll say something that's like,

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.020
I was interviewing a guy one time

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:28.500
and he started talking about the black Israelites

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:29.620
and we're the real Jews.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.260
And I was like, you know, and it wasn't on camera,

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.900
but I was like, I don't, that was so,

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:36.820
it was so far out to me that I was like,

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:41.820
we'll never kind of understand common terms on that.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.940
So, you mentioned there's a bunch of conspiracy theories

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.060
about Putin's health.

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.100
How was he in person?

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.260
Like, what did he feel like?

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.540
Did he look healthy?

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.460
You know, I'm not a health person myself.

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:57.380
So, I mean, I can easily gain 30 pounds and not know it.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.740
So, like, I'm probably not a great person to ask,

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740
but no, he seemed fine.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:05.060
He seemed, he had his arm hooked through a chair.

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:07.020
And I heard people say, well, he's got Parkinson's.

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:11.420
And Parkinson's can be controlled, I know,

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.620
for periods with drugs.

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.180
So, it's hard to assess.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.740
I'm just not, one of the tells of Parkinson's is gait.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.300
You know how a person walks, I think.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.260
And his walking seemed fine.

01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.900
I walked around with him and talked to him off camera.

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:29.060
He's had some work done, for sure.

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:29.900
I mean, 71 or two.

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.140
Classics, you mean like visual purposes?

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.220
Yeah, I'm 54.

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.380
He's like almost 20 years older than me.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.780
He looked younger than me.

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:37.940
What was that like, the conversation off camera?

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:40.220
Like, you walking around with him?

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.860
What was the content of the conversation?

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.580
I mean, I can't, you know, I feel bad,

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.780
even with Putin or anybody,

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:48.100
like talking about stuff that is off the record.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:53.100
But I'll just say that when I said

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.740
that he didn't wanna fight with NATO

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:59.620
or with the US State Department or with Joe Biden

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:01.060
because he wants a settlement,

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:06.660
that's a very informed perspective.

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:11.700
He doesn't, you know, say whatever you want about that,

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.940
believe it or not, but that is true.

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.940
So, he's open for peace.

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:20.340
For peace and appreciation.

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:26.700
Russia tried to join NATO in 2000.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.380
That's a fact, okay?

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.540
They tried to join NATO.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:30.540
So, just think about this.

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.020
NATO exists to keep Russia contained.

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.020
It exists as a bulwark

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.740
against Russian territorial expansion.

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:42.780
And whether or not Russia has any territorial ambitions

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.980
is another question.

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.860
Like, why would it?

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.260
It's the largest landmass in the world, whatever.

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:48.580
But that's why it exists.

01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:51.780
So, if Russia seeks to join NATO,

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:55.820
it is by definition a sign that NATO's job is done here.

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.100
We can declare victory and go home.

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.340
The fact that they turned him down

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.780
is like so shocking to me, but it's true.

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.540
Then he approaches the next president, George W. Bush.

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.980
That was with Bill Clinton at the end of his term in 2000.

01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:10.220
He approached the next president and said,

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:14.300
let's in our next missile deal, let's align on this,

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:18.340
and we'll designate Iran as our common enemy.

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.620
Iran, which is now effectively in league with Russia,

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.500
thanks to our insane policies.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:29.420
But, and George W. Bush, to his credit's like,

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:31.540
well, that seems like kind of an innovative, good idea.

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.900
And Condi Rice, who's like one of the stupidest people

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:36.260
ever to hold power in the United States, if I can say,

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.340
who's like monomaniacally anti-Russia

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.780
because she had an advisor at Stanford

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.820
who was or something during the Cold War.

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.940
No, we can't do that.

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:43.860
And Bush is just weak.

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:44.700
And so he agreed.

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:46.340
It's like, what?

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.620
That is crazy.

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.740
If you're fighting with someone and the person says,

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:54.020
you know what, actually our interests align,

01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:56.660
and you've spent 80% of your mental disk space

01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:58.460
on hating me and opposing me or whatever,

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:01.260
but actually we can be on the same team.

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:05.620
If you don't at least see that as progress, like what?

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.020
Why would you, if your interest is in helping your country,

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:13.340
what would be the, what's the counter-argument?

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.540
I don't even understand it.

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:17.460
And no one has even addressed any of this.

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.220
The war of Russian aggression.

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.580
Yeah, it was a war of Russian aggression for sure.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:24.300
But how did, how did we get there?

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.180
We got there because Joe Biden and Tony Blinken

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.860
dispatched Kamala Harris, who does not freelance this stuff,

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:34.780
okay, fair to say, to the Munich Security Conference

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.740
two years ago this month, February, 2022,

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.380
and said in a press conference to Zelensky, poor Zelensky,

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.700
we want you to join NATO.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.060
This was not in a backroom thing.

01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.780
This was in public at a press conference,

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.580
knowing, because he said it like 4,000 times,

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.540
we don't want nuclear weapons from the United States

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:59.540
or NATO on our Western border, duh.

01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:03.100
And days later he invaded.

01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.540
So like, what is that?

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:09.340
And if you even, I raised that question in my previous job

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.300
and I was denounced as of course a traitor or something,

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.060
but okay, great, I'm a traitor.

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.580
What's the answer?

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.860
What's the answer?

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:20.020
These are not, you know, Toria Nguyen, who I know,

01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.860
not dumb, hasn't helped the US in any way,

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.780
an architect of the Iraq war, architect of this disaster,

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:27.220
one of the people who destroyed the US dollar,

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.380
okay, fine, but she's not stupid.

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:33.400
So like, you're trying to get a war by acting that way.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.700
What's the other explanation?

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.940
By the way, NATO didn't want Ukraine

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:40.380
because it didn't meet the criteria.

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:43.420
So for admission, so why would you say that?

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.060
Because you want a war, that's why.

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.940
And that war has enriched a lot of people

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.780
to the tune of billions.

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:52.940
So I don't care if I sound like

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:55.020
some kind of left-wing conspiracy nut

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.060
because I'm neither left-wing nor a conspiracy nut.

01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.460
Tell me how I'm wrong.

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.980
Who do you think is behind it?

01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:03.600
If you were to analyze, like zoom out,

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.260
looking at the entirety of human history,

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.940
the military industrial complex,

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.940
you said Kamala Harris, is it individuals?

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:14.900
Is it like this collective flock

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.580
that people are just pro-war as a collective?

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:18.980
It's the hive mind.

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.260
It's, and I spent my whole life in DC

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:24.940
from 85 to 2020, so 35 years.

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.220
And again, I grew up around it in that world.

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:33.100
And I do think that conspiracies,

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.240
of course there are conspiracies,

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.540
but in general, the hive mind is responsible

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.580
for the worst decisions.

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:40.260
It's a bunch of people with the same views,

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:43.960
totally views that have not been updated in decades.

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:48.800
Putin said something that I thought was absolutely true.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.820
I don't know how he would know this,

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.340
but it is true because I lived among them.

01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.580
So the Soviet Union dissolves in August of 91

01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.820
on my honeymoon in Bermuda, I'll never forget it.

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.500
And it was a big thing.

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.180
If you lived in DC, I mean, the receptionist in my office

01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.180
in 1991 was getting a master's in Russian from Georgetown.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:10.280
He was gonna be a Sovietologist.

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.460
And he was among thousands of people in Washington

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:13.900
on that same track.

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.660
And so the Soviet Union collapses.

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.900
Well, so does the rationale for like,

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:22.180
a good portion of the US government has been dedicated

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.120
for over 40 years to opposing this thing

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.260
that no longer exists.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.780
So there's a lot of forward momentum.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.940
There's a huge amount of money, the bulk of the money

01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:31.460
in the richest country in the world aimed in this direction.

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:36.460
And it's very hard for people to readjust, to reassess.

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.740
And you see this in life all the time.

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:41.620
I love my wife.

01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:43.740
All of a sudden, she ran off with my best friend.

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.500
Holy shit, I didn't expect that this morning.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.340
Now it's a reality.

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:47.320
Like, how do I deal with that?

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.980
Well, I got stage four cancer diagnosis, okay?

01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.220
It's all bad, but I'm just saying,

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.380
that's the nature of life.

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:56.740
Things you did not anticipate,

01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.940
never thought you'd have to face happen out of nowhere.

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:03.900
And you have to adjust your expectations and your goals.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.420
And people have a hard time with that,

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:06.460
very hard time with that.

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.460
So that's a lot of it.

01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:14.460
If you're Condi Rice, sort of like highly ambitious midwit

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:17.380
who gets this degree from Stanford,

01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:19.860
and you read Tolstoy in the original, sure you did.

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:22.460
And you spent your whole life thinking

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.700
that Russia is the center of evil in the world.

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.020
It's kind of hard to be like,

01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:31.260
well, actually there's a new threat

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:32.620
and it's coming from farther East.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:35.220
It's primarily an economic threat.

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.500
And maybe all the threats aren't reduced to tank battles.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.820
That's the other thing,

01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:42.420
is these people are so inelastic in their thinking,

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:45.620
so lacking imagination and flexibility,

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:49.580
that they can't sort of imagine like a new framework.

01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:51.740
And the new framework is not that you're gonna go to war

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.460
with China over Formosa, Taiwan.

01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.380
No, the framework is that all of a sudden,

01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:00.140
all the infrastructure in Tijuana

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:01.860
is gonna be built by China.

01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.740
And like, that's a different kind of threat,

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.100
but they can't kind of get there

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.820
because they're not that impressive.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.260
So you actually have mentioned this,

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:12.340
it's not just the Cold War, it's World War II

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:16.700
that populates most of their thinking in Washington.

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:21.060
You mentioned Churchill, Chamberlain and Hitler,

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.580
and they kind of seeing the World War II

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.540
as the kind of the good war and the successful role

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.180
the United States played in that war.

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:33.500
They're kind of seeing that dynamic,

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.340
that geopolitical dynamic

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:38.500
and applying it everywhere else still.

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:42.340
Yeah, it's a template for everything.

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.820
And I think it's of huge significance

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:46.980
to the development of the West,

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.020
to the civilization we live in now, to world history.

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.540
It was a world war.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.100
And so I think it's worth knowing a lot about

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.620
and being honest about and all the rest,

01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.060
but it's hardly the sum total of human history.

01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:01.060
It's a snapshot.

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:06.060
And so you keep hearing people refer to not even the war,

01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.980
no one ever talks about the war.

01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.420
Like, how much does Tony Blinken know

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:11.860
about the Battle of Stalingrad?

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:14.420
Probably zero, doesn't know anything,

01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.060
largest battle in human history, but I mean, he knows nothing.

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:21.060
But he knows a lot about the cliches surrounding

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:25.540
the 38 to 40 period, 1938 to 1940.

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:30.540
And everything is kind of expressed through that formula.

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.300
And not everything is that formula, that's all I'm saying.

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:37.980
And the Republicans have a strange weakness for it,

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.860
particularly the closeted ones,

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:42.260
the weird ones who have no life

01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.820
other than starting more wars.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:49.460
Everything to them, the most vulnerable, I would say,

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.940
among them, emotionally, psychologically vulnerable,

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.220
the dumbest, they will always say the same thing.

01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.620
And it appeals to Republican voters, unfortunately,

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.620
that every problem is the result of weakness.

01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.700
Everyone's Chamberlain.

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:05.380
Like Germany never would have gone in

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.900
to Poland and Czechoslovakia if England had been stronger.

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:09.720
That's the argument.

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.560
Is that true?

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.820
I don't know, actually.

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:13.420
Maybe, it might be totally true.

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.540
It might not be true at all.

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.380
I really don't know, but not everything is that.

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:20.020
That's not always true.

01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:21.700
If I go up to you in a bar and I say,

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.700
I hate your necktie,

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.180
I'm being pretty aggressive with you, pretty strong.

01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.460
You might beat the shit out of me, actually,

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.820
or shoot me if I do that.

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.860
Like an aggressive posture doesn't always get you

01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:32.300
the outcome that you want.

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:35.260
Sometimes it requires a more sophisticated

01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:36.180
Mediterranean posture.

01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:37.140
I mean, it kind of depends.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.180
It's a time and place thing.

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.500
And they don't acknowledge that.

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.700
It's like everything is this same template.

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.860
And I just, that's not the road

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.740
to good decision-making at all.

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.020
Since we're on the time period,

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.200
let me ask you a kind of almost cliche question,

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.860
but it applies to you,

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.300
which you've interviewed a lot of world leaders.

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:58.140
If you had the chance to interview Hitler

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.000
in 39, 40, 41,

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.240
first of all, would you do it and how would you do it?

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.040
I assume you would do it, given who you are.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.900
Man, it would be a massive cost for doing it.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.680
It may destroy my life to interview Putin,

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.700
though I can tell you as much as I want

01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:17.220
that I'm not a Putin defender.

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.420
I only care about the United States.

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:19.580
That's 100% true.

01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:20.660
Anyone who knows me will tell you what's true.

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:22.140
I keep saying it.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.860
But history may record me to the extent

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:27.100
it records me at all as a tool of Putin,

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.260
a hater of America.

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:31.300
You know, that seems absurd to me,

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.380
but absurd things happen.

01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.740
What would I ask Hitler?

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:36.220
I don't even know.

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:40.900
I guess that I would probably ask him what I asked Putin,

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.240
which is what I ask everybody.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.160
Like, what's your motive?

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.900
Why did you do, I mean, if he'd already gone into Poland,

01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.220
like, why are you doing that?

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.380
You know, what's your goal?

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.280
And then, you know, the question is,

01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:54.540
is he gonna answer honestly?

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.380
I don't know.

01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.980
You know, you can't make someone answer a question honestly.

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:03.060
You can only sort of shut up while they talk

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.180
and then let people decide what they think of the answer.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.540
Well, just like in the bar fight, there's different ways.

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.740
There are different ways, that's exactly right.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.580
That's exactly, man, is that true?

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.300
That is absolutely right.

01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:16.420
I mean, your energy with Putin, for example,

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.860
was such that it felt like he could trust you.

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.740
I felt like he could tell you a lot.

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.580
I think-

01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.220
I just wanted to get it on the record.

01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:26.060
Yes.

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:26.980
That's all I wanted, you know?

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:29.860
I think it was extremely, like, we have to acknowledge

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.580
how important that interview was for the record

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:36.600
and for opening the door for conversation.

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.100
Like, opening the door to conversation

01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:40.140
literally is the path to, like,

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:42.940
more conversations and peace, peace talks.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.140
Well, I would flip it around and say,

01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:46.100
anyone who seeks to shut that down

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.980
by focusing on a supermarket video or four minutes

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:52.460
versus a two-hour and 15-minute long interview

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.360
with a world leader, anyone who doesn't want

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.420
more conversation, who wants fewer facts,

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.900
fewer perspectives, is totalitarian.

01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:02.340
Probably doesn't have good intent.

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:04.220
I mean, I can honestly say,

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:06.460
for all my many manifold faults,

01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:10.040
I've never tried to, like, make people shut up.

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.380
You know, I just, it's not in me.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.080
I don't believe in that.

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.640
Putin's folks have shown interest for quite a while

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.860
to speaking with me, so you've spoken with him.

01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.560
What advice would you give?

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.680
Oh, do it immediately.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.600
How's your Russian, by the way?

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:31.520
Have you kept up with it?

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.360
Yeah, fluent.

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.420
So it would most likely be in Russian.

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.680
So that's the other thing is,

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.680
I do have a question about language barriers.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.760
Did you feel it was annoying?

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.320
It's horrible.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.160
It's horrible.

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.520
I mean, I don't have much of a technique as an interviewer,

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.680
other than listen really carefully.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:52.280
That's my only skill.

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.640
I don't have the best questions.

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:56.360
I certainly don't have the best questions.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.880
All I do that I'm proud of and that I think works

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.320
is I just listen super carefully.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.240
I never let a word go by that I'm not paying attention.

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.440
It exhausts me, actually.

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:08.240
But you can't do that in a foreign language

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.560
because there's a delay.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.400
Here, I'm just whining, but it's real.

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.160
It's not whining.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:16.640
Can you actually describe the technical details of that?

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.000
Are you hearing concurrently at the same time?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.440
Yes, but there's a massive lag.

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.520
So what's happening is, so the translator,

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.840
so we were, of course, extremely uptight

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.920
about the logistical details.

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:32.160
So we brought our own cameraman,

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.360
who I've been around the world with,

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.840
who worked at Fox, came with me now, amazing.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.840
And he did, I mean, it was,

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:42.200
our cameras, lighting, everything.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.520
Like we had full control of that

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.680
and we had control of the tape.

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.320
The Russians also had their own cameras

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.520
and I don't know what they did with it.

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.600
But we had full control of that

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.800
and we brought our own translator.

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:52.800
We got our own translator because I just,

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.560
you don't trust anyone, right?

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.040
So I think we had a good translator.

01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.280
We had two of them, actually,

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.200
and because they get exhausted.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.400
But the problem is, from my perspective,

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.080
as someone who's like trying to think of a follow-up

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.840
and listen to the answer,

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.120
Putin will talk and you can, in part of your ear,

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:14.280
hear the Slavic sounds.

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:17.360
And then over that is a guy

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.720
with a Slavic accent speaking English.

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.160
And then you can hear Putin stop talking

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.480
and then this guy's answer goes on for another 15, 20 seconds.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:28.400
So it's super disconcerting and it's really hard.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.040
And the other thing is it doesn't matter

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.200
how good your translators are.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.440
I'm interested in language.

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.200
I speak only English fluently.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.960
And, but I'm really interested in language.

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:41.160
And I know, and I work in language,

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.280
it doesn't matter how good your translator is.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:47.160
In literature and in conversation,

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:50.640
you miss so much if the language is moving.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.400
I mean, you see this in Bible study,

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.400
you see it in Dostoevsky, you see it everywhere.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:59.560
If you don't speak Aramaic, Hebrew, Russian,

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.640
you're not really getting,

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.560
I mean, even in romance languages.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.960
Like I, you know, I like Balzac, okay.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.440
I like, it was obviously written in French.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:14.080
You read Paragorio, it's an amazing novel, hilarious.

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.600
And it's like, you're not really getting it.

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:17.440
And it's not that, you know,

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.440
French and English are not that far apart.

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.120
Russian, like what?

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.280
Plus conversation.

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.200
So the chemistry of conversation, the humor, the wit,

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.440
the play with words, all this stuff.

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.280
Exactly.

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.120
And my understanding of Russian

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.200
as a lover of Russian literature and English

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.680
is that it's not a simple language at all.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.040
The grammar's complex.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.960
There's a lot that's expressed

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.400
that will be lost in the translation.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.840
So yes, I mean, the fact that you speak native Russian,

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.920
I mean, I would run that walk to that interview

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.320
because I think it would just be amazing.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.200
You would get so much more out of it than I did.

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:56.120
And we should say that you've met a lot of world leaders.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.120
Both Zelensky and Putin are intelligent, witty, even funny.

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.800
So like there's a depth to the person

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:07.360
that can be explored through a conversation

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.120
just on that element, the linguistic element.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.480
And Putin speaks decent English.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.840
I spoke to him in English, so I know that.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.160
But he's not comfortable with it at all.

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:18.000
But Zelensky is, I think.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.160
No, he is.

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.920
Well, he's better than Putin at English,

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.480
but he's still the humor, like the intelligence,

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.760
all of that is not quite there in English.

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.880
He says simple points, but the guy's a comedian

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:32.240
and he's a comedian primarily in Russian,

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.480
the Russian language.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:36.720
So the Ukrainian language is now used mostly

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:41.280
primarily as a kind of symbol of independence.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.120
I'm aware of that.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.560
It's a political decision, no, I know.

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:47.200
He is, really his native language is Russian language.

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.520
Of course, as a lot of people in Ukraine.

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.120
You can also understand his position

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.760
that he might not want to be speaking Russian publicly.

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.920
That's something I've...

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.520
I don't think they're allowed to speak in Russian

01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.040
some places in Ukraine, right?

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.840
That's one of the reasons that Russia was so mad

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:03.360
is that they were attacking language

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.560
and that's a fair complaint.

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.880
Like, what?

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.200
And by the way, if you haven't been to Moscow in a while,

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.920
you should see it and you will pick up a million things

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.880
that were invisible to me

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.320
and you should assess it for yourself.

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.840
And my strong advice would be,

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.480
even if you don't interview Putin,

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.560
go over there, spend a week there,

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.720
and assess what you think.

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.640
I mean, how restricted does the society feel?

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.960
I mean, it would take a lot of balls to do this

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.720
because you will...

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:31.320
I mean, whatever you decide,

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.080
you will be sucked into conversations

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.960
that have nothing to do with you, political conversations.

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.680
You're obviously not a political activist, right?

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.520
You're an interviewer,

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.560
but I think it would be so interesting.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.920
But for an interview itself,

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.080
is there advice you have about how to carry an interview?

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.160
It is fundamentally different

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:50.120
when you do it in the native language, but...

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:51.560
Yes, I mean, I think,

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.600
I approached the...

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.800
And maybe I did it incorrectly,

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.600
but this was the product of a lot of thought.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:01.280
I was coming into that interview aware

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.360
that he hadn't given an interview at all

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.800
with anybody since the war started.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.720
So I had a million different questions.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.320
And as noted, I didn't ask them

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.920
because I just wanted to focus on the war.

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.960
But I mean, there's so many...

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.600
I'll send you my notes that I wrote.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.200
I was like a diligent little girl with...

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.040
That would be amazing.

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:19.880
But I think...

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:20.800
It was my interview.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.520
All these questions and...

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:24.840
Some of them I thought were pretty funny.

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.280
In your case, I think the very fact of the interview

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.120
was the most important.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:29.960
Yeah, that's probably right.

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:30.800
I did have...

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.200
The question that I really wanted to ask

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.080
that I was almost gonna ask

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.120
because it made me laugh out loud.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.240
I was sitting, having, drinking coffee

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.760
before my producers.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.280
And I was like, I'm gonna go there.

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:43.240
My first question is gonna be, Mr. President,

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:46.200
I've been here in the Kremlin for two days preparing.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.920
And I haven't seen a single African-American

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920
in a position of power in the Kremlin.

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:51.760
Sure.

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.600
I thought that's too culturally specific and dry.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.720
And he'd be like, this guy's freaking crazy.

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.800
Yeah, you don't wanna open with the crazy guy.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.640
No, I know.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.480
With humor.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.300
I know.

01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.140
All right.

01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:04.980
It doesn't translate.

01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:05.820
It doesn't.

01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.320
Oh yeah, and there'll be a small delay

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:10.280
where you have to wait for the job to see if it lands or not.

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:11.480
This is not America.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:17.560
At Fox, you were for a time the most popular host.

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.520
After Fox, you've garnered a huge amount

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.000
of attention as well.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.320
Same, probably more.

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.080
Do you worry that popularity

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.000
and just that attention gets to your head

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.520
is a kind of drug that clouds your thinking?

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.520
You think?

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.320
I live in a spiritual graveyard of people killed

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.680
by the quest for fame, yes.

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.320
I have lived in it.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.040
I mean, I would say the one advantage,

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.080
the two advantages I have.

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:47.600
One, I have a happy family and a stable family

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:49.080
and a stable group of friends.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.880
Which is just the greatest blessing

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:56.880
and a strong love of nature and that my family shares.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.280
So, you know, I'm in nature every day

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:03.000
and I have a whole series of rituals designed

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.540
to keep me from becoming the asshole

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.880
that I could easily become.

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.280
But no, of course.

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.800
I mean, that's what I, you know,

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.760
and I don't want to beat up on,

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.040
I'm grateful to Elon who gave me a platform

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.920
and I mean that sincerely,

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:22.560
but I definitely don't spend a lot of time

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:25.400
on social media or on the internet for that exact reason.

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:28.760
Well, first of all, I think it's, as I've said,

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:32.000
a much more controlled environment than we acknowledge

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.920
and I don't want lies in my head.

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:36.960
But I also don't want to become the sort of person

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.560
who's seeking the adulation of strangers.

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.960
I think that's soul poison.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:46.200
And I said earlier that I think that the desire for power

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.360
and money will kill you.

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:51.080
And I believe that and I've seen it a lot.

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:55.080
But I also think the desire for the love of people

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.960
you don't know is every bit as poisonous, maybe more so.

01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:01.320
And so, yes, and it's not just because I've, you know,

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:04.360
obviously spent most of my life in public.

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.960
And in fact, I don't spend my life in public

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.480
and I'm a completely private person,

02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.000
but professionally I've spent my life in public.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.840
It's not just that, it's like social media

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.040
makes everybody into a cable news host.

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.720
We were talking off the air, my new,

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.040
I just, I'm obsessed with this.

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.800
I don't know enough about it, but here's what I do know.

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:24.760
South Korea, amazing country, great people.

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.680
I grew up around Koreans, probably no group,

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.480
if I can generalize about a group

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:32.480
that I like more than Koreans are just smart,

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:35.080
funny, honest, brave.

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.040
I really like Koreans, I always have, my whole life.

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.480
Growing up in Southern California with Koreans.

02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.280
South Korea is like dying, it's literally dying.

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.160
It's way below replacement rate and fertility.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:47.840
Its suicide rate is astronomical.

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.560
Why is that?

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:53.600
It's a rich country, but of course I don't know the answer.

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.840
But I suspect it has something to do

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.440
with the penetration of technology

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.080
into South Korean society is I think one of the highest,

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.160
certainly one of the highest in the world.

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.800
People live online there.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.080
And there was a belief for a bunch of reasons

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.160
in South Korea that Western technology

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.920
would be a liberating progressive force.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.800
And I think it's been the opposite.

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.160
It's my sense, strong sense.

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.400
And I think it's true in this country too.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.960
I don't understand how people can ignore

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.840
the decline in life expectancy or the rise in fentanyl use.

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:26.080
Like it's not just about China shipping precursor chemicals

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.240
to Mexico, it's like, why would you take that shit?

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.080
I hope those two things aren't coupled.

02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.080
Technological advancement and the erosion.

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.080
Well, let me ask you, and I know you're a technologist

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.680
and I respect it, and there's a lot about technology

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.880
that I like and have benefited from.

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.200
I had back surgery and it worked, okay?

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.520
So I'm not against all technology.

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.240
But can you name a technology, a big technology

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.840
in the last 20 years that we can say conclusively

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.760
has improved people's lives?

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.480
Well, conclusive is a tough thing.

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.720
Pretty conclusively that we can brag about.

02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.760
I think, well, you've criticized Google search recently,

02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:04.800
but I think making the world knowledge accessible

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:08.280
to anyone, anywhere across the world through Google search.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.160
Well, I love that.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.080
I love that idea.

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.240
Are people better informed?

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.680
Or are they more superstitious and misled

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.200
than they were 20 years ago?

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.760
It's not close.

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:18.600
No, I don't know.

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.360
I think they are more informed.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.440
It's just revealing the ignorance.

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:25.160
The internet has revealed the ignorance that people have,

02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:28.160
but I think the ignorance has been decreasing gradually.

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:31.000
And if you look, even you can criticize places

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.640
like Wikipedia a lot.

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.880
And very many aspects of Wikipedia are very biased.

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:39.800
But when you, most of it are actually topics

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.240
that don't have any bias in them

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.600
because they're not political or so on.

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.480
There's no battle over those topics.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.920
And most of Wikipedia.

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.760
I think that's true.

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.240
Is like the fastest way to learn about a thing.

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.440
I couldn't agree more.

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.520
You can very quickly imagine you're an expert

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.040
and that may be the problem.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.600
I think, no, I just experienced it in Moscow.

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.040
It's like, again, I feel like I'm in the top 1%

02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:04.080
for information, certainly intake, because it's my job.

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.320
And I had literal, and I'm always out of the country.

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.360
I've been around the world many times.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.760
I feel like I know a lot about the rest of the world

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.240
or I thought I did.

02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.000
And how did I not know any of that?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.560
And maybe I'm just like unusually ignorant or something

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.640
or reading the wrong things.

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:22.560
I don't know what it was,

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.560
but all I know is the digital information sources

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.120
that I use to understand just something as simple

02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:34.440
as what's the city of Moscow like were completely inadequate.

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:38.280
And anyway, look, I just am worried

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.120
that we're missing the obvious signs.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.120
And the obvious signs are reproduction,

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.920
life expectancy, sobriety.

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.960
If you have a society where people just can't deal

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.480
with being sober, don't wanna have children

02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.560
and are dying younger, you have an extremely sick,

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:04.080
you have a suicidal society, okay?

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.800
And I'm not even blaming anyone for it.

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.360
I'm just saying objectively that is true.

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.600
And the measure of a health of your society

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.000
is the number of children that you have

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.240
and how well they do.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.320
It's super simple.

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.760
That's the next generation, we all die.

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.400
And what replaces us?

02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.000
And if you don't care, then you're suicidal

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.280
and maybe other things too.

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.480
But that's all I'm saying.

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:28.920
So what happened to South Korea?

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.920
Like, why can't anyone answer the question?

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.400
They're great people, they're rich.

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.400
They have all these advantages.

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.720
They're on the cutting edge of every American,

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.680
for a foreign country, they're more American

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:43.400
than maybe any other country other than Canada.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.480
And like, what happened?

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.640
And I mean, your fundamental worry is the same kind

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.920
of thing might be happening

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.760
or will happen in the United States.

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.800
Well, let me just ask you this.

02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.080
I think North Korea seems like the most dystopian,

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.520
horrible place in the world, right?

02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:58.120
Obviously, it's a byword for dystopia, right?

02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:01.360
North Korean, I use it all the time and I mean it.

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.680
If in a hundred years, there are more North Koreans

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:06.840
still alive than there are South Koreans,

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.240
what does that tell us?

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.920
Yeah, that's something to worry about.

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:11.760
But also-

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.640
But like, how did it happen?

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.480
Like, why?

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:15.320
I'm interested in the why.

02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:17.160
This is a question I asked Putin, you know,

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.800
sometimes we don't know why, but why does no one ask why?

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:24.960
I've seen a lot of increased distrust in science,

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.400
which is deserved in many places.

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.880
It just worries me because some

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.880
of the greatest inventions of humanity come from science

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.680
and technological innovation.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.640
Okay, then let me ask you a couple of questions

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.800
and perhaps you have the answer.

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:40.920
And I've always assumed that was true.

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:42.400
And I should say that when I was a kid,

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:45.120
I lived in La Jolla, California next to the Salk Institute

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.800
named after Jonah Salk, a resident of La Jolla, California

02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:50.200
who created the polio vaccine and saved untold millions.

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:53.680
And so my belief, which is still my belief actually,

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.520
that's a great thing.

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:57.720
It's one of the great additions to human flourishing ever.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:03.600
But if technology is so great,

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.560
why is life expectancy going down

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.320
and why are fewer people having kids?

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.920
And why would anybody who has internet access

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:12.000
ever use fentanyl?

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.120
What is that?

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:15.520
What is going on?

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.320
And until we can answer that question,

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:20.200
I think we have to assume the question

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:22.520
of whether technology is a net good or net bad

02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:25.920
is unresolved, like at best, right?

02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:29.000
At best, perhaps, but technology is the very tool

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.600
which will allow us to have that kind of discourse

02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.800
to figure out, to do science better.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.040
I mean, I want that to be true.

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:38.000
And when you said that the internet allows people

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.840
to escape the darkness of ignorance,

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.120
man, that resonated with me because I felt that way

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.480
in 1993 for when it was first starting

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.120
and I first got on it.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:47.720
And I thought, man, this is amazing.

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:49.840
You can talk for free to anyone around the world.

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.480
This is gonna be great.

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.360
But let me just ask you this.

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:53.640
This is something I've never gotten over

02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:55.320
or gotten a straight answer to.

02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:58.480
Why is it that in any European city,

02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:01.200
the greatest buildings, indisputably,

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.880
were built before electricity and the machine age?

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:07.840
Why has no one ever built a medieval cathedral

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.400
in the modern era, ever?

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:12.360
Well, what is that?

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.120
Indisputably, you have a presumption

02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:17.200
we have a good definition of what beauty is.

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:18.160
There's a lot of people-

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:19.120
Right, let's be specific.

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:21.520
Pick a European city or any city in the world

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:24.920
and tell me that there's a prettier building

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.040
than, say, Notre Dame before it was set fire to.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.840
There's other sources of prettiness and beauty.

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.520
Purely in architecture, of course.

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.600
Trees are prettier than any building, in my opinion.

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:35.800
So I agree with that.

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:40.800
But also there could be, I grew up in the pre-internet age.

02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:42.400
Good.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:44.480
But if you grew up in the internet age,

02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.080
I think your eyes would be more open to beauty

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.720
that's digital, that is in a digital world.

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:51.920
I'm not discounting the possibility

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.280
of digital beauty at all.

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:56.240
And the Ted Kaczynski in me wants to,

02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.720
but that's too close-minded.

02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:58.560
I agree.

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:00.680
I'm completely willing to believe

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.680
there is such a thing as digital beauty.

02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:04.800
I have digital pictures on my phone of my dogs and kids,

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:06.040
so I know that there is.

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:09.080
But purely in the realm of architecture,

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:11.560
because it's limited and it is

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.280
one of the pure expressions of human creativity.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:18.720
We need places to live and work and worship and eat.

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:22.080
And so we build buildings and every civilization has.

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:25.000
But the machine age, the industrial age,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.840
seemed to have decreased the quality

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:32.240
and the beauty in that one expression

02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:33.880
of human creativity, architecture.

02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.200
And why is that?

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.440
Well, I could also argue that I'm a big sucker for bridges.

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.720
And modern bridges can give older bridges

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.960
that run for their money.

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:46.760
I like bridges too, so I agree with you, sort of.

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:48.880
But like the Brooklyn Bridge,

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.760
I don't know that there's any modern bridges,

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.120
that was built in late 19th century,

02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.400
very much in the industrial age.

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:02.600
But I'm just saying like the great cathedrals of Europe,

02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:05.320
even the pyramids, whoever built them.

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.040
It doesn't, it seems like, it's like super obvious.

02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.760
I'm just like, I'm dealing on the autism level here,

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.880
just like, well, why is that?

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:15.480
But that's a good way to start.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.680
If all of a sudden you have electricity and hydraulics

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.920
and you have access to, I mean,

02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:23.600
I have machines in my wood shop at home

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.040
that are so much more advanced than anything

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:30.320
than any cathedral builder in 15th century Europe had.

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.400
And yet there's neither I nor anyone I know

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:34.200
could even begin to understand

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.960
how a flying buttress was built, right?

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:39.960
And so what is that?

02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:42.560
And the other question is also consider

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.400
that whatever is creating this technology is unstoppable.

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.360
Well, there's that.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.760
And the question is like, how do you steer it then?

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:54.160
You have to look in a realist way at the world

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.800
and say that if you don't, somebody else will.

02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.120
And you want to do it in a safe way.

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.720
I mean, this is the Manhattan Project.

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.120
Was the Manhattan Project a good idea

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:05.360
to create nuclear weapons?

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.680
That's an easy call.

02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:07.520
No.

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:09.560
For me, it's an easy call in retrospect.

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.240
In retrospect, yes.

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.320
Because it seems like it stopped world wars.

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.880
So the mutually assured destruction

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.000
seems to have ended wars, ended major military.

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:21.560
What?

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.800
80 years, not even 80 years, 79.

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:30.800
And so we haven't had a world war in 79 years.

02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:34.080
But one nuclear exchange would, of course,

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.640
kill more people than all wars in human history combined.

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:40.000
You saying 79 makes it sound like you're counting.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.360
I am counting because I think it,

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.000
obviously it's like completely demonic

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.080
and everyone pretends like it's great.

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:47.560
Nuclear weapons are evil.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:48.400
Yeah, no, absolutely.

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.000
Most of them is evil.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.320
And the technology itself is evil.

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:53.800
And in my opinion, I mean, it's like,

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.680
if you can't, that's just so obvious.

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:58.320
And that's what I'm saying is like,

02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.720
I'm not against all technology.

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.120
I took a shower this morning.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.200
It was powered by an electric pump,

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.680
heated by a water heater.

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.280
Like I loved it.

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.760
I sat in an electric sauna.

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.440
You know, like I'm not against all technology, obviously.

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.000
But the mindless worship of technology.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:16.880
Sure.

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.720
Mindless worship of anything is pretty bad.

02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.680
But I'm just saying, so you said,

02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:21.280
let's approach this from a realist perspective.

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.560
Okay, let's.

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.640
If we think that there is a reasonable

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:29.960
or even a potential chance, it could happen.

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.400
Maybe on the margins, let's assign it a 15% chance

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:36.000
that AI, for example, gets away from us

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.880
and we are now ruled by machines that may actually hate us.

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.080
Who knows what they want?

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.120
Why wouldn't we use force to stop that from happening?

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.520
So you're walking down the street in Midtown Manhattan.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:49.360
It's midnight.

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.200
You've had a few drinks.

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.020
You're coming from dinner.

02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:51.860
You're walking back to your apartment.

02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:56.280
A guy, a very thuggish looking guy, young man approaches you.

02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:57.960
He's 50 feet away.

02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.480
He pulls out a handgun.

02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:00.800
He lifts it up to you.

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:02.080
You also are armed.

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.280
Do you shoot him or do you wait to get shot?

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:07.600
Because all the data, look, he hasn't shot you.

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:08.600
He's not committed a crime

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:09.840
other than carrying a weapon in New York City.

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:10.680
But maybe he's got a license.

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.560
You don't know.

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.400
Could be legal.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.600
But he's pointing a gun at you.

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:18.680
Is it fair to kill him before he kills you,

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:21.120
even though you can't prove that he will kill you?

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:24.960
If I knew my skills with a gun,

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:25.800
because he already has a gun.

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:28.960
Right, but it turns out that you have some confidence

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:31.480
in your ability to stop the threat by force.

02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.280
Are you justified in doing that?

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:34.440
I just like this picture.

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.320
Am I wearing a cowboy hat?

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.160
No.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.240
No, but you are wearing cowboy boots

02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:39.440
and they're clicking on the cobblestones.

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.560
Actually, they're meatpacking.

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:41.400
Okay, great.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.000
I like this picture.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.700
I think about this a lot now.

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:47.760
Yeah, I understand your point.

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:50.880
But also, I think that metaphor falls apart

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:55.880
if there's other nations at play here.

02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:00.800
So if, same as with the nuclear bomb,

02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.840
if US doesn't build it, will other nations build it?

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.440
The Soviet Union build it?

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.880
China or Nazi Germany?

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:09.720
We face this.

02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:12.200
I mean, we face this and the last president

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.280
to try and keep in a meaningful way

02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.960
nuclear proliferation under control was John F. Kennedy.

02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:19.080
And look what happened to him.

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:20.080
But-

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:21.320
But what's your suggestion?

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.160
Like, isn't-

02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.000
No, wait, but hold on.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.720
No, but- Inevitable?

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.560
Well, their position in 1962 was,

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:30.000
no, it's absolutely not inevitable.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.040
And, or perhaps it's inevitable in the sense

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.800
that our death is inevitable, as human beings,

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.460
but we fight against the dying of the light anyway,

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:40.760
because that's the right thing to do.

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.840
No, we were willing to use force

02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.680
to prevent other countries from getting the bomb

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:47.040
because we thought that would be really terrible.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.680
Cause we acknowledged that while there were upsides

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.800
to nuclear weapons, just like there are upsides to AI,

02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:55.360
the downside was terrifying in the hands of...

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:56.960
I mean, that's the thing that I kind of don't get.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:01.040
It's like the applications of that technology

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.600
in the hands of people who mean to do harm and destroy.

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.520
It's like so obviously terrifying.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:07.920
It's not so obvious to me.

02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:09.840
What I'm terrified about is probably a similar thing

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.000
that you're terrified about,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.240
is using that technology to manipulate people's minds.

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.440
That's much more reasonable to me as an expectation.

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:19.280
Yeah.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:21.320
A real threat that's possible in the next few years.

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.040
Well, what matters more than that?

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.640
Well, I think that could lead to like destruction

02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.160
of human civilization through other humans,

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.560
for example, starting nuclear wars.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.700
Yeah, well, I mean, this is one of the reasons

02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:35.240
I wasn't afraid in the Vladimir Putin interview,

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:37.440
cause it's like, it's all ending anyway.

02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.120
You know what I mean?

02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:39.940
Yeah, well...

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:41.660
Humans will dance on the deck of the Titanic.

02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.300
Don't be a pussy, enjoy it.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:47.980
I think we will forever fight against the dying of the light

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.380
as an entirety of the civilization.

02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:51.780
Someone the other day said that Biden ascribed that

02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:55.100
to Churchill, that was a Churchill quote.

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:56.220
That's kind of what I'm saying.

02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:59.140
It's like, if you live in a society

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:01.020
where people don't read anymore,

02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:06.660
like people are by definition much more ignorant

02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:10.160
and like, but they don't know it.

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:12.460
It's like, I do think the Wikipedia culture

02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:14.120
and I think there are cool things about Wikipedia,

02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.280
certainly it's ease of use is high and that's great.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.780
But people get the sense that like,

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:22.620
oh, I know a lot about this or that or the other thing.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.040
And it's like the key to wisdom,

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.580
again, the key to wise decision-making

02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.740
is knowing what you don't know.

02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:30.340
And it's just so important to be reminded

02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:32.540
of what a dummy you are and how ignorant you are

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:33.860
all the time.

02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:35.000
That's why I like having daughters.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.520
It's like, it's never far from mind how flawed I am

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:39.480
and that's important.

02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:42.160
Yeah, I in the same way, I hope to be a dad one day.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.000
You should have a ton of kids.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.120
Are you gonna have a ton of pups?

02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:45.760
Five, oh, pup?

02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:46.900
What, you mean like kids? Children's?

02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:49.440
Yes, but also I've been thinking of getting a dog.

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.240
But unrelated, I would love to have like five or six kids.

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:53.440
Yeah, for sure.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.220
Have you found a victim yet?

02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:59.120
You make it sound so romantic, Tucker.

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.880
I'm just joking, I love it.

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.920
No, you should totally do that.

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:05.280
Yeah, 100%.

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.800
But also in terms of being humble,

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:08.880
you know, I do jiu-jitsu, it's a martial art

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.320
where you get your ass kicked all the time.

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:11.160
I love that.

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:11.980
It's nice to get your ass kicked.

02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:15.680
Physical humbling is unlike anything else, I think.

02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.060
Because we're kind of monkeys at heart

02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:20.640
and just getting your ass kicked is really helpful.

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.680
I've had it happen to me twice.

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:24.600
Twice is enough.

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.120
It got me to quit drinking, you know?

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.520
I was good at starting fights, not good at winning them.

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:31.160
But no, I completely agree with that.

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:34.880
Let me ask you, you've been pretty close with Donald Trump.

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.880
Your private texts about him around the 2020 election

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.480
were made public.

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:44.700
In one of them, you said you passionately hate Trump.

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.220
When that came out, you said that you actually know

02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:50.300
you love him.

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:52.760
So how do you explain the difference?

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:55.240
You know, my texts reflect a lot of things,

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.920
including how I feel at the moment that I sent them.

02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:59.640
That specific text I happened to know

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:01.160
since I had to go through it forensically

02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:03.800
during my deposition in a case I was not named in

02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:05.800
and I had nothing to do with whatsoever.

02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:11.680
It's crazy how civil suits can be used to hurt people

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.560
you disagree with politically.

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.740
But I was mad at a very specific person.

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:19.180
I mean, really, you're asking me, I'll tell you

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:20.920
exactly what that was.

02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.700
It was the second the election ended

02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.920
and they stopped voting,

02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.440
stopped the vote counting on election night,

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.560
I was like, well, this is, and it's all now mail-in ballots

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.320
and electronic voting machines.

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.600
I was like, that's a rigged election.

02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:34.920
I thought that then, I think it now.

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:36.280
Well, now it's obvious that it was.

02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.200
But at the time I was like, I feel like there's,

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.380
that was like crazy what just happened.

02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:41.960
I want, but I don't want to go on TV

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.040
and say that's a rigged election

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.760
because I don't have any evidence it's a rigged election.

02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:45.600
You can't do that.

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:48.080
It's irresponsible and it's wrong.

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.560
So I was like, I want, the Trump campaign

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.200
was making all these claims about, you know,

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:54.120
this or that fraud.

02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.280
So I was trying my best to substantiate them,

02:17:58.280 --> 02:17:59.120
to follow up on it.

02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:00.800
And everyone else was like, shut up, Trump, you lost,

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:04.280
go away, we're going to indict you.

02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:06.240
But I felt like my job was to be like, no, the guys,

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.640
he's president, he's claiming the election just got stolen

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:09.640
and he's making these claims.

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:12.720
Let's see if we can, well, the people around him

02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:14.320
were like so incompetent.

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:15.580
It was just absolutely crazy.

02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:18.020
And I, so I called a couple of times, I finally gave up,

02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:20.120
but I'd call him and be like, all right,

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.360
you guys claim that these inconsistencies,

02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.020
this, you know, whatever this happened,

02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.000
give me evidence and I'll put it on TV.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.920
You know, it's my job to bring stuff

02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:30.920
that is not going to be aired anywhere else to the public.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.640
I couldn't, it was like, it was insane.

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.040
How incompetent and unserious.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:38.600
So they weren't able to provide like-

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:41.360
Well, here's the point of the story and of that text.

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.480
So then they come out and they say, well, dead people voted.

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.880
Well, that's just an easy call, okay?

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:49.280
If a dead person voted, we can prove someone's dead

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.120
because like being dead is one of the few things

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.920
we're good at, like verifying,

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.560
because you start to smell, okay?

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:57.480
And there's a record of it, it's called a death certificate.

02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.880
So it was like, give me the names of people who are dead

02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.960
who voted, and then we can get their registration

02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:05.080
and we can show they voted, five names.

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.360
So I go on TV and I say,

02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:12.080
this, you know, Caroline Johnson, 79 of Waukegan, Illinois

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:14.960
voted, here's her death certificate, she died.

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:16.320
And the campaign sends me this stuff now.

02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.280
I, in general, don't take stuff directly from campaigns

02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:20.600
because they all lie,

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.280
because their job is to get elected or whatever.

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.280
So I'm very wary of campaigns

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.760
having been around it for 30 years, so like,

02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:28.760
but I made an exception to my rule

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.280
and I got a bunch of stuff from them.

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:33.080
Well, like of the six names, two of them were still alive.

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:35.360
What?

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.920
I was, well, I immediately corrected it the next night.

02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.560
CNN did a whole segment on how I was spreading

02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:43.400
disinformation, which I was, by the way,

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.440
in this one case they were right.

02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:47.200
I was so mad.

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.920
I was like, I hate you.

02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:53.080
I'm not talking about you, I'm so mad.

02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.400
Anyway, that's the answer, that's what that was.

02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:57.880
Who were you texting to?

02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:59.320
My producer, and I was like venting.

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.840
It's like a producer I was really close to

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:03.760
and I've known him for a long time, he's really smart.

02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:06.600
And he's like, he was someone I could like be honest with

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:08.200
and I was like, ah!

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:09.720
And by the way, it's so funny.

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:10.880
I mean, now I'm doing what was me,

02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.160
which I will keep to a minimum,

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:14.800
but it's like stealing someone's texts.

02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:18.520
Like how, and by the way, I was an idiot.

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:19.960
I should have said, come and arrest me.

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:22.760
I'm not giving you my freaking text messages, okay?

02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:26.080
But I got bullied into it by a lawyer.

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:30.680
I was weak enough to agree with a lawyer, it was my fault.

02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:31.880
Never should have done that.

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:34.080
Fuck you, they're my texts.

02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:35.320
I'm not even named in this case.

02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:37.720
That's what I should have said, but I didn't.

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:39.400
I said I was mad on the air the next day,

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.480
but not in language that colorful.

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:45.000
But whatever, whatever.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.080
I try to be, I try to be transparent.

02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:50.400
I mean, I also think, by the way,

02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.600
if you watch someone over time,

02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:55.560
you don't always know what they really think,

02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.000
but you can tell if someone's lying.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.720
You can sort of feel it in people.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:03.240
And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:05.920
I don't want to lie, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:08.400
I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar.

02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:11.400
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.480
You said nice things about me earlier.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.320
I'm starting to question, I have questions.

02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:18.760
I have a lot of questions to talk about.

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:19.600
I hate Lex Fridman.

02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:24.240
Yeah, I'm gonna have to see your texts after this.

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:25.760
Your texts are so uninteresting now,

02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.200
it's like crazy how uninteresting they are.

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.320
Emojis and gifs.

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:30.440
Lots of dog pictures.

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.600
Nice.

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:35.080
You said to some degree the election was rigged.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:36.960
Was it stolen?

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:37.800
Is that totally ridiculous?

02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:39.520
It was 100% stolen.

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:40.360
Are you joking?

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:41.960
Like it was rigged to that large of a degree.

02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:46.280
Yeah, they completely change the way people vote

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:48.080
right before the election on the basis of COVID,

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:48.920
which had nothing to do with me.

02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:50.520
So in that way it was rigged.

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:51.760
100% and then.

02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:52.600
Manipulated.

02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:55.560
Then you censor the information people are allowed to get.

02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:58.480
Anyone who complains about COVID,

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:02.040
which is like, by the way, it might've hurt Trump.

02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:03.960
But I mean, it's like, whatever.

02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:06.200
I mean, you could play it many different ways.

02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:10.080
You can't have censorship in a democracy by definition.

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:11.360
Here's how it works.

02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:14.120
The people rule, they vote for representatives

02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:16.120
to carry their agenda to the capital city

02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:17.120
and get it enacted.

02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:18.160
That's how they're in charge.

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.000
And then every few years they get to reassess

02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:23.000
the performance of those people in an election.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.480
In order to do that, they need access,

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:30.680
unfettered access to information.

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:34.080
And no one, particularly not people who are already in power

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:36.760
is allowed to tell them what information they can have.

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:39.440
They have to have all information that they want.

02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:41.920
Whether the people in charge want it or don't want it

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.840
or think it's true or think it's false, doesn't matter.

02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:46.720
And the second you don't have that,

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.640
you don't have a democracy.

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:49.240
It's not a free election, period.

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:52.560
And that's very clear in other countries, I guess,

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:53.720
but it's not clear here.

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:58.720
So, but I would say it's this election that,

02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:00.880
I mean, it took me a while to come to this,

02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:04.280
but it's this election that's the referendum on democracy.

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.120
Biden is senile.

02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:07.320
He's literally senile.

02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:09.640
He can't talk, he can't walk.

02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:10.680
The whole world knows that.

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:11.520
Leave our borders.

02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:13.320
People are, you know, everybody,

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.680
everybody in the world knows it.

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:18.920
He can't, you can't,

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:21.800
a senile man is not gonna get elected

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:24.360
in the most powerful country in the world

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:27.520
unless there's fraud, period.

02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:29.600
Like who would vote for a senile man?

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:31.360
He's literally, he literally can't talk.

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:32.960
And nobody I've ever met

02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:35.440
thinks he's running the US government because he's not.

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.600
And so I think the world is looking on

02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:40.400
at this coming election and saying,

02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:42.240
and a lot of the world hates Trump.

02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:45.120
Okay, it's not an endorsement of Trump, but it's true.

02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:48.360
If Joe Biden gets reelected,

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.320
democracy is a freaking joke.

02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:52.360
It's just true.

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:56.400
I think half the country doesn't think he's senile,

02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:57.240
just thinks he is speaking.

02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:59.240
Do you really think that?

02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:00.520
They don't think he's senile?

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.560
Yeah, I think he just has difficulty speaking.

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:10.560
It's like gradual degradation, just getting old.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:12.520
So cognitive ability is degrading.

02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:13.360
What's the difference

02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.280
between degraded cognitive ability and senility?

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.240
Well, senility has a threshold.

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:21.280
Like it's beyond the threshold

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:23.160
to where he could be a functioning leader.

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.600
Okay, that may be a term of art

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:25.440
that I don't fully understand.

02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.840
And maybe there's like an IQ threshold or something.

02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:32.160
But I'm happy to go with degraded cognitive ability.

02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:33.840
Sure, but that's an age thing.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.480
But he's the leader of the United States

02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:37.640
with the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:38.480
I'm with you.

02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:40.680
I'm a sucker for great speeches

02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:43.160
and for speaking abilities of leaders.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.680
And Biden with two wars going on and potentially more,

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.840
the importance of a leader to speak eloquently,

02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:52.880
both privately in a room with other leaders

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.600
and publicly is really important.

02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:56.960
I agree with you that rhetorical ability

02:24:56.960 --> 02:24:58.400
really matters convincing people

02:24:58.400 --> 02:24:59.400
that your program is right,

02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:02.600
telling them what we're for, national identity,

02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:04.200
national unity, all come from words.

02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:05.920
I agree with all of that.

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:07.200
But at this stage,

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:09.520
even someone who grunted at the microphone

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.200
would be more reassuring than a guy

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:13.680
who clearly doesn't know where he is.

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:15.680
And I think everyone knows that.

02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.320
And like, I can't imagine there's an honest person

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.560
in Washington, which is gonna vote for Biden by 90%,

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:22.160
obviously, because they're all dependent

02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:23.880
on the federal government for their income.

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:27.320
But is there any person who could say like,

02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:29.240
out of 350 million Americans,

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:30.640
like that's the most qualified to lead

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.920
or even in the top 80%, like what?

02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:37.640
That's so embarrassing that that guy is our president.

02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:40.880
And with wars going on, it's scary.

02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.720
But it's complicated to understand

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.040
why those are the choices we have.

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:46.880
Well, I agree.

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:48.360
Well, it's a failure of the system.

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.000
Clearly, it's not working if you've got one guy over 80,

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.840
the other guy almost at 80,

02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:56.440
like people that he should not be running any.

02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.080
So why you have on the Democratic side,

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.840
you have Dean Phillips, you have RK Junior until recently,

02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:03.200
I guess he's independent.

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:06.080
And then you have Vivek, who are all younger people.

02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:06.920
Yeah.

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:10.400
Why did they not connect to a degree

02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:12.000
It's such an interesting,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.240
I mean, I think it's a really interesting question.

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:16.840
Oh, there are a million different answers.

02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:19.640
And of course, I don't fully understand it,

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.000
even though I feel like I've watched it pretty carefully.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.000
But I would say the bottom line is there's so much money

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:31.400
vested in the federal apparatus,

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.560
in the parties, in the government.

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.000
As I said a minute ago, our economy is dominated

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.080
by monopolies, but the greatest of all monopolies

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:41.080
is the federal monopoly,

02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.600
which oversees and controls all the other monopolies.

02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.120
So it's like, it's really substantially about the money.

02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.880
It's not ideological, it's about the money.

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:51.920
And if someone controls the federal government,

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.200
I mean, at this point,

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:55.200
it's the most powerful organization in human history.

02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:59.480
Like, it's kind of hard to fight that.

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:02.320
And in the case of Trump, I know the answer there.

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:03.600
They raided Mar-a-Lago.

02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:06.120
They indicted him on bullshit charges.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.680
And I felt that in myself too.

02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:09.800
Even I was like, come on, come on.

02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:11.280
You know, like, whatever you think of Trump.

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.600
And I agreed with his immigration views.

02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:15.040
I really liked Trump personally.

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:18.280
I think he's hilarious and interesting, which he is.

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:21.000
But it's like, okay, there are a lot of people

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
in this country, let's get some, you know,

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.760
let's have a, at very least like, let's have a real debate.

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:28.240
The second, messed up your camera, sir, sorry.

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:29.400
I'm getting excited.

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.600
But the second they raided Mar-a-Lago

02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:36.520
on a documents charge, as someone from DC,

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:39.040
I was like, I know a lot about classification

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:41.400
and all that stuff and been around it a lot.

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:45.800
That's so absurd that I was like, now it's not about Trump.

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:48.320
It's about our system continuing.

02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:50.720
Like, if you can take out a presidential candidate

02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:52.920
on a fake charge, use the justice system

02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:54.800
to take the guy out of the race,

02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:57.840
then we don't have a representative democracy anymore.

02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:01.800
And I think a lot of Republican voters felt that way.

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:03.120
If they hadn't indicted him,

02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:04.720
I'm not sure he would be the nominee.

02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:05.800
I really don't think he would be.

02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:09.720
So now a vote for Trump is a kind of fuck you to the system.

02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:12.000
Or an expression of your desire

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.120
to keep the system that we had,

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.680
which is when we're voters get to decide,

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.840
prosecutors don't get to decide.

02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:18.640
Look, they told us for four years

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.520
that Trump was like a super criminal or something.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.320
I've actually been friends with some super criminals.

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.760
I'm a little less judgy than most.

02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:29.440
So I didn't discount the possibility that he had,

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.080
I don't know, he's in the real estate business

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.240
in New York in the seventies.

02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.480
Like, did he kill someone?

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:34.320
I don't know.

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:35.160
Yeah.

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.040
No, I'm not joking.

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:39.640
And I'm not killing people, but like anything's possible.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:41.360
It's good that you took a stand on that.

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:42.680
Yeah.

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.080
No, I'm not joking.

02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:45.760
I was like, well, who knows?

02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.320
Real estate. And I didn't know.

02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:49.480
And what they came up with was a documents charge?

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:50.960
Are you joking?

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.000
And then the sitting president

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.160
has the same documents violation, but he's fine.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:56.480
It's like, it's crazy this is happening

02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:57.360
in front of all of us.

02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.480
And then it becomes like, at that point,

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:01.600
it's not about Joe Biden.

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:03.040
It's not about Donald Trump.

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:04.520
It's about preserving a system

02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:06.160
which has worked not perfectly,

02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:09.480
but pretty freaking well for 250 years.

02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:11.280
I know you don't like Trump, I get it.

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.840
Let's not destroy that system.

02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:14.800
Like we can handle in their four years of Trump.

02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.760
I think we can, so calm down.

02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:19.960
What we can't handle is a country whose political system

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:22.680
is run by the justice department.

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:27.680
Like that is just your freaking Ecuador at that point.

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.720
No.

02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:30.920
So speaking of the justice department,

02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:34.880
CIA and intelligence agencies of that nature,

02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:38.280
which you've been traveling quite a bit,

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:39.680
probably tracked by everybody,

02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:42.680
which is the most powerful intelligence agency,

02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:43.880
do you think?

02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:44.720
CIA,

02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:48.320
Mossad,

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.320
MI6,

02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.280
SVR,

02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.800
I keep going, the Chinese.

02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:58.800
It depends what you mean by powerful,

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:04.320
which one bats above its weight, we know.

02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:06.240
Which one is-

02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:07.920
Mossad, just to be clear, I guess, is what you mean.

02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:10.240
Well, of course, tiny country,

02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:12.080
very sophisticated intelligence service.

02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:16.360
Which one has the greatest global reach in comms?

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.480
Which one is most able to read your text?

02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:20.200
I assume the NSA.

02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:22.080
But Chinese, clearly pretty good.

02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:24.880
Israel is pretty good.

02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:27.680
The French actually are surprisingly good

02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:29.120
for kind of a declining country.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.840
Their intel services seem pretty impressive.

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:33.520
No, I love France, but you know what I mean?

02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:35.320
And all that.

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.280
So the question, I mean, I grew up around all that stuff,

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:39.640
but that's all totally fine.

02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:41.520
Like a strong country should have

02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:43.280
a strong and capable intel service.

02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:45.400
So its policymakers can make informed decisions.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.560
Like that's what they're for.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:49.400
And so as Vladimir Putin himself noted,

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:50.800
I don't talk about it very much, but it's true.

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.520
I applied to the CIA when I was in college

02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:55.400
because I was familiar with it

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:58.080
because of where I lived and had grown up and everything.

02:30:58.080 --> 02:30:59.800
And I was like, seemed interesting.

02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:01.280
That's honestly the only reason.

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:02.480
I was like, live in foreign countries,

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:03.800
see history happen.

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:05.080
Like I'm for that.

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:06.520
I applied to the operations directorate.

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:10.440
They turned me down on the basis of drug use actually.

02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:12.480
True.

02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:14.240
But anyway, whatever, I was unsuited for it.

02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:15.480
So I'm glad they turned me down.

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.320
But the point is I didn't see CIA as a threat

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:21.480
partly because I was bathing in propaganda about CIA

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:22.680
and I didn't really understand what it was

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:24.080
and didn't wanna know.

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:25.960
But second, because my impression at the time

02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.920
was it was outwardly focused.

02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:29.600
It was focused on our enemies.

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:34.000
I don't have a problem with that as much.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.640
The fact that CIA is playing in domestic politics

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:38.160
and actually has for a long time

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.720
was involved in the Kennedy assassination.

02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:41.200
That's not speculation.

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:42.120
That's a fact.

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:45.360
And I confirm that for someone who had read their documents

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.720
that are still not public is shocking.

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:50.160
Like you can't have that.

02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:52.760
And the reason I'm so mad is I really believe

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:54.800
in the idea of representative government

02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:56.080
acknowledging its imperfections.

02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:58.160
But like I should have some say, I live here,

02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:01.640
I'm a citizen, I pay all your freaking taxes.

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:06.240
So the fact that they would be tampering

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.720
with American democracy is so outrageous to me.

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:12.600
And I don't know why Morning Joe is not outraged.

02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:16.520
This parade of dummies, highly credential dummies they have

02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.600
on Morning Joe every day, they don't seem to,

02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:20.240
that doesn't bother them at all.

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:21.400
How could that not bother you?

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:24.160
Why is only Glenn Greenwald mad about it?

02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:25.320
I mean, it's confirmed.

02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:27.160
It's not like a fever dream.

02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:28.120
It's real.

02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:31.360
They played in the last election domestically.

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.080
And I guess it shows how dumb I am

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.440
because they've been doing that for many years.

02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:40.320
I mean, the guy who took out Mosadeq lived on my street.

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:42.240
You know, one of the Roosevelt's CIA officer.

02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:44.320
So I mean, again, I grew up around this stuff,

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:49.320
but I never really thought,

02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.400
I never reached the obvious conclusion,

02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:55.960
which is that if the US government subverts democracy

02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:58.680
in other countries in the name of democracy,

02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:01.600
it will over time subvert democracy in my country.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:02.440
Why wouldn't it?

02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.880
That is, the corruption is like core.

02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.840
It's at the root of it.

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:09.720
The purpose of the CIA was envisioned,

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:11.240
at least publicly envisioned,

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:13.480
as an intel gathering apparatus for the executive

02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:15.440
so the president could make wise foreign policy decisions.

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.120
What the hell is happening in country X?

02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:18.120
I don't know.

02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:20.760
Let me call the agency in charge of finding out.

02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:23.800
The point wasn't to freaking guarantee

02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:25.360
the outcome of elections.

02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.200
I'm doing an Israel-Palestine debate next week,

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.520
but I have to ask you just your thoughts,

02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.200
maybe even from a US perspective,

02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:37.840
what do you think about Hamas attacks on Israel?

02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:41.480
What would be the right thing for Israel to do?

02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:43.840
And what's the right thing for US to do in this?

02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:46.920
If you're looking at the geopolitics of it.

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:50.440
I mean, it's not a topic that I get into a lot

02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:51.760
because I'm a non-expert.

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:57.040
And because I'm not, unlike every other American,

02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.560
I'm not emotionally invested in other countries

02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:01.400
just in general.

02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.760
I mean, I admire them or not, and I love visiting them.

02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:07.560
I love Jerusalem, probably my favorite city in the world,

02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:10.720
but I don't have an emotional attachment to it.

02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:12.880
So maybe I've got more clarity.

02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:14.040
I don't know, maybe less.

02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:15.280
Here's my view.

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:17.480
I believe in sovereignty, as mentioned,

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.360
and I think each country has to make decisions

02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:22.440
based on its own interest,

02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:25.320
but also with reference to its own capabilities

02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:26.840
and its own long-term interest.

02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:31.720
And it's very unwise for, I'm not a huge fan of treaties.

02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:34.160
Some are fine, too many bad,

02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:38.040
but I think US aid, military aid to Israel

02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:40.800
and the implied security guarantees, some explicit,

02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:42.400
but many implied security guarantees

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.280
of the United States to Israel

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:47.560
probably haven't helped Israel that much long-term.

02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:50.400
It's a rich country with a highly capable population

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:51.240
like every other country.

02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:53.080
It's probably best if it makes its decisions

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.480
based on what it can do by itself.

02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:01.200
So I would definitely be concerned if I lived in Israel

02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:04.240
because I think fair or unfair,

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:06.040
and really this is another product of technology,

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:10.480
social media, public sentiment in that area is boiling over.

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:12.720
And I think it's gonna be hard for some of the governments

02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:15.320
in the region, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey,

02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:16.760
to contain their own population.

02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:18.800
They don't want conflict with Israel at all.

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:20.440
They were all pretty psyched actually

02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:22.600
for the trend in progress.

02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.680
The Saudi peace deal, which was never signed,

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.240
but it would have been great for everybody

02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.680
because like trade, peace, normal relations,

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:32.000
like that's good, okay, let's just say.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.520
I know John Bolton doesn't like it, but it's good.

02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:39.040
And it's kind of what we should be looking for,

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.280
but now it's not possible.

02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:46.640
And if you had like a coalition of countries against Israel,

02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:48.160
I know Israel has nuclear weapons

02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:50.760
and has a capable military and all that

02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:51.920
and the backing of the United States,

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.840
but like it's a small country, I think I'd be very worried.

02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:58.800
So there's that.

02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.800
And I don't see any advantage to the United States.

02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.520
I mean, I think it's important for each country

02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:09.640
to make its own decisions.

02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:11.160
But it also is a place, like you said,

02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:13.920
where things are boiling over

02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:17.040
and it could spread across multiple nations

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:18.480
into a major military conflict.

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:20.680
Yeah, well, I think very easily could happen.

02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:23.080
In fact, probably right after Ramadan, if I had to guess.

02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.640
And yeah, I pray it doesn't.

02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:30.120
But again, I don't think you can overstate

02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:33.520
the lack of wisdom, weakness, short-term thinking

02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:36.400
of American foreign policy leadership.

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:38.920
These are the architects of the Iraq War

02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:42.120
of the totally pointless destruction of Libya,

02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:44.240
totally pointless destruction of Syria

02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:46.280
and the 20-year occupation of Afghanistan

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.240
that resulted in a return to the status quo.

02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:51.000
So like there of the Vietnam War,

02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:54.040
their track record of the Korean War,

02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:57.960
even going back 80 years is uninterrupted failures

02:36:58.920 --> 02:36:59.760
one after the other.

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:04.760
So I just don't have any confidence in those leaders to...

02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:07.880
When was the last time they improved another country?

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.600
Can you think of that?

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:10.600
Oh, the Marshall Plan.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.600
Well, you look at Europe now and you're like,

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.280
I don't know if that worked.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.880
But even if it did work, again, 80 years ago.

02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:20.520
So when was the last country

02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:23.600
American foreign policy makers improved?

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:27.800
So if I were, Netanyahu's in a very difficult place,

02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:29.560
politically impossible.

02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.880
I'm glad I'm not Netanyahu.

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:33.360
And I'm not sure he's capable

02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:36.120
of making wise long-term decisions anyway.

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:37.840
But if I was just like an Israeli,

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.760
I'd be like, I don't know if I want

02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:44.040
like all this help and guidance.

02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.840
So yeah, I actually think it's worse than

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.640
just having just returned from the Middle East

02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.960
and talking to a lot of pretty open-minded

02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:56.960
sort of pro-Israeli Arabs who want stability above all.

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.280
The merchant class always wants stability.

02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:01.520
So I'm on their side, I guess.

02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:04.200
And they're like, man,

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.760
this could get super ugly, super fast.

02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.240
American leadership is completely absent.

02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:10.240
It's just all posturing.

02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:12.880
It's like people like Nikki Haley.

02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:13.720
You just wonder like,

02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.280
how does an advanced civilization promote someone

02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:18.400
like Nikki Haley to a position of authority?

02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.120
It's like, what?

02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:23.120
Shh, shh, adults are talking, adults are talking.

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:25.000
Nikki Haley, please go away.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.920
Like that would be the appropriate response.

02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:28.360
But everyone's so intimidated to be like,

02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:29.840
oh, she's a strong woman.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:33.760
She's so transparently weak and sort of ridiculous.

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:34.800
It doesn't know anything.

02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:37.240
And it's just like thinks that jumping up and down

02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:39.160
and making these absurd blanket statements,

02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:41.400
repeating bumper stickers is like leadership or something.

02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:46.400
It's like a self-confident advanced society

02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:50.240
would never allow Nikki Haley to advance.

02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:52.400
I mean, she's really not impressive.

02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.280
Sorry.

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:56.080
I just feel like you hold back too much

02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:58.720
and don't tell us what you really think.

02:38:58.720 --> 02:38:59.560
Sorry.

02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:02.280
I think you just speak your mind more often.

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:05.560
I mean, you can completely disagree with my opinions,

02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:06.560
but in the case of Nikki Haley,

02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:09.040
it's not like an opinion form just from watching television,

02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:09.960
which I don't watch.

02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:12.560
It's an opinion form from knowing Nikki Haley.

02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:14.040
So.

02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:15.480
Strong words from Tucker.

02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:16.480
Well, felt too.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:20.080
Well, the world's in the balance.

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:20.920
I mean, it's not just like-

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:21.760
Yes, this is important stuff.

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:23.200
Yeah, it's not just like, well, you know,

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.600
what should the capital gains rate be?

02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:27.880
It's like, do we live or die?

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:30.520
I don't know, let's consult Nikki Haley.

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:32.480
So if you're asking, should we live or die

02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:33.840
and consulting Nikki Haley,

02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:35.720
clearly you don't care about the lives of your children.

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:37.240
That's how I feel.

02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:39.560
Not to try to get a preview or anything,

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:44.440
but do you have interest of interviewing Xi Jinping?

02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:48.240
And if you do, how will you approach that?

02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:50.000
I have enormous interest in doing that.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.200
Enormous.

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.360
And a couple other people and we're working on it.

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.680
Yeah, I should also say like,

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:59.240
it's been refreshing you interviewing world leaders.

02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:03.280
I think when I've started seeing you do that,

02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:06.120
it made me realize how much that's lacking.

02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.240
Well, yeah, it's just interesting.

02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:10.160
I mean, from even a historical perspective is interesting,

02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:13.080
but it's also important from a geopolitics perspective.

02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:15.080
Well, it's really changed my perspective

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:17.240
and I've been going on about how American I am

02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:18.840
and I think that's a great thing.

02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:20.000
I love America.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.760
But it's also, you know, we're so physically,

02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.600
geographically isolated from the world,

02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:27.520
even though I traveled a ton as a kid, a lot,

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:29.320
you know, more than most people.

02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:32.760
But even now I'm like, I'm so parochial.

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:36.080
I'm so, I see everything through this lens

02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:38.720
and getting out and seeing the rest of the world

02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:39.960
to which we really are connected,

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:43.440
like that's real, is vitally important.

02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:46.800
So I, yeah, I mean, at this stage,

02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:49.160
I don't, you know, kind of need to do it,

02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:52.720
but I really want to just motivated by curiosity

02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:56.680
and trying to expand my own mind and not be closed minded

02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:00.000
and really see the fullest perspective I possibly can

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.240
in order to render wise judgments.

02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:04.480
I mean, that's like the whole journey of life.

02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:08.800
I was just hanging out with Rogan yesterday, Joe Rogan.

02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:11.240
And, you know, I mentioned to him

02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:13.880
that as me being a fan of his show,

02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:16.560
that I would love for him to talk with you.

02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:19.680
And he said he's up for it.

02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:22.040
And you reason you guys haven't done it already?

02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:22.880
I don't know.

02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:25.720
I would, there's no, I've only met Rogan once

02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:26.840
and I liked him.

02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.600
I met him at the UFC in New York.

02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.000
He was with somebody, a mutual friend of ours.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.720
And I, you know, Rogan changed media.

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.520
I mean, maybe more than anybody.

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:41.240
And he did it, what I love about,

02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:42.840
what I admire about Rogan without knowing him

02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.440
beyond meeting him that one time.

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.760
I mean, I'm still in media, but I've always been in media.

02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:50.840
You know, it's like not a great surprise.

02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:52.920
I'm doing what I've always done, just a different format.

02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.400
But Rogan, like, he's got one of those resumes

02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:57.800
that I admire.

02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:58.800
You know, I like the guy who was like,

02:41:58.800 --> 02:41:59.720
I was a longshoreman.

02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:00.800
I was a short order cook.

02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:01.880
I was an astrophysicist.

02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:05.640
I was, he's like, he's called a man of parts.

02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:08.200
And this guy was a fighter, a standup comic.

02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:10.640
He hosted some, you know, Fear Factor.

02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.360
And like, how did he wind up at the vanguard

02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.360
of like the deepest conversations in the country?

02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:19.280
Like, how did that happen?

02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:21.720
So I definitely respect that.

02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:22.880
And I think it's cool.

02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:25.600
And Rogan is one of those people

02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:27.120
who just kind of came out of nowhere.

02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:28.320
Like no one helped him.

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.120
You know what I mean?

02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:32.360
He was doing the thing that he loves doing

02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:34.840
and it somehow keeps accidentally

02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:36.800
of being exceptionally successful.

02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:37.840
Yeah, and he's curious.

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.880
So that's like the main thing.

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:42.640
And there was a guy without getting boring,

02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:44.160
but there was a guy I worked with years ago

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:47.240
who like kind of dominated cable news, Larry King.

02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:48.800
And everyone would always beat up on Larry King

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:49.620
for being dumb.

02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:50.920
Well, I got to know Larry King well.

02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:52.320
And I was his film host for a while.

02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:54.480
And Larry King was just intensely curious.

02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:56.520
He'd be like, why do you wear a black tie, Lex?

02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:57.360
Because I like black tie.

02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:58.400
Why do you like black tie?

02:42:58.400 --> 02:42:59.640
No, not everyone else wears a striped tie,

02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:00.480
but you wear a black one, why?

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:01.720
And he would like, he was like really interested.

02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:02.560
Yeah, genuinely.

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:03.380
So yeah.

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:04.600
Totally.

02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:06.960
And I want to be like that.

02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:09.400
I don't want to think I know everything.

02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:11.200
That's so boorish and also false.

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.160
You don't know everything.

02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.880
But I see that in Rogan.

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:15.440
Rogan's like, raw, how does that work?

02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:17.560
And people will, and it's so funny

02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:20.120
how that's threatening to people.

02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:22.760
It's like Rogan will just sit there

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:26.000
while someone else is free balling on some far out topic,

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.360
which by the way might be true,

02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:30.000
probably truer than the conventional explanation.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.160
People are like, I don't know, how can he stand that?

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.560
He had someone say the pyramids weren't built

02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:38.080
3,000 years ago, but 8,000 years ago, and that's wrong.

02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:39.600
It's like, first of all,

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:40.960
how do you know when the pyramids were built?

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:43.720
Second, why do you care if someone disagrees with you?

02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:44.740
Like, what is that?

02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:47.960
This weird kind of like group think,

02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:50.640
it's almost like fourth grade.

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.440
There's always like some little girl in the front rows

02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:56.720
acting as the, you know, kind of the teacher's enforcer.

02:43:56.720 --> 02:43:58.000
Like whip around and be like, sit down.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:58.840
Didn't you hear it?

02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:00.760
Mrs. Johnson said, sit down.

02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.600
That's like the whole American media.

02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:06.560
How dare you ask that question?

02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:09.480
And Rogan just seems like completely on his own trip.

02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:10.800
Like, he doesn't even hear it.

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:11.640
He's like, whoa, really?

02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.800
When were the pyramids built?

02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:14.440
And I was like, oh, I love that.

02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:17.600
Yeah, curiosity, open-mindedness.

02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.760
The thing I admire about him most honestly

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:21.320
is that he's a good father.

02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:22.480
He's a good husband.

02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.240
He's a good family man for many years.

02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:30.240
And that's his place where he escapes from the world too.

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:31.400
And it's just beautiful.

02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.680
Without that, man, you're destroyed.

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:34.520
Yeah.

02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:37.620
If I had a wife who was interested at all,

02:44:37.620 --> 02:44:39.260
in any way in what I did,

02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:42.280
I think I would have gone crazy by now.

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:44.560
When we get home, she's like, how was your day?

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:45.400
It was great.

02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:46.520
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:47.480
That's the end of our conversation

02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:48.900
about what I do for a living.

02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:52.700
And that is such a wonderful and essential respite from,

02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:54.140
you said, how do I not become an asshole

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:55.380
to the extent I haven't?

02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:56.780
I kind of have.

02:44:56.780 --> 02:45:01.500
But how have I not been transformed

02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:03.900
into a totally insufferable megalomaniac

02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:06.860
who's checking his Twitter replies every day

02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:07.940
or every minute?

02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:08.780
It's that.

02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:10.060
Yeah, you gotta have, the core of your life

02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:12.860
has to be solid and enduring

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:14.860
and not just ephemeral and silly.

02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:17.900
So the two of you have known each other for what, 40 years?

02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:19.620
We've been together 40 years.

02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:20.460
Together 40 years?

02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:22.020
40 years, yeah, 1984.

02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:25.640
He was the hottest 15-year-old in Newport, Rhode Island.

02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:26.660
Wow.

02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.740
Sounds dirty, but I was, I'm talking about myself.

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:29.580
I was the hottest.

02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:30.900
Yeah, you were.

02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:32.380
Just looking in the mirror.

02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:33.220
Very nice.

02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:35.740
So what's the secret to a successful relationship,

02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:37.100
successful marriage?

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.580
I don't even know.

02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:42.740
I mean, no, I'm serious.

02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:46.120
I got married in August 91, so that's,

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.820
well, it's our third year of being married.

02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, as noted.

02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:53.060
Yeah, so, you know, you hear these people,

02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:55.380
it's actually changed my theology a little bit,

02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:56.380
not that I have deep theology,

02:45:56.380 --> 02:46:00.420
but like, I grew up in a society in Southern California

02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:03.020
when I was little that was like

02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:04.620
a totally self-created society.

02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:07.500
I mean, Southern California was,

02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:09.740
it was the root of libertarianism for a reason.

02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:11.260
It was like, that's where you went to recreate yourself.

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:14.460
And so the operative assumption there

02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:16.700
is that you are the sum total of your choices.

02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:20.780
And that free will is everything.

02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.180
And we never consider questions like,

02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:25.620
well, why do children get cancer?

02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:26.780
Like, what do they do to deserve it?

02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:28.900
Well, of course, nothing, right?

02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:30.140
Because that would suggest

02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:31.300
that maybe you're not the sum total.

02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:32.380
Choices matter.

02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:34.340
If I smoke a lot, I might get lung cancer.

02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:36.180
If I use fentanyl, I may OD.

02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:37.260
Got it.

02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:38.420
If I don't exercise, I might get fat.

02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:39.420
Okay.

02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:41.220
But like on a bigger scale,

02:46:41.220 --> 02:46:44.860
you're not only the sum total of your choices.

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:46.020
Like things happen to you

02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:48.020
that you didn't deserve, good and bad.

02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:52.540
And marriage is, and I'll speak for myself in that case,

02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:53.580
in my case, just one of them.

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:55.300
And I could say, I mean, clearly spending time

02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:56.420
with the person you're married to,

02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:59.340
talking, enjoying each other.

02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:01.540
You know, I have a lot of rituals.

02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:04.060
We have a lot of rituals that ensure that.

02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:06.420
But in 40 years, like you change,

02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:08.540
you're like a different person.

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:09.860
You know, I like did drugs.

02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:11.860
I was drinking all the time when we met.

02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:15.860
You know, it's been a long time since I've been done that.

02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:17.540
And I'm very different.

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:18.360
And so is she.

02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:19.200
But we're different in ways

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.020
that are complimentary and happy.

02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:20.860
We've never been happier.

02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:22.740
So like, how do we pull that off?

02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.100
Just kind of good luck, honestly.

02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:26.060
And then I see other people.

02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:27.100
No, I'm not kidding.

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:28.260
But that's true.

02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:32.740
I think it's so important not to flatter yourself

02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:34.300
if you've been successful at something.

02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:37.380
The thing I've been most successful at is marriage.

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:40.180
But it's not really me.

02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:41.500
I mean, I haven't.

02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:43.140
So I think what you're indirectly communicating

02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:45.300
is it's like humility, I think.

02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:49.540
Humility is the result of a reality-based worldview.

02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:50.900
Sure, right.

02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:53.340
Once you see things clearly,

02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:55.900
then you know that you are not the author

02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:58.660
of all your successes or failures.

02:47:58.660 --> 02:48:03.000
And I hate the implication otherwise

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.220
because it suggests powers that people don't have.

02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:06.340
That's one of the reasons I always hated

02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:08.620
the smoking debate or the COVID debate.

02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:10.300
Someone die of COVID and you don't have the facts to be like,

02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:12.060
see, this is what you get.

02:48:12.060 --> 02:48:12.900
You smoke cigarettes, you die.

02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:14.420
Well, shit.

02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:15.300
Yeah, if you smoke cigarettes,

02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:16.620
you're more likely to get lung cancer.

02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:18.860
If you don't, if you get whatever.

02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:19.780
Cause and effect is real.

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:22.340
I'm not denying its existence, it's obvious.

02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:24.020
But it's not the whole story.

02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:28.700
There are larger forces acting on us, unseen forces.

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:29.780
That's just a fact.

02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:31.980
You don't need to be some kind of religious nut.

02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:33.460
And they act on AI too.

02:48:33.460 --> 02:48:35.420
And you should keep that in mind.

02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.820
The idea that all-

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:37.860
The missing way you said that.

02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:39.140
No, it's true.

02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:41.300
It's demonstrably true.

02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:42.860
We're the only society that hasn't acknowledged

02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:44.260
the truth of that.

02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:46.460
And the idea that the only things that are real

02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:49.020
are the things that we can see or measure in a lab.

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:49.860
Like that's insane.

02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:51.500
That's just dumb.

02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:52.980
In the religious context,

02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:55.980
you have this two categories that I really like

02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:58.220
that of the two kinds of people.

02:48:58.220 --> 02:48:59.820
People who believe they're God

02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:02.220
and people who know they're not.

02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:06.740
Which is a really interesting division

02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:11.260
that speaks to humility and a kind of realist worldview

02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:13.180
of where we are in the world.

02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:14.020
Oh.

02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:17.980
Can atheists be in the ladder category?

02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:18.820
No.

02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:21.620
There are very few atheists.

02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:23.500
I've never actually met one.

02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:26.220
There are people who pose as atheists,

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:29.020
but no one's purely rational.

02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:31.940
And everyone, I mean, this is a cliche for a reason.

02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:34.020
Everyone under extreme stress

02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:35.620
appeals to a power higher than himself

02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:36.740
because everyone knows

02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:38.900
that there is a power higher than himself.

02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:41.260
So really it's just people who are gripped

02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:43.140
with the delusion that they're God.

02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:44.380
No one actually believes that.

02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:46.100
If you're God, jump off the roof of your garage

02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:47.340
and see what happens.

02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:48.180
You know what I mean?

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:50.020
No one actually thinks that.

02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:52.100
But people behave as if it's true

02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:54.740
and those people are dangerous.

02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:55.980
And I will say by contrast,

02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:58.940
the only people I trust are the people who know their limits.

02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:01.540
And I was thinking actually this morning in my sauna,

02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:05.140
of all the people I've interviewed or met,

02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:06.020
this is someone I never interviewed,

02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:08.180
but I have talked to him a couple of times.

02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:12.500
The greatest leader I've ever met in the world

02:50:12.860 --> 02:50:15.420
is literally a king.

02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:20.620
It's MBC, Sheikh Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, who is Muslim.

02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:21.980
I am definitely not Muslim.

02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:24.300
I'm Christian, Protestant Christian.

02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:26.420
And so I don't agree with his religion

02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:28.660
and I don't agree with monarchies,

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:33.260
but he's the best leader in the world that I've ever met.

02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:36.740
And by far, it's like not even close.

02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:37.820
And why is that?

02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.460
Well, I could bore you for an hour on the subject,

02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:43.860
but the reason that he's such a good leader

02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:47.180
is because he's guided by an ever present knowledge

02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:51.980
of his limitations and of the limits of his power

02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:53.500
and of his foresight.

02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:55.820
And when you start there, when you start with reality,

02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:56.660
it's not even humility.

02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.700
Humility can be opposed, like, oh, I'm so humble, okay.

02:51:00.700 --> 02:51:02.820
Humble brag is a phrase for a reason.

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:03.660
It's like way deeper than that.

02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:07.860
It's just like, no, can I, do I have magical powers?

02:51:07.860 --> 02:51:09.420
Can I see the future?

02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:12.260
No, okay, that's just a fact.

02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:13.620
So I'm not God.

02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:15.980
But I've never seen anybody more at ease

02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:20.820
with admitting that than MBZ, just a remarkable person.

02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:24.500
And for that reason, he is like treated as an oracle.

02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:26.420
I don't think people understand.

02:51:26.420 --> 02:51:30.100
The number of world leaders who traipse through his house

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:33.380
or palace to seek his counsel is,

02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:37.580
I'm not sure that there is a parallel

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:40.420
since, I don't wanna get too hyperbolic here,

02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:42.380
but honestly, since like Solomon,

02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:44.580
where people come from like around the world

02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:46.380
to ask what he thinks.

02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:48.140
Now, why would they be doing that?

02:51:49.340 --> 02:51:51.700
Because Abu Dhabi's military is so powerful.

02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:54.860
I mean, he's rich, okay, massive oil and gas deposits,

02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:58.140
but like for a lot of, you know, so is Canada.

02:51:58.140 --> 02:51:59.300
You know what I mean?

02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:01.460
And no one is coming to Ottawa, Tahawah

02:52:01.460 --> 02:52:03.420
to ask Justin Trudeau what he thinks.

02:52:03.420 --> 02:52:05.060
No, it's humility.

02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:07.340
That's where wisdom comes from.

02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:09.020
You start to think like,

02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:11.940
I spent my whole life like mad at America's leadership class

02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:14.220
because it's not just Biden

02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:17.460
or the people in official positions.

02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:19.780
It's the whole constellation of advisors

02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:21.860
and throne sniffers around them.

02:52:21.860 --> 02:52:24.180
And I'm, it's not that even that I disagree with them,

02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:25.780
it's I'm not impressed by them.

02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:27.620
I'm just not impressed.

02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:30.060
They're not that capable, right?

02:52:30.060 --> 02:52:31.580
So that's what I was saying about Nikki Haley.

02:52:31.580 --> 02:52:32.420
I don't think she's,

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:34.500
Nikki Haley is the most evil person in the world.

02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:36.060
I think she's ridiculous, obviously.

02:52:36.060 --> 02:52:39.220
And everyone's like, oh, Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo.

02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:40.660
What?

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:43.540
Great leaders are so rare that when you see one,

02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:44.780
you know it right away.

02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:45.620
It blows your mind.

02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:50.020
And what blows my mind about Sheikh Mohammed in Abu Dhabi

02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:52.740
is that everyone in the world knows it.

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:55.020
And I've never seen a story on this.

02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:56.780
And I'm not guessing I know this is true

02:52:56.780 --> 02:52:58.620
because I've seen it.

02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:00.260
Everyone in the world knows it.

02:53:00.260 --> 02:53:02.420
And so if there's a conflict,

02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:04.460
he's the only person that people call.

02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:07.500
Like everybody calls the same guy.

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:11.300
And it's like, he runs this tiny little country, the UAE.

02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:13.300
I mean, he's the, in Abu Dhabi,

02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:14.140
they're a bunch of Emirates,

02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:15.900
but he's the president of the country, but still,

02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:18.740
and it's got a ton of energy and all that wealth

02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:20.580
and all that, and Dubai's got great real estate

02:53:20.580 --> 02:53:23.020
and restaurants, but really it's a tiny little country

02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:26.140
that wasn't even a country 50 years ago.

02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:28.060
So how did that happen?

02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:31.460
Purely on the basis of his humility

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:33.340
and the wisdom that results from that humility.

02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:34.540
That's it.

02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:37.100
What advice would you give to young people?

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:41.540
You got four, you somehow made them integrate human beings.

02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:43.460
What advice would you give to people in high school?

02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:46.060
Have children immediately, including in high school.

02:53:46.060 --> 02:53:48.660
Yes, I think that, that's all that matters.

02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:51.860
Like in the end, you know, again,

02:53:51.860 --> 02:53:54.260
these aren't even cliches anymore because no one says them.

02:53:54.260 --> 02:53:55.380
But when I was a kid, people would say,

02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.300
on your deathbed, you never wish you'd spend more time

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:58.140
at work.

02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:00.700
And I mean, everyone said that.

02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:01.900
It was like one of these things.

02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:04.980
And now I don't think Google allows you to say that.

02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:06.340
It's like, no, you're gonna wish you spent more time

02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.060
at work, get back to your cube.

02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:13.060
But I can't overstate from my vantage how true that is.

02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:19.260
Nothing else matters, but your family.

02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:21.540
And if you have the opportunity,

02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:23.340
and a lot of people are being denied the opportunity

02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:27.580
to have children, and this messing with the gender roles,

02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:28.980
and I'm not even talking about the tranny stuff.

02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:34.540
I mean, feminism has so destroyed people's brains

02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:38.540
and the ability of young people to connect with each other

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:40.260
and stay together and have fruitful lives.

02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:42.900
It's like, nothing's been more destructive than that.

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:43.900
It's such a lie.

02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:44.940
It's so dumb.

02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:46.020
It's counter to human nature.

02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:48.180
Nothing counter to human nature can endure.

02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:50.780
It can only cause suffering, and that's what it's done.

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:51.740
But fight that.

02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:52.980
Stop complaining about it.

02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:54.020
Find someone.

02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:56.260
By the way, everyone gets together,

02:54:56.300 --> 02:54:59.100
most people get together on the basis in a Western society

02:54:59.100 --> 02:55:00.420
where there's no arranged marriages.

02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:02.300
They get together on the basis of sexual attraction.

02:55:02.300 --> 02:55:03.140
Totally natural.

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:07.020
Get off your birth control and have children.

02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:07.940
Oh, I can't afford that.

02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:09.420
Well, yeah, you'll figure out a way to afford it

02:55:09.420 --> 02:55:11.260
once you have kids.

02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:14.580
It's like, it's chicken and the egg, but it's actually not.

02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:17.220
When you have responsibility, when you have no choice,

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:18.500
this is true of men.

02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:19.420
I'm not sure if it's true of women,

02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:20.460
but it's definitely true of men.

02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:23.540
You will not achieve until you have no choice.

02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:25.460
As I always think of men,

02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:28.460
men do nothing until they have to,

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:30.940
but once they have to, they will do anything.

02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:32.060
That is true.

02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:33.820
Men will do nothing unless they have to,

02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:35.220
but once they have to, they will do anything.

02:55:35.220 --> 02:55:37.860
I really believe that from watching and from being one,

02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:40.500
and I would never have done anything if I didn't have to,

02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:42.900
but I had to, and I would just recommend it.

02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:44.100
But by the way, even if you don't succeed,

02:55:44.100 --> 02:55:48.020
even if you're poor, having spent my life among rich people,

02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:49.340
I grew up among rich people.

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:50.740
I am a rich person.

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.220
Boy, are they unhappy.

02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:54.340
Well, that's clearly not the road to happiness.

02:55:54.340 --> 02:55:56.020
You don't wanna be a debt slave

02:55:56.020 --> 02:55:57.460
or starve to death or anything like that,

02:55:57.460 --> 02:56:00.580
but making a billion dollars, that's not worth doing.

02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:01.580
Don't do that.

02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:03.500
Don't even try to do that.

02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:05.820
If you create something that's beautiful and worth having

02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:07.980
and you make a billion dollars,

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:09.420
okay, then you have to deal with your billion dollars,

02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:11.580
which will be the worst part of your life, trust me.

02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:16.100
But seeking money for its own sake is a dead end.

02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:19.060
What you should seek for its own sake is children.

02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:20.180
Talk about a creative act.

02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:21.140
Last thing I'll say,

02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:24.380
the whole point of life is to create, okay?

02:56:24.380 --> 02:56:27.900
The act of creation, which is like dying in the West,

02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:31.740
in the arts and in its most pure expression,

02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:35.020
which is children, that's all that's worth doing

02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:37.820
while you're alive, is creating something beautiful

02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:38.780
and creating children.

02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:39.940
By the way, it's super fun.

02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:40.780
It's not hard.

02:56:40.780 --> 02:56:42.500
I can get more technical off the air if you want.

02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:43.580
Yeah, please.

02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:44.420
I have a lot of thoughts on it.

02:56:44.420 --> 02:56:45.660
Do you have documents or something?

02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:48.180
No, I can draw you a schematic.

02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:49.060
Oh, thank you.

02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.500
But yeah, that's the greatest thing.

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:53.980
And the fact that corporate America denies,

02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:55.780
oh, freeze your eggs, have an abortion.

02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:56.620
What?

02:56:56.620 --> 02:56:58.260
You're evil.

02:56:58.260 --> 02:56:59.100
Are you kidding?

02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:00.900
Because you're taking from people

02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:04.700
the only thing that can possibly give them enduring joy.

02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:06.660
And they are successfully taking it from people

02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:07.860
and I hate them for it.

02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:11.420
You founded TCN, Tucker Carlson Network.

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.740
What's your vision for it?

02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:16.460
I have no vision for myself or my career and I never have.

02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:18.900
So I'm like the last person to explain.

02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.820
Yeah, I'm an instinct guy, 100%.

02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:23.620
I have a vision for the world,

02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:25.780
but I don't have a vision for my life or my career.

02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:29.340
So really my vision extended precisely this far.

02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:31.540
I just wanna keep doing what I'm doing.

02:57:31.540 --> 02:57:32.940
I just wanna keep doing what I'm doing.

02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:35.620
And there was a five hour period

02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:38.020
where I wondered if I would be able to

02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:41.060
because I feel pretty spry and alert

02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:43.780
and I'm certainly deeply enjoying what I'm doing,

02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:45.660
which is talking to people and saying what I think

02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:49.260
and learning, constantly learning.

02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:50.740
But I just wanted to keep doing that.

02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:55.340
And so, and I also wanted to employ the people

02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:58.540
who I worked with at Fox.

02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:00.460
I've worked with the same people for years and I love them.

02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:02.820
And so I had all these people

02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:03.900
and I wanted to bring them with me.

02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:06.340
So we had to build a structure for that.

02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:08.140
But this feels like one of the first times

02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:09.380
you're really working for yourself.

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:12.060
Like there's an extra level of freedom here.

02:58:12.060 --> 02:58:13.540
Totally, totally.

02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:17.020
And the good, I'm not, you don't want me doing your taxes.

02:58:17.020 --> 02:58:18.100
Like I'm good at some things,

02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:19.140
but I'm really not good at others.

02:58:19.140 --> 02:58:21.860
So I'm more than would be like running a business.

02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:24.900
No idea, I'm not interested, not a commerce guy.

02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:26.100
So I don't buy anything.

02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:28.380
So it's like a whole thing I'm not good at.

02:58:28.380 --> 02:58:33.380
But luckily, I'm really blessed to have friends

02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:36.340
who are involved in this, who are good at that.

02:58:36.340 --> 02:58:38.620
So I feel positive about it,

02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:43.180
but mostly I am totally committed

02:58:43.180 --> 02:58:46.420
to only doing the things that I am good at and enjoy

02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:47.580
and not doing anything else

02:58:47.580 --> 02:58:48.980
because I don't wanna waste my time.

02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:51.340
And so I'm just getting to do what I wanna do

02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:52.580
and I'm really loving it.

02:58:53.620 --> 02:58:56.780
What hope, positive hope do you have

02:58:56.780 --> 02:59:00.620
for the future of human civilization in say 50 years,

02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:01.820
100 years, 200 years?

02:59:01.820 --> 02:59:04.100
People are great just by their nature.

02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:07.460
I mean, they're super complicated, but I like people.

02:59:07.460 --> 02:59:08.980
I always have liked people.

02:59:10.980 --> 02:59:12.220
If I was sitting here with Nikki Haley,

02:59:12.220 --> 02:59:13.620
who I guess I've been pretty clear

02:59:13.620 --> 02:59:15.740
I'm not like a mega fan of Nikki Haley's,

02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:18.580
I would enjoy it.

02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:21.460
I've never met anybody I couldn't enjoy on some level

02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:23.140
given enough time.

02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:28.140
So as long as nobody tampers with the human recipe,

02:59:29.460 --> 02:59:31.180
with human nature itself,

02:59:31.180 --> 02:59:35.500
I will always feel blessed by being around other people.

02:59:35.500 --> 02:59:37.420
And that's true around the world.

02:59:38.380 --> 02:59:40.220
I've never been to a country

02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:41.940
and I've been to scores of countries

02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:45.300
where I didn't, given a week, really like it

02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:46.980
and like the people.

02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:49.460
So yeah, bad leaders are like a,

02:59:52.060 --> 02:59:54.060
recurring theme in human history.

02:59:54.060 --> 02:59:56.020
Like they're mostly bad

02:59:56.020 --> 02:59:57.860
and we've got an unusually bad set right now,

02:59:57.860 --> 03:00:00.060
but we'll have better ones at some point.

03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:01.060
I just don't wanna,

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:05.900
one thing I don't like more than nuclear weapons

03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:06.740
and more than AI,

03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:08.460
one thing that really, really bothers me

03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:10.380
is the idea of using technology

03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:12.340
to change the human brain permanently.

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:16.180
Because you're tampering with the secret sauce,

03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:20.460
you're tampering with God's creation and totally evil.

03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:23.820
I mean, I literally sat there the other day with Klaus Schwab.

03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:25.860
I was with Klaus Schwab,

03:00:25.860 --> 03:00:28.060
was like a total moron.

03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:29.540
I'm like a hundred years old

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:31.020
and like has no idea what's going on in the world,

03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:33.140
but he's like one of these guys who,

03:00:33.140 --> 03:00:35.540
speaking of mediocre, everyone's so afraid of Klaus Schwab.

03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:36.580
I don't think Klaus Schwab

03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:38.100
is gonna be organizing anything again.

03:00:38.100 --> 03:00:40.660
He's just like a total figurehead, like a douchebag.

03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:42.700
But anyway, but he was talking

03:00:42.700 --> 03:00:45.180
and he's reading all these talking points

03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:47.860
like all the cool kids are talking about Adapos

03:00:47.860 --> 03:00:49.020
and whatever.

03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:51.140
And he starts talking about it in his survey,

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:52.860
in his accent.

03:00:52.860 --> 03:00:54.580
He was saying, I think it's so important

03:00:54.580 --> 03:00:57.260
that we follow in an ethical way,

03:00:57.260 --> 03:00:59.300
always in an ethical way, of course, very ethical.

03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:00.780
I'm a very ethical man.

03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:02.460
That we follow the,

03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:05.500
using technology to improve the human mind

03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:08.260
and I'm like, okay,

03:01:08.260 --> 03:01:10.140
you have no idea what you're talking about.

03:01:10.140 --> 03:01:12.980
You're like as senile as Joe Biden.

03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:15.700
But what was so striking is that no one in the room

03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:17.420
is like, wait, what?

03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:18.980
You're fucking with people's brains?

03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:23.220
Like, what are you even talking about?

03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:24.580
Who do you think you are?

03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:26.860
I mean, you're right.

03:01:26.860 --> 03:01:30.260
The secret sauce, the human mind is really special.

03:01:30.260 --> 03:01:32.380
Like we should not mess with it.

03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:33.220
It's all about the food.

03:01:33.220 --> 03:01:34.780
Should be very careful.

03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:37.940
Whatever special thing it does,

03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:40.780
it seems like it's a good thing.

03:01:40.780 --> 03:01:42.740
Like human beings are fundamentally good

03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:46.180
and like these sources of creativity,

03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:47.540
a creative force in the universe

03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:48.860
we don't wanna mess with.

03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:51.740
Oh, I mean, what else matters?

03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:53.780
I don't understand.

03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:55.380
I mean, I guess,

03:01:55.380 --> 03:01:58.220
look, I don't wanna seem like the Unabomber

03:01:58.220 --> 03:01:59.460
and I'm not.

03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:00.780
We are in a cabin in the woods.

03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:01.620
No, I don't.

03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:03.300
I'm sympathetic to some of his ideas,

03:02:03.300 --> 03:02:04.940
but not of course sending mail bombs to people

03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:05.780
because I like people.

03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:07.780
But I mean, I don't believe in violence at all.

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:12.780
But I think the problem with technology,

03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:14.660
one of the problems with technology

03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:16.060
is the way that people approach it

03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:18.420
in a very kind of mindless, heedless way.

03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:20.660
And I think it's important,

03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:23.300
this idea that it's inexorable and we can't control it.

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:24.660
And if we don't do it, someone else will.

03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:26.980
And there's some truth in that,

03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:28.460
but it's not the whole story.

03:02:28.460 --> 03:02:30.700
We do have free will

03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:34.460
and we are creating these things intentionally.

03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:36.020
And I think it's incumbent on us,

03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:39.460
it's a requirement of a moral requirement of us,

03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:42.780
that we ask like, is this a net gain or a net loss?

03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:44.420
What to the extent we can foresee them,

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:46.220
will the effects be, et cetera, et cetera?

03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:49.580
It's like, it's not super complicated.

03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:51.780
So I just, I prize long-term thinking.

03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:53.940
I don't always apply it in my own life, obviously.

03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:57.020
I want to, but I prize it.

03:02:57.020 --> 03:02:58.300
And I think that people with power

03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.340
should think about future generations.

03:03:00.980 --> 03:03:01.820
And I don't see that kind of thinking at all.

03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:03.860
They all seem like children to me.

03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:05.780
And like, don't give children handguns

03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:07.460
because they can hurt people.

03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:09.500
Yeah, fundamentally you want people in power

03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:11.100
to be pro humanity.

03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:12.580
By the way, you don't want people who are 81

03:03:12.580 --> 03:03:15.100
who are gonna die anyway, why do they care?

03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:16.660
And by the way, if your track record

03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:18.900
with your own family is miserable,

03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:22.500
why would I give you my family to oversee?

03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:24.940
I just don't, like, again,

03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:28.500
these are autistic level questions that someone should answer.

03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:31.900
Well, thank you for asking those questions, first of all.

03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:35.740
And thank you for this conversation.

03:03:35.740 --> 03:03:38.540
Thank you for welcoming me to the cabin in the woods.

03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:40.020
Thank you.

03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:41.460
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:03:41.460 --> 03:03:43.020
with Tucker Carlson.

03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:44.180
To support this podcast,

03:03:44.180 --> 03:03:46.820
please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:03:46.820 --> 03:03:50.340
And now let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi.

03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:55.100
When I despair, I remember that all through history,

03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:58.340
the way of truth and love has always won.

03:03:59.220 --> 03:04:01.660
There have been tyrants and murderers,

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:04.500
and for a time, they can seem invincible,

03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:06.940
but in the end, they always fall.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:09.140
Think of it, always.

03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:12.940
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
