00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
The following is a conversation with Brian Greene,

00:02.840 --> 00:04.900
theoretical physicist at Columbia

00:04.900 --> 00:08.140
and author of many amazing books on physics,

00:08.140 --> 00:11.500
including his latest, Until the End of Time,

00:11.500 --> 00:14.460
Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning

00:14.460 --> 00:16.880
in an Evolving Universe.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.100
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.180
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:21.180 --> 00:22.420
in the description.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.260
And now, here's my conversation with Brian Greene.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.940
In your most recent book, Until the End of Time,

00:29.940 --> 00:32.640
you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate he had

00:32.640 --> 00:34.880
about God in 1948.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.520
He says, quote, so far as scientific evidence goes,

00:39.520 --> 00:42.420
the universe has crawled by slow stages

00:42.420 --> 00:45.680
to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth

00:45.680 --> 00:48.900
and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages

00:48.900 --> 00:51.260
to a condition of universal death.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.060
If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose,

00:55.060 --> 00:57.760
I can only say that the purpose is one

00:57.760 --> 00:59.600
that does not appeal to me.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.260
I see no reason therefore to believe in any sort of God.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.080
That's quite a depressing statement.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.920
As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe

01:09.920 --> 01:12.400
and the emergence of human consciousness.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.960
So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective

01:15.960 --> 01:17.200
to take on this story?

01:18.160 --> 01:19.900
Well, I think the more hopeful perspective

01:19.900 --> 01:23.480
is to more fully understand

01:25.080 --> 01:28.380
what was driving Bertrand Russell to this perspective

01:28.380 --> 01:32.700
and then to see it within a broader context.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.820
And really, that's in some sense what my book,

01:35.820 --> 01:37.500
Until the End of Time, is all about.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.740
But in brief, I would say that there's a lot of truth

01:41.740 --> 01:43.700
to what Bertrand Russell was saying there.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.700
When you look at the second law of thermodynamics,

01:45.700 --> 01:48.140
which is the underlying scientific idea

01:48.140 --> 01:51.640
that's driving this notion that everything's gonna wither,

01:51.640 --> 01:55.140
decay, fall apart, yeah, that's true.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.240
Second law of thermodynamics establishes

01:57.240 --> 02:02.240
that disorder, entropy, in aggregate, is always on the rise.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.040
And that is indeed interpretable as disintegration

02:07.040 --> 02:09.560
and destruction over sufficiently long time scales.

02:09.560 --> 02:14.560
But my view is when you recognize how special that makes us

02:14.960 --> 02:18.560
that we are these exquisitely ordered configurations

02:18.560 --> 02:22.080
of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye

02:22.080 --> 02:25.420
in cosmological time-like terms,

02:25.420 --> 02:27.380
the fact that we're here and we can do what we do,

02:27.380 --> 02:32.380
to me, that's just really something that inspires gratitude

02:32.780 --> 02:37.780
and wonder and a sense of deep purpose

02:38.020 --> 02:42.100
by virtue of being these unique collections of entities

02:42.100 --> 02:44.640
that happen to rise up, look around,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.500
and try to figure out where we are

02:46.500 --> 02:48.540
and what the heck we should do with our time.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.740
So it's not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell

02:51.740 --> 02:56.740
in terms of the basic physics and the basic unfolding,

02:58.260 --> 03:00.580
but I think it's really a matter of the slant

03:00.580 --> 03:02.840
that you take on what it means for us.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.680
So maybe we'll skip around a bit,

03:06.680 --> 03:08.860
but let me ask the biggest possible question,

03:08.860 --> 03:10.260
then you said purpose.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.500
So what's the meaning of it all then?

03:12.500 --> 03:17.500
Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this,

03:18.140 --> 03:22.200
from this brief emergence of complexity

03:22.200 --> 03:24.300
that arises from simple things

03:24.300 --> 03:28.220
and then goes into a heat death that is once again,

03:28.220 --> 03:29.820
returns to simple things

03:29.820 --> 03:33.080
as the march of the second law of thermodynamics goes on?

03:33.080 --> 03:33.920
I think there is,

03:33.920 --> 03:36.680
but I don't think it's a universal answer.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.380
And so I think throughout the ages,

03:39.380 --> 03:44.380
there has been a kind of quest for some final way

03:45.220 --> 03:47.660
of articulating meaning and purpose,

03:47.660 --> 03:50.540
whether it's God, whether it's love,

03:50.540 --> 03:51.660
whether it's companionship.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.700
I mean, many people put forward different ways

03:53.700 --> 03:56.660
of taking this question on.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.340
And there is no one right answer

03:59.340 --> 04:04.340
when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn't care.

04:05.060 --> 04:08.940
There is nothing out there that is the final answer.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.860
It's not as though we need a more powerful telescope

04:11.900 --> 04:14.980
and somehow if we can look deeply into the universe,

04:14.980 --> 04:17.340
all will become clear.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.020
In fact, the deeper we've looked,

04:19.020 --> 04:21.460
both literally and metaphorically,

04:21.460 --> 04:24.900
into the universe and into the structure of reality,

04:24.900 --> 04:27.060
the more it's become clear

04:27.060 --> 04:32.060
that we are just a momentary byproduct of laws of physics

04:33.260 --> 04:36.260
that don't have any emotional content.

04:36.260 --> 04:39.660
They don't have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.380
And when you recognize that,

04:41.380 --> 04:43.900
you realize that searching for the universal

04:43.900 --> 04:47.700
for this kind of a question is a fool's errand.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.860
Every individual has the capacity to make their own meaning,

04:51.860 --> 04:53.740
to set their own purpose.

04:53.740 --> 04:57.900
And that's not some platitude, that is what we are.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.820
Because there is no fundamental answer,

04:59.820 --> 05:01.140
it's what you make of it.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.220
And however much that may sound like a hallmark card,

05:04.220 --> 05:09.140
this really is the deep lesson of physics and science

05:09.140 --> 05:11.460
more generally over the past few hundred years.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.740
Well, there's some level where you can objectively say

05:14.740 --> 05:18.100
that whatever we've got going on here is kind of peculiar.

05:18.100 --> 05:23.100
It's kind of special in terms of complexity.

05:23.380 --> 05:26.580
And maybe you can even begin to measure it

05:26.580 --> 05:28.940
and like come up with metrics

05:28.940 --> 05:31.580
where whatever we've got going on on earth,

05:31.580 --> 05:35.660
these like interesting hierarchical complexities

05:35.660 --> 05:39.380
that form more and more sophisticated biological system.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.820
That seems kind of unique

05:40.820 --> 05:43.580
when you look at the entirety of the universe,

05:43.580 --> 05:48.580
the observable part that we can see with our tools.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.900
So I have to ask, as you describe in your book once again,

05:53.980 --> 05:56.260
Schrodinger wrote the book, What is Life?

05:56.260 --> 05:59.260
based on a few lectures he gave in 1944.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.780
So let me ask the fundamental question here.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.620
What is life?

06:04.620 --> 06:06.860
This particular thing we've got going on here,

06:06.860 --> 06:08.340
this pocket of complexity

06:08.340 --> 06:10.260
that emerged from such simple things.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.700
Yeah, it's a tough question.

06:11.700 --> 06:15.660
I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once,

06:15.660 --> 06:18.420
and I already have my preconceived notion

06:18.420 --> 06:20.060
which he pretty much confirmed,

06:20.060 --> 06:24.940
which is if one could give an answer to that question

06:24.940 --> 06:28.140
that allowed you to sort of draw a line in the sand

06:28.140 --> 06:30.700
between the not living and the living,

06:30.700 --> 06:34.060
then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for

06:34.060 --> 06:36.500
in trying to say what is so special about life.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.300
But the fact of the matter is it's a continuum.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.220
There's a continuum from the things

06:41.220 --> 06:44.140
that we would typically call non-living inanimate

06:44.140 --> 06:46.700
to the things that we obviously call animate

06:46.700 --> 06:49.820
and full of the currents of life.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.820
Somewhere in there,

06:51.820 --> 06:55.540
it is a question of the complexity of the structure,

06:55.540 --> 07:00.340
the ability of the structure to take in raw material

07:00.340 --> 07:04.020
from the environment and process it through a metabolism,

07:04.020 --> 07:07.260
that allows the structure to extract energy

07:07.260 --> 07:10.980
and to release entropy to the wider environment.

07:10.980 --> 07:15.100
Somewhere in those collections of biological processes

07:15.100 --> 07:19.540
is the necessity or the necessary ingredients

07:19.540 --> 07:20.580
and processes for life.

07:20.580 --> 07:22.620
But drawing that line in the sand

07:22.620 --> 07:25.540
is not something that we're able to do,

07:25.540 --> 07:27.500
but I would agree with you.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.020
It's deeply peculiar.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.900
It may in fact be unique,

07:33.900 --> 07:35.020
but it may not.

07:35.020 --> 07:38.220
It could be that the universe is such

07:38.220 --> 07:41.020
that under fairly typical conditions,

07:41.020 --> 07:46.020
a star that's a well-ordered source of low entropy energy,

07:47.420 --> 07:49.100
that's what the sun is,

07:49.100 --> 07:51.020
together with a planet being bathed

07:51.020 --> 07:52.700
by that low entropy energy,

07:52.700 --> 07:55.740
together with a surface that has enough

07:55.740 --> 07:59.300
of the raw constituents that we recognize

07:59.300 --> 08:03.140
are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions

08:03.140 --> 08:07.980
where star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace

08:07.980 --> 08:09.260
that is the core of a star.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.700
It could be that all you need

08:11.700 --> 08:15.020
are those fairly commonplace conditions

08:15.020 --> 08:17.020
and maybe life naturally forms.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.420
Look, the James Webb Space Telescope, right,

08:19.420 --> 08:21.780
is going up hopefully in December.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.740
And one of the goals of that mission

08:23.740 --> 08:26.660
is to look at atmospheres around distant planets

08:26.660 --> 08:31.660
and perhaps come to some sense of how special or not life

08:32.100 --> 08:35.980
or life as we know it is in the universe.

08:35.980 --> 08:39.060
Which part of the story of life,

08:39.060 --> 08:40.700
let's stick to Earth for a second,

08:40.700 --> 08:42.740
do you think is the hardest?

08:42.740 --> 08:45.860
If you were like a betting man,

08:45.860 --> 08:48.460
which part is the hardest to make happen?

08:48.460 --> 08:50.180
Is it the origin of life?

08:50.180 --> 08:52.500
Again, we haven't drawn the line of where,

08:52.500 --> 08:55.940
as you say, the line between a rock and a rabbit.

08:57.820 --> 09:01.180
That part, is it complex organisms

09:01.180 --> 09:03.260
like multicellular organisms?

09:03.260 --> 09:05.980
Is it crawling out of the ocean

09:05.980 --> 09:09.380
where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?

09:09.380 --> 09:12.940
Is it then the us homo sapiens

09:12.940 --> 09:16.460
as we like to think of ourselves as special and intelligent?

09:17.340 --> 09:20.220
Or is it somewhere in between as you also talk about,

09:21.220 --> 09:25.220
again, very hard to know at which point

09:25.220 --> 09:28.220
this consciousness emerge?

09:29.020 --> 09:33.180
If you were to sort of took a survey and made bets

09:33.180 --> 09:36.420
about other Earth-like planets in the universe,

09:36.420 --> 09:38.700
where do you think they get stuck the most?

09:38.700 --> 09:39.540
Well, I would certainly say

09:39.540 --> 09:40.420
if we're gonna go all the way

09:40.420 --> 09:42.460
to conscious beings like ourselves,

09:42.460 --> 09:45.220
I would put it at the onset of consciousness,

09:45.220 --> 09:47.660
which again, I think is a continuum.

09:47.660 --> 09:49.140
I don't think it is something

09:49.140 --> 09:51.700
that you can draw the line in the sand,

09:51.700 --> 09:54.020
but there are obvious circumstances,

09:54.020 --> 09:56.060
there are obvious creatures such as ourselves

09:56.060 --> 09:57.980
where we do recognize

09:57.980 --> 10:01.860
a certain kind of self-reflective conscious awareness.

10:01.860 --> 10:05.700
And if we think about what it would require

10:05.700 --> 10:10.700
for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,

10:11.020 --> 10:13.620
I think that's probably the hardest part

10:13.620 --> 10:16.780
because look, take Earth and recognize

10:16.780 --> 10:20.500
that it weren't for some singular event

10:20.500 --> 10:22.020
65 million years ago

10:22.020 --> 10:25.340
where this large rock slams into planet Earth

10:25.340 --> 10:27.900
and then wipes out the dinosaurs.

10:27.900 --> 10:31.420
Maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet

10:31.420 --> 10:35.620
and they may well have not developed

10:35.620 --> 10:38.940
the kind of conscious awareness that we have.

10:38.940 --> 10:41.620
So for billions of years on this planet,

10:41.620 --> 10:44.180
there was life that didn't have

10:44.180 --> 10:47.220
the kind of conscious awareness that we have.

10:47.220 --> 10:52.220
And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history

10:52.340 --> 10:56.140
that allowed a mammalian species like us

10:56.140 --> 10:58.260
to ultimately be the end product.

10:58.260 --> 11:02.060
And so yeah, I could imagine there's a lot of life out there,

11:02.060 --> 11:04.780
but perhaps none of it's wondering

11:04.780 --> 11:06.380
what's the meaning of life

11:06.380 --> 11:08.620
or trying to make sense of it.

11:08.620 --> 11:11.260
Just going about its business of survival,

11:11.260 --> 11:13.620
which of course is the dominant activity

11:13.620 --> 11:15.620
that life on this planet has practiced.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.900
We are a rare exception to that.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.020
And I really appreciate that you lean into

11:20.060 --> 11:22.500
some of these unanswerable questions with me today.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.420
But so you think about consciousness

11:25.420 --> 11:28.420
not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one.

11:28.420 --> 11:33.340
You think it was a continuum that humans somehow

11:33.340 --> 11:37.500
are maybe some of the most conscious beings on Earth.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.140
So you're, so.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.820
I mean, people will dispute that.

11:40.820 --> 11:41.980
Yes, I mean, well, yeah.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.700
And it's a very hard argument to make.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.900
People will dispute that.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.220
Rocks probably will stay quiet on the matter.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.780
Maybe not, right?

11:48.780 --> 11:51.580
For the moment, they're waiting for their opportunity.

11:51.580 --> 11:56.580
But I agree that, look, even when you and I

11:57.780 --> 12:01.620
look at each other, I am not fully convinced

12:01.620 --> 12:03.580
that you're a conscious being, right?

12:03.580 --> 12:04.580
I mean, I think that you are.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.420
It's not to me.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.300
I mean, your behavior is such that

12:07.300 --> 12:09.340
that's the best explanation for what's going on.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.460
But of course we're all in the position

12:11.460 --> 12:16.460
of only having direct awareness of our own conscious being.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.820
And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world,

12:19.820 --> 12:21.700
we're in a similar state of ignorance

12:21.700 --> 12:25.260
regarding what's actually happening inside of their head,

12:25.260 --> 12:26.540
if they have a head.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.300
And so it's hard to know how singular we are.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.260
But I would say based on the best available data

12:33.260 --> 12:34.900
and the best explanations that we can make,

12:34.900 --> 12:36.580
yeah, there is something special about us.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.500
I don't think that there are fish walking around

12:39.500 --> 12:43.220
and coming up with existentialism.

12:43.260 --> 12:46.820
I don't know that there are dogs walking around

12:46.820 --> 12:48.260
who've developed an understanding

12:48.260 --> 12:49.620
of the general theory of relativity.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.860
I mean, maybe we're wrong,

12:50.860 --> 12:52.780
but that seems the best explanation.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.740
What do you think is more special,

12:55.740 --> 12:57.940
intelligence or consciousness?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.300
I think consciousness.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.140
And I think that there's a deep connection

13:02.140 --> 13:03.620
between these ideas.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.980
They are distinct, but they're deeply connected.

13:05.980 --> 13:09.140
But look, I mean, to me and to, of course,

13:09.140 --> 13:11.340
many philosophers actually coined a name for this,

13:11.340 --> 13:13.020
the hard problem of consciousness.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.100
David Chalmers and others.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.780
As a physicist, I look at the world

13:17.780 --> 13:22.780
and I see it's particles governed by physical law.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.620
We can name them.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.780
We got electrons, we got quarks

13:27.780 --> 13:29.900
that come in various flavors and so forth.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.500
We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.860
And we have a list of laws

13:34.860 --> 13:37.300
that seemingly govern those ingredients.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.300
And nowhere in there is there even a hint

13:41.300 --> 13:43.860
that when you put those particles together

13:43.860 --> 13:48.260
in the right way, an inner world should turn on.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.060
And it's not only that there's no hint, it's insane.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.700
I mean, it's ridiculous.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.660
How could it be that a thoughtless,

13:56.660 --> 14:00.180
passionless, emotionless particle

14:00.180 --> 14:03.180
when grouped together with compatriots

14:03.180 --> 14:07.260
somehow can yield something so deeply foreign

14:07.260 --> 14:09.380
to the nature of the ingredients themselves?

14:09.780 --> 14:12.900
So answering that question,

14:12.900 --> 14:14.940
I think is among the deepest

14:14.940 --> 14:17.900
and most difficult questions that we face.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.900
Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem

14:23.500 --> 14:26.460
or is it possible?

14:26.460 --> 14:28.100
I think you mentioned in your book

14:28.100 --> 14:30.060
that it's just like almost like a side effect.

14:30.060 --> 14:33.220
It's an emergent thing that's like, oh, it's nice.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.940
It's like a nice little feature.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.620
Yeah, well, I mean, when people use the phrase,

14:37.660 --> 14:40.820
hard problem, I mean, they mean in a somewhat technical sense

14:40.820 --> 14:44.740
that it's trying to explain something

14:44.740 --> 14:47.620
that seems fundamentally unavailable

14:47.620 --> 14:52.620
to third party objective analysis, right?

14:53.140 --> 14:55.620
I'm the only one that can get inside my head

14:55.620 --> 14:57.700
and I can tell you a lot about what's happening

14:57.700 --> 15:00.380
inside my head right now is reflected in what I'm saying.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.140
And you can try to deduce things

15:02.140 --> 15:03.540
about what's going on inside my head,

15:03.540 --> 15:06.260
but you don't have access to it in the way that I do.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.300
And so it seems like a fundamentally different kind

15:08.300 --> 15:12.580
of problem from the ones that we have successfully dealt

15:12.580 --> 15:14.220
with over the course of centuries in science,

15:14.220 --> 15:15.900
where we look at the motion of the moon,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.300
everybody can look, everybody can measure it.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.940
We look at the properties of hydrogen

15:20.940 --> 15:22.660
when you shine lasers on,

15:22.660 --> 15:25.900
everybody can look at the data and understand it.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.020
And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem.

15:29.020 --> 15:29.860
And in that sense,

15:29.860 --> 15:33.620
it seems like it is hard relative to the others.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.900
But I do think ultimately

15:35.900 --> 15:38.980
that the explanation will be as you recount.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.140
I think that a hundred years from now,

15:41.140 --> 15:42.180
or maybe it's a thousand,

15:42.180 --> 15:45.540
it's hard to predict the timescale for developments,

15:45.540 --> 15:47.300
but I think we'll get to a place

15:47.300 --> 15:50.020
where we'll look back and kind of smile

15:50.020 --> 15:53.340
at those folks in the 20th century

15:53.340 --> 15:55.340
and before 21st century and before

15:55.340 --> 15:59.340
who thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious,

15:59.340 --> 16:00.740
when the reality of it is,

16:01.380 --> 16:03.820
it's just a thing that happens

16:03.820 --> 16:05.820
when particles come together.

16:05.820 --> 16:10.420
And however mysterious that feels right now,

16:10.420 --> 16:11.260
I think for instance,

16:11.260 --> 16:13.660
when we start to build conscious systems,

16:13.660 --> 16:16.020
things that you're more familiar with than I am,

16:16.020 --> 16:19.420
when we start to build these artificial systems

16:19.420 --> 16:21.140
and those systems report to us,

16:22.020 --> 16:24.300
I'm feeling sad, I'm feeling anxious.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.700
Yeah, there's a world going on inside here.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.620
I think the mystery of consciousness

16:28.620 --> 16:30.860
will just begin to evaporate.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.460
Well, first of all, beautifully put,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.220
and I agree with you completely,

16:35.220 --> 16:38.460
just the way you said it, it'll begin to evaporate.

16:38.460 --> 16:41.260
I have built quite a few robots

16:41.260 --> 16:46.260
and have had them do emotional type things.

16:47.220 --> 16:49.380
And it's immediate that exactly what you're saying,

16:49.380 --> 16:52.580
this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,

16:52.580 --> 16:57.580
that the kind of need to truly understand,

16:57.620 --> 17:00.380
to solve the hard problem of consciousness disappears

17:00.380 --> 17:03.860
because, well, I don't really care

17:03.860 --> 17:05.660
if I understand what can solve

17:05.660 --> 17:07.300
the hard problem of consciousness.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.660
That thing sure as heck looks conscious.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.820
I feel like that way when I interact with a dog,

17:12.820 --> 17:16.820
I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness

17:16.820 --> 17:21.820
to be able to interact and richly enjoy the experience

17:22.740 --> 17:24.380
with this other living being.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.460
Obviously, same thing with other humans.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.980
I don't need to fully understand it.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.060
And there's some aspect,

17:30.060 --> 17:32.180
maybe this is a little bit too engineering focused,

17:32.180 --> 17:33.940
but there's some aspect in which

17:33.940 --> 17:37.820
it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick

17:38.700 --> 17:41.780
to help us communicate with each other.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.700
It sounds ridiculous to say,

17:43.700 --> 17:48.700
but sort of the ability to experience the world

17:49.860 --> 17:52.820
is very useful in a subjective sense,

17:52.820 --> 17:56.180
is very useful to put yourself in that world

17:56.860 --> 17:59.380
and to be able to describe the experience to others.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.860
It could be just a social and the merge.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.500
Obviously, animals, the sort of more primitive animals

18:04.500 --> 18:08.780
might experience consciousness in some more primitive way,

18:08.780 --> 18:12.300
but this kind of rich subjective experience

18:12.300 --> 18:13.740
that we think about as humans,

18:13.740 --> 18:16.660
I think it's probably deeply coupled with language

18:16.660 --> 18:17.860
and poetry.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.700
Yeah, that resonates with my view as well.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.260
I mean, there's a scientist,

18:22.260 --> 18:25.140
maybe you've spoken to Michael Graziano from Princeton.

18:25.140 --> 18:29.620
Yeah, he's developed ideas of consciousness that,

18:29.620 --> 18:31.620
look, I don't think they solve the problem,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.340
but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way

18:34.340 --> 18:39.020
where basically we are not aware

18:39.020 --> 18:43.060
of all the underlying physiochemical processes

18:43.060 --> 18:45.900
that make our brains and our inner worlds

18:45.900 --> 18:48.020
tick the way they do.

18:48.020 --> 18:52.220
And because of that dissociation between sensation

18:52.220 --> 18:55.140
and the physics of it and the chemistry of it

18:55.140 --> 18:56.620
and the biology of it,

18:56.620 --> 18:59.620
it feels like our minds and our inner worlds

18:59.620 --> 19:00.980
are just untethered,

19:00.980 --> 19:04.660
like floating somewhere in this gray matter

19:04.660 --> 19:06.500
inside of our heads.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.620
And the way I like to think of it is like,

19:08.620 --> 19:13.620
look, if you're in a dark room, right,

19:13.980 --> 19:17.380
and I had blown the dark paint on my fingers,

19:17.380 --> 19:20.380
so all you saw was my fingers dancing around,

19:20.380 --> 19:21.980
there'd be something mysterious.

19:22.380 --> 19:24.460
How could those fingers be doing that?

19:24.460 --> 19:25.300
And then you turn around, you realize,

19:25.300 --> 19:27.700
oh, there's this arm underlying it,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.820
and that's the deep physical connection that explains it all.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.620
And I think that's what we're missing,

19:32.620 --> 19:34.340
the deep physical connection

19:34.340 --> 19:36.460
between what's happening up here

19:36.460 --> 19:38.540
and what is responsible for it

19:38.540 --> 19:41.420
in a physical, chemical, biological way.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.660
And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding

19:43.660 --> 19:46.740
of why consciousness feels so mysterious,

19:46.740 --> 19:51.580
because we are suppressing all of the underlying science

19:51.620 --> 19:53.580
that ultimately is responsible for it,

19:53.580 --> 19:55.980
and one day we will reveal that more fully,

19:55.980 --> 19:59.300
and I think that will help us tether this experience

19:59.300 --> 20:01.620
to something quite tangible in the world.

20:01.620 --> 20:05.420
I wonder if the mystery

20:05.420 --> 20:10.180
is an important component of enjoying something.

20:10.180 --> 20:14.260
So once we know how this thing works,

20:14.260 --> 20:19.260
maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.340
We'll seek other sources of enjoyment,

20:22.300 --> 20:25.380
but this is, again, from an engineering perspective,

20:25.380 --> 20:29.060
I wonder if the mystery is an important component.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.580
Well, have you ever seen,

20:31.580 --> 20:36.580
there's this beautiful interview that Richard Feynman did,

20:36.940 --> 20:39.620
great Nobel laureate physicist responsible

20:39.620 --> 20:42.060
for a lot of our understanding of quantum mechanics,

20:42.060 --> 20:43.060
quantum fielding and so forth,

20:43.060 --> 20:46.500
and he was in a conversation with an interviewer

20:46.500 --> 20:48.580
where he noted that some people feel

20:48.580 --> 20:51.060
like once the mystery is gone,

20:51.060 --> 20:53.420
once science explains something,

20:55.940 --> 20:57.380
the beauty goes away.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.340
The wonder of it goes away,

20:58.340 --> 21:02.060
and he was emphasizing in his response to that,

21:02.060 --> 21:05.060
he's like, no, that's not the right way of thinking about it.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.860
He says, look, when I look at a rose,

21:07.740 --> 21:11.540
he says, yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,

21:11.540 --> 21:13.940
the color, the texture.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.940
He says, but what I can do that you can't,

21:15.940 --> 21:18.700
if you're not a physicist, I can look more deeply

21:18.700 --> 21:20.340
and understand where the red comes from,

21:20.340 --> 21:21.500
where the aroma comes from,

21:21.500 --> 21:22.740
where the structure comes from.

21:22.740 --> 21:27.740
He says, that only augments my wonder.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.940
It only augments my experience.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.580
It doesn't flatten it or take away from it.

21:32.580 --> 21:37.580
So I sort of take that as a bit of a motto in some sense,

21:38.820 --> 21:43.860
that there is a wonder that comes from a kind of ignorance.

21:43.860 --> 21:45.780
And I don't mean that in a derogatory sense,

21:45.780 --> 21:47.340
but just from not knowing.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.740
So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.

21:49.740 --> 21:53.500
There's another kind of wonder that comes from knowing

21:53.500 --> 21:55.860
and deep knowing.

21:55.860 --> 22:00.860
And I think that kind of wonder has its own special character

22:00.860 --> 22:03.140
that in some ways can be more gratifying.

22:04.660 --> 22:06.060
I hope he's right.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.460
I hope you're right.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.500
But there's also, I remember he said something about

22:10.500 --> 22:13.940
like science is an onion or something like that.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.540
You can peel back, you keep peeling back.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.580
I mean, there is also, when you understand something,

22:20.420 --> 22:22.060
there's always a sense that there's more mystery

22:22.060 --> 22:23.380
to understand.

22:23.380 --> 22:27.060
Like you never get to the bottom of the mystery.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.780
But I think it's also different than,

22:29.780 --> 22:33.620
I don't think you can analogize say to a magician, right?

22:33.620 --> 22:35.340
A magician does some trick.

22:35.340 --> 22:37.740
You learn how it sounds like, oh my God,

22:37.740 --> 22:39.540
that's ridiculous when you find.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.780
But nature is perhaps the best magician

22:42.780 --> 22:45.060
if you wanna try to make the analogy there.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.860
Because when you peel things back and you understand

22:48.900 --> 22:53.260
how it is that things have color and you have electrons

22:53.260 --> 22:56.460
dancing from one orbital to another,

22:56.460 --> 22:59.260
emitting photons at very particular wavelengths

22:59.260 --> 23:01.940
that are described by these beautiful equations

23:01.940 --> 23:03.500
of quantum electrodynamics,

23:03.500 --> 23:06.100
part of which that Feynman developed.

23:06.100 --> 23:09.500
It gives you a greater sense of awe

23:09.500 --> 23:11.740
when the curtain is pulled back

23:11.740 --> 23:14.380
than what happens in other circumstances

23:14.380 --> 23:16.420
where it does flatten it completely.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.580
Yeah, it's very possible then, say in physics,

23:18.580 --> 23:21.420
that we arrive at a theory of everything

23:21.420 --> 23:23.500
that unifies the laws of physics

23:23.500 --> 23:25.020
and has a very strong understanding

23:25.020 --> 23:26.580
of the fabric of reality.

23:26.580 --> 23:30.420
Even like for the Big Bang to today,

23:30.420 --> 23:33.020
it's possible that that understanding

23:33.020 --> 23:36.540
is only going to elevate our appreciation

23:36.540 --> 23:37.380
of this whole thing.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.300
Yeah, I think it will.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.140
I think it will.

23:39.140 --> 23:41.020
I mean, I think it has so far.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.260
But the other side of it which you emphasize is

23:44.260 --> 23:49.260
it's not like science somehow reaches an end, right?

23:49.340 --> 23:51.460
There are certain categories of questions

23:51.460 --> 23:53.060
that do reach an end.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.100
I think we one day will close the book

23:55.100 --> 23:58.180
on nature's ingredients and the fundamental laws.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.660
Now, we can't prove that.

23:59.660 --> 24:02.380
Maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller.

24:02.380 --> 24:03.860
Maybe there are deeper and deeper laws,

24:03.860 --> 24:04.820
but I don't think so.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.900
I think that there's going to be a collection

24:06.900 --> 24:09.300
of ingredients and a collection of basic laws.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.660
That chapter will close, but it's one chapter.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.900
Now we take that knowledge and we try to understand

24:16.900 --> 24:19.780
how the world builds the structures that it does,

24:19.780 --> 24:23.420
from planets to people to black holes

24:23.420 --> 24:25.660
to the possibility of other universes.

24:25.660 --> 24:29.620
And every step of the way, the collection of questions

24:29.620 --> 24:32.340
that we don't know the answer to only blossoms.

24:32.340 --> 24:36.780
And so there's a deep sense of gratification

24:36.780 --> 24:39.060
from understanding certain qualities of the world.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.540
But I would say that if you take a ratio

24:42.540 --> 24:45.820
of what we understand to the things that we know

24:45.820 --> 24:47.700
that we don't yet understand,

24:47.700 --> 24:50.060
that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller

24:50.060 --> 24:52.180
because the things that we know that we don't understand

24:52.180 --> 24:53.380
grows larger and larger.

24:54.340 --> 24:57.020
Do you have a hope that we solve that theory

24:57.020 --> 25:00.220
of everything puzzle in the next few decades?

25:00.220 --> 25:03.860
So there's been a bunch of attempts from string theory

25:03.860 --> 25:07.540
to all kinds of attempts at trying to solve quantum gravity

25:07.540 --> 25:10.300
or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.300
There's a lot of complexities to this.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.300
One, for experimental validation,

25:16.300 --> 25:17.860
you have to observe effects

25:17.860 --> 25:20.460
that are very difficult to measure.

25:20.460 --> 25:23.700
So you have to build, that's like an engineering challenge.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.300
And then there's the theory challenge,

25:25.300 --> 25:28.980
which is like, it seems very difficult to connect

25:28.980 --> 25:31.860
to the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.

25:31.860 --> 25:35.540
Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?

25:35.540 --> 25:37.620
Well, I have to have to have a hope.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.660
I mean, it's in some sense,

25:39.660 --> 25:43.340
but I devote at least part of my professional life

25:43.340 --> 25:45.100
toward trying to make progress on,

25:45.100 --> 25:47.580
I'm glad you used the phrase quantum gravity.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.340
I'm not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase

25:50.340 --> 25:53.380
because it does make other scientists feel like

25:53.380 --> 25:55.660
if they're not working on this, what are they working on?

25:55.660 --> 25:57.540
Man's like, you know, there's not much left

25:57.540 --> 25:58.940
when you're talking about theory of everything.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.500
Biology is just small details we'll figure out.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.220
Yeah, so it is really trying to put gravity

26:04.220 --> 26:06.220
and quantum mechanics together.

26:06.220 --> 26:08.620
And since I was a college kid,

26:08.620 --> 26:13.020
I was deeply fascinated with gravity.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.540
And as I learned quantum mechanics,

26:15.540 --> 26:19.020
the notion of physicists being stumped

26:19.020 --> 26:20.580
and trying to blend them together,

26:20.580 --> 26:22.300
how could one not get fired up

26:22.300 --> 26:25.980
about maybe contributing something to that journey?

26:25.980 --> 26:27.700
And so we've been on this, you know,

26:27.700 --> 26:29.860
I've been on this for 30 years since I was a student.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.860
We have made progress.

26:31.860 --> 26:32.900
We do have ideas.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.300
You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.540
It's not stuck.

26:37.540 --> 26:40.940
String theory is a vibrant field of research

26:40.940 --> 26:43.660
that is making incredible progress,

26:43.660 --> 26:47.340
but we've not made progress on this issue

26:47.340 --> 26:49.500
of experimental verification, validation,

26:49.500 --> 26:53.980
which is, you know, it is a vital part of the story.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.780
So I would have hoped that by now

26:55.780 --> 26:58.660
we would have made contact with observation.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.660
If you would have interviewed me back in the 80s

27:01.660 --> 27:04.980
when I was, you know, a wild bright-eyed kid

27:04.980 --> 27:07.180
trying to make headway, working 18 hours a day

27:07.180 --> 27:08.260
and this sort of stuff, I would have said,

27:08.260 --> 27:11.100
yeah, by 2021, yeah, we're gonna know

27:11.100 --> 27:13.580
whether it's right or wrong, we'll make contact.

27:13.580 --> 27:14.420
I would have said, look,

27:14.420 --> 27:15.980
there may be certain mathematical puzzles

27:15.980 --> 27:17.180
that we've yet to work out,

27:17.180 --> 27:19.860
but we'll know enough to make contact with experiment.

27:19.860 --> 27:21.540
That has not happened.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.220
On the other hand, if you would have interviewed me back then

27:24.220 --> 27:27.860
and asked me, will we be able to talk about

27:27.860 --> 27:30.420
detail qualities of black holes

27:30.420 --> 27:34.940
and understand them at the level of detail

27:34.940 --> 27:37.700
that we actually, I would have said, no,

27:37.700 --> 27:39.820
I don't think that we're gonna be able to do that.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.540
Will we have an exact formulation of strength

27:42.540 --> 27:43.980
there in certain circumstances?

27:43.980 --> 27:46.620
No, I don't think we're gonna have that, and yet we do.

27:46.620 --> 27:47.940
So it's just to say you don't know

27:47.940 --> 27:51.020
where the progress is going to happen,

27:51.020 --> 27:52.980
but yes, I do hold out hope

27:52.980 --> 27:56.740
that maybe before I move on to wherever,

27:56.740 --> 27:58.100
I don't think there is an after,

27:58.100 --> 28:01.780
but I would love before I leave this earth

28:01.820 --> 28:06.820
to know the answer, but science and the universe,

28:06.940 --> 28:10.460
it's not about pleasing any individual.

28:10.460 --> 28:13.700
It is what it is, and so we just press onward

28:13.700 --> 28:15.060
and we'll see where it goes.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.140
So in terms of strength theory,

28:17.140 --> 28:20.460
if I just look from an outsider's perspective currently

28:20.460 --> 28:22.500
at the theoretical physics community,

28:22.500 --> 28:26.540
strength theory as a theory has been very popular

28:26.540 --> 28:30.740
for a few decades, but has recently fallen out of favor,

28:30.740 --> 28:34.260
or at least it became more popular

28:34.260 --> 28:36.980
to kind of ask the question,

28:36.980 --> 28:39.380
is strength theory really the answer?

28:39.380 --> 28:41.260
Where do you fall on this?

28:41.260 --> 28:43.220
How do you make sense of this puzzle?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.460
Why do you think it has fallen out of favor?

28:45.460 --> 28:47.900
Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement

28:47.900 --> 28:50.300
that's fallen out of favor.

28:50.300 --> 28:55.180
I would say that any field of research when it's new,

28:55.180 --> 28:58.740
and it's the bright, shiny bicycle

28:58.780 --> 29:01.060
that no one has yet seen on that block,

29:01.060 --> 29:03.060
yeah, it's gonna attract attention,

29:03.060 --> 29:06.100
and the news outlets are gonna cover it,

29:06.100 --> 29:09.220
and students are gonna flock to it, sure.

29:09.220 --> 29:14.220
But as a field matures, it does shed those qualities

29:14.260 --> 29:17.260
because it's no longer as novel as it was

29:17.260 --> 29:20.340
when it was first introduced 30 or 40 years ago,

29:20.340 --> 29:22.660
but you need to judge it by a different standard.

29:22.660 --> 29:26.220
You need to judge it by is it making progress

29:26.220 --> 29:28.180
on foundational issues,

29:28.180 --> 29:30.180
deepening our understanding of the subject,

29:30.180 --> 29:31.620
and by that measure,

29:31.620 --> 29:36.580
strength theory is scoring very high.

29:36.580 --> 29:39.300
Now, at the same time, you also need to judge

29:39.300 --> 29:41.100
whether it makes contact with experiment,

29:41.100 --> 29:42.900
as we discussed before too,

29:42.900 --> 29:45.900
and in that measure, we're still challenged.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.220
So I would say that many strength theories,

29:49.220 --> 29:54.220
myself included, are very sober about the theory.

29:54.980 --> 29:58.980
It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago

29:58.980 --> 30:00.580
that hasn't gone away,

30:00.580 --> 30:03.500
but we become better equipped

30:03.500 --> 30:07.380
at assessing the long journey ahead,

30:07.380 --> 30:10.260
and that was something that we weren't particularly good at

30:10.260 --> 30:11.540
back, say, in the 80s.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.580
Look, when I was just starting out in the field,

30:14.580 --> 30:18.820
there was a sense of physics is about to end.

30:18.820 --> 30:22.660
Strength theory is about to be the be all and end all

30:22.700 --> 30:24.260
final unified theory,

30:24.260 --> 30:27.780
and that will bring this chapter to a close.

30:27.780 --> 30:28.620
Now, I have to say,

30:28.620 --> 30:30.740
I think it was more the younger physicists

30:30.740 --> 30:31.860
who were saying that.

30:31.860 --> 30:32.900
Some of them were seasoned,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.820
even if they were pro-strength theory at the time.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.700
I don't know if they were rolling their eyes,

30:37.700 --> 30:41.780
but they knew that was gonna be a long, long journey.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.860
I think people like John Schwartz,

30:43.860 --> 30:45.180
one of the founders of strength theory,

30:45.180 --> 30:46.620
Michael Green, no relation to me,

30:46.620 --> 30:49.660
founders of the theory, Edward Whitten,

30:49.660 --> 30:52.100
one of the main people driving the theory

30:52.100 --> 30:53.900
back then and today,

30:53.900 --> 30:58.900
I think they knew that we were in for a long haul

30:58.900 --> 31:01.780
and that's the nature of science.

31:01.780 --> 31:06.180
Quick hits that resolve everything, few and far between.

31:06.180 --> 31:11.180
And so if you were in for the quick solution

31:12.220 --> 31:13.860
to the big questions of the world,

31:13.860 --> 31:15.100
then you would have been disappointed.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.820
And I think there were people who were disappointed

31:16.820 --> 31:19.740
and moved on and work on other subjects.

31:19.740 --> 31:23.340
If you're in, in the way that Einstein was in,

31:23.340 --> 31:26.940
for a lifetime of investigation to try to see

31:26.940 --> 31:30.640
where, what the answers to the deep questions would be,

31:30.640 --> 31:33.860
then I think strength theory has been a rich source

31:33.860 --> 31:38.020
of material that has kept so many people

31:38.020 --> 31:41.300
deeply engaged in moving the frontier forward.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.020
There's a few qualities about strength theory,

31:43.020 --> 31:45.120
which are weird.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.940
I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.

31:48.980 --> 31:50.260
So let me ask the question,

31:50.260 --> 31:53.180
what to you is most beautiful about strength theory?

31:53.180 --> 31:57.940
Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset,

31:57.940 --> 32:01.020
beyond it's putting gravity and quantum mechanics together,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.980
which I think is it's true claim to fame,

32:03.980 --> 32:06.780
at least on paper, it's able to do that.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.300
What attracted me to the theory was the fact

32:08.300 --> 32:11.180
that it requires extra dimensions of space.

32:11.180 --> 32:16.180
And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way,

32:16.940 --> 32:20.620
even before I really understood what it meant.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.060
I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of

32:24.060 --> 32:25.660
the emotional part of consciousness

32:25.660 --> 32:28.180
and the cognitive part in some,

32:28.180 --> 32:29.500
perhaps you call it strange,

32:29.500 --> 32:31.980
in some strange emotional way,

32:31.980 --> 32:35.460
I was enamored with Einstein's general relativity,

32:35.460 --> 32:37.780
the idea of curved space and time.

32:37.780 --> 32:41.220
Before I really knew what it meant, it just spoke to me.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.300
I don't know how else to say it.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.660
And then when I subsequently learned

32:46.660 --> 32:49.660
that people had thought about more dimensions of space

32:49.660 --> 32:52.420
than we can see and how those extra dimensions

32:52.420 --> 32:55.100
would be vital to a deep understanding

32:55.100 --> 32:56.940
of the things that we do see in this world,

32:56.940 --> 32:59.780
four, five, six dimensions might explain

32:59.780 --> 33:01.780
why there are certain forces and particles

33:01.780 --> 33:03.380
and how they behave.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.340
To me, this was like amazing, utterly amazing.

33:06.340 --> 33:09.100
And then when I learned that strength theory

33:09.100 --> 33:10.740
embraced all these ideas,

33:10.740 --> 33:12.540
embraced the general theory of relativity,

33:12.540 --> 33:13.620
embraced quantum mechanics,

33:13.620 --> 33:16.300
embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,

33:17.260 --> 33:19.140
then I was hooked.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.460
And so when I was a graduate student,

33:21.460 --> 33:23.780
we would just spend hours.

33:23.780 --> 33:26.300
We, I mean, a couple of other graduate students and myself

33:26.300 --> 33:29.300
who had sort of worked really well together,

33:29.300 --> 33:30.940
this is at Oxford in England,

33:30.940 --> 33:33.900
we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day

33:33.900 --> 33:36.340
trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions,

33:36.340 --> 33:38.020
the geometry of them,

33:38.020 --> 33:40.780
what those geometrical shapes for the extra dimensions

33:40.780 --> 33:43.740
would imply for things that we see in the world around us.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.660
And it was a heady, heady time.

33:46.660 --> 33:50.500
And that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through

33:50.500 --> 33:51.420
over the decades.

33:51.420 --> 33:56.420
But I'd say that's really the part of the theory

33:57.020 --> 34:00.260
that I think really hooked me most strongly.

34:00.260 --> 34:02.860
How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?

34:02.860 --> 34:05.940
Are we supposed to imagine actual physical reality

34:05.940 --> 34:08.620
or is this more in the space of mathematics

34:08.620 --> 34:11.620
that allows you to sort of come up with tricks

34:11.620 --> 34:14.620
to describe the four dimensional reality

34:14.620 --> 34:17.420
that we more directly perceive?

34:17.420 --> 34:19.700
No one really knows the answer, of course.

34:19.700 --> 34:22.660
But if I take the most straightforward approach

34:22.660 --> 34:23.500
to string theory,

34:23.500 --> 34:28.020
you really are imagining that these dimensions are there.

34:28.020 --> 34:28.860
They're real.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.780
I mean, just as you would say

34:30.780 --> 34:33.380
that the three space dimensions around us,

34:33.380 --> 34:35.700
left, right, back, fourth, up, down,

34:35.700 --> 34:37.940
yeah, they're real, they're here.

34:37.940 --> 34:40.380
We are immersed within those dimensions.

34:40.380 --> 34:44.540
These other dimensions are as real as these

34:44.540 --> 34:47.620
with the one difference being their shape and their size

34:47.620 --> 34:50.540
differs from the shape and size of the dimensions

34:50.540 --> 34:54.700
that we have direct access to through human experience.

34:54.700 --> 34:57.740
And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions

34:57.740 --> 35:02.300
are tightly coiled up, curled up, crushed together,

35:02.300 --> 35:06.540
if you will, into a beautiful geometrical form

35:06.540 --> 35:08.860
that's all around us,

35:08.860 --> 35:11.980
but just too small for us to detect with our eyes,

35:11.980 --> 35:13.340
too small for us to detect

35:13.340 --> 35:16.260
even with the most powerful equipment that we have.

35:16.260 --> 35:18.980
Nevertheless, according to the mathematics,

35:18.980 --> 35:21.580
the size and the shape of those extra dimensions

35:21.580 --> 35:24.940
leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.

35:24.940 --> 35:28.980
So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve

35:28.980 --> 35:31.860
to make contact with experimental physics

35:31.860 --> 35:34.500
is to see a signature of those extra dimensions

35:34.500 --> 35:36.660
in places like the Large Hadron Collider

35:36.660 --> 35:38.260
in Geneva, Switzerland.

35:38.260 --> 35:41.460
And it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't happen,

35:41.460 --> 35:44.740
but that would be a stunning moment

35:44.740 --> 35:46.180
in the history of the species

35:46.180 --> 35:50.180
if data that we acquired in these dimensions

35:50.180 --> 35:53.460
gives us kind of incontrovertible evidence

35:53.460 --> 35:55.900
that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.

35:55.900 --> 35:59.260
I mean, how mind-blowing would that be?

35:59.260 --> 36:01.020
So with the Large Hadron Collider,

36:01.020 --> 36:03.300
it would be something in the movement of the particles

36:03.300 --> 36:07.740
or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place

36:07.740 --> 36:10.220
where you can detect signs of multiple dimensions

36:10.220 --> 36:12.500
like with something like LIGO, but much more accurate.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.620
In principle, all of these can work.

36:14.620 --> 36:18.380
So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for,

36:18.380 --> 36:21.020
but by high hopes, I'm actually exaggerating.

36:21.020 --> 36:24.380
One of the experiments that we imagined

36:24.380 --> 36:27.580
might in the best of all circumstances yield some insight.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.100
We weren't with bated breath waiting for the result.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.620
We knew it was a long shot.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.580
When you slam protons together

36:33.580 --> 36:35.980
at very high speed of the Large Hadron Collider,

36:35.980 --> 36:37.580
if there are these extra dimensions

36:37.580 --> 36:39.660
and if they have the right form,

36:39.660 --> 36:43.180
and that's a hypothesis that may not be correct,

36:43.180 --> 36:44.940
but when the protons collide,

36:44.940 --> 36:48.060
they can create debris, energetic debris

36:48.060 --> 36:50.940
that can in some sense leave our dimensions

36:50.940 --> 36:53.780
and insert itself into the other dimensions.

36:53.780 --> 36:56.340
And the way you'd recognize that is

36:56.340 --> 36:58.620
there'd be more energy before the collision

36:58.620 --> 36:59.860
than after the collision

36:59.860 --> 37:02.460
because the debris would have taken energy

37:02.460 --> 37:06.540
away from the place where our detectors can detect it.

37:06.540 --> 37:09.060
So that's one real concrete way

37:09.060 --> 37:12.020
that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.

37:12.020 --> 37:16.060
But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space

37:16.060 --> 37:19.380
and gravity is something that exists within,

37:19.380 --> 37:22.780
in fact, is associated with the shape of space,

37:22.780 --> 37:25.220
gravitational waves in principle

37:25.220 --> 37:28.060
can provide a kind of, you know,

37:28.060 --> 37:31.180
cat scan of the extra dimensions

37:31.180 --> 37:35.340
if you had sufficient control over those processes.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.660
We don't yet, or perhaps one day we will.

37:38.660 --> 37:41.380
Does it make you sad a little bit

37:41.380 --> 37:43.020
or maybe looking out into the future,

37:43.020 --> 37:44.540
you mentioned Ed Whitten,

37:44.540 --> 37:47.580
that no Nobel prizes have been given yet

37:47.580 --> 37:48.940
related to string theory.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.300
Do you think they will be?

37:50.300 --> 37:53.620
Do you think you have to have experimental validation

37:53.660 --> 37:55.540
or can a Nobel prize be given,

37:55.540 --> 37:58.660
which I don't think has been given for quite a long time

37:58.660 --> 38:01.940
for purely sort of theoretical contribution?

38:01.940 --> 38:06.180
Yeah, it's certainly as a matter of historical precedent

38:06.180 --> 38:09.060
has been the case that those who win the prize

38:09.060 --> 38:14.060
have established, investigated, illuminated

38:14.220 --> 38:18.660
a demonstrably real quality of the world.

38:18.660 --> 38:21.660
So gravitational waves,

38:21.660 --> 38:24.140
the prize was awarded after they were detected,

38:24.140 --> 38:26.620
not the mathematics of it,

38:26.620 --> 38:28.820
but the actual detection of it.

38:28.820 --> 38:30.740
You know, the Higgs particle,

38:30.740 --> 38:33.700
you know, it was an idea that came from the 1960s,

38:33.700 --> 38:36.260
Peter Higgs and others, in fact,

38:36.260 --> 38:41.260
and it wasn't until 2012, on July 4th,

38:41.460 --> 38:43.340
when the announcement came that this particle

38:43.340 --> 38:45.700
had been detected at the Large Hadron Collider

38:45.700 --> 38:49.180
that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel prize.

38:49.180 --> 38:50.700
The idea was there, the math was there,

38:50.700 --> 38:52.780
but you needed to confirm it.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.260
Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.940
So I'm not surprised.

38:56.940 --> 38:59.540
In fact, I would have been surprised

38:59.540 --> 39:02.140
if a Nobel prize had been awarded

39:02.140 --> 39:04.340
in the arena of string theory

39:04.340 --> 39:07.180
because it's far too speculative right now.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.060
It's far too hypothetical.

39:09.060 --> 39:13.220
In fact, I am sympathetic to the view

39:13.220 --> 39:15.900
that it really shouldn't be called string theory.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.580
It degrades the word theory

39:18.660 --> 39:20.900
because theory in science, of course,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.740
means the best available explanation

39:23.740 --> 39:25.940
for the things that we observe in the world,

39:25.940 --> 39:30.780
the things that we measure in experiments about the world.

39:30.780 --> 39:34.300
And string theory does not do that, at least not yet.

39:34.300 --> 39:37.620
So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?

39:37.620 --> 39:40.500
We're at an earlier stage of development

39:40.500 --> 39:42.300
and that's not the kind of thing

39:42.300 --> 39:45.580
that Nobel prizes should be awarded for.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.900
What do you think about the critics out there?

39:47.900 --> 39:50.340
Peter White, he's from Columbia too,

39:50.340 --> 39:52.540
I think, Sabine Havestader.

39:53.460 --> 39:56.380
Is that a healthy thing or should we sort of focus

39:56.380 --> 39:59.580
on sort of the optimism of these hypotheses?

39:59.580 --> 40:03.100
Yeah, it's actually a good way that you frame it

40:03.100 --> 40:08.100
because I'm always somewhat repelled

40:09.100 --> 40:14.100
by views of the world that start from the negative,

40:14.980 --> 40:17.900
try to cut down an idea,

40:17.900 --> 40:19.820
try to say that's the wrong way

40:19.820 --> 40:22.380
of thinking about things and so on.

40:22.380 --> 40:25.700
I'm much more drawn, maybe because I'm an optimist,

40:25.700 --> 40:27.740
I don't know, I'm much more drawn

40:27.740 --> 40:31.660
to those who go out into the world with new ideas.

40:31.660 --> 40:34.900
And don't try to cut down one idea,

40:34.900 --> 40:38.860
but rather present another one that might be better.

40:38.860 --> 40:42.780
And so you make the first idea maybe string theory irrelevant

40:42.780 --> 40:46.300
because you've come up with the better approach

40:46.300 --> 40:47.540
to the world.

40:47.540 --> 40:48.980
So do I think it's healthy?

40:48.980 --> 40:52.980
Look, I think having a wide range of views

40:52.980 --> 40:56.580
and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.

40:56.580 --> 41:00.420
I think it's good to have arguments within a subject

41:00.420 --> 41:02.700
in order that you stay fresh

41:02.700 --> 41:06.380
and you stay focused on the things that matter.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.740
But in the end of the day,

41:07.740 --> 41:11.940
I think it's a more vital contribution

41:11.940 --> 41:13.260
to give us something new

41:13.260 --> 41:15.540
rather than to criticize something that's there.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.020
Yeah, I'm totally with you.

41:17.020 --> 41:19.820
But it could be just the nature of being an optimist

41:19.820 --> 41:24.220
and also just a love of engineering.

41:24.220 --> 41:29.220
It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket

41:29.300 --> 41:30.580
that somebody else built,

41:30.580 --> 41:34.420
just build a bigger, cheaper, better rocket.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.980
And that seems to be how human civilization

41:38.980 --> 41:40.420
can progress effectively.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.940
We've mentioned the second law of thermodynamics.

41:44.940 --> 41:46.420
I gotta ask you about time.

41:49.180 --> 41:51.380
Do you think of time as emergent

41:51.380 --> 41:53.740
or fundamental to our universe?

41:53.740 --> 41:56.140
I like to think of it as emergent.

41:56.140 --> 42:00.980
I don't have a solid reason for that perspective.

42:00.980 --> 42:02.740
I have a lot of hints of reasons

42:02.740 --> 42:04.420
that some of which come out of string theory

42:04.420 --> 42:09.180
and quantum gravity that perhaps would be worth talking about.

42:09.220 --> 42:12.020
But what I would say is,

42:12.020 --> 42:17.020
time is the most familiar quality of experience

42:17.060 --> 42:18.980
because there's nothing that takes place

42:18.980 --> 42:22.180
that doesn't take place within an interval of time.

42:22.180 --> 42:24.540
And yet at the same time,

42:24.540 --> 42:28.420
it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.060
So it's a wonderful confluence

42:31.060 --> 42:33.540
of the familiar and the deeply mysterious

42:33.540 --> 42:35.980
all in one little package.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.780
If you were to ask me, what is time?

42:38.580 --> 42:39.780
I don't really know.

42:39.780 --> 42:41.020
I don't think anybody does.

42:41.020 --> 42:45.260
I can say what time gives us.

42:45.260 --> 42:48.740
It allows us the language for talking about change.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.620
It allows us to envision the events of the universe

42:52.620 --> 42:55.900
being spread out in this temporal timeline.

42:55.900 --> 42:59.100
And in that way allows us to see the patterns

42:59.100 --> 43:01.660
that unfold within time.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.100
I mean, time allows us the structure

43:04.100 --> 43:06.580
and the organization to think about things

43:06.580 --> 43:11.380
in that kind of a progression, but what actually is it?

43:11.380 --> 43:12.700
I don't really know.

43:12.700 --> 43:16.380
And that's so strange because we can measure it, right?

43:16.380 --> 43:19.020
I mean, there are laboratories in the world

43:19.020 --> 43:21.060
that measure this thing called time

43:21.060 --> 43:23.980
to spectacular precision.

43:23.980 --> 43:27.700
But if you go up to the folks and say,

43:27.700 --> 43:31.900
like, what is it that you're actually measuring?

43:31.900 --> 43:34.540
I don't know that they can really articulate

43:34.540 --> 43:37.180
the kind of answer that you would expect

43:37.180 --> 43:39.340
from those who are engineering a device

43:39.340 --> 43:41.460
that can measure something called time

43:41.460 --> 43:43.100
to that level of precision.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.900
So it's a very curious combination.

43:46.860 --> 43:51.260
What do you make of the one-way feeling of causality?

43:51.260 --> 43:55.180
Like, is causality a thing or is that too

43:55.180 --> 43:58.620
just a human story that we put on top

43:58.620 --> 44:00.780
of this emergent phenomena of time?

44:00.780 --> 44:02.220
I don't know.

44:02.220 --> 44:05.980
I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.

44:05.980 --> 44:09.220
I do think that at the macroscopic level,

44:09.220 --> 44:11.300
if we're talking about sort of the human experience of time,

44:11.300 --> 44:13.380
I do think at the macroscopic level,

44:13.380 --> 44:17.260
there is a fundamental notion of causality

44:17.260 --> 44:20.100
that does emerge from a starting point

44:20.100 --> 44:21.780
that may not have causality built in.

44:21.780 --> 44:23.140
So I certainly would allow that

44:23.140 --> 44:26.340
at the deepest description of reality,

44:26.340 --> 44:28.940
when we finally have that on the table,

44:28.940 --> 44:31.740
we may not see causality directly

44:31.740 --> 44:33.580
at that fundamental level.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.300
But I do believe that we will understand

44:36.300 --> 44:38.380
how to go from that fundamental level

44:38.380 --> 44:41.460
to a world where at the macroscopic level,

44:41.460 --> 44:44.500
there is this notion of A causes B,

44:44.500 --> 44:47.700
a notion that Einstein deeply embraced

44:47.700 --> 44:49.180
in his special theory of relativity,

44:49.180 --> 44:51.860
where he showed that time has qualities

44:51.860 --> 44:54.300
that we wouldn't expect based on experience.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.780
You and I, if we move relative to each other,

44:56.780 --> 44:59.820
our clocks tick off time at different rate.

44:59.820 --> 45:02.020
And our clocks is just a means

45:02.020 --> 45:03.580
of measuring this thing called time.

45:03.580 --> 45:05.900
So this is really time that we're talking about.

45:05.900 --> 45:08.140
Time for you and time for me are different

45:08.140 --> 45:09.340
if we're in relative motion.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.540
He then shows in the general theory of relativity

45:11.540 --> 45:15.100
that if we're experiencing different gravity,

45:15.100 --> 45:17.340
different gravitational fields are actually more precisely

45:17.340 --> 45:19.220
different gravitational potentials,

45:19.220 --> 45:21.740
time will elapse for us at different rates.

45:21.740 --> 45:26.020
These are things that are astoundingly strange

45:26.020 --> 45:29.740
that give rise to a scientific notion of time travel.

45:29.740 --> 45:33.460
Okay, so this is how far Einstein took us

45:33.460 --> 45:37.220
in wiping away the old understanding of time

45:37.220 --> 45:40.420
and injecting a new understanding of its quality.

45:40.420 --> 45:44.460
So there's so much about time that's counterintuitive,

45:44.460 --> 45:46.820
but I do not think that we're ever going

45:46.820 --> 45:50.380
to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.380
At the macroscopic, I mean, there's so many interesting

45:52.380 --> 45:53.940
things at the macroscopic level

45:53.940 --> 45:56.700
that may only exist at the macroscopic level.

45:56.700 --> 45:59.220
Like we already talked about consciousness

45:59.220 --> 46:01.100
that very well could be one of the things.

46:01.100 --> 46:06.100
You mentioned time travel, so I mean, according to Einstein

46:07.060 --> 46:11.700
and in general, what types of travel do you think

46:11.700 --> 46:14.060
our physical universe allows?

46:14.060 --> 46:17.100
Well, it certainly allows time travel to the future.

46:17.100 --> 46:18.700
And I'm not talking about the silly thing

46:18.700 --> 46:21.460
that you and I are now going into the future

46:21.460 --> 46:22.500
second by second by second.

46:22.540 --> 46:25.660
I'm talking about really the version that you see

46:25.660 --> 46:29.140
in Hollywood, at least in terms of its net effect,

46:29.140 --> 46:34.140
whereby an individual can follow an Einsteinian strategy

46:36.460 --> 46:40.660
and propel themselves into the future

46:40.660 --> 46:42.260
in some sense more quickly.

46:42.260 --> 46:46.020
So if I wanted to see what's happening on planet earth

46:46.020 --> 46:48.300
one million years from now,

46:48.300 --> 46:52.460
Einstein tells me how to get one million years from now,

46:53.380 --> 46:55.380
build a ship, I gotta turn to guys who know

46:55.380 --> 46:58.020
how to build stuff, I can't do it like you,

46:58.020 --> 47:00.020
build a ship that can go out into the universe

47:00.020 --> 47:02.780
near the speed of light, turn around and come back.

47:02.780 --> 47:04.460
Let's say it's a six month journey out,

47:04.460 --> 47:07.540
a six month journey back, and Einstein tells me

47:07.540 --> 47:09.460
how fast I need to travel,

47:09.460 --> 47:11.220
how close to the speed of light I need to go

47:11.220 --> 47:13.780
so that when I step out of my ship,

47:13.780 --> 47:17.020
it will now be one million years into the future

47:17.020 --> 47:20.180
on planet earth.

47:20.180 --> 47:23.340
And this is not a controversial statement, right?

47:23.340 --> 47:25.980
This is not something where there's differences

47:25.980 --> 47:28.380
of opinion in the scientific community.

47:28.380 --> 47:30.940
Any scientist who knows anything

47:30.940 --> 47:35.100
about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just said,

47:35.100 --> 47:37.940
it's commonplace, it's bread and butter physics.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.700
And so that kind of travel to the future

47:40.700 --> 47:44.180
is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.

47:44.180 --> 47:45.860
There are engineering challenges,

47:45.860 --> 47:47.980
there are technological challenges.

47:47.980 --> 47:49.500
Close to the speed of light part, yeah.

47:49.500 --> 47:52.820
Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?

47:52.820 --> 47:55.220
There are G-forces that you're gonna experience.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.780
So there's all sorts of stuff embedded in this,

47:57.780 --> 48:01.060
but those I will call the details.

48:01.060 --> 48:04.420
And those details, notwithstanding,

48:04.420 --> 48:07.860
the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.

48:07.860 --> 48:09.700
And if I could pause real quick,

48:09.700 --> 48:12.660
you can also, at the macro level,

48:12.660 --> 48:15.420
with biology extend the human lifespan

48:15.420 --> 48:19.340
to do a kind of travel forward in time.

48:19.340 --> 48:22.620
If you expand how long we live,

48:22.620 --> 48:25.380
that's a way to, from a perspective of an observer,

48:25.380 --> 48:27.860
a conscious observer that is a human being,

48:27.860 --> 48:29.980
you're essentially traveling forward in time

48:29.980 --> 48:32.780
by allowing yourself to live long enough to see the thing.

48:32.780 --> 48:34.980
So that's in the space of biology.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.220
What about traveling back in time?

48:37.220 --> 48:42.020
Yeah, that is a natural next question,

48:42.020 --> 48:44.300
especially if you're doing,

48:44.300 --> 48:45.580
if you're going on one of these journeys,

48:45.580 --> 48:48.900
is it a one-way journey, or can you come back?

48:48.900 --> 48:52.500
And the physics community doesn't speak

48:52.500 --> 48:55.260
with a unified voice on this as yet,

48:55.260 --> 48:57.900
but I would say that the dominant perspective

48:57.900 --> 49:00.300
is that you cannot get back.

49:00.300 --> 49:03.940
Now, having said that, there are proposals

49:03.940 --> 49:07.340
that serious people have written papers on

49:07.340 --> 49:09.100
regarding hypothetical ways

49:09.100 --> 49:10.940
in which you could travel to the past.

49:10.940 --> 49:13.540
And we've seen some of these,

49:13.540 --> 49:16.940
again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas

49:16.940 --> 49:20.060
of physics and build narratives around them.

49:20.060 --> 49:22.020
This idea of a wormhole,

49:22.020 --> 49:25.540
like Jodie Foster in Contact went through a wormhole,

49:25.540 --> 49:27.900
Deep Space Nine Star, I'm sure there are many other examples

49:27.900 --> 49:30.500
with these ideas that I've probably never even seen.

49:30.500 --> 49:34.500
But with wormholes, there's at least a proposal

49:34.500 --> 49:36.660
of how you could take a wormhole,

49:36.660 --> 49:38.260
tunnel through space-time,

49:38.260 --> 49:40.540
manipulate the openings of the wormhole

49:40.540 --> 49:44.140
in such a way that the openings are no longer synchronous.

49:44.140 --> 49:46.340
They are out of sync relative to each other,

49:46.340 --> 49:49.020
which would mean one's ahead and one's behind,

49:49.020 --> 49:50.500
which means if you go through one direction,

49:50.500 --> 49:51.660
you travel to the future.

49:51.660 --> 49:54.380
If you go back, you travel to the past.

49:54.380 --> 49:57.820
Now, we don't know if there are wormholes in the world.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.860
But they're possible according to Einstein, correct?

49:59.860 --> 50:01.740
They are possible according to Einstein,

50:01.740 --> 50:04.420
but even Einstein was very quick to say,

50:04.420 --> 50:07.260
just because my math allows for something

50:07.260 --> 50:08.100
doesn't mean it's real.

50:08.140 --> 50:10.820
He famously didn't even believe in black holes,

50:10.820 --> 50:12.860
didn't believe in the Big Bang, right?

50:12.860 --> 50:15.660
And yet the big, the black hole issue

50:15.660 --> 50:17.140
has really been settled now.

50:17.140 --> 50:20.700
We have radio telescopic photographs

50:20.700 --> 50:22.780
of the black hole in M87,

50:22.780 --> 50:25.180
it was in newspapers around the world

50:25.180 --> 50:26.300
just a couple of years ago.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.140
So it's just to say that just because

50:29.140 --> 50:32.140
it's in Einstein's math, it doesn't mean it's real.

50:32.140 --> 50:34.940
But yes, it is the case that wormholes

50:34.940 --> 50:36.660
are allowed by Einstein's equations.

50:36.660 --> 50:39.460
And in principle, you can imagine,

50:39.460 --> 50:42.300
putting electric charges on the openings of the wormhole

50:42.300 --> 50:44.380
allowing you to tow them around

50:44.380 --> 50:47.580
in a manner that could yield this temporal asymmetry

50:47.580 --> 50:48.420
between them.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.020
Maybe you tow one of the mouths

50:50.020 --> 50:51.780
to the edge of a black hole.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.380
In principle, you can do this,

50:53.380 --> 50:56.540
slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.

50:56.540 --> 50:58.140
And then when you bring it back,

50:58.140 --> 51:02.060
it will be well out of sync with the other opening

51:02.060 --> 51:05.420
and therefore could be a significant temporal gap

51:05.420 --> 51:07.060
between one and the other.

51:07.060 --> 51:10.780
But people who study this in more detail question,

51:10.780 --> 51:13.020
could you ever keep a wormhole open,

51:13.020 --> 51:14.700
assuming it does exist?

51:14.700 --> 51:17.380
Could you ever travel through a wormhole

51:17.380 --> 51:19.660
or would there be a requirement

51:19.660 --> 51:22.900
of some kind of exotic matter to prop it open

51:22.900 --> 51:24.380
that perhaps doesn't exist?

51:24.380 --> 51:28.020
So there are many, many issues that people have raised.

51:28.020 --> 51:31.020
And I would say that the general sentiment

51:31.020 --> 51:34.740
is that it's unlikely that this kind of scenario

51:34.740 --> 51:37.980
is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics

51:37.980 --> 51:39.220
when we finally have it.

51:39.220 --> 51:41.300
But that doesn't mean that the door is closed.

51:41.300 --> 51:44.820
So maybe there's a small possibility

51:44.820 --> 51:45.900
that this could one day be-

51:45.900 --> 51:48.500
That's such an interesting way to put it.

51:48.500 --> 51:51.140
This kind of scenario will not survive

51:51.140 --> 51:53.500
deep understanding of physics.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.860
It's an interesting way to put it

51:54.860 --> 51:59.700
because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios

51:59.700 --> 52:04.060
will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.

52:04.100 --> 52:08.340
Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second,

52:08.340 --> 52:11.220
but if you have like the panpsychism idea

52:11.220 --> 52:14.220
that consciousness permeates all matter,

52:14.220 --> 52:17.980
maybe traveling in that, whatever laws of physics,

52:17.980 --> 52:20.180
the consciousness operates under something like that.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.780
In that view of the universe,

52:21.780 --> 52:24.180
if we somehow are able to understand that part,

52:24.180 --> 52:26.460
maybe traveling is super easy.

52:26.460 --> 52:27.300
Yeah.

52:28.300 --> 52:31.860
It does not follow the constraints of the speed of light,

52:31.860 --> 52:32.700
something like this.

52:32.700 --> 52:37.700
Yeah, so look, I have a definite degree of sympathy

52:38.420 --> 52:42.660
with the possibility that consciousness might be

52:42.660 --> 52:45.540
more than what we described earlier

52:45.540 --> 52:48.220
is just the byproduct of mindless particles.

52:48.220 --> 52:50.580
You just made the rock happy.

52:50.580 --> 52:54.380
Exactly, so it isn't the approach

52:54.380 --> 52:59.380
that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.700
If you've got the puzzle,

53:01.700 --> 53:04.300
how do mindless particles build mind?

53:04.300 --> 53:08.340
One resolution might be the particles are not mindless.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.980
The particles have some kind of proto-conscious quality.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.020
So there's something appealing

53:13.020 --> 53:16.220
about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.

53:16.220 --> 53:20.140
And if that's the case, if we do live in a panpsychist world

53:20.140 --> 53:22.420
where there is a degree of consciousness

53:22.420 --> 53:24.700
residing in everything in the world around us,

53:24.700 --> 53:27.940
then yes, I do think some interesting possibilities

53:27.940 --> 53:31.740
might emerge where maybe there's a way of communing

53:31.740 --> 53:36.740
with physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.

53:36.940 --> 53:40.580
I mean, we as human beings, a vital part of our existence

53:40.580 --> 53:43.900
is human to human communication, contact.

53:43.900 --> 53:46.540
We live in social groups and that's what it's allowed us

53:46.540 --> 53:48.820
to get to the place where we've gotten.

53:48.820 --> 53:51.700
Imagine that we have long missed

53:51.700 --> 53:54.700
that there's other consciousness out there

53:54.700 --> 53:57.540
and some kind of relationship or communion

53:58.140 --> 53:59.980
with that larger conscious possibility

53:59.980 --> 54:01.380
would take us to a different place.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.860
Now, do I buy into this yet?

54:03.860 --> 54:06.420
I don't, I don't see any evidence for it,

54:06.420 --> 54:10.460
but do I have an open mind and allow for the possibility

54:10.460 --> 54:11.420
in the future?

54:11.420 --> 54:12.340
Yeah, I do.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.380
So if that's not the case

54:15.380 --> 54:18.420
and you have these simple particles

54:18.420 --> 54:21.900
that at the macro level emerges some interesting stuff

54:21.900 --> 54:22.860
like consciousness.

54:22.860 --> 54:27.300
Another thing you write about until the end of time book

54:28.060 --> 54:30.860
is the thing that it seems to emerge at the macro level

54:30.860 --> 54:34.940
is the feeling like there's a free will,

54:34.940 --> 54:36.380
like we decide to do stuff.

54:36.380 --> 54:39.100
And you have a really interesting take here,

54:39.100 --> 54:43.500
which is no, there's not a free will.

54:43.500 --> 54:45.900
I'm just gonna speak for you and then you can correct me.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.060
No, there's not a free will,

54:48.060 --> 54:51.420
but there is an experience of freedom.

54:51.420 --> 54:52.820
Yeah.

54:52.820 --> 54:54.260
Yeah.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.100
Which I really love.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.420
So where does the experience,

54:58.420 --> 54:59.780
where does freedom come from

54:59.780 --> 55:02.700
if we don't have any kind of physics-based free will?

55:02.700 --> 55:03.540
Yeah.

55:03.540 --> 55:06.820
And so the idea follows naturally

55:06.820 --> 55:08.460
from all that we've been talking about.

55:08.460 --> 55:10.500
Let's make the assumption

55:10.500 --> 55:13.220
that all there is in the physical universe

55:13.220 --> 55:15.380
is stuff governed by laws.

55:15.380 --> 55:16.500
We may not have those laws,

55:16.500 --> 55:19.500
we may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet,

55:19.500 --> 55:23.700
but everything we know in science points in the direction

55:23.740 --> 55:27.900
that it's physical stuff governed by universal laws.

55:27.900 --> 55:31.420
And that being the case or that being the assumption,

55:31.420 --> 55:33.900
then you come to a particular collection

55:33.900 --> 55:36.060
of those ingredients called the human being.

55:36.060 --> 55:38.140
And that human being has particles

55:38.140 --> 55:41.620
that are fully governed by physical law.

55:41.620 --> 55:43.100
And when you then recognize it,

55:43.100 --> 55:44.380
every thought that we have,

55:44.380 --> 55:46.500
every action that we undertake

55:46.500 --> 55:49.380
is just the motion of particles.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.900
When I'm thinking thoughts right now,

55:50.900 --> 55:53.820
of course, at this level of description,

55:53.820 --> 55:56.300
it is the motion of particles cascading

55:56.300 --> 55:59.820
down various neurons inside of my head and so on.

55:59.820 --> 56:02.780
And every single one of those motions,

56:02.780 --> 56:05.340
collectively and individually,

56:05.340 --> 56:08.540
is fully governed by these laws

56:08.540 --> 56:09.900
that we perhaps don't have yet,

56:09.900 --> 56:12.060
but we imagine one day we will.

56:12.060 --> 56:15.780
That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom

56:15.780 --> 56:19.580
to break free from the constraint of physical law.

56:19.580 --> 56:21.660
And that is the end of the story.

56:21.660 --> 56:24.500
So the traditional intuitive notion of free will,

56:24.500 --> 56:26.900
that we're the ultimate authors of our actions,

56:26.900 --> 56:28.300
that we were the buck stops,

56:28.300 --> 56:30.260
that there is no antecedent,

56:30.260 --> 56:35.020
that is the cause for our deciding to go left or right,

56:35.020 --> 56:38.220
choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die,

56:38.220 --> 56:42.060
that intuitive sensation does not have a basis

56:42.060 --> 56:43.780
in our understanding of the physical world.

56:43.780 --> 56:47.180
So that's the end of the free will of the traditional sort.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.100
But then your question is,

56:49.100 --> 56:51.940
what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?

56:51.940 --> 56:53.900
And the other kind of freedom,

56:53.900 --> 56:55.860
if you focus on it intently,

56:55.860 --> 57:00.700
I think is actually the true version of freedom

57:00.700 --> 57:02.180
that we feel.

57:02.180 --> 57:04.300
And that freedom is this,

57:04.300 --> 57:07.020
you look at inanimate objects in the world,

57:07.020 --> 57:10.140
rocks, bottles of water, whatever,

57:10.140 --> 57:13.340
they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.

57:13.340 --> 57:14.180
Why?

57:14.180 --> 57:17.100
Their internal organization is too coarse

57:17.100 --> 57:18.900
for them to do very much, right?

57:19.540 --> 57:22.020
You try to have a conversation with a glass of water,

57:22.020 --> 57:24.820
you send sound waves, it doesn't do much.

57:24.820 --> 57:26.140
It may vibrate a little bit,

57:26.140 --> 57:30.220
but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.

57:30.220 --> 57:33.060
The difference between us and a rock or a bottle of water

57:33.060 --> 57:35.100
is that our inner organization,

57:35.100 --> 57:38.420
by virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection,

57:38.420 --> 57:42.740
is so refined, so spectacularly ordered,

57:42.740 --> 57:46.460
that we have a huge repertoire of behaviors

57:46.460 --> 57:49.660
that are finally attuned to stimuli

57:49.660 --> 57:51.460
from the external world.

57:51.460 --> 57:53.340
You asked me a question, that's a stimulus,

57:53.340 --> 57:56.860
and all of a sudden these particle processes go into action

57:56.860 --> 58:00.060
and this is the result, this answer that I'm giving you.

58:00.060 --> 58:02.140
So the freedom that we have

58:02.140 --> 58:05.580
is not from the control of physical law.

58:05.580 --> 58:08.260
The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior

58:08.260 --> 58:11.380
that has long since governed inanimate objects.

58:11.380 --> 58:14.700
We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire

58:14.700 --> 58:17.220
of rocks and bottles of water

58:17.220 --> 58:20.060
to have this broad spectrum of responses.

58:20.060 --> 58:20.900
Do we pick them?

58:20.900 --> 58:21.820
We do not.

58:21.820 --> 58:23.060
Do we freely choose them?

58:23.060 --> 58:26.060
We do not, but yet we have them

58:26.060 --> 58:29.340
and we can marvel at those behaviors

58:29.340 --> 58:31.500
and that's the freedom that we have.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.300
The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire

58:34.300 --> 58:36.740
is where the freedom emerges.

58:36.740 --> 58:40.260
Is there something to be said about emergence?

58:40.260 --> 58:42.900
I don't know if you know or have looked at much

58:42.900 --> 58:46.580
about objects that I seem to love way more

58:46.580 --> 58:48.660
than anyone else, which is cellular tom.

58:48.660 --> 58:49.500
Yeah.

58:49.500 --> 58:51.700
Like game of life type of stuff.

58:51.700 --> 58:56.700
From simple things emerges beautiful complexities

58:56.700 --> 58:58.980
and so that's that repertoire.

58:58.980 --> 59:03.980
It's like, it seems if you have enough stuff,

59:04.060 --> 59:06.300
just beautiful complexity emerges

59:06.300 --> 59:09.620
that sure as heck to our human eyes looks

59:09.620 --> 59:12.060
like there's consciousness there, there's free will,

59:12.100 --> 59:15.660
there's little objects moving about and making decisions.

59:15.660 --> 59:18.940
I mean, all of that, you can say it's anthropomorphization

59:18.940 --> 59:21.860
but it sure as heck feels

59:21.860 --> 59:24.620
like there are organisms making decisions.

59:25.620 --> 59:27.700
What is that emergence thing?

59:27.700 --> 59:31.260
Is that within the realm of physics to understand?

59:31.260 --> 59:35.060
Is it within the realm of poetry?

59:36.140 --> 59:36.980
What is that?

59:36.980 --> 59:38.700
Like complex systems, emergence.

59:38.700 --> 59:39.660
What is that?

59:39.660 --> 59:41.620
Will that ever be understood by science?

59:42.140 --> 59:44.020
So here's the way that I think about it.

59:44.020 --> 59:47.860
So there are clearly qualities of the world

59:47.860 --> 59:51.020
that emerge on macroscopic scales.

59:51.020 --> 59:53.780
Our sense of beauty, wonder, consciousness,

59:53.780 --> 59:55.940
all of these kinds of qualities.

59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.220
Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.220
from the laws of physics?

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.580
I do.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:06.340
There is nothing that's not ultimately explainable

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.500
with the laws of physics from this physicalist perspective

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.940
which is what I take.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.020
So you got the particles, you got the laws

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.220
and you have things that emerge

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.820
from the choreographed motions of those particles.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.100
But is that the best language

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.140
for talking about these emergent qualities?

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.580
Usually not.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.980
If I was to take something even more mundane

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.220
like a baseball flying through the air,

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.740
if I was to describe it in terms of the corks

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.060
and the electrons, I'd give you this mountain of data

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.380
with 10 to the 28 particles

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.220
and all of their coordinates in space

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.060
as a function of time.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:46.900
I hand you this mountain of data,

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.220
you'd be like, I don't know what this is.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.220
And then if you really were cleverly looking,

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.060
oh, it's a baseball just described

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.100
in the least economical way possible.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.260
It is much more useful and insightful

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.980
to talk about the baseball flying through the air.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.700
Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.300
like human experience and human emotion

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.700
and human action and the sensation of free will

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.820
that we undeniably all have,

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.460
even if it itself doesn't have a basis

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.500
in our understanding of the physical world.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.740
It's useful to talk about things

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.420
in this very human language.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.700
And so yes, it's vital to talk about things

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.380
in the poetic language of human experience,

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.860
but do not lose sight of the fact, and some people do,

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.900
they say, oh, it's just an emergent phenomenon.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.140
Don't lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:39.820
are emerging from this deeper understanding

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.820
that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.820
And there's a lot of insight to come from that,

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:48.580
such as the freedom that you thought that you had,

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.340
the freedom of will that you thought you had,

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.180
it doesn't have a basis in that reductionist account,

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.260
so it's not real.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.060
So speaking of the poetry of human experience,

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.140
you mentioned the images of the black holes.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.140
How does it make you feel a few years ago

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.820
when that first image came out?

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.300
It's truly amazing.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:11.300
A sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.660
and there was a little sense of,

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.380
jealousy is not quite the right word,

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.580
but a sense of longing.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.940
Yeah, I think that's a better word,

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.500
because here's a subject that started with Einstein

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.540
back in 1915, writes down the equations

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.660
of the general theory of relativity.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.700
And then there are scores of individuals over the decades,

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.540
starting with people like Karl Schwarzschild,

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.900
who analyze the equation,

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.380
see the possibility of black holes,

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.660
people develop these ideas,

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.180
John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.500
It's still a hypothetical subject.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.940
It gets closer to reality through observations

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.500
of the center of our galaxy,

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.380
stars whipping around in a manner

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.620
that could only really be explained

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.940
by there being a black hole in the center of our galaxy,

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.780
but it was still indirect.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:03.580
To actually have a direct image that you can look at,

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.180
what a beautiful arc, narrative arc,

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.180
from the theoretical to the absolutely established.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.620
And that's what we hope will happen with other areas.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.140
For instance, string theory, right?

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.620
I mean, wholly mathematical subject at the outset

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.580
and still pretty much a wholly mathematical subject today.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.900
Yeah, do we long for that image

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:29.020
where we can look at it and say, string?

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.220
It's real, you know, I mean, how thrilling,

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.340
how thrilling to be part of that journey,

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.100
to be part of that step that moves things

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.980
from the abstract to the concrete.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.820
Yeah, so like the image of the DNA,

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.860
the early images of the DNA, for example.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.500
But there is something special.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.940
So the problem with strings is they're tiny.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:54.900
So it's harder to take a picture in the following sense.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.900
When you think of a black hole,

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.900
I mean, you have a swirl of, I guess,

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.420
I don't even know, it's dust or whatever, light.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.580
Accreting onto the event horizon.

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.700
And then there's darkness in the center.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.140
And you just imagine, so that picture in particular,

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.020
I guess, is of a gigantic black hole.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.180
So you just, I mean, it's terrifying.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.580
Billions of times the mass of the sun.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.900
Yeah, so it's both exciting and terrifying.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.060
I mean, I don't know where you fall in the spectrum.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.900
I think it's exciting at first.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.300
Like the longer I think about it,

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.460
every time I think about it,

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.260
the more terrifying it becomes.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.260
So it always starts exciting,

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.740
and then it goes to terrifying.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.100
And both are feelings, very human feelings

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.460
that I appreciate.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:42.740
It's like terrified awe somehow is still beautiful.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.940
That's a good way of saying it.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.900
I think I kind of share that reaction

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.180
because there is a way in which

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.300
when you work on this subject, like all the time,

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.500
I teach it, I teach about black holes,

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500
write the equations on the blackboard.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:01.500
The ideas reside in a very cognitive,

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.460
I don't know, mathematical portion of the brain,

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.300
or at least for me.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.900
And it's only when you like sit down and it's quiet,

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.700
and you start to contemplate, wait, wait, wait, wait,

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.100
this isn't just like a mathematical game.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.420
There are these monsters out there.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.740
Now, not in a sense of I fear for my life,

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.740
but it's a sense of how extraordinary is this universe.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.460
And so it is breathtaking.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.940
How powerful nature is.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.940
Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:42.100
And so there is a deep sense of humility

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.940
that I think this instills

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.660
if you really allow the ideas to sink in.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.740
Well, I have to ask about

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.740
the most stupendously powerful thing

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.380
to have ever happened in our universe,

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.540
which is the Big Bang.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.940
What's up with the Big Bang?

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.380
So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves,

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:05.060
the hope is when you have more and more accurate measurements

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.060
of the gravitational waves,

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.420
you can crawl back further and further back in time

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.620
towards the Big Bang.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.420
Do you have a hope that we'll be able to understand

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.100
the early spark that created our universe?

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.940
Yeah.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.300
That and the deep interior of a black hole

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.420
are I think the biggest mysteries

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.540
that we hope the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.420
will reveal, will illuminate.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.980
And what question could be more captivating

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.940
than why is there something rather than nothing, right?

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:43.260
Why is there a universe at all?

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.340
And will the theories that we're developing

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.500
take us to an answer to that?

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.820
I don't know.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.740
Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is,

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.540
and that's a big question of its own, right?

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.180
One would still be left with the question,

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.140
well, okay, so you've explained the process

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.620
by which a tiny nugget of a universe,

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.140
a tiny nugget of space-time

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.260
can undergo some kind of growth

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.140
to yield the world around us.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.020
But presumably in that explanation,

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.420
you're gonna involve mathematics

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.100
and some ingredients like quantum fields

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.900
or matter or energy or something.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.700
Where did that stuff come from?

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.940
Can we get to that level of explanation?

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.220
I don't know, but it is remarkable that if you ask

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:36.060
what happened a millionth of a second after the Big Bang,

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:40.260
it's not really that controversial any longer, right?

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.780
Even though there's a lot of argument in the field,

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.420
and it's very heated right now, I should say,

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.940
regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.460
What is the right theory of early universe cosmology,

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.060
where I mean early, much earlier

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:56.100
than a millionth of a second?

01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:01.100
A lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.700
No pun intended.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.300
Yeah, right, exactly.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:08.220
But you go like a millionth of a second after that,

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.140
and we're on pretty firm ground.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.220
Isn't that amazing, right?

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.460
To understand what happened from that point forward,

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.260
but to go back is controversial.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.620
So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.580
which I would say has been the dominant paradigm

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.180
since early 1980s.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.020
So what does that mean?

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:28.980
Roughly 40 years now,

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.460
it's been the dominant cosmological paradigm.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.780
And it makes use of a curious feature

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.060
of Einstein's general theory of relativity,

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.300
his theory of gravity,

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.820
where Einstein shows us mathematically

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.860
that gravity can not only be attractive,

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.180
but it can also be repulsive.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:49.180
And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Guth

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.260
and Andre Linde, and at the time, Paul Steinhardt

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.860
and Andreas Hallbrecht and others to say,

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.380
okay, if we had a little nugget in the early universe,

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.620
which was filled with the stuff

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.620
that yields this repulsive gravity,

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.420
well, that would have blown everything apart.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.300
It would cause everything to swell.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.620
Beautiful explanation for what the bang in the Big Bang

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.660
was, and then people mathematically analyze

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.660
the consequences of this idea,

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.220
and they make predictions for tiny temperature differences

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.660
across the night sky that in principle could be measured.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.980
You send up balloons, you send up satellites

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.700
with very refined thermometers,

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.780
and they measured the temperature of the night sky,

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.580
and the statistical distribution

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.740
of the temperature differences

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.980
agrees with the mathematical predictions.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.820
Yeah.

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.980
I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.460
of this insight, so you think,

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.020
aha, the theory has been established,

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:49.020
but scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch,

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.340
and some scientists, including one of the people

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.060
who helped develop the theory at the outset,

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.580
Paul Steinhardt, comes along and says,

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.740
well, yeah, this theory's done pretty well so far,

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.900
but there are aspects of this theory

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.460
that are not so well known,

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.500
so far, but there are aspects of this theory

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.220
that are making me lose confidence.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.900
For instance, this theory seems to suggest

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.420
that there might be other universes.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.340
Like, how do you make sense of a theory

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.900
that suggests there are other universes?

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.940
Or there are others who come along and say,

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.300
this theory seems to talk about length scales

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.700
that are minuscule even by the so-called Planck length,

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.380
the sort of shortest length that we can imagine

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.860
making sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.460
How do you make sense of that?

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.740
And so on and so forth, they develop a list of things

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.580
that they consider to be chinks

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.660
in the inflationary cosmological theory's armor,

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.100
and they develop other ideas which they claim

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.700
yield the same predictions as inflationary cosmology

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.460
for those temperature differences across space,

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.860
but don't suffer from these problems,

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.180
and then the inflationary cosmology folks say,

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:58.380
no, no, no, hang on, your theory suffers

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.100
from different problems, and so the argument goes,

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.140
it's a healthy debate, talk about real debates in science.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.860
So when you ask what's up with the Big Bang,

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.980
I don't know right now.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.780
If you would have asked me five years ago,

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.220
maybe even less than that, three or four years ago,

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.300
I would have said, look,

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.100
inflationary cosmology has some issues,

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.580
but the package of explanations it provides is so potent,

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:28.580
and the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.940
that I would imagine it's going to, in the end, win out.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.220
I would still say that today,

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.220
but I wouldn't say it as loudly.

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.820
I wouldn't say it as confidently.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.180
I think it's worth thinking about alternate ideas,

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.340
and it could be the case that the paradigm

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.740
at some point shifts.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.500
Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.540
of the explanations for those?

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.380
Yeah, certainly.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:58.380
So dark energy has, in the inflationary theory,

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.260
is kind of a big mystery.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.260
So dark energy is the observational realization

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.500
in the last 20 years that not only is the universe expanding,

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.540
it's expanding ever more quickly.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:15.100
Something is still pushing things outward,

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.380
and the explanation is that there's like a residual version

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.580
of the repulsive gravity from the early universe,

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.020
but it's such a strange number.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.660
When you write that amount of dark energy

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:29.140
using the relevant units in a theory of quantum gravity,

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.100
it's a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.700
and then a one.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.300
We're not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.300
We're used to a half, one, pi, e squared to two.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.740
Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.860
that emerge in our explanations of the world,

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.980
and we look at this bizarre number,

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.780
decimal point, all these zeros and a one,

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.180
and we say, something's wrong there.

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.620
Like, where would that number have come from?

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.820
Now, there are people who suggest resolution to it,

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.580
so it's not like we're totally in the dark on it,

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.660
but those people like Paul Steinhard,

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.060
who have alternate cosmological theories,

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.100
cyclic cosmologies, as they call it,

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.460
claim that they have a more natural explanation

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.180
of the dark energy, that it naturally feeds

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.340
into a cyclical process

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.740
that is their cosmological paradigm.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.220
So yeah, if the cosmology should change,

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.820
it's conceivable our view of dark energy may change

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.500
from deeply mysterious to deeply integrated

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.220
into a different paradigm.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.540
That is possible.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.140
I think it's Roger Penrose that think that information

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.700
can bleed through from before the Big Bang

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.380
to after the Big Bang.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:46.860
Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive,

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.860
or is there some information that could bleed through?

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.860
Yeah, I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.700
of the last hundred years,

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.260
rightly won the Nobel Prize for his insights

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.980
into singularities in space-time

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.500
that we know to afflict our mathematical solutions

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.100
of black holes in the Big Bang and so forth,

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:13.100
and he has an enormously fertile imagination.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.340
And I mean that in the most positive sense.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:19.660
And so he has put forward this idea,

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.900
this conformal cyclic cosmology,

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.780
I think is the official title,

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.300
although I could be getting that wrong.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.940
I can't say that I've studied it.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.260
I have seen lectures on it.

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:33.260
I don't find it convincing as yet.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:38.260
It feels like it's being built to find a solution

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:42.220
as opposed to sort of more naturally emerging.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.940
Maybe Roger would say otherwise,

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:48.620
and I don't mean to in any way cast aspersions on the work.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.780
It's vital and interesting,

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.420
and people are thinking about it.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.420
I don't consider it as close a competitor

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.140
to say the inflationary theory as, for instance,

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.900
the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.260
But again, you've got to keep an open mind in this business

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.700
when there's so much that we don't yet understand.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:08.820
I mean, it is wild to think

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.900
that information could survive something like that.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.380
Just like it is wild to imagine

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.580
that information could escape a black hole, for example.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:20.180
It just seems like by construction,

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:24.180
these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.900
But one of the challenges in all of these theories

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:27.700
is when we talk about a singularity,

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.260
has this real sexy term, the singularity,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.620
but a singularity is, in more ordinary language,

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.780
a physical system where the mathematics breaks down.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.140
It's nonsensical.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.860
It's like taking one divided by zero.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.700
You put that into a calculator and it says E, error, right?

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.260
It does not make sense, doesn't compute.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:53.260
And so it's very hard to make definitive statements

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.700
about things like the Big Bang or about black holes

01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.380
until we cure the mathematical singularities.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.740
And there are some who claim that in certain regimes,

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.180
the singularities have been cured.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.060
I don't, by any mean, think that there's consensus

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.060
on these ideas.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.340
So when one talks about information

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.780
sort of bleeding through the Big Bang,

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:15.500
you've really got to make sure

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.380
that the equations have no singularity.

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.780
You talk about cyclic cosmology,

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.540
you've got to make sure that the equations

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.700
don't have any singularities

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.220
as you go from, say, one cycle to the next.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.860
Now, some of the proponents of these theories

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.100
claim that they have resolved these issues.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.700
I don't think that there's a general sense

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.300
that that is the case as yet,

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.380
but it could be that, look, life is so short

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.700
that I haven't had the time to deeply delve

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.540
into all the mathematical intricacies

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.300
of all the ideas that have been put forward.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.260
If I did that, I'd never do anything else.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.740
But that's what the issue is.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.420
And of course, it's just math.

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.820
There may be holes.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.980
There may be gaps in our understanding

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.140
in the way we're modeling physical reality.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:55.980
Well, that's the point.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.500
In fact, when you said I was about to jump in

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.380
and say modeling, but you got there first,

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.100
and it's exactly the right point.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.660
You're talking about the universe here, right?

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.020
And how do you talk about the universe

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020
with a straight face mathematically?

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.100
And the way you do it is you simplify.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.700
You throw away those characteristics of the universe

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.540
that you don't think are vital to a full understanding.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.620
And so we're gonna get to a point

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.580
people are starting to where we've gotta go

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.820
beyond those simplifications.

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:28.100
And so cosmology has, for a long time,

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.500
modeled the universe in the most simplest terms,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.380
homogeneous, isotropic.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.940
It has just a few parameters that describe it.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.580
The average density of mass and energy and so forth.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.380
We have to go beyond those simplifications,

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.420
and that will require putting these things on computers.

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.220
We're not gonna be able to do calculations there.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.660
So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.980
to now give really detailed simulations

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.900
of star systems and galaxies and so forth,

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.860
we're gonna have to do that with cosmology,

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.140
and people are starting to do that today.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.900
Yeah, I've seen some interesting work on simulation.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.740
Most simulation cosmology, by the way, is just awesome.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:10.140
Just simulation of the early formation of our solar system

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:14.860
to understand how the ore cloud and just, I don't know,

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.740
the whole of it, how Earth came to be.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.580
Yeah.

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.980
Like how Jupiter just...

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.860
Protects us.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:26.860
Protects us, and then there's weird moons and volcanoes,

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.940
and modeling all of that, the formation of all of that,

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.780
is fascinating.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:34.620
Yeah.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.180
Because that naturally is the question

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.260
of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.060
How does a rock become a rabbit?

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.620
Yeah.

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.540
But speaking of models,

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.860
there's an equation called the Drake Equation.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.700
Yeah.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.780
We were talking about life.

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.460
Have to ask, at the highest level first,

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.140
when you look out there,

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.300
how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.980
Well, it was zero, one, or many.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.220
So if you say civilization,

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.460
I would bring my number way down.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.900
It could be zero.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.700
If you talk about life,

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.660
I think it could be many.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.780
As we were saying before,

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.860
I think the move from life to consciousness,

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.500
the kinds of beings that would build

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.740
what we would recognize as a civilization,

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.260
that may be extraordinarily rare.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.300
I hope it's not.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.060
As a kid, I loved Star Trek.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.580
I just loved the idea that we would be part

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.660
of some universal community where,

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.020
look, experience on planet Earth

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.100
suggests it doesn't always go so well

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.900
when groups who are separated try to come together

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.780
and live in some larger collective.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.900
But again, as an optimist,

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.900
how amazing would it be to converse

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.140
with an alien civilization

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.420
and learn what they've figured out

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.660
about physics and cosmology

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:06.980
and compare notes and learn from each other

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.340
in some wonderful way?

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:13.820
I love that idea, but if you ask me the likelihood of it,

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.580
I would err on saying it may be so improbable

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.740
that the conditions conspire to allow life

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.700
to move to this place of consciousness

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.180
that it might be rare.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.660
It might be oversimplifying things,

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.460
but just observing the power

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.580
of the evolutionary process,

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.580
I tend to believe, and you read different theories

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:42.340
of how we went, how homo sapiens evolved.

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.460
It seems like the evolutionary process naturally leads

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:51.460
to homo sapiens or creatures like that

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.220
or much better than that.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.380
So to me, there's several scary scenarios.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:02.100
So, okay, the positive scenario is life itself

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.220
is really difficult.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.860
So that origin of life is difficult.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.020
That's exciting for many reasons

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.540
because we might be able to prove that wrong easily

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.780
in the near term by finding life elsewhere.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.940
Sure.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.940
The scary thing to me is if life is easy

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.860
and there's plenty of conscious,

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.780
intelligent civilizations out there

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.620
and we have not obviously made contact,

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.340
which means with intelligence and consciousness

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:38.340
comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.780
So with power comes great responsibility

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.780
and then we end up destroying ourselves.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.140
That's the scariest.

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.220
The positive, I guess, version is that

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.420
maybe we're being watched sort of like,

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.620
there's a transition to where you don't wanna ruin

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.420
the primitive villages out there.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.260
And so there's a protective layer around us.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.100
Yeah.

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.660
They're watching.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.580
So where do you, and these possible explanations

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.260
to the Fermi paradox, why haven't we contacted aliens?

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.100
Yeah.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:13.920
Do you land on?

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.740
Well, I think the most straightforward explanation

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.400
is that there aren't any.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:23.180
Now, there are many other explanations too.

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.620
So you can't be dogmatic about things

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.700
that are just sort of gut feel,

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.860
but one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.340
I don't know if you ever saw this one,

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.340
where this alien civilization finally comes

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.300
to planet earth and gives us this book

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.740
that they really want us to have and to hold.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.780
And it's in this foreign language.

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.620
You don't understand it.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.140
The cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher it

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:52.540
as humans are gonna visit this other alien planet.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.740
They're all sending back postcards,

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.260
how wonderful it is and so forth.

01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.260
And they finally decipher the title, it's to serve man.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.620
And everyone's so thrilled, oh, they're here to serve us.

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.740
It all makes sense.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.260
And then just as one of the final cryptographers

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:10.900
is going on to the alien ship, his helper runs and says,

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.980
I've deciphered the rest of the book, to serve man.

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.020
It's a cookbook.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:20.020
You know, so yeah, is that a possibility?

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.180
Sure, you know.

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.840
So could they be watching us and just sort of waiting

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.700
for us to get to a mature enough level?

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.140
I don't know, it strikes me.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.380
Well, you know, I think it'd be better

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.100
to have this conversation after the James Webb telescope.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.460
I mean, I do think that if we look

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.380
at the atmospheres of many planets,

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:43.380
I mean, there's now an estimate now that there's

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:48.040
on order of one planet per star on average.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.020
So we've long known that, you know,

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.820
the galaxy, hundreds of billions of stars,

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.860
numbers of galaxy, hundreds of billions of galaxies.

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.700
So we're talking about hundreds of billions

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.980
of hundreds of billions of planets.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.700
I'm like, you know, and if we start

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.340
to survey some of these planets,

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.860
and one after the other, after the other,

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.420
we just sort of find no evidence

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.460
for any of the biological markers.

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.340
It could be, of course,

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.900
maybe life takes a radically different form.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.440
It'd be hard to know that.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.660
But I think, you know, that would at least give us

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.420
some insight on the life question.

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.020
But I just don't see how we get insight

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:25.140
on the civilization or consciousness question

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.620
without, you know, the direct connection.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:31.680
And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous,

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:35.100
let's say life is, I'm willing to grant that.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.320
If consciousness is also ubiquitous,

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.700
then I don't understand why they haven't been here

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.540
or why there hasn't been such a decision

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:47.960
because presumably they should be much further ahead of us.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.240
How unlikely would it be that we're like,

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.160
of all consciousness in the universe,

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.560
we're the most advanced?

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.000
That'd be such a special place for human beings

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.180
that it's hard for me to grant that as a likely possibility.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.720
Rather, I think we're kind of running the mill.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.040
And there are many who are far more advanced than us.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.120
And I don't think that they would expend the energy

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.400
to hide themselves.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.800
I don't think they care enough.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.920
And so, you see, that's actually what I believe

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.200
that there's a very large number of civilizations

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.460
that are far more advanced than us.

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.240
But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited,

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.320
both in our direct sensory capabilities and our physics,

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.120
our tools of sensing.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.520
Just like with the string theory and the multiple dimensions,

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.460
we're just not, like, it's like,

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.080
I honestly believe there could be stuff

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.760
in front of our nose that we're just not seeing.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.760
Because we're too dumb, too much hubris,

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.940
and I mean, there's a bunch of stuff,

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:54.920
and too ignorant to the fabric of reality,

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.320
all of those things.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.880
We're young in terms of intelligence.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.040
But I guess what I'd say is, like,

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.160
I'm on board with all of that as a real possibility.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.160
But then, it does strike me that we are sufficiently

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.800
able to observe the universe.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.880
Look, we can look back to, you know,

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.600
a fraction of the duration from here to there,

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.720
just a fraction is left that we are unable to see.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.400
So, however young we are,

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.160
we have been able to sort of pierce the universe,

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.320
and it just strikes me that there would be some signature,

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.240
but maybe that's coming.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.880
But look, having said that I do,

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.600
look, I certainly note the fact that it's rare

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.120
that I stoop down while walking in Manhattan

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.920
and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.520
on the side of the street and talk to the ants, right?

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.960
Because it's just not interesting to me.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.080
So if we're like the ants on the cosmological landscape,

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.760
then yeah, I can imagine that the super advanced aliens

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.960
would be like, like, who would ever, you know?

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.320
But I feel like we're sufficiently advanced

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.200
that there should be some signal signature of that,

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.320
but maybe it's coming.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.120
I think the deeper fundamental problem

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.280
between us and the ants

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.800
is that we don't have a common language.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.640
It's not the interest.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.320
It's that we don't even have a common language.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.880
And so the alien civilizations don't even know how to communicate.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.760
Like we humans have convinced ourselves we're special

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.920
because we developed the language.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.800
And you talk about the importance of language

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.680
to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.440
like how very niche is that like club

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.480
that we've like tribe we've created of language

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.520
linguistic type of systems that are very specific

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.920
to our particular kinds of brains.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.320
And we share ideas together.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.560
We're all super excited that we can understand the universe

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:49.360
because we came up with some notation and math.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.480
I wonder if there's some totally other kinds of language

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.480
that communicates on a different time scale

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.880
with different, very different mechanisms

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.120
in a space of information that just is not,

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.240
it's everything is lost in translation.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.160
Yeah, and it could well be as a look.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.040
I think part of the reason I go toward the possibility

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.080
of the soul intelligence is there's a certain kind

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.080
of romantic appeal to looking out in the cosmos

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.560
and it's just quiet and it's just eternal silence.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.360
There's something that appeals to me

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.880
at an emotional level that way.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.720
But yeah, I mean, nobody knows.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.520
And it's certainly conceivable

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.720
that there's just a radical mismatch

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.080
between the kinds of things

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.880
that we are able to observe and sensitive to

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.240
versus the kinds of structures that permeate the universe

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.440
in a manner that simply we're unable to detect.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.040
Well, if we are alone, that is exciting.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:59.040
And one of the ways it's exciting is that it's up to us

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.800
to become, to expand out into the universe,

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.800
to permeate consciousness out into the universe.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.960
So that's where space exploration comes in.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.440
Let me ask you, as somebody who's a string theorist,

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.120
a physicist, do you think space exploration,

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.440
colonizing space is a physics or an engineering problem?

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.280
What would you say?

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.440
Yeah, I think it's fundamentally an engineering problem

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.440
if we're not trying to do things like build wormholes

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.040
the way they did, say, an interstellar

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.280
to get to a different place

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.960
or trying to travel near the speed of light

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.480
so that we would actually be able

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.160
to traverse interstellar distances.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.720
I mean, without that, our colonization will happen

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.040
at a very, very slow rate, right?

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.440
But one of the beauties of relativity

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.880
is if you do travel near the speed of light,

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.040
you can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.120
People say, how's that possible?

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.160
You can't go billions of light years.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.720
Well, you can actually,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.440
because as you can near the speed of light,

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.080
the way in which space and time change

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.920
allows you to go in principle arbitrarily far.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:09.960
That's very exciting.

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:13.640
But if we put that physics side of the issue

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.960
and the manipulation of space and time to the side,

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.320
yeah, I think it's a deep engineering problem.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.680
How do you terraform other planets?

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.200
How do you go beyond our local neighborhood,

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.360
say, without using the ideas of relativity?

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.080
So I think it's all quite exciting.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.280
And I think the ideas,

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.680
using solar sails that people have developed

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.720
and trying to take that first step to Mars,

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.960
I think that's a vital and valuable step to take.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.800
But yeah, I think these are

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.360
fundamentally engineering challenges.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.480
Or extending the human lifespan through biology research

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:54.480
or maybe reducing what it means to be a human being

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:57.680
into information and uploading certain parts of it.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.880
Maybe not all the full resolution of a human life,

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.880
but maybe the essential things like the DNA

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.080
and be able to reconstruct that human being.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.120
But I have to ask about Mars.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.560
Do you find the dream of humans stepping on Mars,

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:20.800
stepping foot first, but also colonizing Mars,

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.040
one that's worth us fighting for?

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.000
Yeah, usually so.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.520
I mean, I think what we have long been,

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.960
not always in the best way, is a species of explorers

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.480
in the literal sense of traveling from one part

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.560
of the world to another,

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.360
or in the more metaphorical sense

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.120
of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.760
or back to the Big Bang or to the center of black holes.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.480
So I think that's fundamentally part of the human spirit.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:56.480
So I do think that's a vital part of our heritage

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.040
brought forward into its next incarnation.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.000
That's who we are.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.880
Do you think there'll be a day in the future

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.320
where a human being is born on Mars

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:16.320
and has to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.400
Like they'll have to read in a book?

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.000
Yeah, I don't think it'll be a book at that stage.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.480
It'll probably just be uploaded into the head or something,

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.760
or imprinted into the DNA,

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.440
and then they just sort of sense it.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.240
But yeah, I think there's...

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.880
Well, look, the issue you raised before is the vital one.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.600
Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.960
destroys itself?

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.400
Is that sort of a commonplace quality?

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.000
I mean, that's the other potential answer

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.680
to the Fermi paradox.

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.720
Why aren't they here?

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.720
Because by the time they got to the technological development

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.800
where they could travel here, they blew themselves up.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.000
They destroyed themselves.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.640
And that's an unfortunate,

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.720
but not a hard to imagine possibility

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.640
based on things that have happened here on planet Earth.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.040
But putting that to the side, I think it...

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.160
That's the big obstacle, but putting it to the side,

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.800
we will resolve the engineering challenges.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:15.080
And I should probably modify my answer from before.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.080
When you said, is it engineering or physics?

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.520
It's really both, right?

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.560
So we will surmount the engineering challenges,

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.800
and that will then make the physics challenges relevant.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.240
It'll make it relevant to figure out

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.080
how to travel near this beat of light.

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.520
It'll make it relevant to learn how to manipulate

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.360
the shape of space-time and so forth.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.880
So I think it's a multi-stage process

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.320
where it is engineering and ultimately physics.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.560
And if we stick around long enough,

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.720
those are the kinds of challenges

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.720
I think that we're ultimately gonna surmount.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.560
And then the physics side is figuring out

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.920
how to harness energy enough

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.920
to travel outside the solar system,

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.360
which seems like a heck of a difficult journey.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.160
But even Mars itself, I don't know,

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.600
maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.480
and was born with the, you know,

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.840
looking up at the stars and that dream

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880
of like the highest of human achievement

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.040
is ability to fly out there, you know, to join the stars.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.840
I really liked the idea of going to Mars

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:17.200
and not just stepping foot on Mars.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.200
It wasn't until maybe misinformed,

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.080
but for me personally, it wasn't until Elon Musk

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.960
started talking about the colonization of Mars,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.680
did I realize like we humans can actually do that.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.360
And first of all, the importance of somebody saying

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.800
that we can do these seemingly impossible things

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.600
is immeasurable because, you know,

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.120
the fact that he placed that into my mind

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.160
and into the minds of millions of others,

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.880
maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions of others,

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.680
young kids today, I mean, that's gonna make it a reality.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.920
I, for some reason, am deeply excited,

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.200
even though my work is in AI,

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.280
that echoes all of this.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.520
I'm excited by the idea that somebody would be born,

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.200
as we were saying, on Mars and sort of look up

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.680
and be able to see with a telescope Earth

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.360
and say, that's where I came from.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.560
I don't know, that idea scale to other planets,

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.640
to other solar systems, that's really exciting.

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.040
And hugely exciting.

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.320
I think you're absolutely right.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.840
I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.880
And it sounds hackneyed, but it is so important

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.280
for young kids for the next generation

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.480
to think about the things that are seemingly impossible.

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:47.200
I mean, that's what makes them possible.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.320
And this is one which is concrete enough.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.160
I mean, this is something that's gonna happen soon

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.880
in terms of actually going to Mars.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.880
And then the next step of establishing some presence,

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.640
some semi-permanent or permanent presence,

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.600
this is not something that's gonna wait to the 25th century.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.760
I mean, this is something that's gonna happen

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.200
relatively soon.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.240
So, I mean, it could well be in your lifetime,

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.680
unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime,

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.480
that that kid will be born

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.320
and have the experience that you described.

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.800
So yeah, it's spectacularly exciting.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.280
And I actually, I would love to go on Mars

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.920
on one of the early...

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.760
You would?

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.580
Yeah.

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.420
It would've is one way.

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.260
I'm happy to do one.

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.080
Really?

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:30.920
Wow.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.520
And I'm single if there's ladies out there

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.200
that wanna start that family.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.560
Let's go out to Mars.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.720
No, I think...

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.560
See, I have to tell you something.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.720
You spoke about terror, thinking about like black holes.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.440
If I actually think about going to Mars

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.760
and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.800
that's terror inducing.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.960
The idea of to be in this foreign world

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.720
where you can't come back,

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.040
where you've made this choice that can't be reversed.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.720
Oh, you know, at some point it may be,

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.960
but in that, guys, that to me carries a deep sense of terror.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.600
You know, I feel that sense of terror every time.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.840
Kerouac, Jack Kerouac talked about this on the road

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.400
is when you leave a place, if you're honest about it,

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:21.840
like life is short and when you leave a place,

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.440
you move to a new place and you think of all the friends,

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.200
maybe family you're leaving behind

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.200
as you drive over the hill, that really is goodbye.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.360
Like we sometimes don't think of it that way

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.320
when we're moving, but that really is goodbye to that life,

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.680
to the person you were, to all the people.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.320
Maybe if it's close friends,

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.880
you'll see them maybe 10, 15 more times in your life

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.720
and that's it.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.160
And you're saying goodbye to all of that.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.240
And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.680
when you're flying away from Earth and it's like,

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.240
it's goodbye to Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.720
and it's goodbye to whatever, I don't know why I picked those,

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.880
all the things that are special to Earth, it's goodbye,

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.920
but that's life.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.680
I suppose more what excites me about that kind of journey

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.800
is it's a distinct contemplation of your mortality,

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.640
acceptance of your mortality.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.600
You're saying just like when you take on

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.840
any difficult journey, it's accepting

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.200
that you're going to die one day

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.760
and might as well do something truly exciting.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.600
I mean, I'm with you on that.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.600
I'm a strong believer that deep underneath human motivation

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.320
is this terror of our own mortality.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.640
There's this wonderful book that had a great influence

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.600
in me called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.360
And when you are aware of the ways

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.320
in which our mortality influences our behaviors,

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.760
it really does add a different slant,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.040
a different kind of color

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.680
to the interpretation of human behavior.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.640
Yeah, it's funny that that book had a big influence

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.480
on me as well.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.480
Oh, is that right?

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.840
And terror management theory and I,

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.920
again, from an engineering perspective,

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.280
I don't know how many people that book influenced

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:22.080
because I talk to people about the fear of death

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.000
and it doesn't seem to be that fundamental

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.600
to their experience.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.240
And I don't think on the surface

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.600
it's fundamental to my experience,

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.760
but it seems like an awfully,

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.400
in terms of talking about models and strength theory

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.920
and theories, in terms of theories

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.560
of this macro experience of human life,

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.960
it seems like a heck of a good theory

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.360
that the fear of death is at the kind of,

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.800
is the warm at the core.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.440
Yeah, well, I mean, and the terror management theories

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.480
that you make reference to.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.640
I mean, this is a group of psychologists,

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.440
who devise these very clever experiments,

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.760
real world experiments with real people,

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.120
where you can directly measure the hidden influence

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.520
of the recognition of our own mortality.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.640
I mean, they've done these experiments

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.600
where they have group of people A, group of people B,

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.000
and the only difference between the two groups

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.240
is that group B, they somehow reminded them

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.120
in some subtle way of their own mortality.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.240
Sometimes it's nothing more than interviewing them

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:24.000
with a funeral home across the street.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.880
And influence is there, but it's subtle,

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.520
you don't even think you'd take note of.

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.240
And they can find measurable effects

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.680
that differentiate the two groups

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.360
to a high degree of statistical significance

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.960
and how they respond to certain challenges

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.800
or certain kinds of questions

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.800
that shows a direct influence of the reminder

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.000
of their own mortality.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.680
And I've read a number of these studies

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.720
and they are really convincing.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.120
And so, yeah, I would say that the reason why

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.560
so many people would say that,

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.320
yeah, fear of mortality is not front and center

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.200
in my worldview.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.480
Yeah, I don't really think about it much.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.400
Doesn't really matter too much.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.160
The reason why they're able to say that

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.600
is because this thing called culture has emerged

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.840
over the course of the last 10,000 years.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.360
And part of the role of culture is to give us a means

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.120
of not thinking about our mortality all the time,

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.080
of not living in terror of the inevitable end

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.840
which faces us all.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.600
So it's completely understandable that that's the response

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.960
because that's what culture is at least in part for.

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.360
It's at least possible that the fear of death,

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.360
the terror of your mortality is the creative force

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.080
that created all of the things around us

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.640
at this human civilization.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:44.880
And I think about from an engineering perspective,

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.280
this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues,

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.600
is I feel like if you want to create intelligence,

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.600
you have to also engineer in some kind of echoes

01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.760
of this kind of fear.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.480
Fear is such a complicated word,

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.920
but it's kind of like a scarcity,

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.560
a scarcity of time, a scarcity of resources

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.520
that creates a kind of anxiety,

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.480
like deadlines get you to do stuff.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.480
And there's something almost fundamental to that

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.480
in terms of human experience.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.720
Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.720
So you're basically in order to create a kind of structure

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.360
that mirrors what we call consciousness,

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.760
you better have that structure confront

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.040
the same kinds of issues and terrors that we do.

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.240
Consciousness and suffering only makes sense

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.680
in the context of death.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:48.200
If you want to, I feel like,

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.800
if you want to fit into human society,

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.520
if you're a robot, if you want to fit into human society,

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.160
you better have the same kind of existential dread,

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.800
the same kind of fear of mortality,

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.360
otherwise you're not gonna fit in.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.200
Right.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.640
It might be wild, but at least,

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.400
like we're talking about all the theories

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.760
that are at least worth consideration.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.800
I think that's a really powerful one.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.240
And definitely one has resonated with me

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.320
and definitely seems to capture something

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.720
beautifully like real about the human condition.

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:34.240
And I wonder, it's, of course,

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.280
sucks to think that we need death to appreciate life.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.200
But that's just maybe the way it is.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.520
Well, it's interesting if this robotic

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.440
or artificially intelligent system understands the world

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.480
and understands the second law of thermodynamics and entropy,

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.560
even in artificial intelligence will realize

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.240
that even if its parts are really robust,

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.360
ultimately it will disintegrate.

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.200
Yeah.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.200
I mean, so the time scales may be different,

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.000
but in a way, when you think about it, it doesn't matter.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.240
Once you know that you are mortal

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.560
in the sense that you are not eternal,

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.720
the time scale hardly matters

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:17.920
because it's either the whole thing or not.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.720
Because on the scales of eternity,

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.680
any finite duration, however large is effectively zero

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.560
on the scales of eternity.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.800
And so maybe it won't be so hard for an artificial system

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.000
to feel that sense of mortality

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.200
because it will recognize the underlying physical laws

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.560
and recognize its own finitude.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.360
And then it'll be us and robots drinking beers,

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.640
looking up at the stars and just,

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.080
having a good laugh in awe of the whole thing.

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:51.920
Yeah.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.520
I think that's a pretty good way to end it,

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.360
talking about the fear of death.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.840
We started talking about the meaning of life

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.080
and ended on the fear of death.

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.760
Brian, it's just an incredible conversation.

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.600
My pleasure, thank you.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.440
I enjoyed it enormously.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:05.520
I really, really enjoyed it.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.680
It's been a long time coming.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.680
I'm a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.680
Thanks for talking to me, Brian.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.040
Thank you.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Green.

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.080
To support this podcast,

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.880
please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.960
And now let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.560
Physics is really nothing more

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.920
than a search for ultimate simplicity.

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.920
But so far, all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.040
Thank you for listening

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.080
and hope to see you next time.
