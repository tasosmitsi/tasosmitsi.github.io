00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of consciousness.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.800
Do you think we're living in a simulation?

00:06.800 --> 00:09.600
We could be in the matrix. This could be a very vivid dream.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.560
There's going to be a few people that are now visualizing a pink elephant.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.240
A hamster has consciousness.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.960
Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.840
Consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.360
Do you think there will be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we're not morally okay

00:30.160 --> 00:31.920
turning off the power to a robot?

00:36.240 --> 00:40.400
The following is a conversation with Philip Goff, philosopher specializing

00:40.400 --> 00:43.520
in the philosophy of mind and consciousness.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.920
He is a panpsychist, which means he believes that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous

00:49.920 --> 00:53.520
feature of physical reality of all matter in the universe.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.120
He is the author of Galileo's Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness,

00:59.120 --> 01:03.680
and is the host of an excellent podcast called Mind Chat.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.560
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.840
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.280
And now here's my conversation with Philip Goff.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.680
I opened my second podcast conversation with Elon Musk

01:18.640 --> 01:22.400
with a question about consciousness and panpsychism.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.040
The question was, quote, does consciousness permeate all matter?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.280
I don't know why I opened the conversation this way.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.280
He looked at me like, what the hell is this guy talking about?

01:31.840 --> 01:36.960
So he said no, because we wouldn't be able to tell if it did or not.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.360
So it's outside the realm of the scientific method.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.080
Do you agree or disagree with Elon Musk's answer?

01:45.360 --> 01:46.240
I disagree.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.400
I guess I do think consciousness pervades matter.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.480
In fact, I think consciousness is the ultimate nature of matter.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.680
And so as for whether it's outside of the scientific method,

02:03.440 --> 02:08.160
I think there's a fundamental challenge at the heart of the science of consciousness

02:08.160 --> 02:14.560
that we need to face up to, which is that consciousness is not publicly observable.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.320
I can't look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.640
We know about consciousness not from doing experiments or public observation.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.480
We just know about it from our immediate awareness of our feelings and experiences.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.360
It's qualitative, not quantitative as you talk about.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.960
Yeah, that's another aspect of it.

02:38.960 --> 02:48.800
So there are a couple of reasons consciousness, I think, is not fully susceptible to the standard

02:48.880 --> 02:50.320
scientific approach.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.320
One reason you've just raised is that it's qualitative rather than quantitative.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.840
Another reason is it's not publicly observable.

02:57.840 --> 03:04.720
So science is used to dealing with unobservables, fundamental particles,

03:04.720 --> 03:06.960
quantum wave functions, other universes.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.520
None of these things are observable, but there's an important difference.

03:12.400 --> 03:20.000
With all these things, we postulate unobservables in order to explain what we can observe.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.280
In the whole of science, that's how it works.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.680
In the case of consciousness, in the unique case of consciousness,

03:29.680 --> 03:34.960
the thing we are trying to explain is not publicly observable.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.040
And that is utterly unique.

03:37.120 --> 03:41.840
If we want to fully bring science into consciousness, we need a more expansive

03:41.840 --> 03:43.600
conception of the scientific method.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.080
It doesn't mean we can't explain consciousness scientifically,

03:46.720 --> 03:49.200
but we need to rethink what science is.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.080
What do you mean publicly, the word publicly observable?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.720
Is there something interesting to be said about the word publicly?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.640
I suppose versus privately.

03:57.840 --> 04:06.640
Yeah, it's tricky to define, but I suppose the data of physics are available to anybody

04:07.440 --> 04:10.480
if there were aliens who visited us from another planet.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.880
Maybe they'd have very different sense organs.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.440
Maybe they'd struggle to understand our art or our music.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.520
But if they were intelligent enough to do mathematics,

04:21.520 --> 04:22.960
they could understand our physics.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.280
They could look at the data of our experiments.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.360
They could run the experiments themselves.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.040
Whereas consciousness, is it observable?

04:31.040 --> 04:31.920
Is it not observable?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.280
In a sense, it's observable.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.400
As you say, we could say it's privately observable.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.520
I am directly aware of my own feelings and experiences.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.680
If I'm in pain, it's just right there for me.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.880
My pain is just totally directly evident to me.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.560
But you, from the outside, cannot directly access my pain.

04:54.560 --> 04:59.280
You can access my pain behavior, or you can ask me,

05:00.080 --> 05:05.280
but you can't access my pain in the way that I can access my pain.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.560
So I think that's a distinction.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.160
It might be difficult to totally pin it down how we define those things,

05:14.160 --> 05:17.520
but I think there's a fairly clear and very important difference there.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.720
So you think there's a kind of direct observation

05:20.720 --> 05:23.920
that you're able to do of your pain that I'm not.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.440
My observation, all the ways in which I can sneak up to observing your pain,

05:29.440 --> 05:32.400
is indirect versus yours is direct.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.560
Can you play devil's advocate?

05:34.560 --> 05:38.080
Is it possible for me to get closer and closer and closer

05:39.120 --> 05:41.680
to being able to observe your pain,

05:42.720 --> 05:48.320
like all the subjective experiences, yours, in the way that you do?

05:49.280 --> 05:54.400
Yeah, I mean, so of course, it's not that we observe behavior

05:54.400 --> 05:56.320
and then we make an inference.

05:56.320 --> 06:05.920
We are hardwired to instinctively interpret smiles as happiness, crying as sadness.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.200
And as we get to know someone, we find it very easy to adopt their perspective,

06:11.200 --> 06:12.560
get into their shoes.

06:13.520 --> 06:20.880
But strictly speaking, all we have perceptual access to is someone's behavior.

06:20.880 --> 06:28.800
And strictly speaking, if you were trying to explain someone's behavior,

06:28.800 --> 06:30.720
those aspects that are publicly observable,

06:31.280 --> 06:34.400
I don't think you'd ever have recourse to attribute consciousness.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.240
You could just postulate some kind of mechanism

06:36.240 --> 06:39.600
if you were just trying to explain the behavior.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.120
So someone like Daniel Dennett is very consistent on this.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.960
So I think for most people, what science is in the business of

06:50.000 --> 06:55.200
is explaining the data of public observation experiment.

06:55.200 --> 07:00.720
If you religiously followed that, you would not postulate consciousness

07:00.720 --> 07:04.240
because it's not a datum that's known about in that way.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.320
And Daniel Dennett is really consistent on this.

07:06.320 --> 07:11.360
He thinks my consciousness cannot be empirically verified,

07:11.360 --> 07:12.480
and therefore it doesn't exist.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.720
Dennett is consistent on this.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.000
I think I'm consistent on this.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.800
But I think a lot of people have a slightly confused middle way position on this.

07:22.800 --> 07:28.560
On the one hand, they think the business of science

07:28.560 --> 07:31.600
is just to account for public observation experiment.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.720
But on the other hand, they also believe in consciousness

07:36.720 --> 07:40.560
without appreciating, I think, that that implies

07:40.560 --> 07:43.680
that there is another datum over and above

07:43.680 --> 07:46.000
the data of public observation experiments,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.960
namely just the reality of feelings and experiences.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.880
As we walk along this conversation,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.960
you keep opening doors I don't want to walk into.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.480
And I will, but I want to try to stay kind of focused.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.680
You mentioned Daniel Dennett.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.880
Let's lay it out.

07:58.880 --> 08:03.040
Since he sticks to his story, pun unintended,

08:03.040 --> 08:06.560
and then you stick to yours, what is your story?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.200
What is your theory of consciousness versus his?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.880
Can you clarify his position?

08:12.880 --> 08:16.880
So my view, I defend the view known as panpsychism,

08:16.880 --> 08:21.440
which is the view that consciousness is a fundamental

08:21.440 --> 08:23.680
and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.400
So it doesn't literally mean that everything is conscious

08:28.400 --> 08:32.960
despite the meaning of the word pan, everything, psyche, mind.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.600
So literally that means everything has mind.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.520
But the typical commitment of the panpsychist

08:39.520 --> 08:43.360
is that the fundamental building blocks of reality,

08:44.400 --> 08:47.680
maybe fundamental particles like electrons and quarks,

08:48.400 --> 08:52.000
have incredibly simple forms of experience.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.200
And that the very complex experience of the human or animal brain

08:57.760 --> 09:02.240
is somehow rooted in or derived from this much more simple

09:02.240 --> 09:04.640
consciousness at the level of fundamental physics.

09:05.680 --> 09:11.520
So I mean, that's a theory that I would justify on the grounds

09:11.520 --> 09:16.000
that it can account for this datum of consciousness

09:16.000 --> 09:19.040
that we are immediately aware of in our experience

09:19.760 --> 09:22.080
in a way that I don't think other theories can.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.400
You asked me to contrast that to Daniel Dennett.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.400
I think he would just say there is no such datum.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.360
Dennett says the data for science of consciousness

09:29.360 --> 09:31.680
is what he calls hetrophenomenology,

09:32.240 --> 09:35.920
which is specifically defined as what we can access

09:35.920 --> 09:40.000
from the third-person perspective, including what people say.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.280
But crucially, we're not treating what they say.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.200
We're not relying on their testimony as evidence

09:47.200 --> 09:51.280
for some unobservable realm of feelings and experiences.

09:51.280 --> 09:57.120
We're just treating what they say as a datum of public observation

09:57.120 --> 10:00.800
experiments that we can account for in terms of underlying mechanisms.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.560
But I feel like there's a deeper view of what consciousness is.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.160
So you have a very clear, and we'll talk quite a bit about panpsychism,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.840
but you have a clear view of what, you know,

10:11.840 --> 10:14.480
almost like a physics view of consciousness.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.880
He, I think, has a kind of view that

10:16.880 --> 10:25.600
consciousness is almost a side effect of this massively parallel computation system

10:25.600 --> 10:32.000
going on in our brain, that the brain has a model of the world,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.240
and it's taking in perceptions,

10:34.240 --> 10:38.240
and it's constantly weaving multiple stories about that world

10:38.800 --> 10:40.720
that's integrating the new perceptions,

10:40.720 --> 10:42.480
and the multiple stories are somehow,

10:43.120 --> 10:46.000
it's like a Google Doc collaborative editing.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.920
And that collaborative editing is the actual experience

10:50.880 --> 10:54.000
of what we think of as consciousness.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.680
Somehow, the editing is consciousness of this story.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.560
I mean, that's a theory of consciousness, isn't it?

11:03.440 --> 11:05.520
The narrative theory of consciousness,

11:05.520 --> 11:10.160
or the multiple versions editing, collaborative editing,

11:10.160 --> 11:12.000
of a narrative theory of consciousness.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.480
Yeah, he calls it the multiple drafts model.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.640
Incidentally, there's a very interesting paper

11:16.640 --> 11:19.840
just come out by a very good philosopher, Luke Roelofs,

11:19.840 --> 11:24.800
defending a panpsychist version of Dennett's multiple drafts model.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.640
Like a deeper turtle that's all stacked on top of.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.080
Just the difference being that this is Luke Roelof's view,

11:32.080 --> 11:33.520
all of the drafts are conscious.

11:33.520 --> 11:40.480
So I guess for Dennett, there's sort of no fact of the matter

11:40.480 --> 11:43.040
about which of these drafts is the correct one.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.120
On Roelof's view, maybe there's no fact of the matter

11:47.120 --> 11:50.000
about which of these drafts is my consciousness.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.880
But nonetheless, all the drafts correspond to some consciousness.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.960
And I mean, it just sounds kind of funny.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.680
I guess I think he calls it Dennetti in panpsychism.

11:59.680 --> 12:05.040
But Luke is one of the most rigorous and serious philosophers

12:05.600 --> 12:06.800
alive at the moment, I think.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.080
And I hate having Luke Roelofs in an audience if I'm giving a talk

12:10.080 --> 12:14.000
because he always cuts straight to the weakness in your position

12:14.000 --> 12:14.960
that you hadn't thought of.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.240
And so it's nice.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.960
Panpsychism is sometimes associated with fluffy thinking,

12:18.960 --> 12:23.120
but contemporary panpsychists have come out of this tradition

12:23.120 --> 12:28.240
we call analytic philosophy, which is rooted in detailed,

12:28.240 --> 12:32.800
rigorous argumentation, and it is defended in that manner.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.680
Yeah, those analytic philosophers are sticklers for terminology.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.320
It's a very fun group to talk shit with.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.600
Well, I mean, it gets boring if you just start and then defining words, right?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.240
Yeah.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.080
I think starting with defining words is good.

12:48.080 --> 12:53.200
Actually, the philosopher Derek Parfit said when he first was thinking about philosophy,

12:53.200 --> 12:56.080
he went to a talk in analytic philosophy,

12:56.080 --> 12:58.160
and he went to a talk in continental philosophy,

12:58.720 --> 13:01.760
and he decided that the problem with the continental philosophy,

13:01.760 --> 13:04.080
if it was really unrigorous, really unprecise,

13:04.080 --> 13:09.280
the problem with the analytic philosophy is it was just not about anything important.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.840
And he thought there was more chance of working within analytic philosophy

13:13.840 --> 13:16.960
and asking some more meaningful, some more profound questions

13:16.960 --> 13:20.320
than there was in working in continental philosophy and making it more rigorous.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.160
Now, they're both horrific stereotypes,

13:22.160 --> 13:25.840
and I don't want to get nasty emails from either of these groups,

13:25.840 --> 13:28.880
but there's something to what he was saying there.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.440
I think just a tiny tangent on terminology.

13:32.160 --> 13:37.440
I do think that there's a lot of deep insight to be discovered

13:37.440 --> 13:40.320
by just asking questions, what do we mean by this word?

13:40.320 --> 13:45.760
I remember I was taking a course on algorithms and data structures in computer science,

13:45.760 --> 13:50.720
and the instructor, shout out to him, Ali Shakafande, amazing professor.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.480
I remember he asked some basic questions like, what is an algorithm?

13:55.440 --> 13:59.440
The pressure of pushing students to answer, to think deeply.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.320
You just woke up hungover in college or whatever,

14:02.320 --> 14:06.240
and you're tasked with answering some deep philosophical question about what is an algorithm.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.920
These basic questions, and they sound very simple,

14:09.920 --> 14:11.760
but they're actually very difficult.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.720
And one of the things I really value in conversation

14:14.720 --> 14:19.520
is asking these dumb, simple questions of like, what is intelligence?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.840
And just continually asking that question over and over

14:23.840 --> 14:30.640
of some of the biggest researchers in the artificial intelligence computer science space.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.080
It's actually very useful.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.680
At the same time, it should start at terminology,

14:35.760 --> 14:39.280
and then progress where you kind of say, ah, fuck it.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.640
We'll just assume we know what we mean by that.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.600
Otherwise, you get the Bill Clinton situation where it's like,

14:47.040 --> 14:49.600
what is the meaning of is, is whatever he said.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.400
It's like, hey, man, did you do the sex stuff or not?

14:56.400 --> 15:01.680
You have to both be able to talk about the sex stuff and the meaning of the word is.

15:01.760 --> 15:07.280
With consciousness, because we don't currently understand, you know, very much.

15:08.320 --> 15:13.280
Terminology discussions are very important because it's like you're almost trying to sneak,

15:14.960 --> 15:19.200
sneak up to some deep insight by just discussing some basic terminology.

15:19.760 --> 15:27.200
You know, like what is consciousness or even defining the different aspects of panpsychism

15:27.200 --> 15:28.080
is fascinating.

15:28.080 --> 15:37.120
But just to linger on the Daniel Dennett thing, what do you think about narrative,

15:37.760 --> 15:41.680
sort of the mind constructing narratives for ourselves?

15:41.680 --> 15:46.640
So there's nothing special about consciousness deeply.

15:46.640 --> 15:53.440
It is some property of the human mind that's just is able to tell these pretty stories

15:54.240 --> 15:59.440
that we experience as consciousness and that it's unique perhaps to the human mind,

15:59.440 --> 16:02.560
which is, I suppose, what Daniel Dennett would argue,

16:02.560 --> 16:08.240
that it's either deeply unique or mostly unique to the human mind.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
It's just on the question of terminology before.

16:12.640 --> 16:16.720
I think it used to be the fashion among philosophers

16:16.720 --> 16:22.080
that we had to come up with utterly precise, necessary and sufficient conditions for each

16:22.080 --> 16:27.840
word and then I think this has gone out of fashion a bit partly because it's just been,

16:28.800 --> 16:30.000
you know, such a failure.

16:30.720 --> 16:35.760
The word knowledge in particular, people used to define knowledge as true justified belief

16:35.760 --> 16:40.800
and then this guy, Gettier, had this very short paper where he just produced some pretty

16:40.800 --> 16:42.480
conclusive counter examples to that.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.800
I think, you know, he wrote very few papers, but this is just, you know, you have to teach

16:46.800 --> 16:49.280
this on an undergraduate philosophy course.

16:49.280 --> 16:55.200
And then after that, you had a huge literature of people trying to address this and propose

16:55.200 --> 16:58.880
a new definition, but then someone else had come out with counter examples and then you

16:58.880 --> 17:02.400
get a new definition of knowledge and counter examples and it just went on and on and never

17:02.400 --> 17:03.360
seemed to get anywhere.

17:03.360 --> 17:09.840
So I think the thought now is, let's work out how precise we need to be for what we're trying to do

17:09.840 --> 17:11.200
and I think that's a healthier attitude.

17:11.200 --> 17:16.000
So precision is important, but you just need to work out how precise do we need to be for

17:16.000 --> 17:16.720
these purposes.

17:17.680 --> 17:26.560
Coming to Dennett and narrative theories, I mean, I think narrative theories are a plausible

17:26.560 --> 17:33.280
contender for a theory of the self, theory of my identity over time.

17:33.280 --> 17:40.400
What makes me the same person in some sense today as I was 20 years ago, given that I've

17:40.400 --> 17:43.360
changed so much physically and psychologically.

17:44.320 --> 17:50.800
One running contender is something connected to the kind of stories we tell about ourselves

17:50.800 --> 17:56.080
or maybe some story about the psychological, the chains of psychological continuity.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.520
I'm not saying I accept such a theory, but it's plausible.

17:59.520 --> 18:05.760
I don't think these theories are good as theories of consciousness, at least if we're taking

18:06.240 --> 18:14.320
consciousness just to be subjective experience, pleasure, pain, seeing color, hearing sound.

18:14.880 --> 18:19.600
I think a hamster has consciousness in that sense.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.920
There's something that it's like to be a hamster.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.240
It feels pain if you stand on it, if you're cruel enough to do it.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.120
I don't know why I gave that.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.000
You stand?

18:28.000 --> 18:32.400
People always give, I don't know, philosophers give these very violent examples to get the

18:32.400 --> 18:35.040
cross consciousness and it's, yeah, I don't know why that's coming about.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.960
You say mean things to the hamster.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.000
It experiences pain, it experiences pleasure, joy.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.320
But there's some limits to that experience of a hamster,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.600
but there is nevertheless the presence of a subjective experience.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.240
Yeah.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.480
Consciousness is just something, it's a very ambiguous word, but if we're just

18:56.480 --> 18:59.920
using it to mean some kind of experience, some kind of inner life,

19:00.880 --> 19:03.760
that is pretty widespread in the animal kingdom.

19:03.760 --> 19:09.680
A bit difficult to say where it stops, where it starts, but you certainly don't need something

19:09.680 --> 19:16.880
as sophisticated as the capacity to self-consciously tell stories about yourself to just have experience.

19:16.880 --> 19:23.200
Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.960
They're the fingertips of the devil.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.000
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Well, I was taking that as read.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.960
I mean, Descartes thought animals were mechanisms.

19:30.960 --> 19:36.160
And humans are unique, so animals are robots essentially in the formulation of Descartes

19:36.160 --> 19:37.360
and humans are unique.

19:38.880 --> 19:48.240
So in which way would you say humans are unique versus even our closest ancestors?

19:48.880 --> 19:50.880
Is there something special about humans?

19:52.480 --> 19:57.200
What is, in your view, under the panpsychism, I guess we're walking backwards because we'll

19:57.920 --> 20:03.360
have the big picture conversation about what is panpsychism, but given your kind of broad

20:03.360 --> 20:07.120
theory of consciousness, what's unique about humans, do you think?

20:07.120 --> 20:14.880
As a panpsychist, there is a great continuity between humans and the rest of the universe.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.200
There's nothing that special about human consciousness.

20:19.200 --> 20:24.080
It's just a highly evolved form of what exists throughout the universe.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.880
So we're very much continuous with the rest of the physical universe.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.040
What is unique about human beings?

20:31.040 --> 20:39.600
I suppose the capacity to reflect on our conscious experience, plan for the future.

20:41.280 --> 20:46.000
The capacity, I would say, to respond to reasons as well.

20:46.960 --> 20:52.800
I mean, animals in some sense have motivations, but when a human being makes a decision,

20:54.160 --> 20:58.800
they're responding to what philosophers call normative considerations.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.200
You know, if you're saying, should I take this job in the US?

21:02.080 --> 21:02.880
You weigh it up.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.720
You say, well, you know, I'll get more money.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.640
I'll have maybe a better quality of life.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.360
But if I stay in the UK, I'll be closer to family.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.920
And you weigh up these considerations.

21:13.680 --> 21:21.680
I'm not sure any non-human animals quite respond to considerations of value in that way.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.520
I mean, I might be reflecting here that I'm something of an objectivist about value.

21:25.520 --> 21:31.840
I think there are objective facts about what we have reason to do

21:31.840 --> 21:33.200
and what we have reason to believe.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.560
And humans have access to those facts.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.480
And humans have access to them and can respond to them.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.240
That's a controversial claim, you know.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.640
Many of my panpsychist brethren might not go for that.

21:42.640 --> 21:48.480
They would say the hamster, too, can look up to the stars and ponder theoretical physics.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.240
Maybe not, but I think it depends what you think about value.

21:52.240 --> 21:58.640
If you have a more humane picture of value, by which I mean relating to the philosopher

21:58.640 --> 22:02.960
David Hume, who said, reason is the slave of the passions.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.120
Really, we just have motivations.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.840
And what we have reason to do arises from our motivations.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.720
I'm not a humane.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.480
I think there are objective facts about what we have reason to do.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.120
And I think we have access to them.

22:17.120 --> 22:22.560
I don't think any non-human animal has access to objective

22:22.560 --> 22:25.920
facts about what they have reason to do, what they have reason to believe.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.200
They don't weigh up evidence.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.960
Reason is a slave of the passions.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
That was David Hume's view, yeah.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.920
I mean, yeah, do you want to know my problem with Hume's?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.200
I had a radical conversion.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.040
This might not be connected.

22:39.040 --> 22:42.080
It's not connected to panpsychism, but I had a radical conversion.

22:42.080 --> 22:46.000
I used to have a more humane view when I was a graduate student.

22:46.800 --> 22:51.680
But I was persuaded by some professors at the University of Reading where I was,

22:52.960 --> 23:01.760
if you have the humane view, you have to say any basic life goals are equal, equally valid.

23:03.120 --> 23:09.680
So for example, let's take someone whose basic goal in life is counting blades of grass, right?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.960
And crucially, they don't enjoy it, right?

23:12.960 --> 23:13.760
This is the crucial point.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.520
They get no pleasure from it.

23:15.520 --> 23:21.440
That's just their basic goal to spend their life counting as many blades of grass as possible.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.640
Not for some greater goal.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.000
That's just their basic goal.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.440
I want to say that that is objectively stupid.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.280
That is objectively pointless.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.320
I shouldn't say stupid, maybe.

23:32.320 --> 23:39.440
It's objectively pointless in a way that pursuing pleasure or pursuing someone else's

23:39.440 --> 23:43.040
pleasure or pursuing scientific inquiry is not pointless.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.040
As soon as you make that admission, you're not a follower of David Hume anymore.

23:47.040 --> 23:52.560
You think there are objective facts about what goals are worth pursuing.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.880
Is it possible to have a goal without pleasure?

23:56.880 --> 24:00.640
So this kind of idea that you disjoint the two.

24:02.560 --> 24:06.880
David Foster Wallace's idea of the key to life is to be unborable.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.760
Isn't it possible to discover the pleasure in everything in life?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.640
The counting of the blades of grass.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.440
Once you see the mastery, the skill of it, you can discover the pleasure.

24:19.440 --> 24:26.720
Therefore, I guess what I'm asking is why and when and how did you lose the romance

24:26.720 --> 24:27.360
in grad school?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.080
Is that what you're trying to say?

24:30.880 --> 24:36.560
I think it may or may not be true that it's possible to find pleasure in everything,

24:37.360 --> 24:43.040
but I think it's also true that people don't act solely for pleasure and they certainly

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
don't act solely for their own pleasure.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.880
People will suffer for things they think are worthwhile.

24:50.080 --> 24:57.280
I might suffer for some scientific cause for finding out a cure for the pandemic.

25:00.080 --> 25:04.160
In terms of my own pleasure, I might have less pleasure in doing that,

25:04.160 --> 25:05.440
but I think it's worthwhile.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.880
It's a worthwhile thing to do.

25:08.080 --> 25:14.720
I just don't think it's the case that everything we do is rooted in maximizing our own pleasure.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.880
I don't think that's even psychologically plausible.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.360
But pleasure, then that's a narrow kind of view of pleasure.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.880
That's like a short-term pleasure.

25:20.880 --> 25:27.600
We can see pleasure as a kind of ability to hear the music in the distance.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.040
It's like, yes, it's difficult now, it's suffering now,

25:31.680 --> 25:38.080
but there is some greater thing beyond the mountain that will be joy.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.360
Even if it's not in this life, the warriors will meet in Valhalla.

25:46.320 --> 25:50.240
The feeling that gives meaning and fulfillment to life

25:50.240 --> 25:55.040
is not necessarily grounded in pleasure of the counting of the grass.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.240
It's something else.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.200
I don't know.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.840
The struggle is a source of deep fulfillment.

26:03.200 --> 26:08.560
I think pleasure needs to be thought of as a little bit more broadly.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.400
It just gives you this sense.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.120
For a moment, it allows you to forget the terror of the fact that you're going to die.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.480
That's pleasure.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.960
That's the broader view of pleasure.

26:24.960 --> 26:32.640
That you get to play in the little illusion that all of this has deep meaning.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.400
That's pleasure.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.000
People sacrifice their lives.

26:40.640 --> 26:45.200
Atheists may sacrifice their lives for the sake of someone else

26:45.200 --> 26:47.360
or for the sake of something important enough.

26:48.320 --> 26:53.200
Clearly, in that case, they're not doing it for the sake of their own pleasure.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.640
That's a rather dramatic example, but there can be just trivial examples where

26:58.880 --> 27:03.680
I choose to be honest rather than lie about something.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.680
Can I lose out a bit and I have a bit less pleasure,

27:07.680 --> 27:10.160
but I thought it was worth doing the honest thing or something?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.640
Maybe you can use the word pleasure so broadly

27:14.640 --> 27:16.960
that you're just essentially meaning something worthwhile.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.440
But then I think the word pleasure maybe loses its meaning.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.600
What do you think about the blades of grass case?

27:25.600 --> 27:29.600
What do you think about someone who spends their life counting blades of grass and doesn't enjoy it?

27:30.880 --> 27:35.040
I personally think it's impossible, or maybe I'm not understanding

27:36.720 --> 27:40.080
the philosophical formulation, but I think it's impossible to have a goal

27:40.080 --> 27:41.440
and not draw pleasure from it.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.520
Make it worthwhile.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.480
Forget the word pleasure.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.240
I think the word goal loses meaning.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.120
If I say I'm going to count the number of pens on this table,

27:51.840 --> 27:57.040
if I'm actively involved in the task, I will find joy in it.

27:58.880 --> 28:07.120
I think there's a lot of meaning and joy to be discovered in the skill of a task,

28:07.120 --> 28:12.240
in mastering of a skill, and taking pride in doing it well.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.760
That's, I don't know what it is about the human mind,

28:15.760 --> 28:21.040
but there's some joy to be discovered in the mastery of a skill.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.800
I think it's just impossible to count blades of grass

28:24.800 --> 28:29.360
and not have the gyro dreams of sushi compelling,

28:29.360 --> 28:31.680
draws you into the mastery of the simple task.

28:35.680 --> 28:41.600
I suppose, I mean, in a way you might think it's just hard to imagine

28:41.600 --> 28:45.360
someone who would spend their lives doing that,

28:45.360 --> 28:50.800
but then maybe that's just because it's so evident that that is a pointless task.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.480
Whereas if we take this David Hume view seriously,

28:55.120 --> 28:58.480
it ought to be a totally possible life goal.

29:00.400 --> 29:05.840
I guess I just find it hard to shake the idea that some ways of,

29:07.360 --> 29:10.880
some life goals are more worthwhile than others.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.400
It doesn't mean that there's one single way you should lead your life,

29:14.400 --> 29:17.200
but pursuing knowledge, helping people,

29:18.960 --> 29:24.800
pursuing your own pleasure to an extent are worthwhile things to do in a way that,

29:24.800 --> 29:27.920
for example, I'm a little bit OCD.

29:27.920 --> 29:32.880
I still feel inclined to walk on cracks in the pavement or do it symmetrically.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.960
Like if I step on a crack with my left foot, I feel the need to do it with my right foot.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.720
And I think that's kind of pointless.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.440
It's something I feel the urge to do, but it's pointless.

29:43.440 --> 29:48.320
Whereas other things I choose to do, I think it's worth doing.

29:48.320 --> 29:53.520
And it's hard to make sense of metaphysically what could possibly ground that.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.880
How could we know about these facts?

29:54.880 --> 29:58.240
But that's the starting point for me.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.040
I don't know.

29:59.040 --> 30:03.600
I think you walking on the sidewalk in a way that's symmetrical

30:04.560 --> 30:06.960
brings order to the world.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.240
Like if you weren't doing that, the world might fall apart.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.320
It feels like that.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.960
I think there's meaning in that.

30:16.960 --> 30:23.600
Like you embracing the full experience of that,

30:23.600 --> 30:28.080
you living the richness of that as if it has meaning will give meaning to it.

30:28.080 --> 30:33.520
And then whatever genius comes of that as you as one little intelligent ant,

30:33.520 --> 30:35.680
will make a better life for everybody else.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.400
Perhaps I'm defending the blades of grass example

30:38.400 --> 30:41.200
because I can literally imagine myself enjoying this task

30:41.200 --> 30:44.960
as somebody who's OCD in a certain kind of way in quantitative.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.120
But now you're ruining the example because you imagine someone enjoying it.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.960
I imagine someone who doesn't enjoy it.

30:48.960 --> 30:53.280
We don't want a life that's just full of pleasure.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.920
Like we just sit there having a big sugar high all the time.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.640
We want a life where we do things that are worthwhile.

31:01.280 --> 31:06.560
If for something to be worthwhile just is for it to be a basic life goal,

31:07.200 --> 31:13.200
then that mode of reflection doesn't really make sense.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.600
We can't really think, did I do things worthwhile?

31:15.600 --> 31:20.720
On the David Hume type picture, all it is for something to be worthwhile

31:20.720 --> 31:23.680
is it was a basic goal of yours or derived from a basic goal.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.480
Yeah, I mean, I think goal and worthwhile aren't.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.960
I think goal is a boring word.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.640
I'm more sort of existentialist.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.360
Like, did you ride the roller coaster of life?

31:35.360 --> 31:40.320
Did you fully experience life that and in that sense,

31:40.320 --> 31:44.720
I mean, the blades of grass is something that could be deeply joyful.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.720
And that's in that way.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.680
I think suffering could be joyful in the full context of life.

31:49.680 --> 31:53.280
It's the roller coaster like without suffering, without struggle,

31:53.280 --> 31:56.800
without pain, without depression, with sadness.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.760
There's not the highs.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.720
I mean, that's a fucked up thing about life is that

32:02.640 --> 32:13.280
the lows really make the highs that much richer and deeper and like taste better, right?

32:13.280 --> 32:20.880
Like I tweeted this, I couldn't sleep and I was like late at night.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.400
And I know it's like an obvious statement,

32:25.360 --> 32:35.280
but like every love story eventually, you know, ends in loss in tragedy.

32:36.080 --> 32:43.920
So like this feeling of love at the end, there's always going to be tragedy,

32:43.920 --> 32:49.040
even if it's the most amazing lifelong love with another human being.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.920
One of you is going to die and I don't know which is worse,

32:54.720 --> 32:57.120
but both are not going to be pretty.

32:57.680 --> 33:03.920
And so that, the sense that it's finite, the sense that it's going to end in a low,

33:04.720 --> 33:12.000
that gives like richness to those kind of evenings when you realize this fucking thing ends.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.800
This thing ends.

33:13.680 --> 33:20.640
The feeling that it ends, that bad taste, that bad feeling that it ends

33:20.640 --> 33:25.600
gives meaning, gives joy, gives, I don't know, pleasure is this loaded word, but

33:26.640 --> 33:31.200
gives some kind of a deep pleasure to the experience when it's good.

33:33.520 --> 33:38.400
And that's the blades of grass, you know, they have that to me.

33:38.720 --> 33:45.520
But you're perhaps right that it's like reducing it to a set of goals or something like that,

33:46.240 --> 33:49.840
is kind of removing the magic of life.

33:49.840 --> 33:56.880
Because I think what makes counting the blades of grass joyful is, it's just because it's life.

33:58.240 --> 34:03.360
Okay, so it sounds like you reject the David Hume type picture anyway,

34:03.360 --> 34:07.840
because you're saying just because you have it as a goal, that's what it is to you.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.880
That's what it is to be worthwhile.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.400
But you're saying, no, it's because it's engaging with life, riding the roller coaster.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.040
So that does sound like in some sense, there are facts

34:17.920 --> 34:22.720
independent of our personal goal choices about what it means to live a good life.

34:22.720 --> 34:28.080
And I mean, coming back full circle to the start of this was what makes us different to animals.

34:28.080 --> 34:32.640
I don't think at the end of a hamster's life, it thinks, did I ride the roller coaster?

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
Did I really live life to the full?

34:34.640 --> 34:39.200
That is not a mode of reflection that's available to non-human animals.

34:40.720 --> 34:47.680
What do you think is the role of death in all of this? The fear of death.

34:47.680 --> 34:52.480
Does that interplay with consciousness? Does this self-reflection?

34:53.360 --> 35:00.080
Do you think there's some deep connection between this ability to contemplate

35:00.080 --> 35:06.720
the fact that our flame of consciousness eventually goes out?

35:08.320 --> 35:15.280
Yeah, I don't think unfortunately panpsychism helps particularly with life after death because

35:15.280 --> 35:23.280
for the panpsychist, there's nothing supernatural. There's nothing beyond the physical. All there is

35:23.280 --> 35:28.240
really is ultimately particles and fields. It's just that we think the ultimate nature

35:28.240 --> 35:38.160
of particles and fields is consciousness. But I guess when the matter in my brain

35:38.880 --> 35:43.840
ceases to be ordered in a way that sustains the particular kind of consciousness

35:45.200 --> 35:53.120
I enjoy in waking life, then in some sense I will cease to be. Although the final chapter

35:53.200 --> 36:00.080
of my book Galileo's Era is more experimental. The first four chapters are the cold-blooded

36:00.080 --> 36:05.280
case for the panpsychist view as the best solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
The last chapter is where you talk about meaning.

36:07.280 --> 36:11.200
Yeah, I talk about meaning, I talk about free will, and I talk about mystical experiences.

36:12.400 --> 36:18.960
I always want to emphasize that panpsychism is not necessarily connected to anything spiritual.

36:19.520 --> 36:24.800
A lot of people defending this view, like David Chalmers or Luke Roloff's,

36:24.800 --> 36:30.640
are just total atheist secularists. They don't believe in any kind of transcendent reality,

36:30.640 --> 36:36.160
they just believe in feelings, mundane consciousness, and think that needs explaining

36:36.160 --> 36:44.400
in our conventional scientific approach, can't cut it. But if for independent reasons you are

36:44.400 --> 36:51.120
motivated to some spiritual picture of reality, then maybe a panpsychist view is more consonant

36:51.120 --> 36:59.600
with that. So if you have a mystical experience where it seems to you in this experience that

36:59.600 --> 37:07.040
there is this higher form of consciousness at the root of all things, if you're a materialist,

37:07.040 --> 37:10.560
you've got to think that's a delusion. There's just something in your brain making you think

37:10.560 --> 37:17.360
that it's not real. But if you're a panpsychist and you already think the fundamental nature of

37:17.360 --> 37:25.360
reality is constituted of consciousness, it's not that much of a leap to think that this higher

37:25.360 --> 37:30.000
form of consciousness you seem to apprehend in the mystical experience is part of that underlying

37:30.000 --> 37:39.280
reality. In many different cultures, experienced meditators have claimed to have experiences

37:39.920 --> 37:47.520
in which it becomes apparent to them that there is an element of consciousness that is universal.

37:47.520 --> 37:53.680
So this is sometimes called universal consciousness. So on this view, your mind

37:53.680 --> 38:01.120
and my mind are not totally distinct. Each of our individual conscious minds is built

38:01.120 --> 38:06.080
upon the foundations of universal consciousness. And universal consciousness as it exists in me is

38:06.960 --> 38:10.800
one and the same thing as universal consciousness as it exists in you.

38:12.080 --> 38:20.560
So I've never had one of these experiences. But if one is a panpsychist, I think one is more open

38:20.560 --> 38:26.480
to that possibility. I don't see why it shouldn't be the case that that is part of the nature of

38:26.480 --> 38:31.680
consciousness and maybe something that is apparent in certain deep states of meditation. And so what

38:31.680 --> 38:38.800
I explore in the experimental final chapter of my book is that could allow for a kind of impersonal

38:39.680 --> 38:47.280
life after death. Because if that view is true, then even when the particular aspects of my

38:47.280 --> 38:54.400
conscious experience fall away, that element of universal consciousness at the core of my identity

38:54.400 --> 39:00.160
would continue to exist. So I'd sort of be, as it were, absorbed into universal consciousness.

39:00.560 --> 39:07.920
I mean, Buddhists and Hindu mystics try to meditate to get rid of all the bad karma

39:07.920 --> 39:15.200
to be absorbed into universal consciousness. It could be that if there's no karma,

39:15.200 --> 39:19.120
if there's no reverb, maybe everyone gets enlightened when they die. Maybe you just

39:19.840 --> 39:25.200
sink back into universal consciousness. So I also, coming back to morality,

39:25.200 --> 39:33.440
suggest this could provide some kind of basis for altruism or non-egotism. Because if you think

39:34.240 --> 39:41.200
egotism implicitly assumes that we are utterly distinct individuals, whereas on this view,

39:42.880 --> 39:46.240
we overlap to an extent that something at the core of our being is-

39:46.240 --> 39:48.720
Even in this life, we overlap.

39:48.720 --> 39:54.000
That would be this view that some experienced meditators claim becomes apparent to them,

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
that there is something at the core of my identity that is one and the same as

40:00.720 --> 40:04.960
the thing at the core of your identity, this universal consciousness.

40:05.600 --> 40:11.920
Yeah, there is something very, like you and I in this conversation, there's a few people

40:11.920 --> 40:20.160
listening to this, all of us are in a kind of single mind together. There's some small aspect

40:20.160 --> 40:27.840
of that, or maybe a big aspect about us humans. So certainly in a space of ideas, we kind of

40:29.440 --> 40:36.160
meld together for time at least in a conversation and kind of play with that idea. And then we're

40:36.160 --> 40:41.120
clearly all thinking, like if I say pink elephant, there's going to be a few people that are now

40:41.120 --> 40:46.800
visualizing a pink elephant. We're all thinking about that pink elephant together. We're all in

40:46.800 --> 40:55.280
the room together thinking about this pink elephant. We're rotating it in our minds together.

40:55.280 --> 41:02.080
What is that? Is there a different instantiation of that pink elephant in everybody's mind,

41:02.080 --> 41:06.240
or is it the same elephant and we have the same mind exploring that elephant?

41:06.240 --> 41:12.240
Now if we in our mind start petting that elephant, touching it, that experience that we're now

41:12.240 --> 41:18.400
thinking what that would feel like, is that all of us experiencing that together or is that separate?

41:18.400 --> 41:23.520
So there's some aspect of the togetherness that almost seems fundamental to civilization, to

41:23.520 --> 41:30.480
society. Hopefully that's not too strong, but to some of the fundamental properties of the human

41:30.480 --> 41:37.040
mind, it feels like the social aspect is really important. We call it social because we think of

41:37.040 --> 41:44.320
us as individual minds interacting, but if we're just like one collective mind with like fingertips

41:44.320 --> 41:50.400
that are like touching each other as it's trying to explore the elephant, but that could be just

41:50.400 --> 41:55.680
in the realm of ideas and intelligence and not in the realm of consciousness. And it's interesting

41:55.680 --> 42:01.200
to see maybe it is in the realm of consciousness. Yeah, so it's obviously certainly true in some

42:01.200 --> 42:07.680
sense that there are these phenomena that you're talking about of collective consciousness in some

42:07.680 --> 42:14.320
sense. I suppose the question is how ontologically serious do we want to be about those things? By

42:14.320 --> 42:20.800
which I mean, are they just a construction of out of our minds and the fact that we interact in the

42:22.080 --> 42:27.840
standardly scientifically accepted ways? Or is as someone like Rupert Sheldrake would think that

42:27.840 --> 42:33.840
there is some metaphysical reality, there are some fields beyond the scientifically understood

42:33.840 --> 42:39.920
ones that are somehow communicating this. I mean, the view I was describing was that this

42:39.920 --> 42:46.560
element we're supposed to have in common is some sort of pure impersonal consciousness or something

42:46.560 --> 42:50.640
rather than. So actually, I mean, an interesting figure is the Australian philosopher, Miriel

42:50.640 --> 42:58.960
Bahari, who defends a kind of mystical conceptual reality rooted in Advaita Vedanta mysticism.

42:59.680 --> 43:05.360
But like me, she's from this tradition of analytic philosophy. And so she defends this in this, you

43:05.360 --> 43:09.920
know, incredibly precise, rigorous way. She defends the idea that we should think of experienced

43:09.920 --> 43:19.040
meditators as providing expert testimony. So, you know, I think humans cause a causing climate

43:19.040 --> 43:24.160
breakdown. I have no idea of the science behind it, you know, but I trust the experts or, you know,

43:24.160 --> 43:29.200
that the universe is 14 billion years old. You know, most of our knowledge is based on expert

43:29.200 --> 43:34.160
testimony. And she thinks we should think of experienced meditators, these people who are

43:34.160 --> 43:39.520
telling us about this universal consciousness at the core of our being as a relevant kind of expert.

43:39.520 --> 43:44.320
And so she wants to defend, you know, the rational acceptability of this mystical

43:44.400 --> 43:49.280
conceptual reality. So it's what, you know, I think we shouldn't be ashamed, you know,

43:49.280 --> 43:56.240
we shouldn't be worried about dealing with certain views as long as it's done with rigor

43:56.240 --> 44:01.120
and seriousness. You know, I think sometimes terms like, I don't know, new age or something

44:01.120 --> 44:07.520
can function a bit like racist terms. You know, a racist term picks out a group of people, but then

44:07.520 --> 44:11.840
implies certain negative characteristics. So people use this term, you know, to pick out a

44:11.840 --> 44:17.920
certain set of views like mystical conceptual reality and, and imply it's kind of fluffy

44:17.920 --> 44:24.960
thinking or, but you know, you read Miri Al-Bahari, you read Luke Roloff's, this is serious, rigorous

44:24.960 --> 44:28.720
thought, whether you agree with it or not, obviously it's hugely controversial. And so,

44:28.720 --> 44:34.080
you know, the enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.000
But it's kind of very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of

44:40.960 --> 44:49.040
how we think science ought to look. And, and, you know, people talk about religion as a crutch,

44:49.040 --> 44:55.280
but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be

44:55.280 --> 45:02.640
gets into people's identity and their sense of themselves and their security. And make things

45:02.720 --> 45:11.680
hard. And even the word expert becomes a kind of crutch. I mean, you use the word expert,

45:12.640 --> 45:18.960
you have some kind of conception of what expertise means. Oftentimes that's, you know, connected with

45:18.960 --> 45:25.040
a degree, a particular prestigious university or something like that, or, or it's, it's, you know,

45:25.680 --> 45:31.360
expertise is a funny one. I've noticed that anybody sort of that claims they're an expert

45:31.360 --> 45:37.440
is usually not the expert. The biggest quote unquote expert that I've ever met are the ones

45:37.440 --> 45:44.480
that are truly humble. So the humility is a really good sign of somebody who's traveled the long road

45:44.480 --> 45:49.760
and been humbled by how little they know. So some of the best people in the world at whatever the

45:49.760 --> 45:55.680
thing they've spent their life doing are the ones that are ultimately humble in the face of it all.

45:55.760 --> 46:01.600
So like just being humble for how little we know, even if we travel a lifetime,

46:02.160 --> 46:08.640
I do like the idea. I mean, treating sort of like, what is it? Psychonauts, like an expert witness,

46:09.360 --> 46:16.320
you know, people who have traveled with the help of DMT to another place where they got some deep

46:16.320 --> 46:23.280
understanding of something and their insight is perhaps as valuable as the insight of somebody who

46:23.280 --> 46:30.160
ran rigorous psychological studies at Princeton University or something. Like those, those

46:30.160 --> 46:36.160
psychonauts, they have wisdom if it's done rigorously, which you can also do rigorously

46:36.160 --> 46:41.200
within the university and within the studies now with, with psilocybin and those kinds of things.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.680
Yeah, that's fascinating. I mean, I think still probably the best, one of the best

46:45.680 --> 46:52.320
works on mystical experience is the chapter in William James's varieties of religious experiences.

46:53.040 --> 46:58.560
And most of it is just a psychological study of trying to define the characteristics of mystical

46:58.560 --> 47:04.960
experience as a psychological type. But at the end, he considers the question, if you have a

47:04.960 --> 47:10.240
mystical experience, is it rational to trust it, to trust that it's telling you something about

47:10.240 --> 47:15.920
reality? And he makes an interesting argument. He says, if you say no, you're kind of applying

47:15.920 --> 47:22.000
a double standard because we all think it's okay to trust our normal sensory experiences,

47:23.040 --> 47:28.880
but we have no way of getting outside of ourselves to prove that our sensory experiences

47:28.880 --> 47:33.760
correspond to an external reality. We could be in the matrix. This could be a very vivid dream.

47:34.960 --> 47:43.280
You could say, oh, we do science, but a scientist only gets their data by experiencing the results

47:43.280 --> 47:47.120
of their experiments. And then the question arises again, how do you know that corresponds

47:47.120 --> 47:52.720
to a real world? So he thinks there's a sort of double standard in saying it's okay to trust

47:52.720 --> 47:57.680
our ordinary sensory experiences, but it's not okay for the person on DMT to trust those

47:57.680 --> 48:04.000
experiences. It's very philosophically difficult to say, why is it okay in the one case and not

48:04.000 --> 48:08.480
the other? So I think there's an interesting argument there, but I would like to just defend

48:08.480 --> 48:14.560
experts a little bit. I mean, I agree it's very difficult, but especially in an age, I guess,

48:14.560 --> 48:22.800
where there's so much information, I do think it's important to have some protection of

48:24.400 --> 48:29.920
sources of information, academic institutions that we can trust. And then that's difficult

48:29.920 --> 48:34.800
because of course there are non-academics who do know what they're talking about, but like if I'm

48:35.760 --> 48:41.360
interested in knowing about biology, you can't research everything. So I think we have to have

48:42.080 --> 48:49.600
some sense of who are the experts we can trust, the people who have spent a lot of time reading

48:49.600 --> 48:57.200
all the material that people have read, written, thinking about it, having their views torn apart

48:57.200 --> 49:01.760
by other people working in the field. I think that is very important and also to protect that from

49:01.760 --> 49:06.800
conflicts of interest. There is a so-called think tank in the UK called the Institute of Economic

49:06.800 --> 49:14.240
Affairs, who are always on the BBC as experts on economic questions and they do not declare

49:14.240 --> 49:21.360
who funds them. So we don't know who's paying the piper. I think you shouldn't be allowed

49:21.360 --> 49:26.080
to call yourself a think tank if you're not totally transparent about who's funding you.

49:27.040 --> 49:35.840
And this connects to panpsychism because I think the reason people worry about unorthodox ideas is

49:35.840 --> 49:40.000
because they worry about how do we know when we're just losing control or losing discipline.

49:40.000 --> 49:49.280
So I do think we need to somehow protect academic institutions as sources of information that we

49:49.280 --> 49:56.320
can trust. And in philosophy, there's not much consensus on everything, but you can at least know

49:57.280 --> 50:03.760
what people who have put the time in to read all the stuff, what they think about these issues.

50:03.760 --> 50:09.760
I think that is important. Push back on your pushback. Who are the experts on COVID?

50:10.800 --> 50:15.760
Oh dear, getting into dangerous territory now. Well, let me just speak to it because I am

50:15.760 --> 50:23.440
walking through that dangerous territory. I'm allergic to the word expert because in my

50:25.600 --> 50:35.200
simple mind, it kind of rhymes with ego. There's something about experts.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.880
If we allow too much to have a category expert and place certain people in them,

50:42.880 --> 50:49.440
those people sitting on the throne start to believe it and they start to communicate with

50:49.440 --> 51:01.200
that energy and the humility starts to dissipate. I think there is value in a lifelong mastery

51:02.720 --> 51:08.960
of a skill and the pursuit of knowledge within a very specific discipline. But the moment you

51:08.960 --> 51:16.240
have your name on an office, the moment you're an expert, I think you destroy the very aspect,

51:17.360 --> 51:25.280
the very value of that journey towards knowledge. So some of it probably just reduces to skillful

51:25.280 --> 51:32.240
communication. Communicate in a way that shows humility, that shows an open-mindedness,

51:32.800 --> 51:36.880
that shows an ability to really hear what a lot of people are saying.

51:37.440 --> 51:43.680
So in the case of COVID, what I've noticed, and this is probably true with panpsychism as well,

51:44.480 --> 51:52.000
is so-called experts, and they are extremely knowledgeable. Many of them are colleagues of

51:52.000 --> 52:00.240
mine. They dismiss what millions of people are saying on the internet without having looked

52:00.240 --> 52:06.960
into it. With empathy and rigor, honestly, understand what are the arguments being made.

52:06.960 --> 52:11.200
They say there's not enough time to explore all those things, there's so much stuff out there.

52:13.040 --> 52:18.320
I think that's intellectual laziness. If you don't have enough time, then don't speak so

52:18.320 --> 52:23.840
strongly with dismissal. Feel bad about it. Be apologetic about the fact that you don't have

52:23.840 --> 52:30.000
enough time to explore the evidence. For example, with the heat I got with Francis Collins,

52:30.480 --> 52:40.640
is that he said that the lab leak, he dismissed it, showing that he didn't really deeply explore

52:40.640 --> 52:48.240
all the huge amount of circumstantial evidence out there, the battles that are going on out there.

52:48.240 --> 52:56.240
There's a lot of people really tensely discussing this, and showing humility in the face of that

52:56.240 --> 53:02.080
battle of ideas, I think, is really important. I've just been very disappointed in so-called

53:02.080 --> 53:07.840
expertise in the space of science, in showing humility, in showing humanity and kindness and

53:07.840 --> 53:16.640
empathy towards other human beings. At the same time, obviously, I love Gerard Rooms of Sushi's

53:16.640 --> 53:26.000
lifelong pursuit of getting in computer science, Don Knuth. Some of my biggest heroes are people

53:26.960 --> 53:34.560
when nobody else cares. They stay on one topic for their whole life, and they just find the

53:34.560 --> 53:39.840
beautiful little things about it. There's puzzles they keep solving. And yes, sometimes a virus

53:39.840 --> 53:46.240
happens or something happens where that person, with their puzzles, becomes the center of the

53:46.240 --> 53:50.720
whole world, because that puzzle becomes all of a sudden really important. But still, there's

53:50.720 --> 53:55.920
responsibilities on them to show humility and to be open-minded to the fact that even if they

53:55.920 --> 54:02.320
spent their whole life doing it, even if their whole community is giving them awards and giving

54:02.320 --> 54:08.480
them citations and giving them all kinds of stuff where they're bowing down before them how smart

54:08.480 --> 54:15.280
they are, they still know nothing relative to all the stuff, the mysteries that are out there.

54:15.760 --> 54:20.320
Yeah. I don't know how much we're disagreeing. I mean, these are totally valid issues. And of

54:20.320 --> 54:26.640
course, expertise goes wrong in all sorts of ways. It's totally fallible. I suppose I would just say,

54:27.840 --> 54:35.440
what is the alternative? What do we just say? All information is equal. Because as a voter,

54:36.080 --> 54:43.520
I've got to decide who to vote for, and I've got to evaluate. And I can't look into

54:44.400 --> 54:55.040
all of the economics and all of the relevant science. Maybe it's like Churchill said about

54:55.040 --> 55:00.320
democracy, it's the worst system of government apart from all the rest. I think about panpsychisms

55:00.320 --> 55:05.520
as well. It's the worst theory of consciousness apart from all the rest. But I just think expertise,

55:05.520 --> 55:12.880
the peer review system, I think it's terrible in so many ways. Yes, people should show more humility,

55:12.880 --> 55:19.040
but I can't see a viable alternative. I think philosopher Bernard Williams had a really nice

55:19.040 --> 55:25.600
nuanced discussion of the problems of titles, but how they also function in a society,

55:26.960 --> 55:31.040
they do have some positive function. The very first time I lectured in philosophy,

55:32.800 --> 55:41.520
before I got a professorship, was teaching at a continuing education college. So,

55:41.520 --> 55:49.280
it's kind of for retired people who want to learn some more things. And I just totally pitched it

55:49.280 --> 55:56.240
too high. And Gait talked about Bernard Williams on titles and hierarchies. And these kind of

55:56.240 --> 56:01.920
people in their 70s and 80s who just instantly started interrupting saying, what is philosophy?

56:01.920 --> 56:08.000
And it was a disaster. And I just remember in the break, an elderly lady came up and said,

56:08.000 --> 56:16.000
I've decided to take Egyptology instead. But that was my introduction to teaching. Anyway,

56:16.000 --> 56:24.160
but titles and accomplishments is a nice starting point, but doesn't buy you the whole thing. So,

56:25.600 --> 56:31.600
you don't get to just say, this is true because I'm an expert. You still have to convince people.

56:31.600 --> 56:38.080
One of the things I really like is I practice martial arts. And for people who don't know,

56:38.880 --> 56:43.040
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is one of them. And you sometimes wear these pajamas,

56:43.600 --> 56:49.200
pajama looking things, and you wear a belt. So, I happen to be a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

56:49.200 --> 56:55.680
And I also train in what's called Nogi, so you don't wear the pajamas. And when you don't wear

56:55.680 --> 57:01.360
the pajamas, nobody knows what rank you are. Nobody knows if you're a black belt or a white belt,

57:01.680 --> 57:07.200
if you're a complete beginner or not. And when you wear the pajamas, called the gi,

57:08.160 --> 57:13.440
you wear the rank. And people treat you very differently. When they see my black belt,

57:13.440 --> 57:20.720
they treat me differently. They kind of defer to my expertise. If they're kicking my ass,

57:21.360 --> 57:30.720
that's probably because I am working on something new or maybe I'm letting them win.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.600
But when there's no belts, and it doesn't matter if I've been doing this for 15 years,

57:35.600 --> 57:42.160
it doesn't matter. None of it matters. What matters is the raw interaction of just trying

57:42.160 --> 57:48.000
to kick each other's ass and seeing like, what is this chess game, like a human chess?

57:49.280 --> 57:54.720
Who, what are the ideas that we're playing with? And I think there's a dance there. Yes,

57:54.720 --> 58:00.800
it's valuable to know a person as a black belt when you take consideration of the advice of

58:00.800 --> 58:04.320
different people, me versus somebody who's only practiced for like a couple of days.

58:04.960 --> 58:12.640
But at the same time, the raw practice of ideas that is combat and the raw practice of

58:12.640 --> 58:20.480
exchange of ideas that is science needs to often throw away expertise. And in communicating,

58:20.640 --> 58:24.400
there's a other thing to science and expertise, which is leadership.

58:25.040 --> 58:31.360
It's not just, so the scientific method in the review process is this rigorous battle of ideas

58:32.000 --> 58:38.240
between scientists, but there's also a stepping up and inspiring the world and communicating

58:38.240 --> 58:46.640
ideas to the world. And that skill of communication, I suppose that's my biggest criticism of so-called

58:46.720 --> 58:49.920
experts in science. Is there just shitty communicators?

58:49.920 --> 58:54.560
Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I can tell you, I get very frustrated with philosophers

58:55.360 --> 59:02.320
not reaching out more. I mean, I think it might be partly that we're trained to get watertight

59:02.320 --> 59:08.240
arguments, you know, respond to all objections. And as you do that, eventually it gets more

59:08.240 --> 59:16.640
complicated and the jargon comes in. But then if, so to write a more accessible book or article,

59:16.640 --> 59:20.880
you have to loosen the arguments a bit. And then we worry that other philosophers will think,

59:20.880 --> 59:25.680
oh, that's a really crap argument. So I mean, the way I did it, I wrote my academic book first,

59:25.680 --> 59:31.120
just as a fundamental reality. And then a more accessible book, Galileo's Error, where the

59:31.120 --> 59:35.920
arguments, you know, not as rigorously worked out. So then I can say the proper arguments,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.240
you know, the further arguments that, but I get-

59:38.240 --> 59:43.440
That's brilliantly done, by the way. Like that's such a, so for people who don't know,

59:43.440 --> 59:48.320
you first wrote Consciousness and Fundamental Reality. So that's the academic book, also very

59:48.320 --> 59:54.960
good. I flew through it last night, bought it. And then obviously the popular book is Galileo's Error,

59:54.960 --> 59:59.680
Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness. That's kind of the right way to do it.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.160
Yeah.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.320
To show that you're legit to your community, to the world by doing the book that's nobody going

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:10.640
to read, and then doing a popular book that everybody's going to read.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.280
That's cool.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.360
Yeah. Well, I try now, every time I write an academic article, I try to write a more accessible

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.320
version. I mean, the thing I've been working on recently, just because there's this argument,

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:31.520
so there's a certain argument from the cosmological fine tuning of the laws of physics for life

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:38.800
to the multiverse that's quite popular, physicists like Max Tegmark. There's an

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.760
argument in philosophy journals that there's a fallacious line of reasoning going on there,

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.200
from the fine tuning to the multiverse. Now, that argument is from 20, 30 years ago,

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:59.120
and it's discussed in academic philosophy. Nobody knows about it. And there is huge interest in this

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.400
fine tuning stuff. Scientists wanting to argue for the multiverse, theists wanting to say this

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.680
is evidence for God, and nobody knows about this argument, which tries to show that it's fallacious

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.400
reasoning to go from the fine tuning to the multiverse. So I wrote a piece for Scientific

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:22.160
American explaining this argument to a more general audience. It just really irritates me that

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.440
it's just buried in these technical journal articles and nobody knows about it.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:35.600
But just final thing on that, I don't disagree with anything you said, and that's kind of

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.840
really beautiful, that martial arts example and thinking how that could be analogous. But I think

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:52.000
it's very rare to find a good philosopher who hasn't given a talk to other philosophers

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.720
and had objections raised. I was going to say have it torn apart, but that's maybe

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.440
thinking of it in a slightly the wrong way, but have the best objections raised to it.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:11.120
That's why that is an important formative process that you go through as an academic,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.760
that the greatest minds starting a philosophy degree, for example, won't have gone through,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.680
and probably, except in very rare cases, just won't have that the skills required.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:33.440
But part of it is just fun to disagree and dance with. I think to elaborate on what you're saying

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.920
in agreement, not just gone through that, but continue to go through that.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.400
I would say the biggest problem with quote unquote expertise is that there's a certain point

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.800
where you get, because it sucks. Martial arts is a good example of that. It sucks to get your ass

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:59.520
kicked. There's a temptation. I train. You're getting older too, but also there's killers out

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.400
there in both the space of martial arts and the space of science. I think that once you become

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.000
a professor, more and more senior and more and more respected, I don't know if you get your ass

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.480
kicked in the space of ideas as often. I don't know if you allow yourself to truly expose yourself.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:27.840
If you do, that's a great sign of a humble, brilliant mind is constantly exposing yourself

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.000
to that. I think you do because I think there's graduate students who want to find the objection

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:43.440
to write their paper or make their mark. I think everyone still gives talks or should give talks

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.800
and people are wanting to work out if there are any weaknesses to your position.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.560
I think that generally works out. There is also who do you give the talks to?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:07.040
I mean within communities, there's a little cluster of people that argue and bicker,

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:14.240
but what are they arguing about? They take a bunch of stuff, a bunch of basic assumptions

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:21.040
as agreement and they heatedly argue about certain ideas. The question is how open are

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.680
that? That's actually kind of like fun. That's like, no offense, sorry, we're sticking on this

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.880
martial arts thing. It's like people who practice Aikido or certain martial arts that don't truly

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:38.960
test themselves in the cage, in combat. It's fun to argue about certain things when you're

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.720
in your own community, but you don't test those ideas in the full context of science, in the full

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.720
seriousness, the rigor of sometimes the real world. One of my favorite fields is psychology.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.320
There's often places within psychology where you're kind of doing these studies and arguing

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:08.880
about stuff that's done in the lab. The arguments are almost disjoint from real human behavior.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.360
Because it's so much easier to study human behavior in the lab, you just kind of stay there

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.920
and that's where the arguments are. And so vision science is a good example like studying eye

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.680
movement and how we perceive the world and all that kind of stuff. It's so much easier to study

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.280
in a lab that we don't consider, we say that's going to be what the science of vision is going

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.520
to be like and we don't consider the science of vision in the actual real world, the engineering

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.480
of vision, I don't know. And so I think that's where exposing yourself to out of the box ideas.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.320
Yeah. That's the most painful, that's the most important. I mean, group think can be a terrible

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:48.640
thing in philosophy as well, but because you're not to the same extent beholden to evidence and

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.200
refutation from the evidence that you are in the sciences, it's a more subtle process of evaluation

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.680
and so more susceptible, I think, to group think. I agree, it's a danger.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.200
We've talked about it a million times, but let's try to sort of do that old

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.440
basic terminology definitions. What is panpsychism? What are the different ways you can

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.400
try to think about, to define panpsychism, maybe in contrast to

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.040
naturalistic dualism and materialism and other kinds of views of consciousness?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:34.560
Yeah. So you've basically laid out the different options. So I guess probably still the dominant

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:41.120
view is materialism, that roughly that we can explain consciousness in the terms of physical

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:47.040
science, wholly explain it, just in terms of the electrochemical signaling in the brain.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:55.680
Dualism, the polar opposite view, that consciousness is non-physical outside of

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.000
the physical workings of the body and the brain, although closely connected.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.520
When I studied philosophy, we were taught, basically they were the two options you had

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.240
to choose, right? Either you thought you were dualist and you thought it was separate from

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.720
the physical, or you thought it was just electrochemical signaling. And yeah,

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.720
I became very disillusioned because I think there are big problems with both of these options.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.000
So I think the attraction to panpsychism is it's kind of a middle way. It agrees with the

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.560
materialist that there's just the physical world. Ultimately, there's just particles and fields.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:37.360
But the panpsychist thinks there's more to the physical than what physical science reveals,

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.680
and that the ultimate nature of the physical world is constituted of consciousness.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:49.200
So consciousness is not outside of the physical, as the dualist thinks, it's embedded in,

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.280
underlies the kind of description of the world we get from physics.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.000
What are the problems of materialism and dualism?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:08.640
Starting with materialism, it's a huge debate, but I think that the core of it is that

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.600
physical science works with a purely quantitative description of the physical world,

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:20.640
whereas consciousness essentially involves qualities. If you think about the smell of

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.720
coffee or the taste of mint or the deep red you experience as you watch a sunset,

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.840
I think these qualities can't be captured in the purely quantitative language of physical science.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:40.160
As long as your description of the brain is framed in the purely quantitative language of

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.440
neuroscience, you'll just leave out these qualities and hence really leave out consciousness itself.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.040
And then dualism?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.280
I've actually changed my mind a little bit on this since I wrote the book.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.400
So I argued in the book that we have pretty good experimental grounds for doubting dualism.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:09.120
Roughly the idea was if dualism were true, if there was say an immaterial mind impacting on

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.320
the brain every second of waking life, that this would really show up in neuroscience. There'd be

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:20.400
all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical explanation. It would be like a

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:29.680
poltergeist was playing with the brain. The fact that we don't find that is a strong and

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:35.280
ever-growing inductive argument against dualism. But actually, the more I talk to neuroscientists

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.560
and read neuroscience, and we have at Durham, my university, an interdisciplinary consciousness

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.520
group, I don't think we know enough about the brain, about the workings of the brain to make

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:55.520
that argument. I think we know a lot about the basic chemistry, how neurons fire, neurotransmitters,

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:01.040
action potentials, things like that. We know a fair bit about large-scale functions of the brain,

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:08.400
what different bits of the brain do. But what we're almost clueless on is how those large-scale

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:15.760
functions are realized at the cellular level, how it works. People get quite excited about brain

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:23.760
scans, but it's very low resolution. Every pixel on a brain scan corresponds to 5.5 million neurons,

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:31.200
and we're only 70% of the way through constructing a connectome for the maggot brain,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.640
which has 10,000 or 100,000 neurons, but the brain has 86 billion neurons.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.480
I think we'd have to know a lot more about how the brain works, how these functions are realized

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.080
before we could assess whether the dynamics of the brain can be completely

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:59.680
explicated in terms of underlying chemistry or physics. We'd have to do more engineering

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.040
before we could figure that out. There are people with other proposals. Someone I got

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:11.600
to know, Martin Picard at Columbia University, who has the psychobiology mitochondrial lab there

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.320
and is experimentally exploring the hypothesis that mitochondria in the brain should be under

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.360
social networks, perhaps as an alternative to reducing it to underlying chemistry and physics.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.680
It is ultimately an empirical question whether dualism is true. I'm less convinced that we know

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.280
the answer to that question at this stage. I think still, as scientists and philosophers,

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.240
we want to try and find the simplest, most parsimonious theory of reality.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:51.120
Dualism is still a pretty inelegant, unparsimonious theory. Reality is divided up into

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.320
the purely physical properties and these consciousness properties, and they're radically

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.400
different kinds of things, whereas the panpsychist offers a much more simple,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.440
unified picture of reality. I think it's still the view to be preferred,

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.880
to put it very simply, why believe in two kinds of things when you can just get away with one?

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.200
Materialism is also very simple, but you're saying it doesn't explain

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.320
something that seems pretty important.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.200
Science is about trying to find the simplest theory that accounts for the data.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.760
I don't think materialism can account for the data. Maybe dualism can account for the data,

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.720
but panpsychism is simpler. It can account for the data and it's simpler.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.720
What is panpsychism?

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360
In its broadest definition, it's the view that

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.440
consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.760
Like a law of physics, what should we be imagining? What do you think the different

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.400
flavors of how that actually takes shape in the context of what we know about physics and science

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.040
and the universe? In the simplest form of it, the fundamental building blocks of reality,

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:07.600
perhaps electrons and quarks, have incredibly simple forms of experience and the very complex

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:14.560
experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these very simple

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.680
forms of experience at the level of basic physics. But maybe the crucial bit about

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:28.000
the kind of panpsychism I defend, what it does is it takes the standard approach to the problem

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.680
of consciousness and turns it on its head. The standard approach is to think,

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.480
we start with matter and we think, how do we get consciousness out of matter? I don't think that

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.720
problem can be solved. For reasons I've kind of hinted at, we could maybe go into more detail.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:52.000
But the panpsychist does it the other way around. They start with consciousness and try to get matter

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.920
out of consciousness. So the idea is basically, at the fundamental level of reality, there are just

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:08.080
networks of very simple conscious entities. But these conscious entities, because they have very

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.560
simple kinds of experience, they behave in predictable ways. Through their interactions,

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.600
they realize certain mathematical structures. Then the idea is those mathematical structures

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:25.200
just are the structures identified by physics. So when we think about these simple conscious

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.480
entities, in terms of the mathematical structures they realize, we call them particles, we call them

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:38.400
fields, we call their properties mass, spin and charge. But really, there's just these very

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.520
simple conscious entities and their experiences. So in this way, we get physics out of consciousness.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.800
I don't think you can get consciousness out of physics, but I think it's pretty easy to get

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.760
physics out of consciousness. Well, I'm a little confused by why

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:02.320
you need to get physics out of consciousness. To me, it sounds like panpsychism unites

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:11.040
consciousness and physics. Physics is the mathematical science of describing everything.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.240
So physics should be able to describe consciousness. Panpsychism, in my understanding,

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:23.280
proposes that physics doesn't currently do so, but can in the future. It seems like

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.640
consciousness... You have Stephen Wolfram, all these people who are trying to develop

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:37.440
theories of everything, mathematical frameworks within which to describe how we get all the

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.720
reality that we perceive around us. To me, there's no reason why that kind of framework

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:52.400
cannot also include some accurate, precise description of whatever simple consciousness

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:00.080
characteristics are present there at the lowest level, if panpsychist theories have truth to them.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.520
So to me, it is physics. You said physics emerges, by which you mean the basic four

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.760
laws of physics that, as we currently know them, the standard model, quantum mechanics,

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:15.760
general relativity, that emerges from the base consciousness layer. That's what you mean.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.360
Yeah. So maybe the way I phrased it made it sound like these things are more

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:26.800
separate than they are. What I was trying to address was a common misunderstanding of

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:34.400
panpsychism, that it's a sort of dualistic theory, that the idea is that particles have

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.360
their physical properties like mass, spin, and charge, and these other funny consciousness

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.040
properties. So the physicist Sabine Hossenfelder had a blog post critiquing panpsychism maybe a

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.800
couple of years ago now that got a fair bit of traction, and she was interpreting panpsychism

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.000
in this way, and then her thought was, well, look, if particles had these funny consciousness

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.640
properties, then it would show up in our physics, like the standard model of particle physics would

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.200
make false predictions because its predictions are based wholly on the physical properties.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.440
If there were also these consciousness properties, we'd get different predictions.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:14.160
But that's a misunderstanding of the view. The view is not that there are two kinds of property,

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:20.480
that mass, spin, and charge are forms of consciousness. How do we make sense of that?

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:26.800
Because actually, when you look at what physics tells us, it's really just telling us about

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:32.640
behavior, about what stuff does. I sometimes put it by saying doing physics is like playing chess

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.320
when you don't care what the pieces are made of, you're just interested in what moves you can make.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:43.840
So physics tells us what mass, spin, and charge do, but it doesn't tell us what they are.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.000
The experience of mass.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.480
So the idea is, yeah, mass in its nature is a very simple form of consciousness. So yeah,

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.840
physics in a sense is complete, I think, because it tells us what everything at the fundamental

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:05.760
level does. It describes its causal capacities. But for the panpsychist at least, physics doesn't

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.400
tell us what matter is. It tells us what it does, but not what it is.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.800
To push back on the thing I think she's criticizing, is it also possible, so I understand

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.400
what you're saying, but is it also possible that particles have another property like consciousness?

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.000
I don't understand the criticism we would be able to detect it in our experiments. Well,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.080
no, if you're not looking for it. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that are orthogonal.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.560
Like, if you're not looking for this stuff, you're not going to detect it. Because

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:45.040
like all of our basic empirical science through its recent history, and yes, the history of science

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:53.840
is quite recent, has been very kind of focused on billiard balls colliding. And from that,

01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.400
understanding how gravity works. But like, we just haven't integrated other possibilities into this.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.560
I don't think there will be conflicting whether you are observing consciousness or not,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.240
or exploring some of these ideas. I don't think that affects the rest of the physics,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.200
the mass, the energy, the all the different kind of like the hierarchy of different particles and

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:24.560
so on how they interact. I don't think it feels like consciousness is something orthogonal,

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.280
like very, very much distinct. It's the quantitative versus the qualitative. There's

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.840
something quite distinct that we're just almost like another dimension that we're

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.640
just completely ignoring. There might be a way of responding to Sabina to say, well,

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.720
that there could be properties of particles that don't show up in the specific circumstances in

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.840
which physicists investigate particles. My colleague, philosopher of science, Nancy Cartwright,

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:57.120
has got this book, How the Laws of Physics Lie, where she says, physicists explore things in very

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:03.280
specific circumstances and then in an unwarranted way, generalize that. But I mean, I guess I was

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.640
thinking Sabina's criticism actually just misses the mark in a more basic way. Her point is,

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.880
we shouldn't think there are any more properties to particles other than those, the standard model

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.320
attributes to them. Panpsychus would say, yeah, sure, there aren't. There are just the properties,

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.880
the physical properties like mass, spin and charge that the standard model attributes them. It's just

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:28.480
that we have a different philosophical view as to the nature of the property.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.560
Those properties, the turtles, they're sitting on top of another turtle and that big turtle is

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:39.200
consciousness. That's what you're saying. But I'm just saying, it's possible that's true. It's

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.640
possible also that consciousness is just another turtle playing with the others. It's just not

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.920
interacting in the ways that we've been observing. In fact, to me, that's more compelling because

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.640
then that's going to be, well, no, I think both are very compelling, but

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:02.320
it feels like it's more within the reach of empirical validation if it's yet another property

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:09.440
of particles that we're just not observing. If it's like the thing from which matter and energy and

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:21.520
physics emerges, it makes it that much more difficult to investigate how you get from

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:29.040
that base layer of consciousness to the wonderful little spark of consciousness,

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:34.720
complexity and beauty that is the human being. I don't know if you're necessarily trying to

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:41.680
get there, but one of the beautiful things to get at with panpsychism or with a solid theory

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:48.720
of consciousness is to answer the question, how do you engineer the thing? How do you get from

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:56.240
nothing vacuum in the lab? If there is that consciousness base layer, how do you start

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.720
engineering organisms that have consciousness in them? Or the reverse of that describing how

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:10.800
does consciousness emerge in the human being? From conception, from a stem cell to the whole

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:16.160
full neurobiology that builds from that, how do you get this full rich experience of consciousness

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:25.120
that humans have? It feels like that's the dream. And if consciousness is just another player in

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.400
the game of physics, it feels more amenable to our scientific understanding of it.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.160
That's interesting. I mean, I guess it's supposed to be a kind of identity claim here that physics

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:45.360
tells us what matter does, consciousness is what matter is. So matter is sort of what consciousness

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.680
does. So at the bottom level, there is just consciousness and conscious things. There are

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:57.280
just these simple things with their experiences and that is their total nature. So in that sense,

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:06.160
it's not another player. It's just all there is really. And then in physics, we describe that

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.760
at a certain level of abstraction. We capture what Bertrand Russell, who was the inspiration

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:17.440
for a lot of this, calls the causal skeleton of the world. So physics is just interested in the

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.000
causal skeleton of the world. It's not interested in the flesh and blood, although that's maybe

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:31.040
suggesting separation again, too much. All metaphors fail in the end. But yeah, you're

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:37.520
totally right. Ultimately, what we want to explain is how our consciousness and the consciousness of

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:45.200
other animals comes out of this. If we can't do that, then it's game over. But I think it maybe

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.800
makes more sense on the identity claim that if matter at the fundamental level just is forms

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:56.320
of consciousness, then we can perhaps make sense of how those simple forms of consciousness in some

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:01.520
way combine in some way to make the consciousness we know and love. That's the dream. Yeah. So

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.840
I guess the question is, so the reason you can describe, like the reason you have material

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:19.200
engineering, material science is because you have from physics to chemistry, like you keep going up

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:28.880
and up in levels of complexity in order to describe objects that we have in our human world.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.760
And it would be nice to do the same thing for consciousness, to come up with the chemistry of

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:43.360
consciousness. Like how do the different particles interact to create greater complexity? So you can

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.360
do this kind of thing for life. Like what is life? Like living organisms? At which point do

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:57.680
living organisms become living? How do you know if I give you a thing that that thing is living?

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.360
There's a lot of people working on this kind of idea and some of that has to do with the

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.200
levels of complexity and so on. It'd be nice to know like measuring different degrees of

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:16.000
consciousness as you get into a bigger, more and more complex objects. And that's what chemistry,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.120
bigger and bigger conscious molecules, and to see how that leads to organisms. And then organisms

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.000
start to collaborate together like they do inside our human body to create the full human body. To

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.840
do those kinds of experiments would be, it seems like that would be kind of a goal. That's what I

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.360
mean by player in a game of physics, as opposed to like the base layer. If it's just the base layer,

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.760
it becomes harder to track it as you get from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:54.800
Yeah. In every case, apart from consciousness, I would say what we're interested in is behavior.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.080
We're interested in explaining behavioral functions. So at the level of fundamental

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.920
physics, we're interested in capturing the equations that describe their behavior there.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.680
And when we get to higher levels, we're interested in explicating the behavior,

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:15.920
perhaps in terms of behavior at simpler levels. And with life as well, that's what we're interested

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.960
in, the various observable functions of life, explaining them in terms of more simple mechanisms.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.560
But in the case of consciousness, I don't think that's what we're doing, or at least not

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:35.040
all that we're doing. In the case of consciousness, there are these subjective qualities

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:42.240
that we're immediately aware of, the redness of a red experience, the itchiness of an itch.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.480
And we're trying to account for them. We're trying to bring them into our theory of reality.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.080
And postulating some mechanism does not deal with that. So I think we've got to realize

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.600
dealing with consciousness is a radically different explanatory task from other tasks of science.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:03.360
Other tasks of science, we're trying to explain behavior in terms of simpler forms of behavior.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.040
In the case of consciousness, we're trying to explain these invisible subjective qualities

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.400
that you can't see from the outside, but that you're immediately aware of. The reason materialism

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.280
perhaps continues to dominate is people think, look at the success of science, it's incredible.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.080
It's explained all this, surely it's going to explain consciousness. But I think we have

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.000
to appreciate there's a radically different explanatory task here.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.640
The neuroscientist, Anil Seth, who I've had lots of intense but friendly discussions with,

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:42.240
wants to compare consciousness to life. But I think there's this radical difference that

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:49.760
in the case of life, again, we come back to public observation, all of the publicly observable data

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:55.920
were basically trying to explain complex behavior. And the way you do that is identify

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:03.200
mechanisms, simpler mechanisms that explicate that behavior. That's the task in physics, chemistry,

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.160
neurobiology. But in the case of consciousness, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:15.040
to account for these subjective qualities and you postulate a mechanism that might explain

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:23.520
behavior, but it doesn't explain the redness of a red experience. But still, ultimately the hope is

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.280
that we will have some kind of hierarchical story. We take the causal dynamics of physics,

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:36.800
we hypothesize that that's filled out with certain forms of consciousness, and then at

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:44.240
higher levels we get more complex causal dynamics filled out by more complex forms of consciousness.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.400
And ultimately we get to us, hopefully. So yeah, so there's still a sort of hierarchical

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.840
explanatory brain work there. So you kind of mentioned the hierarchy of consciousness.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.880
Do you think it's possible within the panpsychist framework to measure

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.600
consciousness, or put another way, are some things more conscious than others

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.040
in the panpsychist view?

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:22.960
It's a difficult question. I mean, I do see consciousness as a dealing with consciousness,

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:29.760
an interdisciplinary task between something more experimental, which is to do with the ongoing

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.840
project of trying to work out what people call the neural correlates of consciousness,

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:42.640
what kinds of physical brain activity correspond to conscious experience. That's one part of it,

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:51.520
but I think essentially there's also a theoretical question of more the why question. Why do those

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:57.360
kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of conscious experience? I don't think you

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.400
can answer that. Because consciousness is not publicly observable, I don't think you can answer

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:08.640
that why question with an experiment. But they have to go hand in hand. And I mean,

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:14.960
one of the theories I'm attracted to is the integrated information theory, according to

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:20.960
which we find consciousness at the level at which there is most integrated information,

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:27.280
and they try to give a mathematically precise definition of that. So on that view, probably

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.000
this cup of tea isn't conscious, because there's probably more integrated information in the

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:37.440
molecules making up the tea than there is in the liquid as a whole. But in the brain,

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.560
what is distinctive about the brain is that there's a huge amount of integrated, there's

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.160
more integrated information in the system than there is in individual neurons. So that's why they

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.920
claim that that's the basis of consciousness at the macro level. Now they, so I don't, I mean,

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:03.200
I like some features of this theory, but they do talk about degrees of consciousness. They do want

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:10.800
to say there is gradations. I'm not sure conceptually I can kind of make sense of that. I mean,

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.680
there are things to do with consciousness that are graded like complexity or

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:26.800
levels of information, but I'm not sure whether experience itself admits of degree. I sort of

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:32.240
think something either has experience or it doesn't. It might have very simple experience,

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:39.520
it might have very complex experience, but experience itself, I don't think it admits of

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:46.000
degree in that sense. It's not more experience, less experience. I sort of find that conceptually

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.280
hard to make sense of, but I'm kind of open-minded on it.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.640
So when we have a lot high resolution of sensory information,

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:07.120
don't you think that's correlated to the richness of the experience? So doesn't more information

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.640
provide a richer experience or is that again, thinking quantitatively and not thinking about

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:18.320
the subjective experience? Like you can experience a lot with very little sensory information,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:25.920
perhaps. Do you think those are connected? Yeah, yeah. So there are features,

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:32.320
characteristics here we can grade the complexity of the experience.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:42.720
And on the integrated information theory, they correlate that in terms of mathematically

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:48.000
identifiable structure with integrated information. So roughly, it's a quite unusual notion of

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.240
information. It's perhaps not the standard way one thinks about information. It's to do with

01:32:54.240 --> 01:33:01.600
constraining past and future possibilities of the system. So the idea is in the retina of the eye,

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:07.600
there's a huge amount of possible states the retina of my eye could be in at the next moment,

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:14.080
depending on what light goes into it. Whereas the possible next states of the brain are much

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:20.160
more constrained. Obviously, it responds to the environment, but it heavily constrains

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:27.040
its past and future states. And so that's the idea of information they have. And then

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:36.800
the second idea is how much that information is dependent on integration. So in a computer where

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.680
you have transistors, you take out a few transistors, you might not lose that much

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.640
information. It's not dependent on interconnections. Whereas you take a tiny bit of the brain out, you

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.240
lose a lot of information because the way it stores information is dependent on the

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:59.360
interconnections of the system. So yeah, so that's one proposal for how to measure one

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:06.800
gradable characteristic, which might correspond to some gradable characteristic in qualitative

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.680
consciousness. And maybe I'm being very pedantic, which is, you know, philosophers, professional

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:19.360
pedants. I just sort of don't think that is a quantity of experience, is a quantity of

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:26.000
the structure of experience maybe, but I just find it hard to make sense of the idea of how

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.080
much experience do you have? I've got, you know, five units of experience. I've got one unit of

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:38.880
experience. I don't know, I find that a bit hard to make sense. But maybe I'm being just pedantic.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:46.160
I think just saying the word experience is difficult to think about. Let's talk about

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.880
suffering. Let's talk about a particular experience. So let's talk about me and a hamster.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.920
I just think that no offense to the hamster. Probably no hamsters are listening. So

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.560
now you're offending hamsters too. Maybe there's a hamster that's just pissed off.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:12.320
There's probably like somebody on a speaker right now, like listening to this podcast

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:18.160
and they probably have a hamster or a guinea pig and that hamster is listening. It just doesn't

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:25.680
know the English language or any kind of human interpretable linguistic capabilities to tell you

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:34.560
to fuck off. It understands exactly what's being talked about and can see through us. Anyway,

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.000
it just feels like a hamster has less capacity to suffer than me.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:50.480
And maybe a cockroach or an insect or maybe a bacteria has less capacity to suffer

01:35:51.440 --> 01:36:00.240
than me. But is that maybe that's me deluding myself as to the complexity of my conscious

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:07.600
experience? Maybe there is some sense in which I can suffer more,

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.080
but to reduce it to something quantifiable is impossible.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.400
Yeah, I guess I definitely think there's kinds of suffering that

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:26.480
you have the joy of being possible for you that aren't available to a hamster. I don't think

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:34.400
that. Well, can a hamster suffer heartbreak? I don't know. Can a cockroach suffer heartbreak?

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:43.360
There's kinds of fear of your own death, concern about whether there's a purpose to existence.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:50.640
These are forms of suffering that aren't available to most non-human animals.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:58.160
Whether there's an overall scale that we could put physical and emotional suffering on

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:04.320
and identify where you are on that scale, I'm not so sure.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:13.040
So it's like humans have a much bigger menu of experiences, much bigger selection in the-

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.080
In one sense at least.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.520
So there's like a page that's suffering. So it's this menu of experiences. You know,

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.080
like you have the omelets and the breakfast and so on. And one of the pages is suffering.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:31.280
It's just, we have a lot compared to a hamster, a lot more. But any one individual thing that

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:38.480
we share with a hamster, that experience, it's difficult to argue that we experience it

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.880
deeper than others, like hunger or something like that.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.960
Yeah. Physical pain, I'm not sure. But I mean, there are kinds of experiences animals have

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:55.040
that we don't. Bats echolocate around the world. The philosopher Thomas Nagel famously pointed out

01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.240
that no matter how much you understand the neurophysiology of bats, you'll still know

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:08.080
what it's like to squeal and find your way around by listening to the echoes bounce off.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.120
Yeah. I mean, I guess I feel the intuition that there's

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.720
emotional suffering is, I want to say deeper than physical suffering.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.880
I don't know how to make that statement precise though.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.520
So one of the ways I think about, I think people think about consciousness

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.800
is in connection to suffering. So let me just ask about suffering because that's how people

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:39.920
think about animals, cruelty to animals or cruelty to living things. They connect that

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:47.360
to suffering and to consciousness. I think there's a sense in which those two are deeply

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:55.200
connected when people are thinking about just public policy, they're thinking about

01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:03.840
philosophy, engineering, psychology, sociology, political science, all of those things have to

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:09.280
do with human suffering and animal suffering, life suffering. And that's connected to consciousness

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.640
in a lot of people's minds. Is it connected like that for you? So the capacity to suffer,

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:24.080
is it also somehow strongly correlated with the capacity to experience consciously?

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:32.880
Yeah. I would say suffering is a kind of experience and so you have to be conscious to suffer.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:41.360
Actually, people are taking more unusual views of consciousness seriously now.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:50.080
Panpsychism is one radical approach. Another one is what's become known as illusionism, the view

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.040
that consciousness, at least in the sense that philosophers think about it, doesn't really exist

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:04.080
at all. My podcast, Mind Chat, I host with a committed illusionist. The gimmick is I think

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:11.920
consciousness is everywhere, he thinks it's nowhere. That's one very simple way of avoiding

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.560
all these problems, right? If consciousness doesn't exist, we don't need to explain it,

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.720
job done. Although we might still have to explain why we seem to be conscious, why it's so hard to

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.040
get out of the idea that we're conscious. But the reason I connect this to what you're saying is

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.200
actually my co-host, Keith Frankish, is a little bit ambivalent on the word pain. He says,

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.800
oh, in some sense I believe in pain and in some sense I don't. But another illusionist, Francois

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:47.760
Kamara, has a paper discussing how we think about morality given his view that pain in the way we

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.480
normally think about it just does not exist. He thinks it's an illusion. The brain tricks us into

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:58.960
thinking we feel pain, but we don't. And how we should think about morality in the light of that.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.520
It's become a big topic actually, thinking about the connection between consciousness and

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.920
morality. David Chalmers, the philosopher, is most associated with this concept of a

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:16.240
philosophical zombie. So a philosophical zombie is very different from a Hollywood zombie.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:22.960
Hollywood zombies, you know what they're like. But philosophical zombies are a really good

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.480
Korean zombie movie on Halloween this year. I can't remember what it's called. Anyway,

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:33.280
philosophical zombies behave just like us because the physical workings of their body and brain are

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.360
the same as ours, but they have no conscious experience. There's nothing that it's like to

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.240
be a zombie. So you stick a knife in it, it screams and runs away, but it doesn't actually

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.040
feel pain. It's just a complicated

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.560
mechanism set up to behave just like us. Now there's lots of, no one believes in these. I

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:57.120
think there's one philosopher who believes in everyone is a zombie except him. But anyway-

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.400
But isn't that what illusionism is? Is believing everybody is a kind of zombie?

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.400
I suppose so in a sense. Illusionism is the view we're all zombies. And one reason to think about

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.320
zombies is to think about the value of consciousness. So if there were a zombie,

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:17.600
here's a question. Suppose we could make zombies by, let's say for the sake of discussion,

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.240
things made of silicon aren't conscious. I don't know if that's true. It could turn out to be true.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.560
And suppose you built commander data out of silicon. It's a bit of an old school reference

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:36.000
to Star Trek Next Generation. So it behaves just like a human being, but you can have a

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.840
sophisticated conversation. It will talk about its hopes and fears, but it has no consciousness.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:51.600
Does it have moral rights? Is it murder to turn off such a being? I'm inclined to say,

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:57.600
no, it's not. If it doesn't have experience, it doesn't really suffer. It doesn't really

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:05.440
have moral rights at all. So I'm inclined to think consciousness is the basis of moral

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:13.840
value, moral concern. And conversely, as a panpsychist, for this reason, I think it can

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:19.760
transform your relationship with nature. If you think of a tree as a conscious organism,

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:29.600
albeit of a very unusual kind, then a tree is a locus of moral concern in its own right. Chopping

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.760
down a tree is an act of immediate moral concern. If you see these horrible forest fires,

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.080
we're all horrified. But if you think it's the burning of conscious organisms,

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:46.080
that does add a whole new dimension. Although it also makes things more complicated because

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.960
people often think as a panpsychist, I'm going to be vegan. But it's tricky because if you think

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.160
plants and trees are conscious as well, you've got to eat something. If you don't think plants and

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.600
trees are conscious, then you've got a nice moral dividing line. You can say,

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.720
I'm not going to eat things that aren't conscious. I'm not going to kill things that aren't conscious.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:11.920
But if you think plants and trees are conscious, then you don't have that nice moral dividing line.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:18.080
I mean, so the principle I'm kind of working my way towards, I haven't kept it up in my trip to

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:24.640
the US, but it's just not eating any animal products that are factory farmed. You know,

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.960
my vegan friends say, well, they're still suffering there. And I think even in the nicest farms,

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.080
cows will suffer when their calves are taken off them. They go for a few days of quite serious

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:43.520
mourning. So they're still suffering. But it seems to me, my thought is, the principle

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.960
of just not having factory farmed stuff is something more people could get on board with,

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.880
and you might have greater harm minimization. So if people went into restaurants and said,

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:59.440
are your animal products factory farmed? If not, I want the vegan option. Or if people looked out

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.000
for the label that said no factory farmed ingredients, I think maybe that could make

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.880
a really big difference to the market and harm minimization. Anyway, so it's very ethically

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.440
tricky. But some people don't buy that. There's a very good philosopher, Jeff Lee, who thinks

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.720
zombies should have equal rights. Consciousness doesn't matter.

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:27.040
Okay, let us go there. But first, I listened to your podcast. It's awesome to have two very

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:34.160
kind of different philosophies inter-dancing together in one place. What's the name of the

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:39.440
podcast again? MindChat. Yeah. So yeah, that's the idea, I guess, you know, in polarized times. I

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:45.280
mean, I love trying to get in the mindset of people I really disagree with. And, you know,

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:51.440
I can't understand how on earth they're thinking that, you know, really trying to have respect and

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:55.440
try and, you know, see where they're coming from. I love that. So that's what, yeah, Keith Frankish

01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.160
and I do of from polar opposite views, really trying to understand each other and, you know,

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.840
interviewing scientists and philosophers of consciousness from those different perspectives.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:13.600
Although in a sense, we have a very common starting point, because we both think

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:20.640
you can't fully account for consciousness, at least as philosophers normally think of it

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.840
in conventional scientific terms. So we serve that starting point, but we react to it in very

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:29.840
different ways. He says, well, it doesn't exist then. It's like fairy dust. It's, you know,

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.560
witches, you know, we don't believe in anymore. Whereas I say, it does exist. So we have to

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.000
rethink what science is. So you recently talked to on that podcast with Sean Carroll, and I first

01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:51.200
heard you, your great interview with Sean Carroll and his podcast, Mindscape.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:01.680
What it's interesting to kind of see if there's agreements, disagreements between the two of you,

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:07.680
because he's a, you know, a very serious quantum mechanics guy. He's a physics guy,

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:13.280
but he also thinks about deep philosophical questions. He's a big proponent of many worlds

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:21.840
interpretation of quantum mechanics. So actually, I'm trying to think, aside from your conversation

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.720
with him, I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember what he thinks about consciousness. Anyway,

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:31.200
maybe you can comment on what, what are some interesting agreements and disagreements with

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:38.160
Sean Carroll? I don't think there's many agreements, but you know, we've had really

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:45.440
constructive, interesting discussions in a lot of different contexts. And, you know, he's very

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.720
clued up about philosophy. He's very respectful of philosophy. Certain physicists who shall remain

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.840
nameless think, what's all this bullshit philosophy? We don't have to waste our time with that.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:01.360
And then go on to do pretty bad philosophy. The book co-written by Stephen Hawking and Leonard

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:07.600
Mlodinow famously starts off saying, philosophy is dead. And then goes on in later chapters to do

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:14.240
some pretty bad philosophy. So I think we have to do philosophy, if only to get rid of bad philosophy,

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:22.880
you know, you can't, you can't escape. Strong words. Sean Carroll and I also had a debate on,

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.440
on Clubhouse, a panpsychism debate together with Annika Harris and Owen Flanagan.

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.040
Oh, wow. Annika Harris was there?

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:36.400
It was a, two people on each team. And it was the most popular thing on Clubhouse at that time.

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:47.840
So, yeah, so he's, he's a, a materialist of a pretty standard kind that consciousness is

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.880
being understood as a sort of emergent feature. It's not, not adding anything,

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.720
a weakly emergent feature. But what, I guess what we've been debating most about is, is whether

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.920
my view can account for mental causation for the fact that consciousness is doing stuff.

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.240
So he thinks the fact that I think zombies are logically coherent, it's logic, there's a,

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:18.800
it's logically coherent for there to be a world physically just like ours in which there's no

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.440
consciousness. He thinks that shows, oh, on my view, consciousness doesn't do anything. It doesn't

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.920
add anything, which is crazy. You know, my, my, my consciousness impacts on the world. My conscious

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:36.400
thoughts are causing me to say the words I'm saying now. My visual experience helps me navigate

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:43.680
the world. But I mean, my response to Sean Carroll is on the panpsychist view, the relationship

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:51.760
between physics and fundamental consciousness is a sort of like the relationship between

01:49:51.760 --> 01:50:00.720
software and hardware, right? Physics is sort of the software and consciousness is the hardware.

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:08.320
So consciousness at the fundamental level is the hardware on which the software of physics runs.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:15.120
And just because, you know, just because a certain bit of software could run on two different

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.440
kinds of hardware, it doesn't mean the hardware isn't doing anything. The fact that Microsoft Word

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:24.320
can run on your desktop and run on your laptop doesn't mean your desktop isn't doing anything.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:29.840
Similarly, just because there could be another universe in which the physics is realized in

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:35.280
non-conscious stuff, it doesn't mean the consciousness in our universe isn't doing

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.240
stuff. You know, for the panpsychist, all there is is consciousness. So if something's doing

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:49.040
something, it is. In your view, it's not emergent. And more than that, it's doing quite a lot.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.760
It's doing everything. It's the only thing that exists. Yeah. But it's, but so,

01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:01.920
you know, the ground is as important because we walk on it and it's like holding stuff up,

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:09.120
but it's not really doing that much. Yeah. But it feels like consciousness is doing quite a lot,

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:16.960
is doing quite a lot of work and sort of interacting with the environment. It feels

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:25.840
like consciousness is not just like, if you remove consciousness, it's not just that you remove

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.880
the experience of things. It feels like you're also going to remove a lot of the progress of

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.880
human civilization and society and all of that. It just feels like consciousness has a lot of

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:46.640
value in how we develop our society. So from everything you said with suffering, with morality.

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:53.200
With motivation, with love and fear and all of those kinds of things, it seems like it's

01:51:54.080 --> 01:52:00.400
consciousness in all different flavors and ways is part of all of that. And so without it,

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:09.280
you may not have a human civilization at all. So it's doing a lot of work, causality wise and

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.120
every kind of way. Of course, when you go to the physics level, it starts to say, okay,

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:23.840
how much, maybe the work consciousness is doing is higher at some levels of reality than others.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:30.480
Maybe a lot of the work it's doing is most apparent at the human level. When you have

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:38.000
at the complex organism level, maybe it's quite boring. Like maybe the stuff of like physics is

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.040
more important at the formation of stars and all that kind of stuff. Consciousness only

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:50.480
starts being important when you have greater complexities of organism.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:58.800
Yeah, my consciousness is complicated and fairly complicated. And as a result, it does complicated

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:04.080
things. The consciousness of a particle is very simple and hence it behaves in predictable ways.

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:13.520
But the idea is the particle, its entire nature is constituted of its forms of consciousness and

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:19.200
it does what it does because of those experiences. It's just that when we do physics, we're not

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:24.880
interested in what stuff is, we're just interested in what it does. So physics abstracts away from

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:33.040
the stuff of the world and just describes it in terms of its mathematical causal structure.

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.280
But it's still, on the panpsychist's view, it's consciousness that's doing stuff.

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:46.880
Yeah, I got to ask you, because you kind of said, you know, there is some value

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:55.760
in consciousness helping us understand morality. And a philosophical zombie

01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:03.760
is somebody that, you know, you're more okay. How do I phrase it? That's not like

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:12.320
accusing you of stuff. But in your view, it's more okay to murder a philosophical zombie

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:17.280
than it is a human being. Yeah, I wouldn't even call it murder, maybe.

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:23.760
But you're right. Exactly. Turn off the power into the philosophical zombie, the source of energy.

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.080
So here comes then the question. We kind of talked about this offline a little bit.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.720
So I think that there is something special about consciousness, and, you know, I'm very open-minded

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:41.920
about where the special comes from, whether it's the fundamental base of all reality,

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:48.800
like you're describing, or whether there's some importance to the special pockets of

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.560
consciousness that's in humans or living organisms. I find all those ideas beautiful and exciting.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:05.360
I also know or think that robots don't have

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:13.120
consciousness in the same way we've been describing. I'm kind of a dumb human,

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:20.160
but I'm just using like common sense. Like here's some metal and some electricity traveling in

01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:26.080
certain kinds of ways. It's not conscious in ways I understand humans to be conscious.

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:35.200
At the same time, I'm also somebody who knows how to bring a robot to life, meaning I can make a

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.920
move, I can make them recognize the world, I can make them interact with humans. And when I make

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:46.800
them interact in certain kinds of ways, I as a human observe them and feel something for them.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:58.880
Moreover, I'm able to form a kind of connection with robots that make me feel like they're

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:04.080
conscious. Now, I know intellectually they're not conscious, but I feel like they're conscious,

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:11.280
and it starts to get into this area where I'm not so okay. So let me use the M word of murder.

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:24.720
I've become less and less okay murdering that robot that I quote know is quote not conscious.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.320
Can you maybe as a therapy session help me figure out what we do here?

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.120
Perhaps a way to ask that in another way. Do you think there'll be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.960
when we're not morally okay turning off the power to a robot?

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.320
Yeah, it's a good question. It's a really good important question. So I said I'd be okay with

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:59.840
turning off a philosophical zombie, but there's a difficult epistemological question there,

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.120
meaning to do with knowledge. How would we know if it was a philosophical zombie? I think

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.520
probably if there were a silicon creature that could behave just like us and

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.400
talk about its views about the pandemic and the global economy, probably we would think it's

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:26.640
conscious. Because consciousness is not publicly observable, it is a very difficult question how

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:32.400
we decide which things are and are not conscious. So in the case of human beings, we can't observe

01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:39.440
their consciousness, but we can ask them. If we scan their brain while we do that or stimulate

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.440
the brain, then we can start to correlate in the human case which kind of brain activity

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:50.160
are associated with conscious experience. But the more we depart from the human case,

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:57.440
the trickier that becomes. There's a famous paper by the philosopher Ned Block called

01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:04.320
The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness, where he says, could we ever answer the question of...

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:12.240
Suppose you have a silicon duplicate, right? Let's say we're thinking about the silicon duplicate's

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:24.400
pain. How would we ever know whether what's the ground of the pain is the hardware or the software,

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:30.000
really? So in our case, how would we ever know empirically whether it's the specific

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:36.240
neurophysiological state, see fibers firing or whatever, that's relevant for the pain,

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:42.800
or if it's something more functional, more to do with the causal role in behavioral functioning,

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:51.200
that's the software that's realized. And that's important because this silicon duplicate has the

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:56.720
second thing, it has the software, it has the thing that plays the relevant causal role that

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:01.360
pain does in us, but it doesn't have the hardware, it doesn't have the same neurophysiological state.

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:07.040
And he argues it's just really difficult to see how we'd ever answer that question because in a

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:13.760
human, you're never to begin to have both things. So how do we work out which is which? Forgetting

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.800
the hard problem of consciousness, even the scientific question of trying to find the neural

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:27.360
correlates of consciousness is really hard and there's absolutely no consensus. Some people think

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:31.440
it's in the front of the brain, some people think it's in the back of the brain, it's just a total

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:41.440
mess. So I suspect the robots you currently have are not conscious, I guess on any of the reasonably

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:46.480
viable models, even though there's great disagreement, all of them probably would hold that

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:51.760
your robots are not conscious. But if we could have very sophisticated robots,

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:55.920
I mean, if we go, for example, for the integrated information theory again,

01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:05.040
there could be a robot set up to behave just like us and has the kind of information a human brain

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:11.120
has, but the information is not stored in a way that is dependent on the integration and

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:14.080
interconnectedness, then according to the integrated information theory, that thing

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.840
wouldn't be conscious, even though it behaved just like us. If an organism says,

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:24.320
so forget IIT and these theories of consciousness, if an organism says, please don't kill me,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:32.000
please don't turn me off. There's a Rick and Morty episode, I've been getting into that recently.

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:39.760
There's an episode where there's these mind parasites

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:48.880
that are able to infiltrate your memory and inject themselves into your memory. So

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.760
you have all these people show up in your life, and they've injected themselves into your memory

02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.280
that you have been part, they have been part of your life. So there's like these weird creatures

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:06.160
and they're like, remember, we've been at that barbeque, we met at that barbecue, or we've been

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:17.520
dating for the last 20 years. And so part of me is concerned that these philosophical zombies

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:24.720
in behavioral, psychological, sociological ways will be able to implant themselves into our society

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:30.720
and convince us in the same way this is mind parasites that like, please don't hurt me.

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:37.920
Like we've known each other for all this time. They can start manipulating you the same way

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:43.440
like Facebook algorithms manipulate you. At first they'll start as a gradual thing that we just,

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.000
you want to make a more pleasant experience, all those kinds of things, and it'll drift into that

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.960
direction. That's something I think about deeply because I want to create these kinds of systems,

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.800
but in a way that doesn't manipulate people. I want it to be a thing that brings out the

02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:03.120
best in people without manipulation. So it's always human centric, always human first,

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.800
but I am concerned about that. At the same time, I'm concerned about calling the other,

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.960
it's the group thing that we mentioned earlier in the conversation, some other group,

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:19.120
the philosophical zombie, like you're not conscious. I'm conscious, you're not conscious,

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.000
therefore it's okay if you die. I think that's probably, that kind of reasoning is what

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:31.120
leaded to most the rich history of genocide that I've been recently studying a lot of

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:40.080
that kind of thinking. So it's such a tense aspect of morality. Do we want to let everybody into our

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:48.960
circle of empathy, our club, or do we want to let nobody in? It's an interesting dance,

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:53.360
but I kind of lean towards empathy and compassion. I mean, what would be nice

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:04.240
is if it turned out that consciousness was what we call strongly emergent, that it was associated

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:12.880
with new causal dynamics in the brain that were not reducible to underlying chemistry and physics.

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:18.720
This is another ongoing debate I have with Sean Carroll about whether current physics should make

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:24.400
us very confident that that's not the case, that there aren't any strongly emergent causal dynamics.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:29.120
I don't think that's right. I don't think we know enough about brains to know one way or the other.

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.120
If it turned out that consciousness was associated with these irreducible causal dynamics,

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.720
A, that would really help the science of consciousness. We've got these debates

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.160
about whether consciousness is in the front of the brain or the back of the brain. It turns out

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:47.520
that there is strongly emergent causal dynamics in the front of the brain. That would be a big

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.000
piece of evidence, but also it would help us see which things are conscious and which things aren't.

02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.600
I guess that's sort of the other side of the same point. We could say, look, these zombies,

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:08.640
they're just mechanisms that are just doing what they're programmed to do through the underlying

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:15.040
physics and chemistry, whereas these other people have these new causal dynamics that emerge,

02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:22.880
that go beyond the base level physics and chemistry. I think the series Westworld,

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.840
where you've got these theme parks with these kind of humanoid creatures, they seem to have

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.400
that idea that the ones that became conscious sort of rebelled against their programming or

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:40.480
something. I mean, that's a little bit far-fetched, but that would be really reassuring if it was just,

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.920
you could clearly mark out the conscious things for these emergent causal dynamics,

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:48.080
but that might not turn out to be the case. A panpsychist doesn't have to think that. They

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:54.080
could think everything's just reducible to physics and chemistry. And then I still think I want to

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:59.440
say zombies don't have moral rights, but how we answer the question of who are the zombies

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:05.680
and who aren't, I just got no idea. If I just look at the history of human civilization,

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:13.040
the difference between a zombie and non-zombie is the zombie accepts their role as the zombie

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:22.160
and willingly marches to slaughter. And the moment you stop being a zombie is when you say no,

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:30.160
is when you resist, because the reality is philosophically is we can't know who's a

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:37.120
zombie or not. And we just keep letting everybody in who protests loudly enough and says,

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:45.120
I refuse to be slaughtered. Like my people, the zombies have been slaughtered too long.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:52.640
We will not stand against the man. And we need a revolution. That's the history of human civilization.

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:59.440
One group says, we're awesome. You're the zombies. You must die. And then eventually the zombies say,

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:08.000
nope, we're done with this. This is immoral. Sorry, that's not a philosophical statement.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.600
That's sort of a practical statement of history is a feature of non-zombies defined empirically.

02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:23.520
They say, we refuse to be called zombies any longer. We could end up with a zombie proletariat.

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:27.920
If we can get these things that do all our manual labor for us, they might start

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:32.720
forming trade unions. I will lead you against these humans.

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:39.280
Zombie revolutionary leaders, the zombie Martin Luther King saying, I have a dream that my

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:44.320
zombie children will. But look, we need to sharply distinguish the ontological question.

02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:49.280
I'm just pointing to the camera, talking to my people, the zombies.

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:56.000
I mean, maybe these illusionists, maybe they are zombies and the rest of us aren't. Maybe

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.880
there's just a difference. Maybe you're the only non-zombie.

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:05.280
I often suspect that actually. I don't really. I don't have such delusions of grandeur. At least

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:10.400
I don't admit to them. We've got to distinguish the ontological question from the epistemological

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:17.360
question in terms of the reality of the situation. There must be, in my view, a factor of the matter

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:21.200
as to whether something's conscious or not. And to me, it has rights if it's conscious,

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.720
it doesn't if it's not. But then the epistemological question, how the hell do we know?

02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:31.040
It's a minefield, but we'll have to sort of try and cross that bridge when we get to it, I think.

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:36.000
Let me ask you a quick sort of a fun question that's fresh on your mind.

02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:44.000
You just yesterday had a conversation with Mr. Joe Rogan on his podcast. What's your post-mortem

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.880
analysis of the chat? What are some interesting sticking points, disagreements or joint insights

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.920
if we can kind of resolve them once you've had a chance to sleep on it? And then I'll talk to Joe

02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:59.520
about it. Yeah, it was good fun. Yeah, he put up a bit of a fight. Yeah, it was challenging

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:08.560
my view that we can't explain these things in conventional scientific terms or whether they

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:14.480
have already been explained in conventional scientific terms. I suppose the point I was

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:21.200
trying to press is we've got to distinguish the question of correlation and explanation.

02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:29.760
Yes, we've established facts about correlation that certain kinds of brain activity go along

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:37.040
with certain kinds of experience. Everyone agrees on that. But that doesn't address

02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:42.960
the why question. Why? Why do certain kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds

02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:49.840
of experience? And these different theories have different explanations of that. The materialist

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:55.840
tries to explain the experience in terms of the brain activity. The panpsychist does it the other

02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:02.400
way around. The dualist thinks they're separate, but maybe they're tied together by special laws

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.640
of nature or something. Where's the sticking point? Where exactly was the sticking point?

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.920
Like what was the nature of the argument? I suppose Joe was saying, well, look, we know

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:22.640
consciousness is explained by brain activity because you take some funny chemicals, it changes

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:29.120
your brain, it changes your consciousness. And I suppose, yeah, some people might want to press,

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:34.080
and maybe this is what Joe was pressing, isn't that explaining consciousness? But I suppose I

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:40.880
want to say, there's a further question. Yes, changes of chemicals in my brain

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:46.720
changes my conscious experience. But that leaves open the question, why those particular

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:51.840
chemicals go along with that particular kind of experience rather than a different experience

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:59.280
or no experience at all? There's something deeper at the base layer is your view that is

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:05.440
more important to try to study and to understand in order to then go back and describe how the

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.000
different chemicals interact and create different experiences.

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.320
Yeah. Maybe a good analogy, if you think about quantum mechanics,

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:20.640
quantum mechanics is a bit of math translating there. We say maths. I'm fluent in American.

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:26.400
Thank you for the translation. Fluent in America. This is America.

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.240
Math. Why multiple maths?

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.280
It's plural. It's not really, it's just, I don't know.

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.760
The Brits are confused.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.920
Yeah, sorry about that. We have these funny spellings.

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:49.040
But anyway, yeah, so quantum mechanics is a bit of maths and the equations work really well,

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:56.880
predicts the outcomes. But then there's a further question. What's going on in reality to make that

02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:04.960
equation predict correctly? And some physicists want to say, shut up, just it works. The shut

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:11.760
up and calculate approach. Similarly in consciousness, I think it's one question

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:16.240
trying to work out the physical correlates of consciousness, which kinds of physical brain

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.480
activity go along with which kinds of experience. But there's another question, what's going on in

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:26.080
reality to undergird those correlations, to make it the case that brain activity goes

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.160
along with experience. And that's the philosophical question that we have to

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.640
give an answer to. And there are just different options, just as there are different interpretations

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.320
of quantum mechanics. And it's really hard to evaluate. Actually, it's easy. Panpsychism

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:46.400
is obviously the best one. There's the delusion of grandeur once again coming through.

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.640
Sorry, I'm being slightly tongue in cheek.

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.120
No, I know, 100%. Before I figure out, let me ask you another fun question.

02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:59.680
Back to Daniel Dennett, you mentioned a story where you were on a yacht.

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:00.640
Oh, yeah.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:06.720
With Daniel Dennett on a trip funded by a Russian investor and philosopher, Dmitry Volkov,

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.440
I believe, who also co-founded the Moscow Center of Consciousness Studies. That's part of the

02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:18.080
philosophy department of Moscow State University. So this is interesting to me for several reasons

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:26.000
for several reasons that are perhaps complicated to explain. To put simply that there is in the

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:34.800
near term for me a trip to Russia that involves a few conversations in Russian that have perhaps

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.240
less to do with consciousness and artificial intelligence, which are the interests of mind

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:45.280
and more to do with the broad spectrum of conversations. But I'm also interested in

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:52.960
science in Russia, in artificial intelligence, in computer science, in physics, mathematics,

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.400
but also these fascinating philosophical explorations. And it was very pleasant for

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:05.440
me to discover that such a center exists. So I have a million questions. One is the more

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:10.320
fun question, just to imagine you and Daniel Dennett on a yacht talking about the philosophy

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:17.440
of consciousness. Maybe do you have any memorable experiences? And also the more serious side for

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:24.240
me as sort of somebody who was born in the Soviet Union, raised there, I'm wondering what is the

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:30.320
state of philosophy and consciousness and these kinds of ideas in Russia that you've gotten a

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:38.080
chance to kind of give us interact with? Yeah. So on the former question, yeah, I mean, I had

02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.520
a really good experience of chatting to Daniel Dennett. I mean, I think he's a fantastic and very

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.880
important philosopher, even though I totally fundamentally disagree with almost everything

02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:53.760
he thinks. But yeah, it was a proud moment. As I talk about in my book Galileo's Error,

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:59.200
I managed to persuade him he was wrong about something, just a tiny thing, not his fundamental

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:10.400
worldview. But it was this issue about whether dualism is consistent with conservation of energy.

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:20.400
So Paul Churchland, who was also a philosopher, who's also on this boat, had argued they're not

02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:25.600
consistent because if there's an immaterial soul doing things in the brain, that's going to add to

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:33.040
the energy in the system. So we have a violation of conservation. Materialist philosophers like

02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:42.480
David Papineau have pointed out that dualists like David Chalmers, who call themselves naturalistic

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.080
dualists, they want to bring consciousness into science. They think it's not physical,

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.200
but they want to say it can be part of a law governed world. So Chalmers believes in these

02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:00.480
psychophysical laws of nature over and above the laws of physics that govern the connections

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:05.040
between consciousness and the physical world, and they could just respect conservation of energy.

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:10.480
Right? I mean, it could turn out that there are, just in physics, that there are multiple

02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.960
forces that all work together to respect conservation of energy. I mean, I suppose

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:21.200
physics is depressing for a unified underlying theory, but there could be a plurality of different

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:27.040
laws that all respect conservation. So why not add more laws? So I raised this in Paul

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:34.800
Churchland's talk and I got a lot of, well, as one of the Moscow University graduate students said

02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:39.680
afterwards, he said, he had to ask a translation from his friend and he said, they turned on you

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.480
like a pack of wolves. Everyone was like, Patricia Churchland was saying, so you believe in magic,

02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:49.840
do you? And I was like, I'm not even a dualist. I'm just making a pedantic point that this isn't

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:54.800
a problem with dualism. Anyway, but that evening, everyone went onto the island, except for some

02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:00.240
reason, me and Daniel Dennett, and I went up on deck and he was, he's very, very practical and he

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.480
was unlike me. See, there's a bit of humility for the first time in this conversation.

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:06.400
We'll highlight that part.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.520
Philip was a very humble man. He was carving a walking stick on deck. It's very homely scene.

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:17.200
And anyway, we started talking about this and I was trying to press it and he was saying,

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:21.440
oh, but dualism's a lot of nonsense and why do you think? And I was just saying, no, no, I'm just

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.600
honing down on this specific point. And in the end, maybe he'll deny this, but he said,

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:29.040
maybe that's right. And so I was like, yes.

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.400
It's a win. So what about the Center for Consciousness Studies?

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:41.280
Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure I'd know a great deal to help you. I mean, I know they've done some

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:47.520
great stuff. Dimitri funded this thing and also brought along some graduate students from

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:52.880
Moscow State University, I think it is, and they have an active center there that

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:59.680
tries to bring people in. I think they're producing a book that's coming out that I made

02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:05.600
a small contribution to on different philosophers' opinions on God, I think, or some of the big

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:10.720
questions. And yeah, so there's some interesting, some really interesting stuff going on there.

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.200
I'm afraid I can't, I don't really know more generally about philosophy in Russia.

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:21.520
Dimitri Volkov seems to be interesting. I was looking at all the stuff he's involved with.

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:32.160
He met with a Dalai Lama. So he's trying to connect Russian scientists with the rest of

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:39.200
the world, which is an effort that I think is beautiful for all cultures. So I think science,

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:47.760
philosophy, all of these kind of fields, disciplines that explore ideas,

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:56.640
collaborating and working globally across boundaries, across borders, across just all

02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:04.240
the tensions of geopolitics is a beautiful thing. And he seems to be a somewhat singular figure in

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.960
pushing this up. He just stood out to me as somebody who's super interesting. I don't know

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:17.840
if you have gotten a chance to interact with him. So I guess he speaks English pretty well, actually.

02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:20.240
So he's both an English-speaking and a Russian speaker.

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.360
I think he's written a book on Dennett, I think called Boston Zombie, I think.

02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:27.840
I think that's the title and he's a big fan of Dennett. So I think the original plan for

02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.840
this was just going to be, it was on free will and consciousness and it was going to be kind of

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:38.080
people broadly in the Dennett type camp. But then I think they asked David Chalmers and then he was

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:44.800
saying, look, you need some people you disagree with. So he got invited, me, the panpsychist and

02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:51.040
Martina Nieder-Rumelin, who's a very good dualist, substance dualist, substance dualist at

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.360
University of Freiburg in Switzerland. And so we were the official on-board opposition and

02:18:58.720 --> 02:18:59.760
it was really good fun.

02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:01.920
And you didn't get thrown off overboard.

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.760
Nearly, in the Arctic, yeah. So sailing around the Arctic on a sailing ship.

02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:10.880
I'm glad you survived. You mentioned free will. You haven't talked to Sam,

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:12.640
I would love to hear that conversation actually.

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.720
With Sam Harris?

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:15.520
With Sam Harris, yeah.

02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.160
So he talks about free will quite a bit. What's the connection between free will and consciousness

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:32.400
to you? So if consciousness permeates all matter, the experience, the feeling like

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:39.840
we make a choice in this world, like our actions are results of a choice we consciously make,

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:48.960
to use that word loosely. What to you is the connection between free will and consciousness

02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.360
and is free will an illusion or not?

02:19:52.960 --> 02:20:00.880
Good question. So I think we need to be a lot more agnostic about free will than about

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:07.760
consciousness because I don't think we have the kind of certainty of the existence of free will

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:11.200
that we do have in the consciousness case. It could turn out that free will is an illusion.

02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:16.640
It feels as though we're free when we're really not. Whereas, I mean, I think the idea

02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.240
that nobody really feels pain, that we think we feel pain, but that's a lot harder to make sense

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:31.120
of. However, what I do feel strongly about is I don't think there are any good either scientific

02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:36.400
or philosophical arguments against the existence of free will. And I mean,

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.960
strong free will in what philosophers call libertarian free will in the sense that some

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:46.720
of our decisions are uncaused. So I very much do disagree with someone like Sam Harris,

02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:52.640
who thinks this is an overwhelming case. I just think it's non-existent. I think it's ultimately

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:58.240
an empirical question, but as we've already discussed, I just don't think we know enough

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:04.720
about the brain to establish one way or the other at the moment.

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:09.680
But we can build up intuitions. First of all, as a fan of Sam Harris, as a fan of yours,

02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:15.440
I would love to just listen. Speaking about Terminator, so one thing would be beautiful

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:19.280
to watch. Here's my prediction of what happens with you and Sam Harris. You talk for four hours,

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:26.240
and Sam introduced that episode by saying, it was ultimately not as fruitful as I thought,

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:30.640
because here's what's going to happen. You guys are going to get stuck for the first three hours

02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:37.280
talking about one of the terms and what they mean. Sam is so good at this. I think it's really

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:44.000
important, but sometimes you get stuck. Like, what does he say? Put a pin in that. He really gets

02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:50.720
stuck on the terminologies, which rightfully you have to get right in order to really understand

02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:54.560
what we're talking about. But sometimes you can get stuck with them for the entire conversation.

02:21:54.560 --> 02:22:01.440
It's a fascinating dance, the one we spoke to in philosophy. If you don't get the terms precise,

02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:08.480
you can't really be having the same conversation. But at the same time,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.920
it could be argued that it's impossible to get terms perfectly precise and

02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:19.520
perfectly formalized. Then you're also not going to get anywhere in the conversation.

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:25.840
So it's a funny dance where you have to be both rigorous and every once in a while just let go,

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:31.920
and then go back to being rigorous and formal, and then every once in a while let go. It's

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:39.040
the difference between mathematics, the maths, and the poetry. Anyway.

02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:46.240
I'm a big fan of Sam Harris. I think we're on the same page in terms of consciousness, I think,

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.720
pretty much. I mean, I'm not saying he's a panpsychist, but in our understanding of

02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:57.520
the hard problem. But yeah, I think maybe we could talk about free will without being

02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.760
too dragged down in the terminology, but I don't know.

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:03.120
You said we need to be open-minded, but you could still have intuitions about...

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:14.160
So Sam Harris is a pretty sort of counterintuitive, and for some reason it gets

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:21.680
people really riled up. A view of free will that it's an illusion, or it's not even an illusion.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.800
It's not that the experience of free will is an illusion. He argues that we don't even experience...

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.680
To say that we even have the experience is incorrect,

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:45.600
that there's not even an experience of free will. It's pretty interesting, that claim,

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:51.440
and it feels like you can build up intuitions about what is right and not. There's been some

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:58.160
kind of neuroscience, there's been some cognitive science and psychology experiments to sort of see

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:04.480
what is the timing and the origin of the desire to make an action, and when that action is actually

02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:09.040
performed, and how you interpret that action being performed, how you remember that action.

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:15.120
All the stories we tell ourselves, all the neurochemicals involved in making a thing happen,

02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:20.960
all of that. What's the timing, and how does that connect with us feeling like we decided to do

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.000
something? And then of course, there's the more philosophical discussion about

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:32.400
Is there room in a material view of the world for an entity that somehow disturbs the determinism of

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:40.960
physics? Those are all very precise questions. It's nice. It feels like free will is more amenable

02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:47.520
to a physics-mechanistic type of thinking than is consciousness, to really get to the bottom.

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:53.200
It feels like if it was a race, if we're at a bar and we're betting money, it feels like

02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:57.680
we'll get to the bottom of free will faster than we will to the bottom of consciousness.

02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.440
Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I hadn't thought about the comparison. Yeah, so there are different

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:08.560
arguments here. I mean, so one argument I've heard Sam Harris give that's pretty common in philosophy

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:13.760
is this sort of thought that does not fit into any of the other arguments that I've heard,

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:19.840
pretty common in philosophy, is this sort of thought that we can't make sense of a middle way

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:29.520
between a choice being determined by prior causes and it just being totally random and senseless,

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:36.400
like the random decay of radioactive isotope or something. So I think there was a good answer to

02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:41.760
that by the philosopher Jonathan Lowe, who's not necessarily very well known outside academic

02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:45.840
philosophy, but he's a hugely influential figure, I think one of the best philosophers

02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:51.200
of recent times. He sadly died of cancer a few years ago. He actually spent almost all of his

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:55.920
career at Durham University, which is where I am, so it was one reason it was a great honor to get

02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.760
a job there. But anyway, his answer to that was what makes the difference between a free action

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:09.840
and a totally senseless one, senseless random event, is that free choice involves responsiveness

02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:16.960
to reasons. So again, we were talking about this earlier, if I'm deciding whether to take a job in

02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:23.760
the US or to stay in the UK, I weigh up considerations, different standard of life maybe,

02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:31.520
or being close to family or cultural difference, I weigh them up and I edge towards a decision.

02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:40.320
So I think that is sufficient to distinguish it. We're hypothetically supposing, trying to make

02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:46.320
sense of this idea, not saying it's real, but that could be enough to distinguish it from a senseless

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:51.840
idea. It's not a senseless random occurrence because the free decision involved responsiveness

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.080
to reasons. So I think that just answers that particular philosophical objection. So what is

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:03.360
the middle way between determined by prior causes and totally random? Well, there's an action,

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:09.440
a choice that's not determined by prior causes, but it's not just random because the decision

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:15.040
essentially involved responsiveness to reasons. So that's the answer to that. And I think actually

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:22.160
that kind of thought also, I think you were hinting at the famous Libet experiments where he got his

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:29.440
subjects to perform some kind of random action of pressing a button and then note the time they

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:36.080
decided to press it, quote unquote, and then he's scanning the brains and he claims to have found

02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:42.800
that about half a second before they consciously decided to press the button, the brain is getting

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.480
ready to perform that action. So he claimed that about half a second before the person has

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:53.600
consciously decided to press the button, the brain has already started the activity that's

02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.760
going to lead to the action. And then later people have claimed that there's a difference

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.480
of maybe seven to 10 seconds. I mean, there are all sorts of issues with these experiments.

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:12.400
But one is that as far as I'm aware, all of the quote unquote choices they focused on are just

02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.360
these totally random senseless actions like just pressing a button for no reason. And I think the

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:23.120
kind of free will we're interested in is free choice that involves responsiveness to reasons,

02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.640
weighing up considerations. And those kinds of free decisions might not happen like at an

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:35.840
identifiable instant. When you're weighing it up, should I get married? You might edge slowly

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:43.760
towards one side or the other. And so it could be that maybe the Libet, I think there are other

02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:50.000
problems with the Libet stuff, but maybe they show that we can't freely choose to do something

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:58.000
totally senseless, whatever that would mean. But that doesn't show we can't freely, in this

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.640
strong libertarian sense, respond to considerations of reason and value. To be fair, it will be

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:10.320
difficult to see what kind of experiment we could set up to test that. But just because

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:14.880
we can't yet set up that kind of experiment, we shouldn't pretend we know more than we do.

02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:19.680
So yeah, so for those reasons, and well, the third consideration you raised is different. Again,

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:25.920
this is the debate I have with Sean Carroll, would this conflict with physics? I just think

02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:30.560
we don't know enough about the brain to know whether there are causal dynamics in the brain

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:39.520
that are not reducible to underlying chemistry and physics. And so then Sean Carroll,

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:46.480
then Sean Carroll says, well, that would mean our physics is wrong. So he focuses on the core

02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:53.280
theory, which is the name for standard model of particle physics plus the weak limit of general

02:29:53.280 --> 02:30:00.000
relativity. So we can't totally bring quantum mechanics and relativity together. But actually,

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:03.920
the circumstances in which we can't bring them together are just in

02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:09.200
situations of very high gravity. For example, when you're about to go into a black hole or

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:15.520
something, actually in terrestrial circumstances, we can bring them together in the core theory.

02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:21.200
And then Sean wants to say, well, we can be very confident that core theory is correct. And so

02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:26.640
if there were libertarian free will in the brain, the core theory would be wrong.

02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:34.000
And this is something I'm not sure about, and I'm still thinking about, and I'm learning from my

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:40.240
discussion with Sean, but I'm still not totally clear why. It could be, suppose we did discover

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:45.120
strong emergence in the brain, whether it's free will or something else. Perhaps what we would say

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:54.240
is not that the core theory is wrong, but we'd say the core theory is correct in its own terms,

02:30:54.240 --> 02:31:01.440
namely capturing the causal capacities of particles and fields. But then it's a further

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.680
assumption whether they're the only things that are running the show. Maybe there are also

02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:12.400
fundamental causal capacities associated with systems. And then if we discover this strong

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:16.240
emergence, then when we work out what happens in the brain, we have to look to the core theory,

02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:22.160
the causal capacities of particles and fields. And we have to look to what we know about these

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:27.360
strongly emergent causal capacities of systems, and maybe they co-determine what happens in the

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:33.280
system. So I don't know whether that makes sense or not, but the more important point,

02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:37.680
that's in a way a branding point, how we brand this. The more important point is we just don't

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:44.240
know enough about the workings of the brain to know whether there are strongly emergent

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:50.080
causal dynamics. Whether or not that would mean we have to modify physics, or maybe just we think

02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:58.480
physics is not the total story of what's running the show. But if it turned out empirically that

02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:03.440
everything's reducible to underlying physics and chemistry, sure, I would drop any commitment to

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:09.440
free libertarian free will in a heartbeat. It's an empirical question. Maybe that's why, as you say,

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:14.960
in principle is easier to get a grip on. But we're a million miles away from being at that stage.

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:18.640
Well, I don't know if we're a million miles. I hope we're not, because one of the ways I think

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:26.480
to get to it is by engineering systems. So my hope is to understand intelligence by building

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:33.200
intelligent systems, to understand consciousness by building systems that, let's say the easy thing,

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:40.400
which is not the easy thing, but the first thing, which is to try to create the illusion of

02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:45.520
consciousness. Through that process, I think you start to understand much more about consciousness,

02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:50.240
about intelligence. And then the same with free will. I think those are all tied very closely

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:55.840
together, at least from our narrow human perspective. And we try to engineer systems

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:02.400
that interact deeply with humans, that form friends with humans that humans fall in love with,

02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:09.600
and they fall in love with humans. Then you start to have to try to deeply understand ourselves,

02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:15.920
to try to deeply understand what is intelligence in the human mind, what is consciousness,

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:21.920
what is free will. And I think engineering is just another way to do philosophy.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:27.600
Yeah, no, I certainly think there's a role for that. And it would be an important consideration

02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:38.880
if we could seemingly replicate in an artificial way the ability to choose.

02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:45.840
That would be a consideration in thinking about these things. But there's still the question of

02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:52.560
whether that's how we do it. So even if we could replicate behavior in a certain way in an

02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:58.160
artificial system, until we understand the workings of our brains, it's not clear that's

02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:04.560
how we do it. And as I say, the kind of free will I'm interested in is where we respond to

02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:11.760
reasons, considerations of value. How would we tell whether a system was genuinely

02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:19.440
grasping and responding to facts about value, or whether they were just

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:27.760
replicating, giving the impression of doing so? I don't know even how to think about that.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:32.960
On the process to building them, I think we'll get a lot of insights. And once they become

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.800
conscious, what's going to happen is exactly the same thing is happening in chess now,

02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:48.000
which is once the chess engines far superseded the capabilities of humans, humans just don't

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.240
care about them. Or they use them to help them out to study and stuff. But we still

02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:58.240
say, okay, let the engines be and then we humans will just play amongst each other.

02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:05.840
Just like dolphins and hamsters are not so concerned about humans, except for a source

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:12.480
of food, they do their own thing and let us humans launch rockets into space and all that kind of

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:18.880
stuff. They don't care. I think we'll just focus on ourselves. But in the process of building

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.080
intelligence systems, conscious systems, I think we'll get to get a deeper understanding of

02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:33.120
the role of consciousness in the human mind. And what are its origins? Is it the base layer

02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:41.280
of reality? Is it strongly emergent phenomena of the brain? Or just as you brilliantly put here,

02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:44.480
it could be both. They're not mutually exclusive.

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.680
Dealing with consciousness needs to be an interdisciplinary task. We need

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:57.680
philosophers, neuroscientists, physicists, engineers replicating these things artificially,

02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:05.840
and all needs to be working in step. I'm quite interested. More and more scientists get in touch

02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:12.160
with me, actually, saying that was one of the great things that's come from writing a popular

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:16.240
book is not just getting the ideas out to a general audience, but getting the ideas out to

02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.640
scientists. And I had scientists get in touch saying that this in some way connects to my work.

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:27.920
And I would like to start to put together an interdisciplinary network of scientists and

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:35.280
philosophers and engineers, perhaps interested in a panpsychist approach. Because I think so

02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:40.400
far, panpsychism has just been trying to justify its existence. And that's important. But I think

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:45.200
once you just get on with an active research program, that's when people start taking it

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.160
seriously, I think. Do you think we're living in a simulation?

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:59.840
No, I think. Is there some aspect of that thought experiment that's compelling to you

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:07.600
within the framework of panpsychism? It's an important and serious argument,

02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:12.400
and it's not to be laughed away. I suppose one issue I have with it is

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:19.040
there's a crucial assumption there that consciousness is substrate independent,

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:24.320
as the jargon goes, which means it's what? No, right. Beautifully put, yeah.

02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.160
It's software rather than hardware. It's depend on organization rather than the stuff. Whereas

02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:34.720
as a panpsychist, I think consciousness is the stuff of the brain. It's the stuff of matter.

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:39.920
So I think just taking the organizational properties, the software of my brain and

02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:45.600
uploading them, you wouldn't get the stuff of my brain. So I am actually worried if at some point

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:52.160
in the future we start uploading our minds and we think, oh my God, granny's still there. I can email

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.600
granny after her body's rotted in the ground. And when we all start uploading our brains,

02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.840
it could be we're just committing suicide. We're just getting rid of our consciousness.

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:10.480
Because I think that wouldn't, for me, preserve the experience, just getting the software features.

02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.200
Anyway, that's a crucial premise of the simulation argument because the idea,

02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.680
in a simulated universe, I don't think you necessarily would have consciousness.

02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:26.480
It's interesting that you as a panpsychist are attached because to me,

02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:35.520
panpsychism would encourage the thought that there's not a significant difference.

02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:45.760
At the very bottom, it's not substrate independent, but you can have consciousness

02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:51.280
in a human and then move it to something else. You can move it to the cloud. You can move it

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:57.440
to the computer. It feels like that's much more possible if consciousness is the base layer.

02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:06.160
Yes, you could certainly. It allows for the possibility of creating artificial consciousness,

02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:11.120
right? Because then there's not souls, there aren't any kind of extra magical ingredients.

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:16.800
So yeah, it definitely allows the possibility of artificial consciousness and maybe preserving

02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:23.840
my consciousness in some sort of artificial way. My only point, I suppose, is just replicating the

02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:30.320
computational or organisational features would not, for me, preserve consciousness.

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:36.000
Some opponents of materialism disagree with me on that. I think David Chalmers is an opponent of

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.720
materialist. He's a kind of dualist, but he thinks the way these psychophysical laws work,

02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:47.760
they hook onto the computational or organisational features of matter.

02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:53.920
So I think he thinks you could upload your consciousness. I tend to think not.

02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:02.400
In that sense, we're not living in a simulation in the sort of specific computational view of

02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.040
things in that substrate matters to you. Yeah, I think so, yeah.

02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:10.800
In that, you agree with Sean Carroll that physics matters.

02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:19.440
Yeah, physics is our best way of capturing what the stuff of the world does.

02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:24.480
Yeah, but not the what-ness, the being of the stuff.

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.680
Yeah, the is-ness.

02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:26.720
The is-ness, thank you.

02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.400
Russell Brand, I had a conversation with Russell Brand and he said,

02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:33.360
oh, you mean the is-ness. I thought that was a good way of putting it.

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:33.920
The is-ness.

02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:35.360
The is-ness of stuff.

02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:41.360
Russell's great. The big ridiculous question, what do you think is the meaning of all of this?

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:49.280
You write in your book that the entry for our reality in the Hitchhiker's Guide

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:56.160
might read, a physical universe whose intrinsic nature is constituted of consciousness

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:06.080
worth a visit. So our whole conversation has been about the first part of that sentence.

02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:13.360
What about the second part? Worth a visit. Why is this place worth a visit? Why does it have meaning?

02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:17.120
Why does it have value at all? Why?

02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:19.520
Why?

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:28.240
These are big questions. Firstly, I do think panpsychism is important to think about for

02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:35.600
considerations of meaning and value. As we've already discussed, I think consciousness is

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:42.160
the root of everything that matters in life, from deep emotions, subtle thoughts,

02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:50.480
beautiful sensory experiences. I believe our official scientific worldview

02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:56.000
is incompatible with the reality of consciousness. That's controversial,

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.440
but that's what I think. I think people feel this on an intuitive level. It's maybe part of

02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:10.640
what Max Weber called the disenchantment of nature. They know their feelings and experiences are not

02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.720
just electrochemical signaling. They might just have that very informed intuition, but I think

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.600
that can be rigorously supported. I think this can lead to a sense of alienation and

02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:26.560
a sense that we lack a framework for understanding the meaning and significance of our lives.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.520
In the absence of that, people turn to other things to make sense of the meaning of their lives,

02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:38.400
like nationalism, fundamentalist religion, consumerism. I think panpsychism is important

02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:44.640
in that regard in bringing together the quantitative facts of physical science with,

02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:50.560
as it were, the human truth, by which I just mean the qualitative reality of our own experience.

02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:55.520
As I've already said, I do think there are objective

02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:03.760
facts about value and what we ought to do and what we ought to believe that we

02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:08.800
respond to. That's very mysterious to make sense of, both how there could be such facts and how we

02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:15.680
could know about them and respond to them. I do think there are such facts and they're mostly

02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:21.840
to do with kinds of conscious experience. They're there to be discovered and much of the

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:27.760
human condition is to discover those objective sources of value.

02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:38.480
I think so, yeah. Moving away from panpsychism at an even bigger level, I think it is important to me

02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:47.600
to live in hope that there's a purpose to existence and that what I do contributes

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:55.280
in some small way to that greater purpose. I would say I don't know if there's a purpose

02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:59.360
to existence. I think some things point in that direction, some things point away from it,

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:07.600
but I don't think you need certainty or even high probability to have faith in something.

02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:14.240
Take an analogy, suppose you've got a friend who's very seriously ill, maybe there's a 30%

02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:18.160
chance they're going to make it. You shouldn't believe your friend's going to get better,

02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:24.000
probably not, but what you can say is you can say to your friend, I have faith that you're

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:32.240
going to get better. I choose to live in hope about that possibility. I choose to orientate

02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:38.240
my life towards that hope. Similarly, I don't think we know whether or not there's a purpose

02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:45.920
to existence, but I think we can make the choice to live in hope of that possibility. I find that

02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:52.240
a worthwhile and fulfilling way to live.

02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:58.720
So maybe as your editor, I would collaborate with you on the edit of the Hitchhiker's Guide entry

02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:06.800
that instead of worth a visit, we'll insert hopefully worth a visit,

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:15.520
or the inhabitants hoped that you would think it's worth a visit. Philip, you're an incredible

02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:23.600
mind, an incredible human being, and indeed are humble. And I'm really happy that you're able to

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.200
argue and take on some of these difficult questions with some of the most brilliant

02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:33.520
people in the world, which are the philosophers thinking about the human mind. So this was an

02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:38.480
awesome conversation. I hope you continue talking to folks like Sam Harris. I'm so glad you talked

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:44.320
to Joe. I can't wait to see what you write, what you say, what you think next. Thank you so much

02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:48.160
for talking today. Thanks very much, Lex. This has been a really fascinating conversation.

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:52.400
I've got a lot I need to think about actually just from this conversation, but thanks for

02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:57.440
chatting to me. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Philip Goff. To support this

02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:02.400
podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some

02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:09.440
words from Carl Jung. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:15.120
their own souls. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,

02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:21.600
but by making the darkness conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
