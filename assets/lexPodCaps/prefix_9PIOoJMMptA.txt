00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
when it's quiet, that's when it hits you.

00:02.880 --> 00:04.960
That's what, I think that's what a lot of people experience

00:04.960 --> 00:07.160
when they come back from a conflict zone.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.480
You know, everything that was life and death,

00:11.480 --> 00:14.120
everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos,

00:14.120 --> 00:15.480
all the people that are around you

00:15.480 --> 00:17.400
that would die for you, kill for you,

00:17.400 --> 00:18.600
you would kill for them.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.840
All these millions of dollars worth of equipment

00:22.840 --> 00:24.360
and stuff like that you were responsible for

00:24.360 --> 00:26.560
now are all gone and it's just you.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.720
The following is a conversation with Ed Calderon,

00:30.720 --> 00:33.760
a security specialist who has worked for many years

00:33.760 --> 00:37.400
on counter narcotics and organized crime investigation

00:37.400 --> 00:40.080
in the Northern border region of Mexico.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.600
I highly recommend you follow the writing and courses

00:43.600 --> 00:48.600
on his Patreon and website, edsmanifesto.com.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.480
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.280
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:52.280 --> 00:55.120
in the description and now, dear friends,

00:55.600 --> 00:56.920
here's Ed Calderon.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.160
What does your experience in counter narcotics,

01:01.160 --> 01:03.280
investigating the Mexican drug cartel,

01:03.280 --> 01:04.960
teach you about human nature?

01:05.920 --> 01:08.520
I mean, first off, anybody can be got.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.720
Anybody can be corrupted.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.000
You know, you work in that field and you,

01:15.960 --> 01:18.920
realistically the training we got and profiling

01:18.920 --> 01:21.160
and investigation and stuff like that

01:21.160 --> 01:23.720
was basically you learn from the older guys there.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.280
And some of those guys were already corrupted

01:25.280 --> 01:27.120
from the start.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.240
So trust no one.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.560
I remember seeing that X-Files episode where that was stated.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.640
You quickly learn that even if you are somebody

01:35.640 --> 01:39.640
that to your own mind appears incorruptible,

01:39.640 --> 01:41.800
you know, small changes happen around you,

01:41.800 --> 01:44.280
wheels get greased, money gets put in front of you

01:44.280 --> 01:47.400
and or things get threatened like your life.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.320
And sometimes a payment for some of this corruption

01:50.320 --> 01:52.040
is just to continue on living.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.120
You encounter people that seem incorruptible

01:55.120 --> 01:57.640
that go through FBI background checks,

01:57.640 --> 02:01.440
that go through all of the security measures

02:01.440 --> 02:04.760
that all of us were put through, you know, polygraph test.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.600
And then later on, you know,

02:07.480 --> 02:08.680
it turns out they were on the take

02:08.680 --> 02:11.440
or they became somebody that was corrupted.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.440
I think what I found out is that anybody at any level,

02:16.440 --> 02:19.960
they could be a very strong, hard to get person right now,

02:20.800 --> 02:24.800
but people get corrupted through their families,

02:24.800 --> 02:26.320
through need.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.720
Mexico is a place where a lot of instability occurs.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.760
So financial needs, health.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.320
So a crack could form through the wall of integrity

02:36.320 --> 02:39.760
and then over time, it seeps in somehow.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.560
Mexico has a culture of corruption.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.200
Like, you know, you have your kid

02:43.200 --> 02:44.640
that goes to school at public school

02:44.640 --> 02:46.160
and you want him to be in the morning,

02:46.160 --> 02:47.720
not in the afternoon school,

02:47.720 --> 02:48.560
time period.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.040
So you go off and grease the wheels

02:51.040 --> 02:53.240
with the director of the school,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.480
people hearing this in Mexico, nod their heads,

02:55.480 --> 02:58.120
because this is something that happens from early on.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.960
So there's a systemic and cultural thing to it,

03:00.960 --> 03:02.560
you know, as far as getting around rules.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.080
And this happens because, you know,

03:04.080 --> 03:05.800
the people that are in charge in Mexico, the government,

03:05.800 --> 03:10.120
is, you know, their tandem amount is trust

03:10.120 --> 03:11.960
between criminals and the cartels down there

03:11.960 --> 03:12.800
for a lot of the culture.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.560
So people don't get caught up in the culture.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.560
So you know, it's a place where there's a lot of corruption

03:17.560 --> 03:18.480
and people don't trust the government

03:18.480 --> 03:21.000
and much less criminality.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.120
When you meet a person sticking on human nature,

03:24.120 --> 03:25.600
do you think it's possible to figure out

03:25.600 --> 03:26.880
if they can be trusted?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.400
So you said anyone could be corrupted.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.200
You know, how long would you need to talk to a person?

03:34.200 --> 03:37.840
And even in your own personal private life, just a friend,

03:37.840 --> 03:40.400
or is trust a thing that's never really guaranteed?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.560
I think trust is never really guaranteed.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.800
I know a lot of people are gonna say

03:43.800 --> 03:46.080
that's a sad way and hard way of living your life,

03:46.080 --> 03:48.080
but you know, life experience, at my end,

03:49.120 --> 03:50.800
you know, people change.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.680
You know, the dynamics of a relationship might change.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.160
I look at people's character,

03:55.160 --> 03:58.520
specifically their past and past experiences, if I can.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.320
Somebody that presents themselves in front of you

04:00.320 --> 04:03.080
as somebody, but you quickly learn

04:03.080 --> 04:05.440
that that somebody is just a mask or a persona

04:05.440 --> 04:07.920
that they kind of created for themselves.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.880
And they might not even be aware of the persona?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.680
Like, is there some deep psychological stuff?

04:11.680 --> 04:16.320
Sometimes I've experienced a lot of failure in my life.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.920
You can see it in my nose, you know,

04:17.920 --> 04:21.320
you can see it in my lack of a digit, you know.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.640
The amount of, you know, the amount of failure

04:26.640 --> 04:28.920
you can see in somebody and how they wear them sometimes

04:28.920 --> 04:31.400
is a pretty telling thing as far as them being able

04:31.400 --> 04:34.120
to be trusted or that you can trust their story

04:34.120 --> 04:35.840
or their experience.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.360
And when I say experience, I mean,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.600
I've met some criminals, like former criminals

04:39.600 --> 04:41.880
or, you know, some people of that background

04:41.880 --> 04:43.840
that I trust with my life, you know,

04:43.840 --> 04:47.560
because they're not reformed, but they figured out

04:47.560 --> 04:50.000
that that's not a life they can live long enough

04:50.000 --> 04:52.200
to kind of continue on in.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.240
And I've also met people that are in law enforcement

04:54.240 --> 04:57.000
that I wouldn't trust with my car keys, you know,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.040
because, you know, whatever persona they adopted

05:00.040 --> 05:04.040
over the years is a pretty good one, pretty good mask.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.280
Sometimes such a good mask,

05:05.280 --> 05:06.640
they don't even know they're wearing it.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.760
And on top of that, it's not just the psychology.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.120
There's also a neurobiology to it.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.760
I've been very fortunate and deliberate

05:14.760 --> 05:18.480
to surround myself with good people throughout my life,

05:18.480 --> 05:20.840
but I've recently gotten to sort of observe,

05:20.840 --> 05:24.520
not close to me, but nearby,

05:24.520 --> 05:27.560
somebody that could be classified as a sociopath

05:29.160 --> 05:31.240
and a narcissist.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.400
Like, I don't wanna use those psychological terms,

05:33.400 --> 05:37.840
but just, it's like, oh, people, you know,

05:37.840 --> 05:39.960
come with different biology, too.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.760
So it's not just like the trauma you might experience

05:42.760 --> 05:45.200
in your early life and all the deep complexity

05:45.200 --> 05:50.200
that leads to the psychology that you have as an adult,

05:52.440 --> 05:56.360
but it's also the biology you come with, the nature,

05:56.360 --> 06:00.420
that you might not just have the machine

06:00.420 --> 06:03.440
that can empathize deeply with the experience of others,

06:03.440 --> 06:06.740
or maybe a machine that gets off,

06:06.780 --> 06:10.300
gets a dopamine rush from the manipulation of other humans

06:10.300 --> 06:11.540
or the control of other humans.

06:11.540 --> 06:15.340
Yeah, I mean, for an example of my own background,

06:15.340 --> 06:16.820
my mom didn't have a father.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.420
He left really early on in their childhood.

06:21.420 --> 06:24.900
My mom raised her two sisters

06:24.900 --> 06:26.700
and basically kept a household.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.680
She was a great mom.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.860
She was a badass, you know, she was very independent.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.180
She showed me how to be independent.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.420
She showed me how to kind of watch out for others

06:37.100 --> 06:38.580
and kind of build me up in that way.

06:38.580 --> 06:41.780
And I had a great childhood as far as, you know,

06:41.780 --> 06:45.380
as far as her and kind of like how she molded me.

06:45.380 --> 06:49.720
Later on, I figured out that when I had my own kid,

06:50.840 --> 06:53.500
you know, I figured out that she was basically

06:53.500 --> 06:57.060
trying to make me into what she didn't have in a way.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.660
And if I can get to see somebody's parents, you know,

06:59.660 --> 07:04.180
that's usually a sign of something, at least for me,

07:04.180 --> 07:06.340
as far as figuring out where people are.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.940
I think there's something to be said about nature and nurture

07:08.940 --> 07:10.700
and how some people come up.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.700
Some people are just born with that predatory instinct,

07:13.700 --> 07:15.660
you know, and you'll never know.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.940
I mean, they spend their whole life

07:16.940 --> 07:18.220
practicing how to hide it.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.700
But if you can figure out somebody's, you know,

07:21.700 --> 07:23.300
background, childhood, where they're from,

07:23.300 --> 07:25.140
you can kind of tell something about them.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.660
You know, I'm from Tijuana, you know, I'm a survivor.

07:27.660 --> 07:29.860
That's my background as far as where I'm from.

07:30.860 --> 07:35.340
Culturally, genetically, psychologically,

07:35.340 --> 07:36.540
the full shebang.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.500
Yeah, I guess some people are born

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
with certain predispositions.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.420
And if they're in the right environment,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.180
some of the negative aspects might flourish

07:44.180 --> 07:45.540
more than others, you know.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.100
For me, I mean, I grew up skateboarding in Tijuana

07:49.100 --> 07:52.380
and I remember breaking into my first backyard pool.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.540
It was a house that a cartel guy owned

07:54.540 --> 07:57.540
and we used to skate the pool in the back of it.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.980
So I learned how to pop open padlocks

08:01.020 --> 08:05.180
with a small vehicle, hydraulic lift.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.500
And I remember doing that.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.380
And later on in life, I got to train with people

08:10.380 --> 08:14.060
from other parts of Mexico and work with them.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.620
And I remember pulling that trick off

08:15.620 --> 08:17.140
and they were like looking at me like,

08:17.140 --> 08:18.580
where'd you learn that?

08:18.580 --> 08:21.220
It's like some burglars in Tijuana, you know.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.500
And they're like, wow, that's interesting.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.340
Like are all people from Tijuana like that?

08:25.340 --> 08:27.140
And I said, no, we're not all like that.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.740
But I guess in some way we are because, you know,

08:30.660 --> 08:33.580
Tijuana produces some, produces kids like that, you know.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.980
She produces, like the environment itself produces,

08:37.140 --> 08:39.220
produces a pretty specific person, I guess.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.740
You know, where our normal is,

08:40.740 --> 08:42.140
our normal or our baseline normal

08:42.140 --> 08:43.460
is way different than most.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.980
The trajectories that you can take in life

08:45.980 --> 08:49.940
are defined in a way that aren't available

08:49.940 --> 08:51.180
elsewhere in the world.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.020
Yeah.

08:52.020 --> 08:53.340
And so you develop, I mean,

08:53.340 --> 08:54.340
part of that is psychological,

08:54.340 --> 08:56.140
part of that is cultural and so on.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.260
Part of that is the cultural trauma.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.380
But then also the ethical lines based on the corruption.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.580
Because I grew up in the Soviet Union

09:03.580 --> 09:05.820
and there's the same kind of understanding

09:05.820 --> 09:08.780
that there's some gray area of corruption.

09:08.780 --> 09:09.620
Yeah.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.740
It's always there, like on the outskirts

09:11.740 --> 09:13.460
or even in the center.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.100
How you can grease things to make things easier

09:16.100 --> 09:18.140
and how it's like a personal thing.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.940
I'll just, you know, pay off the,

09:20.940 --> 09:23.580
in Tijuana we have a mordida is what we call it, you know.

09:23.580 --> 09:26.820
When you pay a cop off, a mordida means a bite.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.380
So, and...

09:30.380 --> 09:33.860
But what's the bite aspect?

09:33.860 --> 09:37.140
So you get stopped for a traffic violation of some sort

09:37.140 --> 09:38.620
and the cop walks up to you.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.900
Obviously you don't say the word bite,

09:39.900 --> 09:42.500
but it's like a slang term for it.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.540
And he asks for your paperwork and, you know,

09:45.540 --> 09:49.020
and if you get fined or get a ticket,

09:49.020 --> 09:51.180
you say, can I pay the ticket here?

09:51.180 --> 09:52.900
Is what they say.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.940
And you know, put your money inside the paperwork

09:54.940 --> 09:56.620
and hand it over to the cop, mordida.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.860
You think it's, you know, I'm just gonna do it

09:58.860 --> 10:01.380
and nobody knows, you know, but it's a systemic thing.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.860
Everybody, like a lot of people do it

10:02.860 --> 10:04.220
and then they don't trust the police

10:04.220 --> 10:06.140
because they are fed with this.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.500
Yeah, I mean, same thing was in the Soviet Union.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.900
It's funny, but then there's something inside you

10:12.900 --> 10:16.700
where that kind of, those opportunities come

10:16.700 --> 10:18.740
like with a police officer where you realize

10:18.740 --> 10:20.460
you could just pay a little bit of money

10:20.460 --> 10:21.660
and get out of a thing.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.820
And then you realize you can pay a little bit of money

10:23.820 --> 10:26.540
or do a favor to get your kids in a better school

10:26.540 --> 10:27.620
or something like that.

10:27.620 --> 10:30.700
But there comes opportunities where you were,

10:30.700 --> 10:33.380
all right, if I do this little thing,

10:33.380 --> 10:36.180
I can make, I can get a huge promotion

10:36.180 --> 10:39.260
or I can get a huge increase in my power

10:39.260 --> 10:40.740
or I can get a lot of money.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.940
And something inside you says, no, that's not right.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.540
And I wonder what that is.

10:45.540 --> 10:49.980
Cause like, yeah, I want, cause it feels different

10:49.980 --> 10:52.780
than the legal systems within which you operate.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.820
There's some kind of basic human integrity, human decency.

10:55.820 --> 10:59.060
I wonder if that's like constructed or it's always there.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.500
If it's like, again, nature versus nurture.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.060
I think, you know, for me, it was looking at,

11:04.060 --> 11:05.820
at seeing that in somebody else

11:05.820 --> 11:08.060
that I kind of learned about it.

11:08.060 --> 11:12.140
There's a man that I consider a mentor figure.

11:12.140 --> 11:14.460
His name is Lieutenant Colonel Liza Oda.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.140
He was a lieutenant colonel from the army

11:16.140 --> 11:18.100
that basically came over and took over the group

11:18.100 --> 11:19.740
that I used to work with.

11:19.740 --> 11:24.500
And he was, you know, incorruptible, you know, he was,

11:24.500 --> 11:28.900
that was the essence or the aura that he projected.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.220
The first time he, the first time he went off on patrol

11:33.220 --> 11:34.700
when he was placed in charge of us,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.820
I actually drove him around Tijuana.

11:37.940 --> 11:40.540
He was one of those lead from the front type of people.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.620
The amount of assassination attempts he got

11:44.620 --> 11:48.380
was basically a proof of how incorruptible he was

11:48.380 --> 11:49.940
because they kept trying to pay him off.

11:49.940 --> 11:50.900
And when that didn't work,

11:50.900 --> 11:52.260
they tried to kill him several times.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.900
I think the last assassination attempt

11:53.900 --> 11:55.820
took the use of his legs.

11:55.820 --> 11:58.540
And that man is still a dangerous person in my mind.

11:58.540 --> 12:02.780
But for me, and you know, people can gather a little bit

12:02.780 --> 12:04.540
about my background and where I'm from

12:04.540 --> 12:06.940
and some of the access I currently have

12:06.940 --> 12:09.260
to train the federal institutions here in the US

12:09.260 --> 12:12.260
as far as my background and if I was corrupted or not,

12:12.260 --> 12:14.260
because there's a lot of that out there.

12:15.260 --> 12:19.620
The Catholic guilt that's kind of built into some of us

12:19.620 --> 12:21.660
is always kind of there, you know.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.180
El cucuy vive bajo la cama.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.340
The devil was under the bed, you know.

12:26.460 --> 12:30.180
So I don't consider myself Catholic,

12:30.180 --> 12:32.260
consider myself culturally Catholic, I think,

12:32.260 --> 12:34.860
is what I kind of say with that.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.900
I had a pretty good structure with my dad and my mom

12:36.900 --> 12:37.940
at the house and you know,

12:37.940 --> 12:41.780
they never let me get away with things.

12:41.820 --> 12:45.820
And I think my mom was a pretty big moral compass for me.

12:45.820 --> 12:49.940
But that Lieutenant Colonel kind of leading from example

12:49.940 --> 12:54.180
and seeing his work and how much profound change

12:54.180 --> 12:56.180
he caused in the people that work with him

12:56.180 --> 12:58.420
as far as, you know, we felt supported

12:58.420 --> 13:02.420
and we felt like we had a guiding figure during this.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.500
Tijuana was the most dangerous city on the planet

13:04.500 --> 13:06.700
when I was working there and he took charge.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.900
What does it take to be a man, the Lieutenant Colonel,

13:09.940 --> 13:13.780
who maintains integrity after assassination attempts?

13:13.780 --> 13:16.260
Is it possible for a normal human to do that

13:16.260 --> 13:17.620
or again, is it genetics?

13:17.620 --> 13:20.420
That's an interesting question, I'll say this.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.060
Seeing him, I mean, the last assassination attempt

13:23.060 --> 13:25.020
he had, they took the use of his legs,

13:25.020 --> 13:26.020
he was with his kid.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.220
There was a recklessness to it, you know.

13:30.220 --> 13:33.940
I can see that now, like now that I have enough distance

13:33.940 --> 13:36.660
from it, I could see that there's a recklessness

13:36.660 --> 13:38.660
to being that way.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.020
And also you put in jeopardy people around you

13:41.020 --> 13:43.060
if you take that route.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.580
So I think there's a sacrifice to it,

13:44.580 --> 13:47.740
a very powerful and hard one to make for a lot of people.

13:49.020 --> 13:54.020
For me, it was, I wouldn't get picked to get on board

13:54.020 --> 13:55.500
with some of the operations groups

13:55.500 --> 13:57.340
that I wanted to work with because I was known

13:57.340 --> 14:01.300
for not taking money or not being trusted

14:01.300 --> 14:04.260
by certain older segments of the organization

14:04.260 --> 14:06.420
that I was with with stuff because they knew

14:06.420 --> 14:10.060
that I wouldn't get money.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.740
So there's always a weird sacrifice to it

14:13.740 --> 14:16.260
and you're almost kind of like masochistic in that way

14:16.260 --> 14:19.660
when you get approached with it.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.580
They're like, why are you being an idiot?

14:21.580 --> 14:24.180
Why are you driving around that beat up car?

14:24.180 --> 14:26.420
Look at the Hummer H2 that just drove in

14:26.420 --> 14:29.300
with the other guy that is doing exactly your same job.

14:32.140 --> 14:35.860
Society as a whole down there doesn't reward it

14:35.860 --> 14:37.420
or at least doesn't see it in the people

14:37.420 --> 14:39.260
that don't take that route in Mexico.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.340
For them, all cops are corrupt, all of them.

14:43.540 --> 14:47.540
And seeing it again from the outside,

14:47.540 --> 14:48.620
I'm not there anymore.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.460
There's almost like a, why didn't you Ed?

14:54.740 --> 14:56.140
That could have been easier maybe

14:56.140 --> 14:59.380
or you could have been dead long ago

14:59.380 --> 15:01.180
because people that are on the take down there

15:01.180 --> 15:04.100
are usually owned by one side or the other.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.660
And when that gets found out,

15:05.660 --> 15:07.380
if you have somebody that you're paying off

15:07.380 --> 15:10.820
that hints you off of drug operations in the area,

15:10.820 --> 15:13.180
your rivals are pretty keen on killing you.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.100
Money aside, so like a Hummer aside,

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
how much of a motivator is fear?

15:18.940 --> 15:19.780
It's a big one.

15:21.940 --> 15:26.420
I'll say, for me, I didn't think I was gonna live to see 30.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.580
I was sure of it.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.220
Did that concept scare you

15:30.220 --> 15:33.860
or was that just a principle of life?

15:34.820 --> 15:36.180
What did you operate under?

15:37.700 --> 15:41.020
I lost my brother when I was 13 on it too.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.060
He was 19.

15:43.060 --> 15:46.540
He was like the VIP of the family.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.540
You miss him?

15:48.540 --> 15:49.380
Oh, every day.

15:51.900 --> 15:56.900
He was a skateboarded BMX motorcycle hunter,

15:58.420 --> 16:00.980
one of the best marksmen that I've ever seen shoot.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.620
So better than you at everything.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.660
He's the best of us is what we would say.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.380
And when he died,

16:06.380 --> 16:10.020
there was almost like a concert at this funeral.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.380
I met three of his girlfriends

16:11.380 --> 16:13.580
that all introduced themselves, like the one.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.020
To this day, every now and then I get pulled aside down

16:19.020 --> 16:23.940
when I go back home and they're Eric's brother.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.420
Despite all the stuff that I've done,

16:26.420 --> 16:29.060
I'm still, every now and then I get recognized.

16:30.020 --> 16:35.020
That made my mom and my dad go into a horrible depression.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.060
And basically left me to my devices when I was a kid.

16:39.740 --> 16:44.740
From 13 onwards, I had this self-destructive aspect

16:45.460 --> 16:46.860
to me after that, I think.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.980
So again, something that's come up in therapy

16:48.980 --> 16:52.700
after I've been gone through all that and had this notion

16:52.700 --> 16:56.620
that if I can only die good in some way, shape or form

16:57.580 --> 17:00.420
or for something that it would matter.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.700
And they would kind of look at me

17:02.700 --> 17:05.620
with the same reverence I did with my brother.

17:05.620 --> 17:09.100
So dying isn't the problem.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.380
The goal of life is to die for something good.

17:11.380 --> 17:16.380
Yeah, at least that was my mindset going through that job.

17:17.980 --> 17:22.140
I remember I was in medical school before that,

17:22.140 --> 17:23.740
second year of medical school.

17:23.740 --> 17:24.700
I was doing pretty good.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.140
And then 9-11 happened,

17:26.140 --> 17:28.420
and that wasn't an option anymore for me.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.540
The economy was horrible.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.980
Couldn't afford to stay there.

17:31.980 --> 17:36.740
So I sat in the newspaper and my big brother,

17:36.740 --> 17:38.580
who was still alive and had,

17:38.580 --> 17:43.580
he's like, you're not gonna do that shit.

17:43.820 --> 17:44.700
We wouldn't dare.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.620
And all of a sudden I was in a field

17:47.620 --> 17:49.300
having my hair shaved off

17:49.300 --> 17:53.420
and a bunch of the guys that later turned

17:53.420 --> 17:55.980
into the Zeta cartel military men

17:55.980 --> 17:57.860
were in charge of our training.

17:57.860 --> 18:00.060
And I went through that process.

18:00.060 --> 18:03.660
In what field were you and why is your head being shaved?

18:03.660 --> 18:06.020
And what the hell was going through your mind?

18:06.020 --> 18:07.620
What was the leap that you took?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.940
I was sold the idea of this being

18:09.940 --> 18:12.420
a new Americanized police force

18:12.420 --> 18:13.460
that they were constructing.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.300
In Mexico.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.540
In Mexico.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.860
So elite special force kind of.

18:18.860 --> 18:21.620
Prestigious elite, the people in charge of our training

18:21.620 --> 18:25.980
were a lot basically ex-Mexican GAFE people.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.220
GAFEs are what the special forces kind of originated.

18:29.220 --> 18:32.420
A lot of their members turned into the Zeta cartel.

18:32.420 --> 18:36.140
So they were brutal in their training.

18:36.140 --> 18:40.140
We were sold this idea of it being scientific,

18:40.140 --> 18:44.580
like educated based and like a career path.

18:44.580 --> 18:48.220
And all of a sudden we're in this refurbished prison

18:48.220 --> 18:50.460
that wasn't good enough to be a prison.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.540
And they turned it into a training ground.

18:53.540 --> 18:55.540
And I quickly kind of realized

18:55.540 --> 18:58.100
that they were training us to be a paramilitary group,

18:58.100 --> 19:01.220
not a community policing organization.

19:01.220 --> 19:03.020
Which in my mind, I thought

19:03.020 --> 19:04.700
that's what we're gonna be doing.

19:04.700 --> 19:08.100
What was the hardest process of that training for you?

19:08.100 --> 19:11.900
Cause this is like a fragile innocent boy

19:11.900 --> 19:14.100
becomes a man kind of process.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.660
It's a, they're turning us into something

19:16.660 --> 19:18.260
that they could use.

19:18.260 --> 19:19.620
So it's a breaking down.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.780
They break down the individual, it's a-

19:23.780 --> 19:24.780
Physically and mentally?

19:24.780 --> 19:29.780
Yeah, I think it's a half done initiation process,

19:31.860 --> 19:33.140
I think in a way.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.500
Looking at it from now into the past,

19:35.500 --> 19:40.500
the shaving of the hair, the stripping off your identity,

19:41.180 --> 19:44.540
everybody gets a number.

19:45.660 --> 19:49.740
The uniforms, the running around

19:49.740 --> 19:54.700
and being treated like human garbage.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.860
The first thing they said to us

19:55.860 --> 19:58.300
when we were lined up in that field was

19:58.300 --> 20:02.460
a pan y verga para comer aqui, se acabo el pan.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.340
Which means there's bread and dick to eat here.

20:05.340 --> 20:08.140
And the bread ran out a week ago, right?

20:08.140 --> 20:12.500
So it was, I mean, I can't equate it to anything

20:12.500 --> 20:14.060
in the military here in the United States

20:14.060 --> 20:15.540
because people down there could actually

20:15.540 --> 20:16.460
get physical with us.

20:16.460 --> 20:18.020
I mean, they could actually hit us

20:18.020 --> 20:19.300
and punch us and shit like that.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.980
Which is not allowed here anymore,

20:21.980 --> 20:24.860
at least in most of the militaries

20:24.860 --> 20:26.780
and as horrible as down there.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.180
The AK-47 is being shot around us to simulate reality,

20:31.180 --> 20:33.660
basically causing hearing loss, that type of stuff.

20:34.700 --> 20:39.020
So chaos, abuse, really challenging you,

20:39.020 --> 20:40.380
again, physically and mentally.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.420
And an open door there, always.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.860
So if you don't wanna be here, you can just walk out.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.380
And the more you go into it, time-wise,

20:47.380 --> 20:48.620
you're more invested you are.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.780
So in a way, you're kind of building your own chains

20:51.780 --> 20:53.260
while you're going through that process.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.460
Were you tempted to walk out?

20:54.460 --> 20:57.300
Yeah, several times, several times.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.900
Specifically seeing some of the ways that people

21:00.900 --> 21:04.140
that I thought were better or stronger than me

21:04.140 --> 21:05.940
were walking out or quitting

21:07.100 --> 21:09.380
because of something that happened in there.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.900
There was some sexual assault stuff

21:12.900 --> 21:15.140
happening in there as well.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.340
Were you afraid of that?

21:17.300 --> 21:20.220
Always, you're in a place like that

21:20.220 --> 21:22.340
and there's females in the environment

21:22.340 --> 21:25.620
and some of the instructors are doing what they do.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.220
So that was like a cause for alarm.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.060
I mean, these people are in charge of our safety

21:29.060 --> 21:30.860
and education and look at what's happening here.

21:30.860 --> 21:35.100
So you could see some of the smarter ones leaving,

21:35.100 --> 21:37.980
not looking at this as a viable choice for life.

21:37.980 --> 21:41.020
How did that change you, those few months?

21:42.020 --> 21:45.340
I had this motivation, this idealistic motivation

21:45.380 --> 21:47.180
in my head of making a difference

21:47.180 --> 21:52.180
and they drill a lot of nationalistic

21:55.820 --> 21:59.860
the flag marching, being part of a group

21:59.860 --> 22:02.340
and the group being behind you in all of this.

22:02.340 --> 22:05.420
What was the nationalistic pride?

22:05.420 --> 22:07.100
Was it in the nation of Mexico?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.420
Yeah, yeah.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.140
What's the vision of this great nation of Mexico?

22:11.140 --> 22:13.500
Did you believe, did it get into your blood?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.740
Yeah, it got into my,

22:15.140 --> 22:18.860
it's a indoctrination, it's a paramilitary group.

22:18.860 --> 22:22.740
So everything there is basically modeled after the military.

22:22.740 --> 22:25.500
So that's what they were trying to kind of instill in us.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.580
I was a team leader in there after three months,

22:30.580 --> 22:34.900
basically I was, we went through a bunch of trials,

22:34.900 --> 22:37.900
physical trials, mental trials and stuff like that.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.740
And some of us were named team leaders

22:40.740 --> 22:43.580
and I bought into it.

22:43.580 --> 22:46.340
I'm supposed to be here, look at me,

22:46.340 --> 22:51.340
I'm making headways, I'm sticking out a bit.

22:53.180 --> 22:57.940
And I was pretty proud of what I was going through there,

22:57.940 --> 23:00.980
six months, then you get the reality check

23:00.980 --> 23:02.820
when you signed the dotted line

23:02.820 --> 23:06.220
and how that none of it really meant anything

23:06.220 --> 23:08.580
as far as what we were about to go out and do.

23:08.580 --> 23:12.380
You know, an example of this,

23:12.380 --> 23:15.940
we were trained with a 92 FS Beretta,

23:15.940 --> 23:20.740
which is a nine millimeter pistol, Italian made.

23:20.740 --> 23:23.540
We got to shoot 20 rounds out of that gun.

23:24.540 --> 23:29.460
And then when we got out, we were handed a Glock 17,

23:29.460 --> 23:33.860
which I've never seen one in my life.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.700
I was trying to figure out where the safety was

23:36.700 --> 23:41.700
and a few other people there were handling those guns

23:41.700 --> 23:42.740
in a horrible manner.

23:44.860 --> 23:46.860
So we were very under trained, under equipped

23:46.860 --> 23:48.940
and there was a lot of assumptions about what we knew

23:48.940 --> 23:51.500
and all of a sudden we were being cast into this,

23:51.500 --> 23:55.660
the start of one of the bloodiest

23:55.660 --> 23:59.340
and longest lived modern conflicts in our history.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.620
That doesn't get called that,

24:00.620 --> 24:04.140
but it's basically been an ongoing war in Mexico

24:04.140 --> 24:09.140
that is still to this day amassing bodies.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.020
So the Mexican drug war.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.540
The Mexican drug war, which is,

24:14.820 --> 24:16.740
it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started

24:16.740 --> 24:18.420
because when I was going through training,

24:18.420 --> 24:20.660
there was already stuff going on.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.260
I went into training in 2004

24:23.260 --> 24:27.380
and there were already major cartel related events

24:27.380 --> 24:28.780
all over Mexico by then,

24:28.780 --> 24:33.140
but not at the size or scope as I was about to go into.

24:33.220 --> 24:37.180
When President Felipe Calderon took office down there

24:37.180 --> 24:39.500
and actually officially kicked it off

24:39.500 --> 24:42.700
by putting the military in play

24:42.700 --> 24:47.420
as part of it to basically militarize the drug war,

24:47.420 --> 24:48.860
including us.

24:48.860 --> 24:52.180
Who are the major players in this drug war?

24:52.180 --> 24:56.980
So the politicians, the military, the police force,

24:56.980 --> 25:01.980
the cartels, all Mexican, then the United States,

25:01.980 --> 25:06.740
China, just to lay out all the pieces on the board.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.900
First off, there are giant local drug markets in Mexico

25:09.900 --> 25:12.100
that are fought over,

25:12.100 --> 25:14.900
just local drug markets that are huge in scope.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.860
So no exporting to other locations.

25:16.860 --> 25:18.420
Just to start, yeah.

25:18.420 --> 25:21.100
So a big problem in Mexico

25:21.100 --> 25:22.580
is basically those local drug markets.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.340
And an example of that,

25:24.340 --> 25:25.700
and one I have a lot of experience with

25:25.700 --> 25:27.140
is the one in Tijuana,

25:27.140 --> 25:29.780
which not only feeds the local populace,

25:29.780 --> 25:31.780
but also feeds the populace from San Diego

25:32.620 --> 25:33.940
that crosses down into Tijuana

25:33.940 --> 25:35.540
and buys their product there.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.580
And now, a phenomenon that's occurring now

25:39.580 --> 25:42.820
is marijuana trafficking is going from California

25:42.820 --> 25:45.900
down into Mexico because they produce better weed,

25:45.900 --> 25:48.020
which is fascinating to see now.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.340
So there's already a channel

25:49.340 --> 25:51.260
and you're kind of like reusing that channel.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.300
Yeah, there's a lot of people and vehicles

25:53.300 --> 25:54.900
getting checked when they drive down.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.580
And Tijuana is being called San Diego South now

25:57.580 --> 26:02.220
because all the economic migrants are living down there.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.460
90% of all houses in Tijuana,

26:04.460 --> 26:06.460
new houses are being bought up by Americans.

26:06.460 --> 26:08.620
So that'll tell you something about the impact

26:08.620 --> 26:10.780
and change that's going on down there.

26:10.780 --> 26:12.220
So you have these local drug markets

26:12.220 --> 26:13.980
that are being fought over.

26:13.980 --> 26:16.780
You also have these drug routes that go through Mexico,

26:16.780 --> 26:18.660
up into Mexico, around Mexico,

26:18.660 --> 26:21.220
through the ocean, under the wall,

26:21.220 --> 26:24.100
drug tunnels over the wall.

26:24.100 --> 26:31.180
And on backpacks, on migrants that go up into the United States.

26:31.180 --> 26:34.780
Not only do the cartels make money off drug trafficking,

26:34.780 --> 26:38.620
but also extortion, money laundering,

26:38.620 --> 26:41.700
paid protection schemes.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.940
Any mining operation in Mexico will have to pay protection

26:44.940 --> 26:47.580
or else they'll get hit.

26:47.580 --> 26:50.100
A lot of times, the largest money makers

26:50.100 --> 26:51.220
for some of these criminal groups

26:51.220 --> 26:56.260
are protecting and taxing anybody that goes across the border.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.940
So that's also a big issue.

26:58.940 --> 27:03.500
And it's not just, again, some Americans think it's like the cartels.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.900
They imagine this single or maybe two or three groups.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.740
There's several out there.

27:09.740 --> 27:12.220
I don't have a current estimate, but last time I checked,

27:12.220 --> 27:17.380
it was somewhere in the vicinity of 50 to 70 different groups,

27:17.380 --> 27:19.180
some small, that just dedicate themselves

27:19.180 --> 27:21.260
to a single little town somewhere.

27:21.260 --> 27:23.700
There are armed groups that are basically in control of that area

27:23.700 --> 27:26.660
to some bigger federations, like the Sinaloa Cartel,

27:26.660 --> 27:31.580
which is probably currently the largest and most powerful one in Mexico,

27:31.580 --> 27:37.100
and the New Generation Cartel, which is growing exponentially right now.

27:37.100 --> 27:41.660
So these criminal groups are players in that conflict.

27:41.660 --> 27:47.660
Then another player that doesn't get talked about is politics, politicians.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.500
There's an ongoing discussion that has been going on, I think,

27:51.500 --> 27:57.860
since Trump was elected about cartels being terrorist organizations or not,

27:57.860 --> 28:00.260
or if they fit that description.

28:00.260 --> 28:05.700
Well, we are living through multiple assassinations

28:05.700 --> 28:08.540
on political candidates out in Mexico right now.

28:08.540 --> 28:14.020
And most of those assassinations are motivated by one side sponsoring

28:14.020 --> 28:16.740
one candidate and the other side sponsoring the other.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.580
What I mean by sides, I mean cartel groups.

28:19.580 --> 28:22.420
So they have elected officials that are on the take.

28:22.420 --> 28:27.100
And we have many governors who are under investigation on the run

28:27.100 --> 28:30.460
or in prison right now, state governors.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.820
So politics is involved in it.

28:31.820 --> 28:34.140
That's a big player as well.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.820
When you think about the cartel problems, you don't think,

28:36.820 --> 28:40.340
well, at least most people don't think about that aspect of it.

28:40.340 --> 28:46.300
So to have integrity as a politician in Mexico means you have no protection

28:46.300 --> 28:49.420
and under constant threat of assassination.

28:49.420 --> 28:53.140
We just seen the arrest and prosecution of the head of all

28:53.140 --> 28:57.420
Conrad cartel operations when I was active in the form of Garcia Luna,

28:57.420 --> 29:01.420
who was the guy, Felipe Calderon, who kicked off the drug war.

29:01.420 --> 29:02.540
That was his guy.

29:02.540 --> 29:06.340
Turns out he was on the take at that level.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.700
Is there a spectrum of how on the take you can be?

29:10.700 --> 29:13.060
Are there ethical lines that you can cross?

29:13.060 --> 29:14.220
Some of it is money.

29:14.220 --> 29:22.340
And then is it possible to operate in a gray area that does not

29:22.340 --> 29:27.820
result in destructive ethical violations, deep ethical violations?

29:27.820 --> 29:29.020
I have no idea.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.540
I don't think there is, realistically.

29:30.540 --> 29:34.420
I mean, anything that kind of supports some of these groups,

29:34.420 --> 29:36.860
you're supporting things of a horrible nature.

29:39.740 --> 29:42.060
I just posted recently on my Instagram account

29:42.060 --> 29:45.420
of a lady that was in Guanajuato.

29:45.420 --> 29:48.300
She's one of seven recently assassinated women that are

29:48.300 --> 29:52.340
looking for their kids, basically.

29:52.340 --> 29:56.540
There's a bunch of groups and organizations out there in Mexico,

29:56.540 --> 29:59.220
some in Tijuana that I've actually walked with,

29:59.220 --> 30:05.580
who are taking control of trying to find the bodies of their kids.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.740
That's her up there.

30:06.740 --> 30:11.780
Maria Carmela Vazquez, a mother who searched for a missing son,

30:11.780 --> 30:16.020
was shot to death outside her home on Sunday.

30:16.020 --> 30:19.700
Her son, Osmar Vazquez, disappeared on June 14th.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.500
The 46-year-old woman is the fifth mother to be killed this year

30:23.500 --> 30:25.780
while searching for their missing loved ones.

30:25.780 --> 30:30.620
She was a member of the Payamo Missing Person Collective.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.380
There's many groups out in Mexico who basically have given up

30:33.380 --> 30:37.140
on trusting the government to find their kids.

30:37.140 --> 30:42.940
The number of missing in Mexico is a debated topic

30:42.940 --> 30:46.420
because the government itself doesn't release those numbers

30:46.420 --> 30:49.420
or at least hasn't done a good job about keeping them

30:49.420 --> 30:51.980
and or releasing them.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.780
Mexico is a country that has industrialized body disposal.

30:55.780 --> 30:59.220
In Tijuana, we had the legendary stewmaker,

30:59.220 --> 31:04.980
which is a guy that basically used caustic acid

31:04.980 --> 31:09.780
to get rid of bodies at a massive level.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.820
So there's a separate operation for getting rid of bodies

31:12.820 --> 31:13.980
and murdering the people.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.820
At least in Tijuana we saw that phenomenon

31:15.820 --> 31:19.900
and it's obvious that it's going on all over Mexico.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.980
Who's having those discussions about mass murder

31:22.980 --> 31:23.980
and getting rid of people?

31:23.980 --> 31:26.980
I've been reading a lot about World War II recently

31:27.020 --> 31:29.900
and there was aggressive innovation on the Nazi side

31:29.900 --> 31:32.140
of how to get rid of a large number of people.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.020
That's for the longest time both the Soviets

31:34.020 --> 31:36.580
and the Soviets were more brutal with this.

31:36.580 --> 31:39.340
It's literally, it's a engineering problem

31:39.340 --> 31:41.380
of how you kill a large number of people

31:41.380 --> 31:42.740
and get rid of their bodies.

31:42.740 --> 31:47.740
So the Soviets were more into just laying people down

31:48.820 --> 31:50.900
into the grave face down

31:50.900 --> 31:52.620
and then shooting them in the back of the head

31:52.620 --> 31:53.860
and then doing that on a mass scale.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.700
So you just pile people on

31:55.740 --> 31:57.860
and then there was obviously innovation with the Holocaust

31:57.860 --> 32:00.820
in terms of gassing people and all that kind of stuff.

32:00.820 --> 32:05.380
I'm not sure exactly where these trade craft skills

32:05.380 --> 32:07.300
are coming from specifically.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.940
You hear discussions of Israelis training

32:09.940 --> 32:13.420
some of the cartel groups back in the late 90s,

32:13.420 --> 32:15.220
specifically the Ariana Fias Cartel.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.140
There's a lot of stories about that.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.500
A security specialist coming down and showing them things

32:19.500 --> 32:21.300
like how to make caustic soda,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.420
how to put rocks inside of bodies

32:24.420 --> 32:26.260
and then chicken wire them around

32:26.260 --> 32:28.700
and throw them into the ocean or river

32:28.700 --> 32:30.860
so that the bodies don't float.

32:30.860 --> 32:31.860
And when you kind of-

32:31.860 --> 32:33.260
You put rocks inside a body

32:33.260 --> 32:34.700
to make sure the body doesn't float?

32:34.700 --> 32:38.740
So you open up the intestinal tract, put rocks inside,

32:39.700 --> 32:41.580
you cut where tattoos are,

32:41.580 --> 32:44.900
you take off hands and faces and throw them somewhere else

32:44.900 --> 32:46.300
and you wrap them in chicken wire.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.900
So make it not identifiable.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.660
Yeah, and throw them into a body of water.

32:50.660 --> 32:53.980
And this is a horrible thing

32:54.660 --> 32:55.500
but it's actually-

32:55.500 --> 32:56.340
It's a craft.

32:56.340 --> 32:57.180
It's a trade craft.

32:57.180 --> 33:00.740
It's trade craft and there's a link to the US

33:00.740 --> 33:02.060
as far as some of that trade craft.

33:02.060 --> 33:04.620
You have to remember that the United States

33:04.620 --> 33:08.660
had a thing called School of the Americas and the CIA

33:08.660 --> 33:10.500
and they showed things

33:10.500 --> 33:12.980
and a lot of that stuff is out there

33:12.980 --> 33:16.500
in the hands of people that are of that generation.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.340
So there's a manual-

33:18.340 --> 33:19.700
There's a manual somewhere.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.540
Like with chapters and it's like how to get rid of the body.

33:22.540 --> 33:23.540
There's manuals out there.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.780
Under time constraints

33:25.780 --> 33:30.780
or how identifiable can the body be afterwards?

33:31.020 --> 33:32.940
What are geographical constraints?

33:32.940 --> 33:33.780
All that kind of stuff.

33:33.780 --> 33:37.420
I think that was common back in the early 2000s

33:37.420 --> 33:39.020
and maybe the late 90s

33:39.020 --> 33:41.140
when some of these things were going on

33:41.140 --> 33:43.420
but they've lost even that

33:43.420 --> 33:46.580
as far as respect for the government or bodies being found.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.660
Right now, what you usually see is just bodies being burnt

33:49.660 --> 33:51.500
to a crisp and buried in a field somewhere.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.100
That's usually what you'll see.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.020
Some of the groups like this woman

33:57.420 --> 33:59.500
belong to basically taking upon themselves

33:59.500 --> 34:03.260
to go out to find clandestine graves

34:03.260 --> 34:07.620
in the outskirts of the towns that they live in,

34:08.700 --> 34:11.380
probing the ground with these metal probes

34:12.460 --> 34:15.620
and seeing if whatever they encounter

34:15.620 --> 34:20.300
in the bottom of these clandestine graves stinks or not.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.900
If they find IDs or clothing, they kind of gather that

34:23.060 --> 34:26.660
and they basically present it to the investigative authorities

34:26.660 --> 34:28.500
in the towns or the states they live in,

34:28.500 --> 34:30.340
which basically are doing their jobs.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.140
Over 90% of all murders in Mexico were never solved.

34:36.220 --> 34:38.140
So they've even stopped trying

34:38.140 --> 34:39.740
to get rid of bodies in that way.

34:41.660 --> 34:45.660
How does a cartel take power?

34:45.660 --> 34:49.060
How does it gain control of this local area

34:49.060 --> 34:50.740
that you mentioned and then grow,

34:51.700 --> 34:53.740
take control of a region?

34:53.740 --> 34:58.700
And how does it do so in this dynamic relationship

34:58.700 --> 35:03.700
between politicians and the military and the police force?

35:03.780 --> 35:06.100
It's a thing that happens over time.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.020
There has always been a big effort, even when I was in,

35:09.020 --> 35:13.460
to buy or own certain members of the police force,

35:13.460 --> 35:14.700
even when we're going through training.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.500
Some people get pulled out during training

35:16.500 --> 35:19.340
because they were found out to have some sort of parent

35:19.340 --> 35:21.780
or sibling that was a cartel member

35:21.780 --> 35:26.460
or their FBI background check came back negative

35:26.460 --> 35:28.820
when they were already in the training program.

35:30.180 --> 35:34.740
So I think part of it is, first off,

35:34.740 --> 35:36.340
they take advantage of the fact

35:36.340 --> 35:37.780
that Mexico is a young country.

35:37.780 --> 35:39.380
It's a country of young people.

35:40.380 --> 35:43.980
We have a big group of young people

35:43.980 --> 35:48.380
that have little to no opportunities to come up.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.060
When I went to take that career path,

35:52.060 --> 35:54.780
a lot of my friends took the other option.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.380
They went to work for some of these criminal groups.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.500
So they have this going for them.

36:00.500 --> 36:04.300
They basically have a lot of bodies to hire cheaply.

36:04.300 --> 36:08.100
And leverage in terms of forcing those bodies

36:08.100 --> 36:09.620
to do whatever is needed

36:09.620 --> 36:12.180
because the alternative for those people is nothing.

36:12.180 --> 36:13.340
There's no options.

36:13.340 --> 36:17.140
So you have a kid somewhere who is working on a field

36:17.140 --> 36:19.780
or you have a kid like me that was out of the job,

36:19.780 --> 36:21.420
out of school.

36:21.420 --> 36:25.380
And the only options for me was this ad in the newspaper,

36:25.380 --> 36:26.780
which seemed like a long shot,

36:26.780 --> 36:30.660
or going with some of my friends that had cars now

36:30.660 --> 36:33.220
and were hanging out all night at these bars.

36:33.220 --> 36:38.220
And some of them had Draco AK-47 pistols in their cars

36:39.220 --> 36:40.340
and it looked cool.

36:41.260 --> 36:42.700
So there is a trajectory,

36:42.700 --> 36:44.980
there's many trajectories possible in your life

36:44.980 --> 36:48.140
where you could have been still operating

36:48.140 --> 36:51.540
in a criminal organization in Mexico.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.780
Yeah, I mean, there's not a lot of options.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.740
Do you think you'd be good at it?

36:56.740 --> 36:57.580
I don't know.

36:57.580 --> 36:58.980
I mean, I'm pretty good at what I do now,

36:58.980 --> 37:00.500
which is teaching people how to detect it

37:00.500 --> 37:01.940
and kind of fight against it.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.300
So I think...

37:03.300 --> 37:07.180
I have a sense that the skills transfer pretty well.

37:07.180 --> 37:10.020
That's also the dark side of this whole thing.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.100
A lot of the people that I used to work with,

37:12.100 --> 37:14.180
I know things and I have them training

37:14.220 --> 37:15.660
and I had some specialized training

37:15.660 --> 37:19.020
and I currently do, I've done presentations

37:19.020 --> 37:21.580
for the Secret Service and the FBI and you name it.

37:21.580 --> 37:23.700
I've gone there and shown them what I do.

37:24.820 --> 37:26.980
A lot of the people that I used to work with

37:26.980 --> 37:29.460
who are out of the job are in the wind.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.220
And some of these people are way more trained than I am.

37:33.100 --> 37:38.100
It's interesting what the reason why I get looked for

37:38.340 --> 37:39.740
and they ask me questions is because

37:39.740 --> 37:41.100
I actually have the experience

37:41.260 --> 37:45.180
that my university was the most dangerous city on the planet.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.380
And when people ask me about some of that stuff,

37:47.380 --> 37:48.500
I could speak from experience

37:48.500 --> 37:51.140
as far as encountering some of that directly.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.460
Some of the people that I used to work with

37:52.460 --> 37:56.140
who were way better at it than I am are in the wind.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.660
Interesting thing in Mexico,

37:57.660 --> 37:59.420
if you are of a police organization

37:59.420 --> 38:03.580
and you get fired or you quit,

38:03.580 --> 38:06.660
you are ineligible to join another police organization

38:06.660 --> 38:08.420
that discounts you.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.580
So for somebody like me who was a professional

38:11.580 --> 38:14.260
operations group member or police officer in Mexico

38:14.260 --> 38:18.700
of that region, there's no options for me outside of that.

38:18.700 --> 38:22.140
So they themselves basically have created this

38:22.140 --> 38:24.140
inescapable box for some of these people

38:24.140 --> 38:25.500
that go into that line of work.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.540
And where do they go after?

38:29.780 --> 38:33.100
I've heard offers of $12,000 to join

38:33.100 --> 38:35.260
some of the organizations out there.

38:35.260 --> 38:39.540
Plus, they get benefits, not like the government.

38:39.540 --> 38:42.980
I'm still waiting for my liquidation check.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.940
This has been out of service for like six, seven years.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.380
I'm still waiting for my check.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.660
So some of these people,

38:50.660 --> 38:52.820
it's obvious that the opportunities are presented

38:52.820 --> 38:55.140
to them out there are stronger.

38:55.140 --> 38:59.500
And again, the youth is what gets eaten by this war.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.500
And that's one of the main things that they start with,

39:02.500 --> 39:03.940
just the youth.

39:03.980 --> 39:08.820
We had a phenomenon in Tijuana late 90s, early 2000s

39:08.820 --> 39:10.220
called the Narco Juniors.

39:10.220 --> 39:15.220
Narco Juniors were basically middle-class

39:15.220 --> 39:18.300
or upper-class families, had kids that were bored

39:18.300 --> 39:21.060
and they just joined some of these cartel groups.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.420
These cartel groups saw in them opportunities

39:23.420 --> 39:25.580
to get into regular industry,

39:25.580 --> 39:27.540
to go through the family businesses,

39:27.540 --> 39:29.220
to kind of establish themselves,

39:29.220 --> 39:32.460
use some of those businesses for storage

39:32.460 --> 39:35.380
or figure out how to use some of their transportation

39:35.380 --> 39:37.180
businesses for drug mueling.

39:37.180 --> 39:42.100
So this is how they start getting into different areas

39:42.100 --> 39:44.220
that they regularly couldn't.

39:44.220 --> 39:47.340
And that's how it starts.

39:47.340 --> 39:52.100
You owe somebody, they get into paid protection

39:52.100 --> 39:55.180
type schemes, which are also common all over Mexico.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.300
And sooner or later, they start owning businesses

39:59.300 --> 40:02.420
and they regulate some of their income.

40:03.420 --> 40:07.540
So they become part of the local economy in a big way.

40:07.540 --> 40:08.980
I had this experience in Sinaloa

40:08.980 --> 40:11.660
where we were driving down this shitty street

40:11.660 --> 40:14.380
and all of a sudden it became a cool, nice,

40:14.380 --> 40:16.420
curvy highway type thing.

40:16.420 --> 40:19.300
And I looked around there, it's like, this is a nice road.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.460
And the guy was with me, he said,

40:20.460 --> 40:21.820
yeah, the cartels built it.

40:23.460 --> 40:24.580
He goes to some of these towns

40:24.580 --> 40:26.980
and the cartels are the government there.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.980
They build the hospitals, they build the churches,

40:28.980 --> 40:30.620
they build the schools.

40:30.700 --> 40:34.220
COVID happens, they're enforcing the mask mandates.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.980
They're out enforcing the mask mandates,

40:36.980 --> 40:39.060
the stay-at-home policies.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.340
They're the ones delivering supplies

40:41.340 --> 40:45.460
to the townspeople in bags, courtesy of so-and-so cartel.

40:46.580 --> 40:51.060
So they become the Robin Hood characters

40:51.060 --> 40:51.900
of their environments.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.900
If they're smart, these groups basically turn into that,

40:54.900 --> 40:57.700
Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor,

40:57.700 --> 41:00.140
or at least that's the projection that they give.

41:01.620 --> 41:04.900
What's the role of violence in this operation?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.580
I'm extreme.

41:06.580 --> 41:09.340
It used to be that there were rules, as you say,

41:09.340 --> 41:13.340
like, don't go after kids, don't go after women,

41:13.340 --> 41:15.300
but all those things are gone now.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.260
They had been gone for decades, I think.

41:19.900 --> 41:22.980
The escalation of violence, you kill one of mine,

41:22.980 --> 41:24.140
I'll kill four of yours.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.220
You kill four of mine, I'll go after your family

41:26.220 --> 41:27.460
because you're hiding.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.780
There's stories of high-level cartel people

41:30.780 --> 41:35.780
getting their sons and daughters murdered, mutilated,

41:36.060 --> 41:38.060
and revenge killings.

41:38.060 --> 41:42.060
So I think it's at a point where it spiraled out

41:42.060 --> 41:45.660
of semblance of a rule set, as far as who can get exposed

41:45.660 --> 41:47.140
to some of this violence.

41:47.140 --> 41:49.260
Those highly-produced ISIS videos,

41:50.260 --> 41:52.460
where they show torture and executions,

41:54.260 --> 41:56.060
according to some of the sources that I've talked about,

41:56.060 --> 41:57.740
according to some of the sources that I've talked to

41:57.740 --> 41:58.740
here in the United States,

41:58.740 --> 42:01.300
that were looking at that phenomenon.

42:01.300 --> 42:04.380
They said that it seems to be that that was influenced

42:04.380 --> 42:06.740
by some of the narco blog videos

42:06.740 --> 42:11.020
that were coming out of Mexico in the early 2000s.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.940
Basically, some of these groups were the first ones

42:12.940 --> 42:17.940
that got wind of the fact that you can export terror

42:17.940 --> 42:22.020
or the horror that an execution has through social media.

42:22.060 --> 42:27.060
Way back when Facebook was a bit more of a wildland area,

42:27.060 --> 42:29.460
you could see these in news feeds,

42:29.460 --> 42:32.020
videos of executions, tortures, and stuff like that

42:32.020 --> 42:32.980
coming out of Mexico.

42:32.980 --> 42:34.060
On Facebook?

42:34.060 --> 42:34.900
Way back when.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.740
Wow.

42:35.740 --> 42:37.060
This was a different time.

42:38.820 --> 42:41.660
For people who criticize social media and the moderation,

42:41.660 --> 42:46.660
it's a tough job because the brutal world out there.

42:46.980 --> 42:49.500
I mean, I remember seeing some of these ISIS videos

42:49.740 --> 42:51.460
on Facebook way back when,

42:51.460 --> 42:53.900
and they cracked down on all that.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.580
But one that's kind of clear,

42:56.580 --> 42:59.860
and I'm not gonna say where to find it,

42:59.860 --> 43:01.700
but people out there might have seen it

43:01.700 --> 43:03.260
because some of these videos get shared

43:03.260 --> 43:07.060
through WhatsApp groups and chat groups out there.

43:07.060 --> 43:09.340
One of the ones that caught my attention way back when

43:09.340 --> 43:12.840
was a guy getting, two guys getting executed by a chainsaw.

43:13.840 --> 43:18.840
And people can kind of imagine what that would be like,

43:20.920 --> 43:21.760
but-

43:21.760 --> 43:23.040
This is produced on purpose?

43:23.040 --> 43:24.520
Like it's videotaped on purpose?

43:24.520 --> 43:28.040
It's a cartel group caught two rival cartel members,

43:28.040 --> 43:30.960
and a way to send a message to those,

43:30.960 --> 43:34.880
the rival cartel is to basically execute these people

43:34.880 --> 43:35.880
in front of a camera.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.600
I mean, you can't get to your rivals,

43:38.600 --> 43:42.120
but you can make them see what they're doing,

43:42.200 --> 43:45.640
or at least make their people look at what happens

43:45.640 --> 43:48.360
if you invade their territory.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.320
So it's an escalation of brutality in the violence as well?

43:51.320 --> 43:52.160
I mean-

43:52.160 --> 43:53.240
And at least a terror,

43:53.240 --> 43:55.720
and the mass communication of terror.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.440
Yeah, I mean, you have videos of some of these people

43:58.440 --> 44:01.080
engaging in cannibalism in front of a video

44:01.080 --> 44:02.480
to see how brutal they are,

44:02.480 --> 44:07.480
or people taking out somebody's heart while they're alive,

44:07.520 --> 44:08.520
and filming it.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.920
And it used to be social media as a whole,

44:10.920 --> 44:12.040
you would see some of these videos,

44:12.040 --> 44:16.560
they would get put down in a few days.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.680
But now there's telegram groups,

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
there's live leaks,

44:21.240 --> 44:23.200
there's a bunch of other sites out there

44:23.200 --> 44:25.520
that kind of disperse some of these videos,

44:25.520 --> 44:29.080
and it's basically a bulletin board for them

44:29.080 --> 44:31.360
as far as, hey, you got into my territory,

44:31.360 --> 44:33.200
well, this is what's gonna happen to you.

44:34.600 --> 44:38.400
Is there a game theoretic way

44:38.400 --> 44:41.280
to remove this kind of brutality,

44:41.280 --> 44:42.840
to deescalate the brutality?

44:42.840 --> 44:46.040
Because it seems like if a cartel takes power

44:46.040 --> 44:49.680
that exceeds the power of politicians in a locality,

44:49.680 --> 44:52.800
there's a strong incentive to reduce the brutality,

44:52.800 --> 44:57.000
to crack down on this kind of chainsaw executions.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
You know, there was a recent leak of government files,

45:03.560 --> 45:05.200
called the Guacamaya leaks.

45:05.200 --> 45:08.240
It's our version of WikiLeaks, I guess.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.240
And it was mostly documents

45:11.240 --> 45:13.520
coming out of the Mexican military.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.360
I haven't seen it talked about a lot here in stateside,

45:16.360 --> 45:18.680
but it's a pretty big thing down in Mexico.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.760
And in some of those documents,

45:19.760 --> 45:23.240
it reveals how powerless the government is,

45:23.240 --> 45:25.080
I mean, as far as the military goes.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.000
So that's another player in Mexico, the military.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.960
The military has been out in force in the streets,

45:32.960 --> 45:34.640
basically doing a policing role

45:34.640 --> 45:37.520
since Felipe Calderon was the administration.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.880
He basically militarized the drug war.

45:41.680 --> 45:45.640
Felipe Calderon was to the right of the political spectrum.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.600
And his main rival, who was his way to the left,

45:48.600 --> 45:49.760
is now in power.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.440
And one of the campaign promises he had

45:53.440 --> 45:57.200
was to demilitarize the drug war,

45:57.200 --> 46:00.480
to send the military back to its barracks and all that.

46:00.480 --> 46:01.920
And he's basically continuing on.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.960
They just passed some legislation

46:03.960 --> 46:06.480
that basically keeps the military on the streets

46:06.480 --> 46:08.240
for a few more years.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.880
And I think some of these documents that were leaked

46:13.880 --> 46:16.560
are very telling as far as why that is.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.480
The military now has a vast amount of power

46:21.480 --> 46:24.200
when it comes to security industry.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.960
I mean, they're in charge of building airports

46:25.960 --> 46:27.520
and train lines in Mexico now.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.560
Their documents themselves show how certain regions

46:33.560 --> 46:37.640
in Mexico who have a specific military presence

46:37.640 --> 46:40.440
work for one side or favor one side of the cartel.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.240
They're corrupted, too.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.080
So there's these military forces that are in part corrupted.

46:45.080 --> 46:46.160
Yes.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.240
And the cartel, who operates with violence,

46:49.240 --> 46:51.200
somehow finding a balance between each other.

46:51.200 --> 46:55.320
And it just feels like, throughout human history,

46:55.320 --> 47:00.320
there's dictators or leaders that come

47:01.040 --> 47:03.360
into situations like this and really crack down

47:04.200 --> 47:05.280
on the violence.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.040
It seems like that's not happening.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.560
It seems like there's a kind of market

47:09.560 --> 47:11.040
of violence happening here.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.120
There's a systemic amnesia that happens

47:13.120 --> 47:15.160
every presidency in Mexico.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.880
So the president comes in.

47:17.880 --> 47:21.120
He has five to six years to do whatever he needs to do.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.280
And he does everything.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.080
And as soon as he's gone, everything he did,

47:25.080 --> 47:30.080
even what was working, gets chopped off.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.040
Police organizations get defunct

47:33.040 --> 47:35.240
or their names get changed.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.880
Uniforms change.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.760
So there's a lot of turnover everywhere?

47:39.760 --> 47:41.960
Every five years, federally, there's a turnover.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.480
And things change.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.320
What about the cartels?

47:44.320 --> 47:45.600
Do they persist?

47:45.600 --> 47:46.440
Yeah.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.280
Do the leadership persist?

47:47.280 --> 47:52.160
I mean, the Sinaloa cartel has had a figurehead

47:52.160 --> 47:54.800
behind it since the 80s, the same one.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.720
I mean, it's a federation of smaller cartels

47:58.720 --> 47:59.800
that are all kind of linked up.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.080
But pretty much, historically,

48:02.080 --> 48:04.240
he was considered the head of the Sinaloa cartel.

48:04.240 --> 48:08.280
El Mayo Sambada has been there since the 80s.

48:08.280 --> 48:11.400
So in a way, yeah, he's persisting.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.560
He's surviving all of these presidencies.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.480
Again, these documents that were leaked

48:17.480 --> 48:20.840
are a clear sign of what strengths and weaknesses

48:20.840 --> 48:23.880
there are as far as the government's main weapon

48:23.880 --> 48:27.000
against somebody's criminal group, which is the military.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.360
And if people doubt this,

48:29.360 --> 48:30.880
they can look it up now online

48:30.880 --> 48:33.000
because all these documents are out there.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.040
But just a clear thing,

48:36.040 --> 48:38.840
the Mexican Navy or the Marina

48:38.840 --> 48:40.600
doesn't work with the Mexican Army.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.920
They don't speak to each other.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.240
So that should tell you everything you need to know

48:44.240 --> 48:46.120
as far as trust.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.120
That could be just bureaucratic dysfunction.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.640
They don't trust each other.

48:49.640 --> 48:53.080
Are they both struggling with the problem of corruption?

48:53.080 --> 48:55.360
Some of these documents that are already out there

48:55.360 --> 48:59.040
talk about the ports in Mexico,

48:59.040 --> 49:00.960
which are probably the main conduit

49:00.960 --> 49:03.120
of precursors of methamphetamines

49:03.120 --> 49:06.520
and precursors of things like fentanyl into the country.

49:06.520 --> 49:10.000
They're operated and guarded by the Marina, right?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.520
So these things are happening under their watch.

49:12.520 --> 49:17.520
And then you get talks about the Army in certain places,

49:17.720 --> 49:22.160
basically working counter cartel operations

49:22.160 --> 49:25.040
to specifically one side, not another.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.520
As far as the rival groups out there.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.120
And we have a long history of some of these groups going,

49:30.120 --> 49:31.440
military groups going rogue.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.440
Los Etas are a prime example of this.

49:33.440 --> 49:37.760
These special forces units that basically turned around

49:37.760 --> 49:40.200
and went to work as bodyguards for the Gulf cartel.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.000
And then decided to,

49:43.000 --> 49:43.880
but what they basically did

49:43.880 --> 49:46.440
was an internship with a cartel.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.520
They went out there, did bodyguarding for the Gulf cartel

49:50.520 --> 49:52.800
and then realized they can do a better job

49:52.800 --> 49:53.640
than they were doing.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.440
They started their own, sparking off one of the,

49:56.440 --> 49:57.680
again, one of the bloodiest,

49:57.680 --> 50:01.840
the kind of like internal cartel wars in Mexico's history.

50:02.760 --> 50:03.960
Who was El Chapo?

50:03.960 --> 50:05.640
El Chapo was a part of the leadership

50:05.640 --> 50:08.040
or at least a faction of the leadership in the cartel.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.120
It's a federation of different, of small organizations.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.120
Well, I'd say small organizations,

50:13.120 --> 50:14.720
basically families or organizations

50:14.720 --> 50:17.280
that conform this larger group,

50:17.280 --> 50:21.320
which is the Sinaloa cartel that is based out of Sinaloa.

50:21.320 --> 50:26.320
Basically, they are people that have family

50:27.000 --> 50:29.240
and power nucleuses there in Sinaloa.

50:29.240 --> 50:32.000
I mean, who was he?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.480
I think he was a high-level operator

50:34.480 --> 50:35.600
for the Sinaloa cartel.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.520
He had his own drug routes, his own networks,

50:38.520 --> 50:41.680
his family nucleus down there

50:41.680 --> 50:44.080
still in control of some of those operations.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.840
So his arrest really didn't change anything.

50:47.800 --> 50:51.960
But he wasn't the mastermind, number one leader

50:51.960 --> 50:54.920
that I think the media and the government

50:54.920 --> 50:56.600
kind of portrayed him as.

50:56.600 --> 50:58.640
Who was the mastermind?

50:58.640 --> 51:02.480
If you go down there and you read

51:02.480 --> 51:07.480
what most of the brave journalists in Mexico that we have,

51:08.120 --> 51:09.760
say, another aspect of this war

51:09.760 --> 51:11.240
is that a lot of journalists get killed.

51:11.240 --> 51:14.840
I think Mexico has some of the top numbers in the world.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.160
And this is no secret to anybody.

51:18.160 --> 51:22.720
El Mayo Zambada is the name of the historical figurehead

51:22.720 --> 51:27.120
of this cartel or at least somebody who people theorize

51:27.120 --> 51:30.920
or suspect to be the main guy or the main person

51:30.920 --> 51:33.280
that is in charge of some of the sub-discriminal group.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.920
Is he still alive?

51:34.920 --> 51:37.560
That's a going rumor that he's still very much alive.

51:37.560 --> 51:38.640
And the interesting thing about him

51:38.640 --> 51:41.040
is that he learned his craft in Los Angeles.

51:41.040 --> 51:44.520
So people thinking that Sinaloa cartel isn't a Mexican thing,

51:45.200 --> 51:49.280
it's actually, he apparently learned a lot of his craft

51:49.280 --> 51:52.000
from people in the United States.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.720
And that's the craft of leadership,

51:53.720 --> 51:56.680
the craft of business, the craft of which aspect of the craft?

51:56.680 --> 52:00.240
The craft of getting a product from Colombia,

52:00.240 --> 52:01.560
putting it through Mexico.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.400
The logistics.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.600
The logistics part of it.

52:06.280 --> 52:11.280
And he somehow is operating in the shadows,

52:11.760 --> 52:13.320
so he's not a known entity.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.880
I don't have a clear number of this,

52:14.880 --> 52:16.680
but he was interviewed by a magazine

52:16.680 --> 52:18.720
called Proceso in Mexico.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.880
And some pictures were taken of him.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.600
This was over 10 years ago, probably.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.640
And that's the last time anybody's ever seen

52:24.640 --> 52:25.680
a picture of him.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.360
What's it like to be a journalist in that?

52:27.360 --> 52:31.600
So can a journalist have a conversation with him and live?

52:31.600 --> 52:34.280
Nonetheless, he asks to have that conversation.

52:34.280 --> 52:38.420
I think he reached out to this journalist to talk about it.

52:39.260 --> 52:43.260
There's a media wing to the work that we do,

52:43.260 --> 52:45.900
a sister page called Demolir.

52:45.900 --> 52:49.380
And it's run by some pretty good people.

52:49.380 --> 52:52.700
And the way we met is that I was basically training them

52:52.700 --> 52:54.260
how to work in hostile environments.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.940
And they were like, oh, we're gonna go report

52:55.940 --> 52:58.460
on cartel activity in Mexico.

52:58.460 --> 53:03.460
And I was like, you know, that is a year and a half ago,

53:03.940 --> 53:08.540
a reporter went to the president's daily briefing,

53:08.540 --> 53:09.680
press conference that he has.

53:09.680 --> 53:14.680
They called him La Mayanera, President Manuel Lopez Obrador,

53:14.940 --> 53:17.220
and told him to his face, like,

53:17.220 --> 53:19.820
I have threats on my life, they're trying to kill me.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.100
And it happened.

53:23.100 --> 53:25.460
There's been a slew of assassinations and murders

53:25.460 --> 53:27.220
of members of the press all over Mexico.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.840
It's not an easy job.

53:29.120 --> 53:33.080
Either they say too much,

53:33.080 --> 53:36.000
or they say things that favor one side or the other,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.400
which is another aspect of it that is interesting.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.720
I don't consider myself a reporter.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.520
I don't report on the news in Mexico.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.080
I have friends that do that very well.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.760
I commentate on some of it only.

53:47.760 --> 53:51.160
But you see a lot of these cartel reporters go down there,

53:51.160 --> 53:52.380
talk to a specific side,

53:52.380 --> 53:55.440
and basically speak one side of the story.

53:55.440 --> 53:58.760
And that is not something that the other side wants.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.800
If you go down there and speak to one side,

54:01.800 --> 54:04.320
you're saying what they want people to know or hear.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.640
So in a way, you're kind of spreading

54:05.640 --> 54:08.240
some of their cartel propaganda, in a way.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.120
And that's how some people get shot.

54:12.120 --> 54:16.120
Do you think it's possible to go in there

54:16.120 --> 54:20.180
and have a conversation with a cartel leader?

54:20.180 --> 54:21.020
Well, Sean Penn.

54:21.020 --> 54:23.800
Or somebody like me, for somebody like Sean Penn.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.160
This is what I will say.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.860
After that whole Sean Penn thing,

54:27.900 --> 54:30.220
I think a lot of people would reconsider

54:30.220 --> 54:32.120
a meeting with anybody of any level

54:32.120 --> 54:34.300
that has any variety here in the United States.

54:34.300 --> 54:36.660
They wouldn't trust anybody to get that close.

54:37.980 --> 54:39.900
There are people out there that will talk to reporters

54:39.900 --> 54:42.860
and help people that are working on a laboratory

54:42.860 --> 54:45.460
somewhere in a hillside, somewhere down south,

54:45.460 --> 54:49.640
the Sierra, low-level people that get authorization

54:49.640 --> 54:51.300
to speak to reporters and stuff like that.

54:51.300 --> 54:53.140
But they don't say anything that isn't being taught

54:53.140 --> 54:55.180
or shown in various different ways

54:55.180 --> 54:56.960
or outlets out there for them.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.040
I mean, some of these guys have Instagram accounts.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.000
Some of these guys have blog about it.

55:01.000 --> 55:01.840
But not the leaders.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.760
TikTok, no, not the leaders.

55:03.760 --> 55:07.040
I think after what happened to Oshawa Guzman,

55:07.040 --> 55:11.080
I think that opportunity, that window was closed

55:11.080 --> 55:13.560
for some of the leadership down there.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.160
I think, I disagree.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.340
I think they're just more sensitive,

55:18.520 --> 55:21.720
realizing that there has to be a deep trust.

55:21.720 --> 55:24.740
It's not just anybody and not any high profile.

55:24.740 --> 55:26.420
I've gotten a chance to speak

55:26.420 --> 55:28.140
to some very high profile leaders

55:28.140 --> 55:30.100
that don't speak to journalists.

55:30.100 --> 55:32.760
And they understand the value of trust.

55:33.700 --> 55:37.660
If they have something to say, which I don't think they do,

55:37.660 --> 55:41.660
I don't think they, unless at some point in the future,

55:41.660 --> 55:44.900
which is something I suspect might be coming,

55:44.900 --> 55:48.580
that there is some sort of armed intervention

55:48.580 --> 55:52.180
and or external attack on some of these criminal groups

55:53.180 --> 55:55.820
that really puts the pressure on them.

55:55.820 --> 55:59.380
You don't think there's a human aspect to this,

55:59.380 --> 56:03.140
of a human being wanting their story to be known?

56:03.140 --> 56:07.580
Versus, this is different than the propaganda machine

56:07.580 --> 56:11.080
of I have something to say, I have some message

56:11.080 --> 56:14.540
to put out there to play the game of politics and power

56:14.540 --> 56:15.980
and money and all that kind of stuff.

56:15.980 --> 56:19.220
Isn't there also a human being underneath all that armor

56:19.260 --> 56:24.180
that for the sake of perhaps ego, legacy,

56:24.180 --> 56:25.980
wants to be understood?

56:25.980 --> 56:28.500
I think in a way, they already do that.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.500
There's corridos, which are basically Mexican folk songs

56:31.500 --> 56:34.140
that get sung about some of them.

56:34.140 --> 56:38.700
So in a way, some of these singers are reporting

56:38.700 --> 56:39.660
on some of their lives.

56:39.660 --> 56:43.380
And it's a great honor to have a corrido made about you.

56:43.380 --> 56:46.940
Somebody made a corrido about me based on my interviews.

56:46.940 --> 56:49.020
I didn't pay for it, so it's a real one.

56:49.860 --> 56:50.700
It feels cool.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.380
So creating a myth, the legend of the man.

56:53.380 --> 56:57.980
I think it's about, I think a way you can find somebody

56:57.980 --> 57:01.580
like that is somebody that wants to get their story

57:01.580 --> 57:06.580
specifically clear and straight, coming from that culture

57:07.660 --> 57:10.660
and getting to work for the government down there

57:10.660 --> 57:13.540
and then not working for the government down there

57:13.540 --> 57:15.340
and being on the outside, being critical

57:15.340 --> 57:17.260
of not only the government that is in place now,

57:17.340 --> 57:19.660
but also the government that I actually work with.

57:19.660 --> 57:21.620
I can tell you that there's villains

57:21.620 --> 57:22.780
all over the place down there.

57:22.780 --> 57:25.340
Everybody's a villain at all levels

57:25.340 --> 57:26.660
and in some way, shape, or form.

57:26.660 --> 57:29.500
And some of these people, I think in a way,

57:29.500 --> 57:32.300
including El Chapo, I think that some of that meeting

57:32.300 --> 57:35.420
was about film rights and stories

57:35.420 --> 57:38.020
and being able to get his story out there.

57:38.020 --> 57:40.940
I think, I'm not too sure because I wasn't there,

57:40.940 --> 57:43.340
but I suspect that some of that was going on.

57:44.220 --> 57:47.260
If you can bring an honest voice down there,

57:47.260 --> 57:49.860
they can trust to put that out there.

57:51.980 --> 57:53.900
I think you could try.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.580
I'm interested in that kind of thing

57:56.580 --> 57:59.060
because ultimately, in some of those places,

58:00.980 --> 58:03.540
inside a cartel at the very top

58:03.540 --> 58:07.580
is when you can really look at the raw aspects

58:07.580 --> 58:11.140
of human nature in a way you can't necessarily elsewhere.

58:11.180 --> 58:13.940
There's a youth coming into power down there.

58:13.940 --> 58:15.380
And when I say youth, I mean,

58:15.380 --> 58:16.980
some of the old guard is going out

58:16.980 --> 58:18.820
and some of the new guard is coming in.

58:18.820 --> 58:22.580
An example of this is El Chapo Guzman's sons

58:22.580 --> 58:24.980
who are now in their own right

58:24.980 --> 58:27.140
kind of gaining legendary status.

58:28.580 --> 58:30.300
There was an attempted arrest on his son

58:30.300 --> 58:34.860
that led to the famous Culiacanazo incident,

58:34.860 --> 58:36.580
which we are now learning more about

58:36.580 --> 58:38.420
because some of the Guacamaya leagues

58:38.420 --> 58:41.780
are kind of speaking more about what happened that day.

58:42.820 --> 58:45.020
Basically, a federal operation,

58:46.420 --> 58:49.980
they say to arrest El Chapo Guzman's son

58:52.340 --> 58:55.740
turned into a siege to try and get him free.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.460
They called in the Calvary,

58:57.460 --> 58:59.180
basically the whole of the Sinaloa cartel

58:59.180 --> 59:01.380
showed up to try and rescue him.

59:01.380 --> 59:02.660
Interesting thing about that

59:02.660 --> 59:05.140
is in reading some of the documents

59:05.140 --> 59:06.460
and also just seeing some of the videos

59:06.500 --> 59:08.860
and stuff like that came out of that incident.

59:08.860 --> 59:10.460
The cartels were the ones evacuating

59:10.460 --> 59:12.100
the citizenship from the area.

59:13.100 --> 59:15.420
They were the ones going restaurant to restaurant,

59:15.420 --> 59:17.820
if you wanna exit the city, go through here,

59:17.820 --> 59:18.940
take your families, get down,

59:18.940 --> 59:20.740
but you have to leave because the army's coming here,

59:20.740 --> 59:21.900
they're gonna fight us.

59:23.940 --> 59:26.860
So there's like a deep morality to all of that.

59:26.860 --> 59:28.940
Underneath the violence, there's a humanity.

59:28.940 --> 59:30.300
I mean, it's their home.

59:30.300 --> 59:33.340
It is their home and they were fighting for their home

59:33.340 --> 59:35.980
and they were fighting for leadership from their home.

59:36.940 --> 59:38.940
There is a morality, there is a humanity there.

59:38.940 --> 59:42.260
And again, if people wanna paint them all

59:42.260 --> 59:43.700
with the villainy aspects,

59:45.780 --> 59:48.660
everybody's a villain in somebody else's story,

59:48.660 --> 59:51.060
if you kinda look at it that way.

59:51.060 --> 59:52.900
People should check out your Patreon,

59:52.900 --> 59:54.500
should check out your Field Notes.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.780
You're a really good writer, your Instagram too.

59:56.780 --> 59:59.020
You write about, you have a quote

59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.780
in your Field Notes about villains.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:06.020
Quote, I once worked for a villain, a savior to some

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.180
and a biblical demon of old to others,

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.020
a true product of his environment.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.500
He was the best and the worst of us.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.180
We're all potential villains in someone else's story,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:21.100
he would say to us as we would head out into the unknowns

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.220
that the night had waiting for us.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.740
It was during one of these nights that I looked around me

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.660
and saw horns and pitchforks among my people

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.140
and realized what he meant.

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.520
We were no knights of their own table.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.720
Whatever we were, we were needed.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.680
In the end, I guess that justified

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.280
most of what was about to happen.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280
Do you think El Chapa,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.760
do you think people like him are good or evil?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.840
I think there's no one without the other.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.840
I think there's a cost to their goodness that they do.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.520
The roads they build, the hospitals,

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.640
the career paths that they pay for.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.400
There are doctors in Mexico that their careers were paid for

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.600
by some of these groups.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.680
And they do a lot of amazing good for the community.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.680
I remember there was a surgeon reconstructing cleft palates.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.320
In one of my travels that I did out there,

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.240
I spent some time actually going out there

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.120
after I got out of the job to train people

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.800
and this type of stuff that I show people.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.080
And they told me, I told them,

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.600
you're doing God's work?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.080
This stuff is legit, this is God's work?

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.920
Building smiles for people.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.000
I said, yeah.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.960
And then, can I talk to you?

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.960
He said, my career path was paid for by cartel,

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.600
a group of cartel members.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.880
They paid for my career path

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.600
because they wanted somebody on hand

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.960
that could fix their teeth.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.480
Do you think some aspects of that

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.520
is just sort of manipulative control

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.280
or is some of it also just, again,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.280
a care for the population, for fellow human beings

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.240
that are one of your own?

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.640
I think both.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.520
I think there's, again,

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.040
it's hard to just make them saints or devils.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.160
Some of the good they do in some of their communities

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.320
and don't ask anything for in return.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.040
And even if they don't ask it for anything in return,

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.360
where the military shows up,

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.040
they are immediately met with rocks and roadblocks

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.800
and everybody's main weapon down there,

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.080
since most Mexicans can't buy or own firearms,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.840
the main weapon down there is silence

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.200
and their eyes to report to the people

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.480
that they consider the good guys in their environment, right?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.320
So, that's a hard question.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.360
I think there's a bit of both,

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.480
and both the government and the criminal groups

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.040
that are operating down there.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.920
Silence is their main weapon.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.440
So, El Chapo is currently in prison.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.440
Is he worth talking to?

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.160
I'd say yes.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.560
Is there things that to you are interesting about him

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.640
that are still not understood?

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.200
Is he a window into something

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.400
that you don't understand about that world still

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.920
or are curious about in that world?

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.400
I think he's a window into the family dynamics of that world.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.760
I wanna say family dynamics.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.960
Mexico has a big thing about compadres and hermanos.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.600
We have people that we call family

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.240
that are not necessarily our family.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.840
He is somebody that witnessed the construction

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.360
of what is now the Sinaloa Cartel.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.000
He was in it way back when he started off as a farmer

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.480
and then went into trafficking.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.320
He's from a town called Bandira Huata,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.720
which is basically, that's the Wakanda of cartels,

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.920
basically, that's where a lot of that originates.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.920
The things that he saw as far as how some of these things

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.120
got built, I think, would be an interesting topic

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.000
of conversation with somebody like him.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.520
So that story is a story of evolving family dynamics.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.360
So part of the story of the cartel is individual humans.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.520
Marrying other families, getting named the padrino,

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.880
basically godfathers to other people's kids,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.400
forming family and blood ties and influence ties

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.560
to people not only in Mexico but in the United States.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.520
Seeing how that dynamic and family dynamic is still there.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.600
So he's gone, he's in prison,

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.960
but he's probably on his way to be

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.880
our next clandestine saint.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.520
You go to the chapel of Malverde.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.280
Malverde is basically a Mexican Robin Hood folk saint

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.360
down there who is a saint of traffickers.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.160
And at his shrine, you have a small little chapel,

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.880
a shrine right next to it.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.720
So he's on his way to sainthood in Mexico,

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720
not recognized by the Catholic church,

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.920
but that doesn't matter in Mexico anymore.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.120
Speaking to somebody like him,

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.880
who you can consider him somebody that lost,

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.560
he's arrested, but his family's okay.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.400
His legacy is out there.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.040
He's probably gonna be the next folk saint

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.280
when he passes away.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.680
Do you think he feels like the new wave

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.960
of what the cartel has become

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.840
has betrayed him and left him behind?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.880
Because it seems like the way the cartel operated

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.480
has changed over the decades.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.960
Yeah.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.280
Well, number one, their power and influence is bigger.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.840
There are Sinaloa cartel operations in Columbia,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.040
straight to the, like in the source of it.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.480
And then there are clear, they have a clear presence

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.080
in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.000
They're in the United States.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.920
The whole thought process that a lot of Americans have,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.560
like, we don't want that trouble over here.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.000
We don't want them to get here,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
like build a wall and all this.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.720
So they're deeply integrated into legitimate businesses.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.120
I mean, they've been having kids and families up here

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.520
since for a long time.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.920
Some of these people have American passports

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.960
that work not only directly for them,

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.800
but have blood ties down there.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.080
There's been dragnets and arrests

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.280
of some of these criminal organizations, states.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.040
The New Generation Cartel had one, two, three years ago,

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.200
where I think it was Operation Anaconda,

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.480
I think it was called.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.040
They arrested over 80 of their operatives.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.520
And this is a new cartel that is very militaristic

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.720
and growing in Mexico.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.400
And they had over 80 arrests in the United States,

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.080
you know, of members of them operating here.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.800
And so you could be a legitimate operator

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.960
inside the United States.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.760
That's hard to detect.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.040
Makes you wonder how many in the US government

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.600
the politicians here.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.480
Is the role of the United States in the drug war

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.200
financially in terms of power is very big?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.040
Yeah.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.840
Surely there's politicians that have a finger into this.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.800
Immigration is part of it.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.800
Illegal immigration is part of it.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.640
And the influence that that has as a bargaining chip

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.480
and a political chip.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.640
We saw this with the first caravan kind of coming up

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.080
and how it was politicized.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.760
The money, Fast and Furious,

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.680
and guns being basically let walk down into Mexico.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.520
People that don't know,

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.480
basically the ATF had this operation

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.080
where they were looking at straw purchasers or firearms.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.280
Basically people buying up a specific type of firearms

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.240
that were on a shopping list that the cartels wanted to buy.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.480
Including, you know, 50 cows, FN57 pistols,

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.840
which are small pistols with a high velocity round

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.800
that will go through a bulletproof vest.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.960
And then there were AR-15s of all kinds

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.200
that could quickly be modified into full auto

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.560
down in Mexico with drilling a few holes

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.200
and making a few things to them.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.000
So these people were buying all these,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.360
the ATF was watching them and allowing them to walk

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.880
those firearms into Mexico under the guise

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.200
of trying to track them somehow.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.520
Which doesn't make a lot of sense for most people

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.800
that kind of look at that operation.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.120
The only people found,

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.520
the only reason people found out about it was

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520
because of the murder of a few federal agents,

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.640
of the US federal agents that were killed with those guns.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.400
One of my friends was shot with one of those pistols

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.680
outside of his house.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.360
And they shot him and they shot his wife.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.080
Both of them were killed.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.600
Daughter was in the back seat, lost part of her arm.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.360
When that happened, the guns were unique.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.200
They were like, oh, we didn't ever,

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.880
the matapolicias is what they call them.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.080
They're the cop killers.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.800
I haven't seen those before.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.400
So they were unique and interesting

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.520
and later on in life, I was watching CNN

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.040
and seeing the hearings going on.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.200
I was like, oh, that's where they came from.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.720
Two federal agents changed a lot and it was politicized.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.280
There was a whole scandal up here,

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.960
but in Mexico, how many people died with those firearms?

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.520
Being let down, being let go down there.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.720
And also what type of sentiment

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.880
do you think the local populous has of the United States

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.480
after all those guns were basically handed over

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.360
to some of these groups?

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.080
Gun trafficking is another giant part of the equation

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.440
and part of the problem down there

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.760
as far as the amount of munitions, weapons.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.520
And now we were also getting trade craft material

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.000
from conflict zones outside of Mexico.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.640
So weaponized drones.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.200
The first time we saw some of those weaponized drones

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.200
was in Syria and like a few weeks later,

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.720
grenades were being dropped on the roofs

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.320
of some public officials building.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.000
The cartels are using drones?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.920
Yeah, that's been going on for a while.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.160
There's a place in Michoacan

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.000
and has some pretty interesting videos.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.960
And the interesting part of it is

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.760
because the federal police down there

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.720
are actually working hand in hand

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.360
with a United Carteles Unidos group,

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.920
which is basically the local cartels

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.800
to try and fight off the new generation cartel

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.760
moving into Michoacan.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.760
So even the federal forces are fighting with the cartels

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.000
to try and keep this larger cartel out.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.280
And there's videos of these civilian drones

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.800
basically dropping explosives.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.720
They found some explosive testing ranges out there

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.760
that are basically replicating stuff

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.280
that you would see the IRA use

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.920
during the troubles out there from homemade mortars.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.800
IEDs have been used in Mexico, not that much,

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.480
but they're making like a presence again.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.920
We don't have a lot of ordnance around like Iraq,

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.000
but we do have a big mining industry down there.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.080
So mining explosives of all kinds are pretty easy to get.

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.320
So you start seeing that.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.840
And also, I mean, there's some exotic weaponry

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.520
coming in from the South now and from the ocean.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.480
Some of it is probably US military equipment

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.880
sold to various South American governments

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.080
that are now not as stable as they were

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.160
and they're kind of making their way into black markets.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.320
A lot of those 50 cal

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.960
and vehicle mounted technical type machine guns

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.920
and some of the RPGs and man pads

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.560
or remote control guided missiles

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.680
that have been found in cartel hands

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.120
are probably making their way up from down South.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.760
Do you get these like multi-million dollar systems

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.440
like the High Mar system in the Ukraine?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.720
You get like super sophisticated advanced technology

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.760
or we're not.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.880
So like this is like military grade.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.960
I'm not sure what the application would be exactly

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.280
in Mexico.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.800
Some of the sophisticated stuff I see in our man pads,

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.840
which is basically remote guided missiles.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.320
I've seen some of those found out.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.960
What is the application exactly?

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.760
A display of power?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.120
There are no fly zones over parts of Mexico.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.360
For this reason?

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.600
The new generation cartel took down a helicopter.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
There's been incidents of military helicopters

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.520
falling from the sky and they said

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.920
that it was mechanical issues.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.360
But again, I'm not gonna do conspiracy theories out there,

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.320
but there's a lot of videos on TikTok

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.240
of seeing a lot of cartel forces at parties

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.240
carrying around rocket launchers on their backs.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.120
So there's an increased probability of mechanical failures

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.880
over those areas when you're flying a helicopter.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.480
There's no fly zones over some parts of Mexico.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.560
And another thing you're seeing now is night vision.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.120
Night vision equipment that is clearly military grade

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.680
from the US that was probably abandoned

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.400
in some more field out there,

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.080
maybe Afghanistan or somewhere like that.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.800
And it's being found in safe houses

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.680
and in the hands of cartel forces.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.720
You wanna talk about a scary opponent.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.040
Somebody wearing night vision with a suppressed firearm.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.560
Those types of capabilities are now out there.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.040
Also, there's this tendency to think in every now and then

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120
you'll see these cartel videos

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.880
with these guys carrying around these 50 cal

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.440
and they show up, they stand there like,

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.960
yeah, boasting about their rifles.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.160
And everybody laughed at them because the 50 cal

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.560
or anything like that without an optic on it,

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.000
it's like you're gonna shoot,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.440
you're praying shoot basically,

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.720
see if you can hit anything with it.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:25.720
But now there's a few of my sources I've seen,

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.320
sophisticated laser guided range finders

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.400
and sighting systems on some of these

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.080
that are being found out there.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.960
How much damage can 50 cal, what's the application?

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.880
They started getting them specifically

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.600
with the proliferation of armored vehicles in Mexico.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.640
Mexico has a giant industry in armored vehicles as far as.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.400
So there's a race in terms of armoring,

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.760
like protecting especially high value targets

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.840
and then weapons they can deal with those armored,

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.840
protected high value targets.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.920
There was an attempted assassination

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.840
of a state prosecutor somewhere in,

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.920
I think central Mexico, I forget exactly where,

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.480
but she was riding around an up armored Jeep.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.120
Cherokee, I think it was,

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.920
and their main means of firepower was 50 cal

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.200
and that car was left in pieces.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.120
She survived in it.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.080
So I think the armored vehicle company that sold her

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
that vehicle has it in the display room.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.720
Then before my time,

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.760
probably two, three years before I was actually active,

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.800
they tried to kill the head of public security

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.520
in the state of Baja.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.440
And with him, it was a grenade launcher,

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.520
40 millimeter grenade launcher.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.600
It skipped off the armored vehicle

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.760
and landed in the car behind it, made the back explode.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.200
One of the guys that I used to work with

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200
was actually in that car, he survived it.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.920
But you started to see, oh, they're using our vehicles now,

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.000
so let's get 50 caliber now to try and defeat that armor.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.640
So yeah, there's always this race of technology

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.480
basically down there.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.840
Armored vehicles, how do you take on an armored vehicle?

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.240
Well, there's a few ways, 50 cows,

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.160
if you can mount them in the right way

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.240
and shoot at a car like that,

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.320
or a bunch of kids with balloons and acrylic paint

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.120
on the front windshield and blind the vehicle

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.160
so they can't drive it anymore is another way.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.280
Towline across a road painted like the painted black

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.000
so you can't see it, and cut the thing in half.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.560
Again, I'm not saying any secrets.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.880
These are things that people have seen out there.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.520
Shoot at the radiator.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.320
Some of these radiators are not even

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.820
the more sophisticated vehicles out there,

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.440
don't have sufficient armoring around the radiator

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.120
or the battery housing of some of these vehicles.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.200
There was a case of a guy,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.320
I think his nickname was El Pelavacas

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.520
or something like that out in Sinaloa,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.920
level cartel guy.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.240
He had an armored vehicle, he was riding around

01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.840
and he got ambushed, he shot at his car.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.600
He was like, ah, I have armor, you can't shoot me.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.920
And somebody went up to his car

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.900
and just put the barrel right in the locking mechanism.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.080
And that got him, you know?

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.280
So it's an interesting place

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.160
as far as people getting certain types of guns.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.880
Armor is prolific down there.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.240
I mean, everybody down there,

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.960
all the cartel members, you'll see them wearing plate armor.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.520
So that's an issue.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.560
It's not like you can shoot somebody

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.080
square in the chest and they'll go down.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.840
Are they afraid to kill Americans?

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.980
So I know I was traveling in Ukraine on the front.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.360
So like a lot of the journalists

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.260
were traveling like armored vehicles.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.060
And at first I was like,

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.640
it seems like this would attract attention.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.600
Like it seems like they would want to hit those targets.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.180
But then I realized over time, as I learned,

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.840
there's a fear of killing Americans.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.960
There could be a drastic escalation of conflict.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.200
Yeah, it's not worth it.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.880
It's picking a beehive.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.720
Yeah.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.920
Yeah, there is a tendency to shy away

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.280
or stay away from that.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.960
I mean, they don't want the heat or the attention.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.440
Outside of that, everyone's game.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.680
Everyone's game, but also there's been many cases

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.840
of Americans being killed down there.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.280
I mean, we saw the Mormon massacre that happened down there

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.600
and all of them were American, Mexican.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.460
They had both nationalities and blonde kids, you know?

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.580
White being massacred in the middle of a desert

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.780
and the cars basically catching fire.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.100
This happened.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:36.380
And you know, the Americans sent the FBI down there

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.580
to kind of review some of what happened down there.

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.420
And I think that was when Trump started talking

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.340
about kind of reviving this whole notion

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.900
of cartels being labeled as a terrorist organization.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.740
Probably more of a political pressure point

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.460
that he was using to try and get Mexico

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:58.460
to reinforce its southern border, which it hasn't.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.660
But there's escalation.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.540
You know, oh, this already happened and nothing happened.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.580
So we can probably get away with it, you know?

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.260
And again, there's a newer generation moving forward now

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.180
of people coming into power.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.620
More brutal, more technically savvy.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.700
Well, they have the experience of their parents

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.580
and the people behind them and what they've done

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.660
and what gone away with.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:23.180
And now, yeah, more savvy about information warfare.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.300
Their main recruiting tool is TikTok.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.540
You go to TikTok and you'll see a bunch of these kids

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.220
at an archipod dancing around.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.780
And some of these are videos by cartel members

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.420
filming other cartel members in cartel controlled territory.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.060
And that's a window into that life

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.460
for who's on TikTok now, kids.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.640
And the enticing aspect of that is the money,

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.660
the fun, the high roller life.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.820
And the possibility of making it to a level, you know?

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.820
Yeah, a fame of respect, power, money.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.620
Here in the U.S., somebody might, you know,

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.220
I want a mansion, like that's their mindset.

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.940
I want to live, you know, like that wrapper.

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.500
Down there, I mean, if you can buy a house for your mom,

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.780
you know, or pay off some debts that you might have

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.860
or a car, that's enough to kill for.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.100
So you also, one of the many things you did is

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.740
you did security try to protect in this war,

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.860
try to protect people, high value people.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.700
Yeah.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.860
How do you do, you and others,

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.980
how is it possible to protect a high value target

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.620
like a celebrity or an important politician in this situation?

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:41.620
So I was tasked to protect the governor of Baja

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.020
and his family.

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.380
I was basically replacing a whole contingency

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.020
of people that were already there

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.020
that turned out to be corrupted.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.860
That wasn't my field, I was operational.

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.820
I was working with other people

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.180
doing the counter narcotic stuff

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.940
and the director of the institution that I was in

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.020
basically called me and said,

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:03.700
hey, you're gonna go and replace these people.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.980
And what happened to them?

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:05.820
Well.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.540
So you were known as a person that could be kind of trusted.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.740
I was tasked for that, so I think they considered that.

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:18.180
And I specifically worked for a governor named

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.020
Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan,

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.420
who was probably one of the best governors

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.620
we have had in the state.

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.620
And people wanna see if I'm trustworthy or not,

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:27.580
they can ask him directly.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.660
And I still speak to some members of his family

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.260
and we're still friends in that way.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.580
Is protecting people like technically

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.300
a difficult problem to solve?

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.420
For my experience in that time and in place,

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.380
he was basically spearheading the drug war in Baja

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.380
when he was in power.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.300
So he had threats from all over,

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.060
not only him, but his family.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.060
First thing I realized working that job in Mexico

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.580
is that we had people coming in

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.740
to do specialized training of that regard,

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:02.940
Israelis teaching us how they would do things in Israel.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.220
That didn't make a lot of sense for us in Mexico.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.980
We had people that had some Secret Service experience

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:13.100
showing us how they would do celebrity bodyguarding

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:17.220
or bodyguarding somebody maybe in California of that nature.

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.700
Didn't make sense for us.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.980
Then we got to experience some cross-training

01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:24.700
with some NSW, Naval Special Warfare people,

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.020
who were coming off protection details

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.780
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.620
Is there some useful crossover there?

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.060
We were struggling with the acceptance

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.380
that we were basically doing protection details

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.020
in a war zone.

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.980
So the approach that had to be taken in Mexico

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.780
was similar to the approach you would take in Afghanistan

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:45.700
during a war?

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.740
Some of the overt militaristic type approaches to security

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.940
that we had to adopt.

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.260
We didn't move him in a single armored vehicle.

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.860
We had two of them that looked exactly alike.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.220
So when we would move around,

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.460
we would switch one car through the other every now and then

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.380
we would arrive to an event.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.100
They would open the door and it would be one of us.

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.660
And they were like, hey, where's the governor?

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.540
He's in the back one.

01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.820
So we would move to that.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.700
So we had to do stuff like that.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.540
And again, this is a young me

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.420
who didn't have any specialized training.

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.340
I was on YouTube learning some of these things,

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.620
going online, learning about armored vehicles,

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.500
learning about architectural armor.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.940
I think you just described a large percentage

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.020
of the Ukrainian military, how they operate,

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.100
which is on YouTube,

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.980
trying to figure out how to use some of this technology.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.060
And that's actually incredibly effective.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:34.900
Yeah.

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.220
You know, I do quite a lot of stuff

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.820
where I'm totally not an expert,

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.460
totally uneducated and so on.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.140
It's kind of surprising how quickly you can get caught up.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.780
As we were talking offline, if you take a course,

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.980
if you talk to an expert, if you learn from an expert,

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.940
you can like catch up really quickly.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.740
For me, it was all of a sudden

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.060
I have this director calling me in

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.540
and I'm wearing vans, you know, and jeans, you know,

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.380
t-shirt.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.500
And all of a sudden I had 80 some people

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.620
that I had to move around and I was in charge

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.900
of securing planes, which I, what do I know about that?

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.540
Airport hangars, armored vehicle maintenance

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.380
and purchasing and figuring out how to set up

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.700
a counter-assault group for a protection detail.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.180
And I was like, where am I gonna learn all this?

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.140
Were you able to quickly figure some of these things out?

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.820
On the fly, basically, you know, as I was going,

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.580
I remember having this experience

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.980
being in our security office on my laptop,

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.460
figuring out how to set up a counter-surveillance

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.580
aside to our protection detail,

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.980
basically how to have people looking for people

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.820
that might be looking for us, you know, type thing.

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:48.820
And then going to San Diego, to Coronado

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:54.500
and training with some people from former SEAL guys

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.860
and NCIS people who did that job in war zones

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.580
and seeing them critique some of the solutions

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.540
that we came up with on the fly and being like,

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.460
oh, we never saw that before.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.540
Oh yeah, this is, we're doing it down there.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.060
So getting that compliment and also getting their,

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.020
you know, feedback, like we probably do this or do that.

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.940
And it was a learning process on the fly

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:20.900
that was pretty, I mean, seat of your pants level.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.460
Is it possible for the family and for the high value person

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.820
to have a sense of normalcy, to have a normal life?

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:28.940
I mean, I tried.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.540
I was already starting off on the wrong foot basically

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.740
because trust had been violated

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.180
by the people that I was replacing.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.420
So I had to gain that back.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.900
Then young kids in that family that wanted to have a,

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.580
you know, go out and stuff like that

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:45.420
in the most violent city on the planet.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.380
So I had to do my homework and figure out places

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.580
where they were safe to go to

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.580
and make friends with certain club owners

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.820
and figure out ways to put security in some of these places

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.420
and having to create this bubble of normalcy

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:03.340
around some of these people was pretty difficult.

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:08.340
And there's no way that that is a normal for anybody.

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:12.820
And, you know, God bless them.

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.740
I know it didn't, I know it wasn't easy

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.260
and I know that it affected their lives

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.500
and they lost on a big part of their youth.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.780
Being under that security supervision

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.780
bubble probably does a lot for somebody specifically

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.380
growing up like that, you know.

01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.940
You lose opportunities of things that we take for granted,

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.060
you know, just going out, just not telling anybody

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.180
and going to the store, you know,

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.860
because you want to get some snacks or something like that.

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.420
That's not available to some of these people.

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.540
I have to be honest, when I was in Ukraine,

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.660
that was a really big benefit.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:46.580
You'd escape?

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:47.660
No, I couldn't hang out.

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.540
I couldn't eat when I'm stressed.

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:52.460
I would fast and not eat much, so I got lost weight.

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.220
So it's great, it's great for the diet.

01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.220
That's a good diet to be in,

01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.660
basically be under protective custody.

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.500
That's a good idea for a new diet.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.140
And just life allowed me to focus,

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.860
get a lot of reading done,

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.780
focus on the important things in life.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.140
I mean, I joke, of course, but there's some,

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.780
there's some complexity to this

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:16.100
in terms of normalcy of the family,

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.220
but also just how to operate,

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.060
like have a mental clarity and a lack of fear.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.940
Just basically be good at your job, whatever that job is,

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:28.380
as a politician, as a leader, even as a soldier.

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:31.660
Somebody that I, again, I think it is Belisa Ola,

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.780
said this to me, or said something like this

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.180
to a group of us,

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.220
that there's nothing wrong with being paranoid.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.780
It's about educating your paranoia

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.420
and knowing what to be afraid of.

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.020
If you're afraid of everything,

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.660
you know, you're basically overwhelmed.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.500
But if you start educating yourself as far as specifically

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.980
what to prioritize as far as what to worry about,

01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:53.900
you know, war zone, working, protecting somebody,

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.060
you know, you're not looking at everybody's faces,

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.420
you're just looking at their hands,

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.340
because that's what's gonna kill you.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.100
You know, that's an example of focalizing,

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.500
you know, what you're paranoid and what you're afraid of.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.580
So looking at the hands,

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:08.100
that's the specific to a particular situation,

01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:11.980
but also figuring out which situations to avoid

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.460
and which is okay.

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.340
I mean, that's like ultimately one of the biggest things

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.180
you could do.

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.460
Yeah, route analysis.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.980
You know, you have to get to the airport

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.740
and you send off two cars to analyze two routes.

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.260
And then on the fly, you just change trajectory

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.780
to create randomness and unpredictability

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.260
and have that as a security feature.

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:41.780
Having a convoy of four vehicles separated into two convoys

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.300
and show up in different parts to, again,

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.940
make it hard for people to guess where you're gonna be,

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.820
pulling out false information as far as where it's gonna be,

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.180
who's gonna be and that type of stuff.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.460
It's kind of amazing how many assassination attempts

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.060
Hitler avoided just by having a pretty strict schedule

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.980
and being a little bit off in terms of timing,

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.060
just like showing up 15 minutes late

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.060
or to a slightly different location.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.780
We were going through training

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.460
specifically around this type of stuff

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.140
and operational training,

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.780
basically showing us how to ambush people.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.740
When I started making a group for myself

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.380
as far as counter-ambush,

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.740
there's cat teams that they call them up here in the US,

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:27.540
basically a group to respond to a high violent ambush.

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.900
First off, the first rule,

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.900
if you find yourself in an ambush,

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.580
it wasn't a successful ambush

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:35.340
because if you find yourself in it, you're alive.

01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.460
Yes.

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.980
But if you wanna create an amazing counter-ambush team,

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.380
you have to make them ambushers.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.780
And with ambushing, you figure out

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.060
where all the opportunities

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:50.100
of not only successfully doing what you need to do

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.100
are in your favor, but also to escape with your life.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.380
We're not gonna be received by virgins in heaven.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.180
That's not the type of mentality that we had down there.

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.300
But we start learning about some of these things

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.340
and also seeing cartel forces

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.380
apply some of these ambush tactics to the military

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.340
or cartel forces.

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.180
What is an ambush?

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:11.180
What are we talking about?

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.780
So that's a surprise attack

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.860
with an asymmetry of power kind of thing.

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.580
There's a contingency somewhere moving towards

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.740
a place that you control and own,

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.980
where you have the advantages,

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.420
where they can't see you, but you can see them,

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.620
where they can't predict you,

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.540
but you can predict where they're gonna pass,

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.500
go through places where they forcibly have to pass,

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.060
places where they're predictable,

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.740
places where you can not only predict,

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.140
but also have a plan for yourself to escape

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:39.740
and exit that place.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.420
So how do you train for counter-ambush?

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:44.220
You turn into a perfect ambusher.

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.580
That's how you train for counter-ambush.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.020
Also always trying to make sure

01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:49.860
you have more information about other people,

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.460
you have the element of surprise, all of those things.

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.620
And Musashi would say, know your enemy, know his sword.

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.300
Basically that, it's simplified.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.340
There's a lot of enemies around you in Mexico.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:03.940
There's a lot of uncertainty, right?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.300
Well, I guess that's what route analysis is.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.660
You prepare for the probable.

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.180
And if the impossible happens,

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:13.220
you're halfway out of it, hopefully.

01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.580
And if you find yourself in an ambush,

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:15.940
it wasn't a successful one.

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.620
As far as our training and kind of the mindset,

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.820
my experience with it,

01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:25.980
the adversarial thinking part of it

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.860
has always been a very powerful one.

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.820
I think one that a lot of people ignore

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.460
kind of like lead to the wayside.

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:34.060
Specifically in all conflicts out there,

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.820
there's a tendency for a military force

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.420
or a conventional force of any kind

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.340
to be trained in a way where they dehumanize the enemy.

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.620
And when that happens,

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.700
you become blind to the enemy's story.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.900
It's his capability, his story, his ability.

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:53.500
If you treat the other side like an inhuman monster,

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.580
it's hard to take notes, you know?

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:59.660
So part of this is a radical empathy

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.300
for the quote unquote enemy.

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.260
At least for me personally,

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.340
I wasn't one of the guys that would grab him

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.180
and beat the shit out of him

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:08.300
and put him in the back of a van,

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.220
just tie him up and gag him.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:12.260
So you were able to see them as human?

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.740
I learned that from my mother, you know?

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.700
She said, nobody's against you there for themselves.

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:21.820
Learn this and you will make friends of enemies.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.700
She said that when I graduated

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.540
and I've carried that with me throughout my whole career.

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.580
But isn't there then a pain of killing another human?

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.740
Always.

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:34.780
But there isn't, again, I apologize to go back to Ukraine

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.260
as my only experience of this kind of harshness.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.980
And it is a powerful experience.

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.660
There's a dehumanization that happens.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.940
I suppose this is common in war.

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.340
There's something like a video game aspect

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.300
where people are almost having fun.

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.820
There's a humor.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.980
And I think underneath that, the prerequisite

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.540
is to see the enemy in the same way you see the enemy

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:56.860
when you play Call of Duty.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.460
You don't really think,

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.260
you're thinking of them as NPCs, the bad guys.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:04.900
The Russians are called orcs in Ukraine.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.340
I mean, there's all kinds of other names.

01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.420
For us, it was Mugrosos, you know?

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.100
Malandro Mugrosos, like dirty people.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.220
There's always something.

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.420
Over time, those are just words.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.420
But over time, it gathers a kind of meaning to it

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:22.820
that's more than just the words, orcs.

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.540
They're less than human.

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.980
They're dirty, they're too dumb

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.940
to understand the evil they're doing or whatever the.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.780
It's useful, it's useful.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.620
It's part of the program.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.300
But like that's what, and I've talked to soldiers,

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:40.300
and some of them do have stories of momentarily

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.900
remembering that there's a human on the other side.

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:48.340
I've talked to one woman who's this really badass soldier.

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:53.460
She saw this really brave soldier on the other side

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:58.460
do something that was almost stupid, how brave it was.

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:03.460
And then she was trying to shoot him, and she missed.

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:06.860
And she said she couldn't sleep the night after,

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.500
thinking why did she miss, why did she miss?

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:16.180
And then she thought she missed because he was a hero.

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.180
And she had this brief realization

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:19.940
that there was a hero on the other side.

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.340
The other side is heroes.

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.620
And then, but then that quickly disappeared.

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:27.100
Again, but she had this moment as a human being

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:30.620
that rises to defend his nation, to defend his people,

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.620
and he could be heroic on the other side.

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.660
There are things that we're trained to depress

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:38.820
or conceal or hide and kill in us

01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.700
when you're trained for something like that,

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.300
or when you're in conflict zone like that

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.460
and you hear the narrative constantly being blared out

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.500
that the other side is a orc,

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.100
or whatever word you wanna use.

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.300
But we live in a day and age

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.820
when you can see Americans going off to Japan

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:58.180
and shaking hands with some of their former enemies.

01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:02.140
I mean, some of us have seen that and how things change.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.380
I think years from now,

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.900
a lot of the stuff that we are taking right now

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.180
is of the utmost importance, won't matter anymore.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.180
The question is how many years?

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:14.340
That's a question I asked of a lot of people

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.740
in that part of the world.

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.020
And a lot of them currently,

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.540
they're also self-aware about it.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.900
They're like, I'm not sure I trust my current feelings,

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.700
but the current feelings are generational.

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:31.620
Like for decades, I will not just hate the leadership,

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.900
I will hate all of Russian people.

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:36.860
I can't understand that on my side of my life experience

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.580
because our war has been an internal war

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.460
amongst our people in our monster houses.

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:43.620
While that is the propaganda,

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.500
there's also a deep grain of truth

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:49.220
that there is a oneness to the people of that region.

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.260
But people will get very offended at that idea

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:56.260
because right now it's a very strong nationalist borders.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.460
But there is a cultural history that connects people.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.900
I mean, in some deep sense, we're all connected.

01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.820
We all come from Western Africa

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:06.460
and then all came from fish before then,

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:11.460
depending on your view of history, of life on earth.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.060
But there is a oneness to us

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.020
and often you forget that in conflict.

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.820
I had an experience working.

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.300
There was a friend of mine who took the other path

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.260
and went to work for some of these criminal groups.

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.980
I was operational and we saw a bunch of people

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.980
in a gas station, parked.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:39.100
Back then, the main modus operandi that they had

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:44.100
was that they would impersonate or dress up as federal police.

01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:46.100
And that's how they would move around the city.

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.100
We saw these suburbans in a gas station

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.100
and some of the guys were carrying our AK-47s.

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.100
And that's not a standard issue firearm.

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:05.100
So we saw that and I got off on foot and walked by

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:10.100
to try and get a better sense of what was going on.

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:14.100
I took everything off, wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.100
And I got a whistle from one of the guys that was there

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.100
and my name was called.

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.100
It was one of the guys that I grew up with.

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.100
Redhead kid, looked like El Canelo.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.100
There's redheads in Mexico, by the way.

01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:34.100
I think it's probably some of the Irish

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:38.100
that betrayed the American side during the last Mexico-American war

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:40.100
that stayed down there and had a bunch of kids.

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:42.100
It's probably from there.

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:44.100
Love is stronger than anything else, I think.

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.100
There's a redhead kid.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.100
When I say kid, I mean he was my age.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.100
Now to my eyes, he's always going to be younger now.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.100
He whistled, told my name.

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.100
He said, hey, ¿qué hace aquí?

01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.100
I'm like, what are you doing here?

01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:02.100
He's like, gosh, I was just going home.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.100
I was going to get a taxi.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.100
He's like, okay.

01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.100
As he walks over, he has a plate carrier

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:13.100
with AK magazines on his chest.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.100
AK without a stock on it, just carrying it in his hand.

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.100
He comes over and he hugs me.

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.100
I could feel the magazines on my chest.

01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:26.100
Mind you, I have a gun on me, tucked.

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:31.100
Neck style is buzzing in my back pocket

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:35.100
as people are trying to figure out what's going on.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.100
He asked me small talk shit.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.100
Hey, what are you doing?

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.100
What do you work at?

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.100
I'm just looking for a job.

01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:44.100
I used to work at a video store.

01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.100
He's like, I haven't seen you in a while.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.100
How's so-and-so of your family?

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100
Good.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.100
How's so-and-so of your family?

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.100
Good.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:57.100
It's like, this is an interesting job you have.

01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.100
He's like, yeah, it's pretty good.

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.100
They pay us well.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.100
You get a car.

01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.100
There's money and nobody fucks with you.

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.100
You get respect.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.100
I was like, that's awesome.

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.100
If you want, I can get you in.

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:15.100
If you want that, I'm too much of a coward for that, I told him.

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:19.100
Conversation like any other between two friends.

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:22.100
He hugs me before I go.

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:24.100
I have something to him.

01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:26.100
I can't remember what.

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.100
And he says, hey, in my ear, I know what you do for a living.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:32.100
It's not a safe place for you to be.

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:37.100
And I walk off.

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:41.100
A few moments later, the army showed up.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:51.100
And you could feel the amount of rounds going off from two blocks away.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:56.100
We came back with our guys.

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.100
And it was over.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.100
So he didn't survive that?

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:07.100
I looked through the bodies and the cars that were left.

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.100
There were bodies all over the place.

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.100
People left there.

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.100
It was a mess.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:18.100
I spent like an hour looking for him.

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:24.100
The only way I could recognize him was his hair.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:29.100
I stayed with his body all night.

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:36.100
There's a bridge in Tijuana that goes over the river in a place called La Mesa.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.100
And that's where the forensic offices were.

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.100
His body was taken there.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.100
And I stayed with his body until it was released.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.100
I told his family about it.

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:50.100
Because I knew them.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:55.100
And that aspect of us versus them, or they're the enemy, and things like that.

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.100
My mom told me those words.

01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.100
Nobody's against you.

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.100
They're just for themselves.

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:03.100
So don't make the mistake of dehumanizing anybody.

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:07.100
And those roles could have been easily reversed?

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.100
I could have been shot in the face there.

01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:16.100
That aspect of conflict brings where, let's say, bad guys, good guys, heroes, villains.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:22.100
There's an innocence to that that goes away.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.100
Is your mom still with us?

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.100
No.

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.100
Almost three weeks before I decided to quit, she passed away.

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.100
Did that have a role to play?

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.100
A major one.

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:41.100
After I got done on the protection detail with the governor, like everything down there again, the whole cycle.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.100
He got his turn.

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.100
You know, politics change.

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:57.100
And down there, basically, if you're a gubernatorial candidate, you have either a friend, a friend of a friend or a family member be the head bodyguard guy.

01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:02.100
And the guy that won the elections had his head bodyguard guy already there.

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.100
So all of us were sent back to whatever we came from.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.100
So I went back to work on the streets.

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.100
I was back on the operations group.

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:20.100
I was working with the subdirector directly with him, basically back on the ground doing the stuff that I was doing before that job.

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:30.100
We were moving away from the successes that had been had by people like Lezola when they were in charge of that whole process, the people that I used to work with.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:36.100
Some of the only successes in that counter push against cartels in Mexico.

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.100
And you can kind of like, it's documented.

01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:39.100
You can read about it out there.

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.100
A bunch of people wrote papers on it.

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.100
Some of the only successes were had by Lezola in the places where he had leadership.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:51.100
He not only pacified Tijuana, he also did the same in Juarez.

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.100
He was sent to be the police chief in Juarez too.

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:58.100
But politics change and, you know, heroes become villains.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:08.100
A lot of people started calling him a villain because of his unorthodox approach and human rights violations and all this type of stuff kind of come to the forefront.

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:15.100
And people forgot, you know, people forgot what it took to get Tijuana off the most dangerous city list on the planet.

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:19.100
And people were vilified.

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:25.100
People like him and the police force that I was a part of started getting compromised.

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.100
A lot of the things that were put forth to try and keep us honest.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:34.100
There was a program, they had these centers called C3s.

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.100
Basically, you would go there every year.

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.100
You would get your financials checked.

01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:42.100
You would get a physical psychological evaluation.

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.100
You would get a polygraph exam done on you.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:49.100
All the works to try and see if you were somebody doing something wrong.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:55.100
And all of that was canceled because it violated your human rights.

01:42:55.100 --> 01:43:03.100
If you get fired from a job because of a failed polygraph exam, because that was not an actual admissible way of firing somebody.

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:17.100
So all of a sudden you had people that were known cartel compromised people that were fired five, six years ago showing back up to work with their back paid and everything.

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:26.100
So this started happening and I quickly realized that it was going to be hard to stay there.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:44.100
I was driving home from work and I got a call from my brother that my mom had been going through some health issues that had turned into psychiatric issues.

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:52.100
So we were basically taking turns trying to take care of her, you know, locking the doors so she wouldn't wander off and stuff like that.

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:58.100
So not only was I dealing with the job on the street, but I was dealing with that.

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:07.100
And also I had a two year old and a marriage that was difficult that time.

01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:12.100
So I was trying to figure all these things out made more difficult by your job.

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:20.100
Yeah, it's not a financially secure job, you know, and the pressures that it has and the odd hours and all that made it really hard.

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:27.100
And then all of a sudden my brother calls me and tells me that let's go to the hospital.

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.100
Something happened to my mom.

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:36.100
It wasn't my turn to watch her, so I felt pretty shitty about that.

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:44.100
I got to the hospital and the doctors came out and told us that she was gone.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:48.100
It was a massive heart attack.

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.100
She had a pacemaker by then, so she was gone.

01:44:53.100 --> 01:45:05.100
She was in her 60s, so we kind of expected something, but that was hard for me.

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.100
She was my center.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.100
She was going to be the one that I would ask for advice as far as work, you know, if I should leave it or not.

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:14.100
The ground was removed from under you.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.100
Yeah, there's nothing underneath me.

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.100
I get three days off work.

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.100
That's what they gave me.

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:28.100
I'm trying to grieve as I go back to work.

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:35.100
Dark shit crosses my mind as I'm going through that process of trying to figure things out.

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.100
Dark shit like suicide, right?

01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.100
Dark shit?

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.100
Yeah.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.100
So it was very low for you.

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.100
It hit very hard.

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.100
Yeah.

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:50.100
I wasn't allowed to grieve, basically, and I wasn't allowed to grieve for a few years for different reasons.

01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:52.100
I went back to work.

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:56.100
You weren't allowed, other people also, you yourself were not allowing yourself to grieve.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:01.100
There was other people with me that didn't allow me to grieve, you know.

01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:10.100
I went to work, got called into the office, and I was basically told that I was going to be reassigned after what I just went through.

01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:18.100
The reassignment was going to be something that I saw as unacceptable.

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:25.100
It was the people in charge at that point were obviously corrupted.

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:32.100
And what I got from their conversation was that they wanted us to work for a specific side.

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:37.100
And I knew that that was the time to go.

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:46.100
I asked for a license, basically licenses, unpaid absence from work, basically a leave of absence.

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:50.100
I think it's what you call it up here, which by law is allowed.

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.100
And I was denied for no reason.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:59.100
So I'm invested in this job, you know.

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:05.100
I have a good salary and I have a category in there.

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:09.100
So by the level of time you spend in there, you get a category.

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.100
So I was a pretty high category agent.

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:20.100
I had all this training and again, training that would be useless in the private sector and the public sector in Mexico.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.100
I couldn't change from one corporation to another.

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:25.100
I couldn't go to work for another police institution.

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:32.100
So I took a deep breath and I resigned.

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:35.100
I went to the office. I said, I need to resign.

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.100
They said, what? I need to resign.

01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:41.100
Some of the people in the office that knew me from a long time were like, what's wrong with you?

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:46.100
They thought I was having a mental breakdown.

01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:51.100
Handed it all over, all the paperwork, took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in there.

01:47:51.100 --> 01:48:06.100
Blade armor, tear gas grenades, gas mask, satellite radio, MP5 magazines, an MP5, a submachine gun, Glock, Glock magazines, all of it, helmet.

01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:14.100
And I put it in the, I handed it over in the armory and I left.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.100
I made some phone calls.

01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:22.100
I was married to an American and my daughter is American.

01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:27.100
I never envisioned myself coming to the United States to do that process for myself.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:33.100
I was invested in that job. I thought I was going to die or retire from that.

01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:41.100
And it quickly became like an issue because everybody's wondering why I left the job so abruptly.

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:50.100
So there were some threats made when I left by people inside the office and I probably, you know, it's anonymous yet.

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.100
So there's significant pressure not to leave. It's hard to leave this kind of job.

01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:55.100
Yeah.

01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:02.100
The system makes it difficult to leave the individuals to the degree they might be corrupted, really don't want you to leave.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.100
There's no support. Yeah, there's no support.

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.100
And it's probably the opposite of support.

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:07.100
Yeah.

01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:11.100
Almost like implied or explicit or implicit threats.

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:20.100
Yeah. Luckily, I had developed some friendships in the United States with some of the people that I used to work with and cross-drain with

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:28.100
and some friendships that I developed with people that I would just talk to and make friends with stateside.

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:36.100
One of them is a Navy SEAL reservist whose name is Dan Stanchfield and his wife, Kelly.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:44.100
They opened the doors of their house to me and my kid and my wife at that time.

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:57.100
As I seek to basically look for the American dream, I crossed the border with my kid and nobody knew anything.

01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:03.100
They didn't tell anybody, just my wife and I was off.

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:12.100
When I came to the States, I already kind of dabbled in the whole training field and showing some of my experience to people.

01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:18.100
So I had at least a seed of that out there. People knew me for that.

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:33.100
But all of a sudden, I was in the middle of an avocado orchard in the middle of California and everything's quiet.

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.100
And there's no more radios going off all of the night.

01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.100
There's no more three cell phones on the counter.

01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.100
There's no guns. There's no rifles.

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:49.100
There's no 80 people calling to see what's going on.

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:52.100
There's nothing. It's just quiet.

01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:55.100
And it's during the time when Trump got elected.

01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:01.100
So the immigration process that usually would take – I had most things going for me.

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:07.100
The immigration process that would take most of the year took two years.

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:14.100
So it was not an easy process to not only come to the U.S.

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:23.100
but come to the U.S. with that pressure, kind of underlying pressure as far as being an immigrant at that time here.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:32.100
And then your own personal psychological, the PTSD of going from a war zone to an avocado orchard.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:41.100
The word PTSD and TBI and all of these things, I did not – I didn't know any of them.

01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:51.100
It was through people that I got to meet in the training field that were Marines, SEALs, Marisot guys,

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:59.100
those types of people that started giving words to some of the things that I felt, which I didn't really know.

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:06.100
We would treat post-traumatic stress with alcohol and vacation time, a bottle of mezcal.

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:09.100
When you see the bottom of it, your troubles are gone.

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.100
Cured.

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:16.100
Yeah, immediately. I was an alcoholic as well as all the other stuff.

01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:22.100
I was drinking myself to sleep every third night.

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:28.100
My marriage obviously was failing. It wasn't easy for her.

01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:36.100
She was brave and she did what she could, and I totally respect and understand her process with it.

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:41.100
But when it's quiet, that's when it hits you.

01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:46.100
I think that's what a lot of people experience when they come back from a conflict zone.

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:53.100
Everything that was life and death, everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos,

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:58.100
all the people that are around you that would die for you, kill for you, you would kill for them.

01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:04.100
All these millions of dollars worth of equipment and stuff like that you were responsible for now are all gone.

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:12.100
It's just you walking into a circle K and buying three cans of Foster's to drink yourself to sleep.

01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:22.100
Yeah, you write on your Patreon brilliantly about PTSD, about the cost of things you've done and seen.

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:31.100
Quote, when it's over and we're far from that chaos and noise of death being close and life being real,

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:37.100
that is when some of us remember in the quiet nights in a field in Tennessee looking at fireflies,

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:44.100
walking through a fair, holding hands with a lover, asking you what's wrong.

01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:49.100
At your kid's birthday party, leave early to avoid the ending of a celebration.

01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:55.100
That is what the quiet means to some of us. So that's speaking to that silence, the quiet.

01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:01.100
How do you live with and thrive with this newly learned term of PTSD?

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:08.100
If anything, I would recommend people that have any of these issues to go to places where other people have their issues.

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:17.100
It's not a competition, but you get to see the scope of problems in the world and you sometimes feel kind of lucky as far as your own.

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:23.100
It humbles you and makes you appreciate all the different kinds of struggles that people go through.

01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:31.100
I went through some horrible shit, but there are some people there that went through more horrible shit or stuff that I don't think I could have survived.

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:43.100
When I went through that process of figuring things out, the first thing that glaringly pointed out or stuck out to me was my inability to process things.

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:48.100
There was a big pause button there, a giant one. Everything was on pause.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:53.100
My grieving, not only my mom, but my brother.

01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:58.100
So I had a pause button on me since I was 13, basically.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:07.100
Then I got to bury many of my friends and inform their wives or girlfriends of what happened.

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:14.100
That all, again, was paused because I wasn't allowed to process.

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:19.100
I spent years without going on vacation because I was a workaholic.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:28.100
I found at the core of my issues alcohol, a giant pause button in the form of alcohol.

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.100
Basically, I would drink my problems away.

01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:38.100
Specifically, it's like if you have a mess in your house, you just put a big tarp over it to cover it up.

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:41.100
Alcohol was that for me.

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:51.100
It festered more and more as I not only went through the process of learning about PCSD, going through therapy, but refusing to let that go.

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:56.100
Going through therapy and seeing what other people's problems were.

01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:02.100
This is the only thing I have. I'm not hurting anybody with it.

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:06.100
Why do I need to get rid of that?

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:13.100
By this point, I was traveling across the country and training people and showing some of the experiences that I had to other people,

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.100
being on podcasts and having conversations like the one I'm having with you.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.100
So speaking to the skills that you developed.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:27.100
In a way, basically reliving and reopening a bunch of shit for myself every time I do it.

01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:36.100
I was getting triggered and the way I would manage that was I would drink at the end of the night after a weekend class somewhere.

01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:44.100
When I talk about the fireflies in a field in Tennessee, it was a moment where I was forcing myself to try and be sober.

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:48.100
We did this medical class out in the hills in Tennessee.

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:54.100
It was a beautiful green place, beautiful family there that hosted us.

01:56:54.100 --> 01:57:00.100
The first time I ever saw fireflies, I thought I was having a hallucinogenic experience.

01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:05.100
When I say why is the dust glowing is what I thought.

01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:09.100
A friend of mine is a veteran.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:14.100
He ran off to the woods and grabbed one and brought it to me and showed it to me.

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:17.100
I was like, holy shit, that's a firefly.

01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:20.100
Wow, how do they glow? I don't know.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:23.100
And he's crushed it in his hand and says, gone.

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:28.100
And that brought me back immediately to holy shit.

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:34.100
It kind of like I was off somewhere and I was back and I had to go drink.

01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:43.100
I went through that process of like going off, getting on, going off, getting off at my marriage, separate.

01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:50.100
And that was another end of the world aspect to everything.

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:56.100
I lost my mother, I lost the job, and then the marriage failed.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:59.100
And it was on me.

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:16.100
I basically went somewhere and did a stock of everything that was going on and made a decision to stop drinking.

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:24.100
I had some bad relationships after and I just came to a place where I need to stop drinking.

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:27.100
You've gotten to a point so low.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.100
Was this a decision you arrived at by yourself?

01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:32.100
Was there some inspiration?

01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:36.100
Or was it just the point is so low, lost so much?

01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:39.100
It was the start of COVID.

01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.100
This is recent.

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:45.100
I'm going to have two years over in December.

01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.100
So when you talked to Rogan the first time, you're still struggling with this demon.

01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:52.100
I was in and out of the car, basically is what I would say.

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:57.100
I was in and out of and then trying to get rid of it.

01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:02.100
That must be a super stressful experience talking to Joe Rogan the first time you drank that night.

01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.100
You remember?

01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:08.100
The second time I was there, I went somewhere and got shit faced.

01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:17.100
It was stressful, not for any other reason than I felt the responsibility to the people that couldn't speak about it.

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:20.100
So that's the pressure.

01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:26.100
It was the start of COVID and things started getting shut down and slowed down.

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:31.100
My dad got really sick and almost died.

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:36.100
We had to set up some Jason Bourne level shit at my brother's place.

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.100
He was in Mexico.

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:43.100
So we had to bribe a guy to get us an oxygen tank.

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:47.100
I had to root Jimmy Regan a respirator.

01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:52.100
It was some shit.

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:57.100
But my dad was like, he survived it.

01:59:57.100 --> 02:00:00.100
The doctor was like, say goodbye.

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:05.100
My dad was like, yeah, say goodbye to him.

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:07.100
I guess he died as a gangster.

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.100
I got it.

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:10.100
Tough guy.

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:13.100
He did some gangster shit that day.

02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:18.100
But on my end, I was being isolated basically as COVID is, everybody's slowing down.

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:22.100
No more classes, no more excuses to go out there and drink and no more socializing.

02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:29.100
So social drinking turned into alone drinking more and more and more.

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:37.100
I bought a bottle of gin because I was down in Mexico taking care of my dad.

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:41.100
And they closed down beer production in Mexico.

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.100
So beer went away.

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.100
And beer was a way I kind of managed it.

02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:50.100
It's not hard alcohol, it's just beer.

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:52.100
But that went away, so it was just hard alcohol.

02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:56.100
That was what was available down there.

02:00:56.100 --> 02:01:05.100
One night alone at the house, my dad's house, I drank a bottle of gin, a whole bottle of gin.

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:08.100
And I almost died.

02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:16.100
And after that, some people started noticing that I was isolating more and more.

02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:21.100
And it was kind of eating away at me.

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:28.100
I was in a relationship at that point when I started seeing everything just kind of fall apart around me.

02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:37.100
And I drank half of a glass of wine.

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:42.100
And it made me sick internally in my mind.

02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:49.100
And my kid said to me, and I don't know, nobody coached her, nobody said anything to her.

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:52.100
She's a pretty intuitive kid.

02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:55.100
She said, I don't drink anymore, Dad.

02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:00.100
Out of nowhere in the middle of the night.

02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.100
And I stopped.

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.100
I stopped that night.

02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:14.100
I remember waking up at three in the morning and taking a cooler that I had and just dumping all the beers in it and chucking them in the garbage.

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:20.100
And with a knife poking each of them to not be tempted to go back for them.

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:28.100
And then the second day I went around and started finding the hides that I had, because I had some, you know, hides.

02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:40.100
And then I went somewhere and locked myself in for two weeks.

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:51.100
I had the withdrawals, the clearest nightmares that I'd ever had in my life for two, three weeks.

02:02:51.100 --> 02:03:00.100
I went somewhere, and I want to keep them private, but I went somewhere where they offered a place for me.

02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:04.100
And when I asked them about it, it's a community.

02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:07.100
I gave them some money for their school as a donation.

02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:10.100
I gave them like a few thousand dollars.

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:12.100
I said, yeah, sure, come.

02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:14.100
You can go through this process here.

02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.100
Cool as fuck, people.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:21.100
The first thing they did when I got there is they stood me up in front of everybody to thank me for the donation.

02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.100
And then told everybody that I was an alcoholic.

02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:30.100
And if anybody saw me drinking, I was to be kicked out of there immediately.

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:35.100
And I felt horrible.

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:39.100
So that was where I started.

02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:43.100
Was that temptation still there?

02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:52.100
There was a moment when it was, and some therapy circle.

02:03:52.100 --> 02:04:02.100
There's a rodeo clown friend of mine who his body's, his spine is basically fused together, you know, type of guy.

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:10.100
We've been friends and enemies and friends again, you know, during our therapy circle sessions.

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.100
Oh, so like there's an intimacy there.

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:13.100
Yeah.

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:16.100
He didn't know anything about me.

02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:20.100
One time when we were telling our story, he stood up and told his story.

02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:21.100
And then he heard mine.

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:25.100
And then he was pissed off at me and didn't want to talk to me for a while.

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:34.100
And then later he told me that it was because he saw what I did with my experience and how much of a difference that he perceived that I was making with it.

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:42.100
And he felt jealous that he can do the same with his experience because he was just a broken X rodeo clown.

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:49.100
He told me when I was going through the process like, hey, you're an internet celebrity person, you know, you're known.

02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:55.100
Aren't you worried about people finding out that you're that you're recovering drunk?

02:04:55.100 --> 02:05:00.100
And I said, yeah, it's fucking scary as shit if people find out that I am going through this process.

02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:09.100
It's scary that, you know, the critique, you know, I already get a lot of shit for being an ex-police officer in Mexico and all that, all the negativity that comes from that.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:16.100
And he said, don't be, you know, that you can't pickpocket a naked man.

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:17.100
So just get naked.

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.100
And what does that mean?

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:20.100
Write about it.

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:21.100
Post it online.

02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:22.100
You never know.

02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:27.100
Somebody somebody out there might get inspired to do their own kind of process.

02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:39.100
So I started posting cowardly in a way because I wanted to make other people keep me on the path, you know, but in other ways, you know, desperation.

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.100
You know, I don't I don't want to drink anymore.

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:47.100
I don't want to go back to that on that path, which I know leads directly to a bad death.

02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:48.100
I'm not afraid of death.

02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:49.100
I just want a good one.

02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:50.100
I don't want a bad one.

02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:55.100
I think that was going to lead me to a bad death.

02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:10.100
I started writing about it and sharing it online, you know, through my fever dreams post and just being humorous about it online and getting a lot of hate on one side, you know, having a few people and companies that I work with kind of step back.

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:26.100
And seeing this guy has some issues to having other people kind of make fun of or make light of that weakness portrayed us getting hate, getting criticism because here you are a narcotics police officer.

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.100
There's no as a drinking problem.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:36.100
So is that like supposed to be what like flaws revealed weakness or a perception of alpha in the U.S.

02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:41.100
I guess that some people have, you know, you were supposed to be strong and here you are.

02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.100
I mean, I'm not I'm not Jocko Willink.

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:44.100
I'm not David Goggins.

02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:49.100
You know, I wake up at 10 in the morning sometimes and I'll have cornflakes with my eight year old.

02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:52.100
You know, I like days off.

02:06:52.100 --> 02:07:05.100
I used to wake up at three thirty in the morning every day to review what happened during the night and then go off for a jog and then the gym and just be ready to be able to murder somebody with my hands if I had to.

02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:11.100
But that is I can maintain that during the whole process of getting out of it now leaving alcohol.

02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:16.100
I remember just being honest with it and just seeing the two sides of it.

02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:23.100
You know, Joe told me never read the comments section, which is beautiful.

02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:26.100
It's a beautiful piece of advice.

02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:36.100
But it gets you sometimes when you talk about some of these things openly and some of the comments were positive.

02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:46.100
And I've been seeing people comment, sending me messages and meeting people on the road that are five months in 10 months.

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:52.100
Some people that have been on that wagon for way longer than I have.

02:07:52.100 --> 02:08:10.100
And there's what's cool when you meet people that are superhuman or perform and take an extreme ownership of things and are just amazing people that are thriving out there.

02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:12.100
It's inspirational.

02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:18.100
I see some of these people and I'm like, holy shit, I need to figure out how to get to some semblance of that.

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:21.100
But I'm not that, you know, I've been through the wringer.

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.100
I fucked up a shit ton of times.

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:26.100
You know, my nose is an example of that.

02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:28.100
I have a few missing teeth.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:39.100
But in a way, I think all of that is part of the process and not a lot of people want to talk about, you know, independently of the experience I got down there and some of the things that I show and talk about.

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:49.100
And some of the advocacy I do related to women like her that are, you know, trying to look for a better life and trying to find their missing kids.

02:08:49.100 --> 02:09:00.100
Training people to not get into those situations, but also showcasing the fact that people that go through some of these processes have a journey to go through.

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:10.100
You know, I just came into your studio with a duffel bag straight from the airport and I'm going to leave early tomorrow morning to somewhere else.

02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:16.100
I've been on the road for almost, I think, five years nonstop.

02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:23.100
I go back to a specific place every week to see my kid for two, three days and then I'm back out.

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:27.100
You know, some people are like, are you running?

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:28.100
Like, are you worried?

02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:29.100
Is this afraid about something?

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:43.100
No, but I am, you know, on this weird path, I guess, trying to look for something that I think I've been missing as far as my afterlife of a sort, you know, coming out of that.

02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:55.100
Are you looking for some kind of a deeper understanding of humanity, like from the specific experiences you had to get some deeper understanding of what the hell we're all doing here?

02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:58.100
I meet people every weekend with different stories.

02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:00.100
You know, people come to some of my classes.

02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:06.100
I show them how to weaponize the environment, how to arm themselves, how to not get abducted.

02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:14.100
I meet people that have gone through those experiences and are basically trying to work through some of their own issues by going through the training like that.

02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:20.100
I get to meet people that are, you know, people that I've only seen online, you know, or seen in videos.

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.100
I remember meeting Royce Gracie in Harvard City.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.100
I heard of that guy.

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.100
He's a pretty interesting character.

02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.100
I remember seeing him in a bootleg VHS video.

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:31.100
I told him about it.

02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:36.100
We were doing a class out at Emerson Knives.

02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:42.100
It's a knife company, but Mr. Emerson also has like a jujitsu gym there where Royce straightens out of.

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:45.100
That's his space.

02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:50.100
And, you know, they're teaching how to defend against somebody trying to stab you.

02:10:50.100 --> 02:11:00.100
And I'm showing them all the ways you can get around that and fabricate and improvise and smuggle things, basically the adversarial side of that.

02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:05.100
That's what I'm known for, the psychology and kind of the ways that people do that.

02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:12.100
And I remember him seeing some of the stuff that I was doing and just being like, where are you from? Mexico.

02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:13.100
Makes sense.

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:23.100
You know, somebody from Brazil, you know, tipping the hat to somebody from Mexico as far as him seeing the violence and some of the mentality behind it.

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:35.100
So for people who don't know, Royce Gracie is the legendary martial artist that probably introduced Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to the American audience, to the world, to the process of UFC and showing the effectiveness of it.

02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:42.100
And in practice that a little skinny guy can defeat a big aggressive guy.

02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:51.100
So an anaconda, a small anaconda walking into that ring with his family behind wearing pajamas, wearing pajamas and everything.

02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:56.100
What is this guy wearing pajamas for? And then he would strangle people with those pajamas.

02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:58.100
I remember seeing that and just having it.

02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:12.100
I think probably what a generation before had with Bruce Lee, I guess, are my generation was Royce walking into that walking into that octagon and changing paradigms.

02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:20.100
Seeing him in that gym is also I have a gun owner and shooter, which is interesting.

02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:38.100
You know, having seen somebody like him who is, you know, well versed with his hands also be a man that has gone into the realm of being well versed with with weaponry, which is an aspect of of martial arts and the martial way of thinking that, you know, some people kind of.

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:44.100
The purists will stick with one side of it, but he's obviously a warrior in a lot of ways.

02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:50.100
So just as a small tangent, so you're somebody that you don't just look at unarmed combat.

02:12:50.100 --> 02:13:01.100
You look at the full spectrum of the chaos of combat that's outside of the realm of Jiu-Jitsu and even just mixed martial arts, unarmed, armed with knives and beyond.

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:05.100
Yes, was his mind open to the fuller spectrum of violence?

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:11.100
Yeah, I mean, he was he was in the middle of this class that we were doing where people were basically focusing on both.

02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:16.100
Ernest Emerson, who's a famous for his knives, he has a knife company.

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:21.100
It's a nice for NASA, you know, not only that, but he's also a very avid martial artist.

02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:25.100
He trained with a lot of Filipino martial arts related to knives and stuff like that.

02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:31.100
But a different mindset, you know, a defensive mindset to train people how to defend against that.

02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:34.100
And you have Royce, who's he's from Brazil.

02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:36.100
I mean, he has some street in him.

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:43.100
That's something that, you know, those guys didn't call as well, we say in Mexico, seeing the ways he would.

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:53.100
He stepped in there and provided some encouragement to the people there as far as, you know, how people sometimes focus on the this is a system and this is a way.

02:13:53.100 --> 02:14:01.100
But there's other ways out there that might negate or defeat the ways that you are concentrating on, you know, so kind of get out of that bubble.

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:10.100
My whole kind of speciality or what I focus on is mindset and figuring out the software that some of these people gain and gather from.

02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:16.100
If I need to arm myself, you know, the easiest thing to manufacture in most places appointed object.

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:23.100
So I can take that crystal big pen that you're writing on that notepad with and using the friction from the carpet.

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:27.100
I can turn it into a hypodermic needle that you can then poke into somebody's neck.

02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.100
What's the process of doing that?

02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.100
I can do it right now if you want.

02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:33.100
Can you use your words for the listener and also because I'm terrified.

02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:35.100
No, I could.

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:39.100
Basically, you can take the friction, the heat and friction created from this carpet.

02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.100
Yes.

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:42.100
You can grab that pen in of itself.

02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:48.100
It will pierce flesh, but it will slow itself down because it has a few angles on to on the tip.

02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.100
Oh, you want to wear down the angles.

02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:59.100
So if you take that tip off and you grab it and grind it on an angle on the carpet, the heat will actually turn it into a hypodermic needle if you know what you're doing.

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:02.100
Hypodermic meaning like it smoothens the entry.

02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:06.100
It'll make a point in an angle that will guide its way into your flesh.

02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:11.100
So you can actually go through a torso with that if you know what you're doing as a small tangent.

02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:14.100
You also gave me a present.

02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:17.100
It could be one of the most epic presents I've ever received.

02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:19.100
You give it to Rogan.

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:22.100
Can you explain what I'm holding in my hands?

02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:24.100
There's a guy online, coffin tramp.

02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:26.100
This is a moniker.

02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:30.100
It is a G10 rod.

02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:34.100
G10 is a very strong material, basically capable.

02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:41.100
A lot of people make actually G10 knives, which are basically non-magnetic, non-ferrous objects that can be utilized as a stabbing.

02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.100
The core of it isn't an actual pencil core.

02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:52.100
It's a G10 core and it's encased in oak, hard oak.

02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:55.100
So that is capable again of stabbing through a torso.

02:15:55.100 --> 02:16:03.100
Now, the guy that made that is an artisan, you know, makes that it looks like a pencil concealed in the nature of the object itself.

02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:09.100
But that small object is capable of being introduced into a chest cavity.

02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:17.100
You know, all it takes is about the half of your thumb or the length of your thumb to stab into your chest cavity.

02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:27.100
And now your pericardium is pierced and it's being filled with blood or your whole heart is pierced and you have a few minutes to live if you're at a standing heart rate.

02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:32.100
So this has the effectiveness of a knife, essentially.

02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:36.100
It has the effectiveness of a shank or an ice pick.

02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:40.100
You know, it's not going to cut, but it's going to make a hole where it's not the chin be.

02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:44.100
Here the pen is literally mightier than the sword.

02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:52.100
This is really epic from like a perspective of an academic.

02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:57.100
This is a symbol of both intelligence and violence.

02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.100
I love it.

02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:10.100
And also the current state of affairs where people need to arm themselves with things that are concealed as far as their purpose in a place where in a country or in a society that limits their ability to arm themselves.

02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:19.100
So if you're going to a safe place, you're going to a place where no weapons allowed, which means a target rich environment if you're a predator.

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:22.100
That's a sign of rebellion.

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:30.100
Let this be a signal of everyone should be terrified when you're around me because even a pencil can murder you.

02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:32.100
I intend to use this.

02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:38.100
Nobody owns life, but anybody that can hold a frying pan owns death is a quote that I heard once, which is a beautiful one.

02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:40.100
I'm looking if anyone betrays me.

02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:41.100
This is the way to go.

02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:59.100
Can you, given all your experience and all the different ways and you think about martial arts and violence in Mexico and in the world, speaking of hoists, what is your approach to conflict like a street fight?

02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:06.100
What advice would you give people in the full spectrum of what a street altercation might entail?

02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:08.100
What is the best way to approach it?

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:11.100
I think before you get there, you have to prepare.

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:22.100
One of the first things I tell people is if you don't have a basic TCCC training class behind you, you should reanalyze your life and your ability to prepare.

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.100
TCCC.

02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:32.100
Basically how to stop somebody from bleeding out or dying from a stab wound, gunshot wound or any of those types of wounds or an amputated leg during an ID scenario.

02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:39.100
Anything you would see in a Boston marathon type event or a Vegas shooting event where people are getting shot, stabbed, cut.

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:44.100
So understand how to help people, how to help yourself post violence.

02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:48.100
You don't want to be a detriment to the situation.

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:49.100
You want to be an asset.

02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:56.100
So build yourself up as an asset in a situation like that because you might be doing that on yourself or on somebody else.

02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:05.100
And also it helps you understand what situations are going to result in a lot of in a difficult situation to deal with afterwards.

02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:09.100
Yeah, it also teaches you what to stab and what to shoot.

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:17.100
If you're thinking about it in a full and on all the dimensions of it, you know, you know, there's there's all weapon, all knowledge can be weaponized.

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:27.100
And I think that's the approach all people should kind of figure out for themselves when they start getting ready or if they want to take the responsibility of their own safety in their hands.

02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:32.100
So in a self-defense situation, there's a lot of questions here, but what does one stab?

02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:40.100
There's the carotid arteries, which are used commonly in jujitsu as something to choke because they feed a computer, you know.

02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:45.100
So there's a lot of blood flowing through that required for the successful operation of the computer.

02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:50.100
And not a lot of stuff is guarding the outside world from your carotid arteries.

02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.100
It's a really weird design, by the way.

02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:54.100
It is not a smart one.

02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:57.100
It doesn't even make sense because with mammals, they bite each other's neck.

02:19:57.100 --> 02:20:00.100
Like, why can't you have more protection?

02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:04.100
Because this is the only like us humans don't use our mouth to kill each other.

02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:07.100
But most mammals, most predators do.

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.100
It's like, why the hell don't we protect this?

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:11.100
We do have a defensive mechanism.

02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:17.100
And you see it sometimes when people are ambushed and people try to open up each other's necks from behind.

02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:25.100
If you push somebody's neck forward, the carotids will actually lower themselves and be encased in more flesh and muscle.

02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:28.100
If you pull a head back, not so much.

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:34.100
So that's a way that at least, I think, the evolutionary, we have a defensive mechanism for that.

02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:43.100
There's a few videos out there of people getting their neck sewn back shut after somebody pushed their head forward to try and slice their necks and they survived.

02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:47.100
So this is a viable target.

02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.100
The heart is another one.

02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:55.100
Interesting thing about the heart, people get alarmed when I talk about this and show it in classes.

02:20:55.100 --> 02:21:02.100
Again, a lot of the classes I do are for orientation and for people to recognize that behavior.

02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:07.100
So a lot of law enforcement comes to some of these classes, oh, that's horrible.

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.100
That's how somebody will kill somebody.

02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:14.100
Yeah, this is how people that know their shit will try and approach somebody and stab you to death.

02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.100
This is how they would do it.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:27.100
There's a tendency to view what we see in John Wick or view what we see in this martial arts community where they're slicing and dicing people different myriads of ways.

02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:37.100
A lot of that is based on dueling-based cultures like the Filipino martial arts or some of the Italian martial arts out there where somebody's facing off with somebody else with a similar weapon,

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:42.100
where both of us are agreeing to basically get into a stabbing competition.

02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:50.100
That would make sense in that scenario, in that context, but I've never seen a lot of people actually get into these one-on-one knife altercations.

02:21:50.100 --> 02:22:01.100
What we see now in a modern context when it talks about weaponry is an ambush-counter-ambush-based scenario where somebody pulls out a knife turning a grappling situation on the street

02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:15.100
or when somebody turns a striking exchange of punches into pulling out a cheap gas station knife or a pen or a rock from the ground or a handgun.

02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:21.100
Most modern combatives, when it comes to weaponry, should be based on the whole aspect of ambush and counter-ambush.

02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:27.100
There's a lot of people showing valuable type of material and coursework on this out there.

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:36.100
My whole approach and my specific realm is in the aspect of how people go from the process of learning some of these things from experiential stuff.

02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:45.100
People that grew up in rural places grow up on pig farms that actually get the experiences of processing a pig, for example, or processing an animal.

02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:57.100
Those people will have more skills as hunters. Those people will have more skills with a knife if they pick it up as a weapon than most of the martial artists that I've seen approach some of these classes

02:22:57.100 --> 02:23:02.100
where I go and have a simulated torso in the form of a pig hanging in a room somewhere.

02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:10.100
Some of that has to do with just the familiarity and the comfort of just the biology of a living organism.

02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:15.100
If you cut off certain things, if you cut a certain thing, it's just a meat vehicle.

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:18.100
The same thing. The medical training should come first.

02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:23.100
Or if you don't have that, be a hunter or go to a butchery class.

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:28.100
That will teach you more about how to use a knife on somebody else than anything.

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:30.100
That'll give you the experience of flesh.

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:39.100
I do this example every now and then where I have people bring in a tactical knife and they'll bring in a butter knife.

02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:45.100
I ask them which will go through a torso. We have a pig there, so it simulates a torso pretty closely.

02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:48.100
Most people will say, that butter knife is not going to go through.

02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:54.100
And it does. It does go through. It's thin enough, strong enough, sturdy enough that it'll go through.

02:23:54.100 --> 02:24:03.100
Kitchen knife, a cheap one that costs 89 cents at a Walmart and an expensive $400 one.

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:09.100
And the cheap one will outperform the expensive one. The tip will snap off during some of it.

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:21.100
Yeah, I have to say that just as a small tangent, I went to a farm and just seeing the butchering of meat and so on.

02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:28.100
And the processing of meat and pigs and cows, that's uncomfortable.

02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:35.100
But I think also it's honest and raw and that's something that probably everyone should experience regularly.

02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:40.100
It's also humbling to remind you.

02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:49.100
When I had a dog, Homer, he's in Newfoundland, that I was very close with and we lost him.

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:54.100
And I just remember that I carried him. He's like 200 something pounds.

02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:57.100
I had to carry him. I had to put him to sleep.

02:24:57.100 --> 02:25:04.100
And one of the biggest realizations is like, oh, this is just a biological thing.

02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:11.100
To realize that this is just meat, this is not, and you can cut it.

02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:15.100
And then if you bleed, all of a sudden the life can disappear from you.

02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:21.100
It's all gone. It's like, holy shit, there's this meat vehicle that some people have referred to as Lex.

02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:25.100
I'm just a few stabbings away from leaving.

02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:28.100
Yeah, I'm leaving. Goodbye. That's a soul that just flies away.

02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:30.100
It used to be that we had to hang around.

02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:34.100
People would come back from battle and we would hear things next to the campfire.

02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:36.100
As far as, oh, he stabbed somebody here and this happens.

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:42.100
But now we live in an age where you can, when I do a class, this is a stab to the heart.

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:48.100
And here's like five videos of it happening live on live leaks or whatever.

02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:52.100
And we can deconstruct that. Not only that, but what weapon was used?

02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:54.100
Oh, it was a gas station folder.

02:25:54.100 --> 02:26:00.100
It was a pioneer woman knife from Walmart with flowers on the handle, whatever it was.

02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:06.100
And people start realizing that it doesn't take a lot, that it doesn't take a lot of training.

02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:12.100
Because a lot of these people are not high level assassins trained by ninjas in the hills or anything like that.

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:18.100
They're people that grew up really or learned by seeing that behavior in others.

02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:21.100
And when they start coming to the realization that it is pretty easy to do that,

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:24.100
and they start figuring out like, how do you counteract that?

02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:27.100
Well, number one, learn the behavior yourself so you can recognize it.

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:32.100
The whole aspect of being a good counter-ambush team is to be the best ambusher in the planet.

02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:37.100
So again, the whole aspect of Musashi saying, know your enemy, know his sword.

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.100
You figure that out as far as learning that behavior.

02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:44.100
When you start seeing how some of these stabbings occur,

02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:49.100
the first thing you notice is that one of the hands is always kind of out of the picture.

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:53.100
Or there's a lack of symmetry in the people that are about to do something horrible.

02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:58.100
So when you see lack of symmetry in the environment, somebody with their hands going backwards,

02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:07.100
there's a crowd of people and two or one individual is looking counter where everybody else is looking.

02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:11.100
Or there's a hyper aware individual in the crowd.

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:16.100
The hyper aware are always usually out there to fuck somebody over.

02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:20.100
Or they're trying to keep those predators from fucking somebody else over.

02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:26.100
So unless you step back and you put yourself in the process of learning how they learn

02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:32.100
and you become that potential nightmare person, it's hard to recognize that in a crowd.

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:38.100
It feels like one of the significant ways to win as a Street Fighter

02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:43.100
is to avoid it by sort of sending pacifist signals in every way,

02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:48.100
meaning avoiding the situation whenever there's a hyper vigilant people.

02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:54.100
You just kind of avoid signaling that you're one of the players of interest.

02:27:54.100 --> 02:28:02.100
If we're talking about counter ambush, at which point do you do that versus shift to the aggression?

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:07.100
I think violence should be always an option. Everybody should have that option.

02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:10.100
And you need to be good at that option.

02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:14.100
I think I heard Jordan Peterson talk about the fact that everybody needs to be dangerous

02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:16.100
but keep that shit under control.

02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:19.100
I think he was referring to a different context.

02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:23.100
I know. I'm referring to the ability of...

02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.100
The little physical conflict as well.

02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:32.100
There's two cases that I saw of people utilizing social engineering to a beautiful degree to de-escalate shit.

02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:38.100
One guy, first off, if you're in a place where people are grabbing your wife's ass or something like that,

02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:39.100
what are you doing there?

02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:45.100
There's a load of things that are wrong with everything that you're doing in your life to be in that environment.

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:48.100
But let's say you're in an inescapable situation.

02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:53.100
There was this guy who was in a compromised position.

02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:57.100
Somebody wanted to fight him, like legit kick his ass.

02:28:57.100 --> 02:29:00.100
And he said, okay, let's go.

02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:05.100
But I need to warn you that I have hep C before we go outside.

02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:07.100
It's masterful.

02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:11.100
I was getting my phone out to film this.

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:14.100
And even I was just lowering my phone to give him a slow clap.

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:17.100
That was a beautiful move.

02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:20.100
And then there was this other man.

02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:27.100
There was a riot somewhere in Ensenada, the municipality of Ensenada and Baja.

02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:28.100
They were protesting.

02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:34.100
Some of the people that pick those fields down there, part of a tribe called Los Tricis,

02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:38.100
very hardy, hardworking people, but nefarious people too.

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:42.100
They're pretty good at their thing.

02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:45.100
There was a riot line they couldn't break.

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:49.100
And this old man walks in the middle of the riot line and yells, grenade!

02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:54.100
And throws an avocado in the middle of all the cops.

02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:58.100
He broke that riot line with an avocado.

02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:00.100
That could have gone wrong in so many ways.

02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:01.100
But it didn't.

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.100
I don't know.

02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:03.100
There's small lessons there.

02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:08.100
There is a case to be made about social engineering, about learning about behavior,

02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:14.100
about learning how to lie and how to move your way or navigate your way around situations like that.

02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:20.100
Small things like bartering, knowing how to bribe people in conflict zones is the thing that I show

02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:24.100
when I talk about or train people to work in hostile environments.

02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:30.100
De-escalation, specifically figuring out what is of value in the environment,

02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:36.100
what things you shouldn't be doing in an environment that might be considered disrespectful or out of place.

02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:40.100
People have a tendency that it didn't grow up in places that are violent,

02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:45.100
to make continuous eye contact with somebody that might be an issue.

02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:48.100
Or smiling, when there's nothing to smile about.

02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:53.100
I think there's a picture I saw somewhere of Russians taking a portrait,

02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:57.100
and there's Americans there, and the Americans are smiling, but the Russians aren't.

02:30:57.100 --> 02:31:00.100
Because what is there to smile about, which is true.

02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:02.100
And of course, it's not as simple as smile or not smile.

02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:04.100
There's subtlety to it, like you said.

02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:09.100
Eye contact is a super interesting one, because I found in my own life,

02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:12.100
like not making eye contact is...

02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:16.100
I know people will be joking, but it's a really powerful way to de-escalate.

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:25.100
And there's such a fascinating thing, though, because you could talk about drunk fights that are harmless.

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:29.100
But I feel like the same dynamic applies to the most violent conflict, including wars.

02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:33.100
I feel like ego is part of this.

02:31:33.100 --> 02:31:37.100
So to me, the question of conflict, whether it's a street fight or anything else,

02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:45.100
is the calculus of, are you willing to take an L in terms of psychology?

02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:49.100
Somebody grabs your wife's ass, you mentioned.

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:52.100
Boy, if you let that happen, you go home.

02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:56.100
You're going to have to pay the price of you were the person who didn't defend you.

02:31:56.100 --> 02:32:01.100
Like in your relationship, you didn't defend your wife's honor.

02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:04.100
You're going to psychologically pay that price yourself.

02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:11.100
And depending on your wife, she might secretly also lose a little bit of respect for you.

02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.100
Now, how do you play that calculus?

02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:16.100
Because now we see the war in Ukraine.

02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:26.100
I would say there is elements of similar posturing in the United States, in Europe, in Ukraine, Russia, China.

02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:28.100
At a macro level.

02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:34.100
At a geopolitics, it's still somebody grabs somebody's ass, and you're not backing down.

02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:41.100
So to take those losses and basically just posture, lower your head and live to fight another day type situation.

02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:46.100
The thing with modern violence is the access to weaponry.

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:50.100
I mean, again, nobody owns life, but anybody who can hold a frying pan can own death.

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:55.100
I've seen people get double-leg takedown somebody on the ground.

02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:58.100
It's a different thing doing in the mats versus concrete.

02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:01.100
That's a good way to kill somebody.

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:06.100
The most prolific impact weapon on the planet is the planet itself.

02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:11.100
You can see various videos of people online where they fall and they hit their head or somebody hits their head.

02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:15.100
And they go into this stretched out fit, basically.

02:33:15.100 --> 02:33:20.100
And that might not kill you then, but it'll kill you that night or the second night if you don't get checked out.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:23.100
People bleed out internally, get an edema.

02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:30.100
Again, the whole aspect of me showing how some of these things, not only some of these methodologies and somehow people prepare for violence

02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:36.100
and how people experience violence, how they make their weapons, how the people fight in the streets and stuff like that.

02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:40.100
It's to recognize that behavior from the inception.

02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:44.100
There's a video I show where there's a bunch of street kids in Rio de Janeiro.

02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:50.100
I think it's during the Olympics where they're snatching chains and cell phones from people.

02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:53.100
And it's a fun video. See it.

02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:58.100
The first thing you learn about it is how they target people.

02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:01.100
Now, who are they going after? There's a bunch of people there.

02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:04.100
Why are they going after that specific person?

02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:12.100
And they start learning about profiling and how they identify victim mentality or the perfect victim, lack of awareness.

02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:19.100
They keep on a straight line, avoidance, avoidance of eye contact if they're doing something, if areas are wrong,

02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:26.100
and how they pick who they're going to go after, the small people, the women, even some of the men.

02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:31.100
And they separate the men that they're perfect victims versus the men that's going to turn around and punch them in the face.

02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:34.100
What are they looking for?

02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:41.100
Well, first off, you notice that the men that are in that environment, that look at them and are aware of their presence,

02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:44.100
the hyper aware are the ones that are not good to target.

02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:46.100
So that's the first lesson there.

02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:51.100
So it's probably a good idea not only to be hyper aware, but to recognize that hyper awareness in others.

02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:54.100
If I want to separate myself from the victim crowd.

02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:58.100
Another thing you notice is these are kids going after some grown adults.

02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:02.100
And some of these grown adult men are with women.

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:11.100
And you see them kind of getting outside of the grasp of the kids that are trying to rip their chains off their neck or their cell phones.

02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:14.100
And they have no consideration for the women around them.

02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:19.100
You see other men that are with women and you see them grab the women and put them behind them.

02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:22.100
And immediately they'll say this is the wrong one.

02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:24.100
Let me move off to the next one.

02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:35.100
So that small little lesson in those videos will show you first how these kids are growing up to profile and target who the perfect victims are.

02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:37.100
That's a school for them.

02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:39.100
And that is an adversarial school.

02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:42.100
We should look at that school and apply to ourselves.

02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:49.100
So in general, you think conflict, ultimately the people that are doing conflict are looking for weakness?

02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:53.100
I mean, they're looking for opportunity, opportunistic.

02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:54.100
That's the predators.

02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:55.100
That's what they do.

02:35:55.100 --> 02:36:06.100
They look for an opportunity, you know, from jumping down from a tree and getting the slowest gazelle to looking for the opportune moment to pounce on something that's probably big, but the risk is worth it.

02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:09.100
I feel like there's several motivations.

02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:15.100
But isn't there also a power hierarchy motivation as well?

02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:21.100
Like you, there's something about the big guy that tempts you to send a message, especially with gangs.

02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:26.100
Aren't they constantly sort of trying to signal that they're at the alpha?

02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:28.100
Yeah, I mean, there's a different situation.

02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:36.100
So you could be you could be facing a sociopathic predator who is looking for something in you that you're the resource that they're looking after.

02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:38.100
Maybe it's a woman.

02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:48.100
It could be a group of people that don't like the fact that you have a specific nationality or your passport is stamped in a specific way or that you pray to whatever God.

02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:51.100
All these factor in.

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:54.100
But in the end, they all do the same thing.

02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:56.100
They look for an advantageous position.

02:36:56.100 --> 02:37:01.100
If I were to target you, I would put you in between that wall and me.

02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:08.100
So you have two avenues of exits and I would step on one of your feet to keep that avenue closed.

02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.100
So you have to go this way.

02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:11.100
So this is where my knife is going to be.

02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:15.100
You see that behavior mirrored everywhere in the world.

02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:18.100
First off, you look for advantages, right?

02:37:18.100 --> 02:37:30.100
If it's something that's unavoidable, like you're in between me and my ability to go home or you're in between me and my ability to feed my family or you're in between me and my ability to posture to the people that are behind me, the young guys that I'm in charge.

02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:35.100
I will do everything in my power to end you.

02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:47.100
The motivations are not my realm, but the ways they do it are basically the advantage part of it.

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:51.100
So desperation is dangerous.

02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:52.100
It's a dangerous school.

02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:58.100
When I say dangerous school, I mean the most dangerous people usually come from those desperate environments.

02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:13.100
You can have people in Coronado holding onto logs in the ocean and go through this millions of dollars worth of training and just be professional killers for the government and just be these incredible human beings.

02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:22.100
And then there's a kid that will walk up to one of them when he's off and put an ice pick right into his chest when he's least expecting it.

02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:25.100
And that doesn't mean that one is superior than the other.

02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:30.100
It just means that there's more than one way to become that.

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:32.100
Teenagers terrify me.

02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:48.100
It feels like the intensity of desperation, like the capacity of a teenager, like 16, 17, to be desperate and also not have the matured understanding of ethics of the world.

02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:53.100
Like they have this intensity of feeling that is unlike anything else.

02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.100
They don't have a volume knob to them.

02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:58.100
So it's like a garden hose without a nozzle on it so you can regulate it.

02:38:58.100 --> 02:38:59.100
They haven't developed that.

02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:04.100
They haven't learned that maybe from somebody else or it used to be warrior cultures.

02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:11.100
You would go apprentice under somebody or you would learn some of these things from other people, even some modern gangs have a little bit of that.

02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:20.100
But if you're not and you're just this kid that's been playing Call of Duty all of his life or has been witnessing violence in media,

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:27.100
and there's no sense of it's probably a bad idea to go off and do this because all of these repercussions.

02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:30.100
I could see how that could be a danger to society.

02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:40.100
And some of the volume knobs, some of the countermeasures, the people exploding on somebody else with a weapon.

02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:43.100
You see videos constantly online.

02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:51.100
I remember seeing this one of these two teenage girls somewhere in the US and one of them just there's a fight.

02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:57.100
There's a hair pulling competition and all of a sudden one of them takes out a knife and it just happens like that.

02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:03.100
And it's just pure and restrained downward stabbing.

02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:07.100
You know, you're like, wait, where does that come from?

02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:13.100
Well, she's from an environment where she saw that as an option.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:15.100
She didn't see the repercussions of it.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:21.100
And she found herself in a place where she thought that was the only viable option, pulling out a weapon.

02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:25.100
And I think that's the dangerous part of it.

02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:31.100
So how do you prepare to win those kinds of situations, to escape those kinds of situations?

02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:35.100
Like you said, it's training, it's exposing your mind.

02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:39.100
I always tell people if you don't have a combative base, you don't have a base.

02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:41.100
Boxing, jiu-jitsu.

02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:44.100
And that gives you what, like an awareness of your body kind of thing?

02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:47.100
It gives you an awareness of your body, give you a spatial awareness.

02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:55.100
If you can't see the points with your peripheral vision, if you can't see the points of somebody's feet in your peripheral vision,

02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:59.100
they are in range to stab you in the heart if they wanted to.

02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:02.100
And that's something you learn from boxing, that you learn from jiu-jitsu.

02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:07.100
You learn from a bunch of combat arts where you learn about distance and angling people.

02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:10.100
That comes from this experience that you have.

02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:16.100
Again, a lot of these things were just horse play when we were growing up in some cultures,

02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:19.100
or rough and tumble with your brothers and shit like that.

02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:23.100
But some of us are growing up in single kid homes now, and we don't get that.

02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:24.100
We were missing that.

02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:28.100
And if you don't have it, then you find it in the jiu-jitsu gym.

02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:30.100
You find it in the boxing gym.

02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:32.100
You find it in a Thai boxing gym.

02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:40.100
You find it in places where they specialize in focusing on certain aspects of this whole combative whole.

02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:48.100
It used to be, before UFC, the kung fu man, that kung fu guy, that's street lethal shit.

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:52.100
You can't use it in the sporting, you can't show you this because it'll kill you.

02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:57.100
Now we pretty much know that most of that was flights of fancy or BS.

02:41:57.100 --> 02:41:58.100
It pains me too, man.

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:01.100
I wanted to learn some of the D-Mock single punch and killing technique.

02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:03.100
I remember those books.

02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:05.100
I'm still on the lookout for that.

02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:07.100
Maybe somewhere.

02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:10.100
Maybe if you put a pen in your hand, that might turn into that.

02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:12.100
That's the only way, right?

02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:16.100
But a lot of these myths are kind of faded away.

02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:22.100
Now you see people that have different combative bases, combining them all and becoming a fighter.

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:27.100
The UFC fight, two people fighting each other is one thing.

02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:36.100
You being in the middle of the Portland riots and a bunch of state troopers throwing gas at rioters and then rioters themselves fighting each other.

02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:40.100
And you finding yourself in the middle of that, that's a completely different thing.

02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:51.100
And if you think you're going to go on the ground and get in a guard with a guy swinging around a piece of a shovel handle as tear gas is going on,

02:42:51.100 --> 02:43:01.100
because you got stopped there and your car windows were broken and your family's in the backseat, that is a different situation.

02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:08.100
So you're going to get medical, learning about weaponry.

02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:19.100
I personally don't really like fighting on the ground, but that's why I forced myself to go to train with different people out there on the ground.

02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:20.100
You get to catch wrestling.

02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:23.100
So top and bottom, you don't like either.

02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:26.100
Personally, I like being in a car and running everybody over.

02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:29.100
That would be great if I could, or driving really far away.

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:43.100
Or I had this experience in Utah, some friends of mine, military, some of your best shooters, some of the best shooters in the US coming from the Marine Corps.

02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:48.100
They were showing me how they would shoot something from really far away.

02:43:48.100 --> 02:43:54.100
And I was like, you don't even have to be in the same vicinity.

02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:58.100
The scope of violence, how far you can be from it or how close you could be from it.

02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:03.100
Just wait till we get to see what we can do in the cyber attack world.

02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:08.100
We can destroy your whole well-being, your whole life, your identity.

02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:09.100
That's another aspect of it too.

02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:20.100
Financial and then figure out where you live, in terms of ambush, figuring out everything about you such that hurting you is easy.

02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:29.100
I have a class where we specifically work on social engineering and how you can go about something at a micro level.

02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:41.100
I do a class with a guy named Matt Fidler who is one of the premier experts on how to get into and bypass locks.

02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:48.100
He'll show you how to open up every single or bypass every single commercial lock available in the United States.

02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:52.100
He'll spread it out and it will open up everything.

02:44:53.100 --> 02:45:01.100
My part in his class is I talk about how you can pull some of that off in a public space and not get caught.

02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:08.100
Or how you would employ some of these things in a context where it's useful for law enforcement, for the military, stuff like that.

02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:14.100
We have this exercise in a public space where there's a bunch of padlocks in the environment.

02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:23.100
We paint them pink so people know it's our padlocks and we're not breaking into anybody else's padlocks if we get approached and asked about it.

02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:31.100
I ask the students, you have to gather all these padlocks from this public space, so how would you do it?

02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:33.100
A lot of them are trying to pick them.

02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:35.100
They're very suspiciously picking them and stuff like that.

02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:39.100
They get caught and it's a whole situation.

02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:45.100
But the smart ones will basically develop a social media campaign related to the padlocks.

02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:50.100
A beautiful example of this, and this actually happened here in Texas.

02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:53.100
I did a class out in Dallas.

02:45:53.100 --> 02:46:01.100
We put the padlocks all over this public mall and the students basically came up with a breast cancer awareness campaign online.

02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:05.100
They made fliers for it.

02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:08.100
They did the social media page on a campaign.

02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:10.100
They did this email chain.

02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.100
When they went there, people were expecting them.

02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:19.100
They normalized the behavior through social media and they were walking around bowl cutters in the middle of the mall, cutting these things off.

02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:25.100
That's a beautiful solution to a complex problem of that nature.

02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:31.100
Again, the weaponizing part of it, all knowledge can be weaponized.

02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:41.100
If you focus on getting in a street fight with somebody with your fist or a knife, you're missing out on the whole complexity of violence and the way that it's now being utilized.

02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:52.100
In terms of breaking out locks and restraints and captivity, let's talk about a dark topic that you're one of the world's experts in, kidnapping.

02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:56.100
You teach courses on counter-kidnapping and terrorism.

02:46:56.100 --> 02:47:03.100
I read an estimate that criminal gangs get $500 million a year in ransom payments from kidnapping.

02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:07.100
Just at a high level, what is kidnapping? Who does it and why?

02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:13.100
What are some insights that can help us understand what is this problem in the world?

02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:16.100
It happens in different ways in different parts of the world.

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:21.100
I just sent off a group of people that trained some of the Ukrainians.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:26.100
Some of the stuff that they were showing them was some of the counter custody stuff that I showed them.

02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:35.100
A friend of mine named Vince went out there and was showing them some of the aspects of how to utilize things like Kevlar cordage and how to infuse it in their uniform.

02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:39.100
If they get zip-tied to cut them open, it's a war setting.

02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:43.100
It talks about being captive in a war zone.

02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:49.100
But the information or the methodology actually comes from Mexico, that methodology as far as how I learned it.

02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:51.100
In terms of how to escape from restraints and stuff like that.

02:47:51.100 --> 02:48:08.100
In Mexico, you have abductions happening where cartels who hold control over a specific place or zone are having a hard time with financial situations as far as maybe they're not making enough money to pay everybody off.

02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:10.100
They let them freelance basically.

02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:24.100
In a lot of ways, some of these criminal groups freelance or some of these groups actually professionalize to abduct businessmen, abduct the sons of businessmen or people that have money to ask for ransoms for them basically.

02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:31.100
They've taken captivity and abduction to an art form in places like Mexico.

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:41.100
It has a history all over the world, but specifically my experience with it was going to cartel safe houses that turn into holding places.

02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:51.100
You would see homemade prison cells and stuff like that and people being held in captivity for months if not years as they were milking their family for everything they owned.

02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:56.100
So it turns out into a business, they're not actually even interested in hurting the people physically.

02:48:56.100 --> 02:49:00.100
They're interested in hurting them financially.

02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:06.100
Financially and also if they get hurt, they're hurt for a purpose which is to make their family pay up faster or more.

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:17.100
Some of the abduction groups that I've seen out there, professional ones in Mexico, basically make it a living to target people that have abduction insurance or that work for companies that have good abduction insurance.

02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:21.100
So it's almost like an ATM for them. It's like, ah, here we go again.

02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:25.100
So there's some of that going on. Some not so much.

02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:33.100
Some abductions are express. I mean, I'll grab you with a gunpoint, take you to an ATM, you empty it out and then you're on your way.

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:37.100
That's an express kidnapping. That might not be worth you doing anything insane.

02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:42.100
You just go with the motions. But some people do get picked up.

02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:50.100
I have trained people with prior experiences of abductions in Mexico and here in the United States.

02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:58.100
People that have spent some time in captivity with loved ones here, like ex-boyfriends or boyfriends that tie them up and beat the shit out of them.

02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:06.100
And the restraints that are utilized are zip ties and handcuffs sometimes or duct tape or their own clothing, things of this nature.

02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:18.100
Basically, what somebody is looking for when they tie anybody up is to convince you that they are in control, that they are God and that any hope of you releasing those restraints or getting out of that situation is hopeless.

02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:30.100
From a cartel group picking you up in the middle of a dirt road somewhere in Cancun to ex-boyfriends showing up at your house and tying you up until you agree to get back with them.

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:36.100
That's the same thing. And some of the restraints that are being utilized come from different places.

02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:52.100
I remember an instructor I had way back when told me that the proliferation of zip ties as a restraint in criminal abductions came up after the movie Heat came out because everybody wanted to be Robert De Niro zip tying people in the bank robbery at the end of the movie.

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:56.100
Criminals saw that and it became a good thing.

02:50:56.100 --> 02:51:03.100
Can you actually speak to the, is it possible to systematically learn how to escape restraints like handcuffs, rope, zip ties?

02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:15.100
The best at it are not the military. They're not seer program people. They are criminals. I learned how to get out handcuffs from a 15-year-old who was in charge of meth sales in La Avenida Revolucion in Tijuana.

02:51:15.100 --> 02:51:16.100
Is there a system to it?

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:25.100
I mean, it's not specifically a system. It's usually what happens is they'll buy a set of handcuffs and they will mess around with them in a playing feature.

02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:33.100
So one thing I do in a class is first off, I'm honest about the fact that some, you know, all the restraints are temporary, even marriage.

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:40.100
This is like, wait, can we just pause on the deep philosophical? You're like Miyamoto Musashi with that statement.

02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:48.100
All restraints are temporary, even marriage. I just like adding that one in there for last because this is a dark subject.

02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:50.100
Every cage can be escaped.

02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:58.100
All restraints are temporary. You either free yourself from the restraints, somebody else takes them off, or you die and your body rots away around them.

02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:06.100
You know, those are the options. And I like that first option myself. The second option is pretty cool if you can convince somebody to do that for you.

02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:12.100
But that first option is an interesting one. You have to deconstruct restraints. Not all restraints are made the same.

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:20.100
You can train to get out of handcuffs here in the US and, you know, focus on a pair of Smith & Wesson handcuffs, which are kind of the most common brand of handcuffs here.

02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:25.100
But if you find yourself in detention somewhere in Russia, the handcuffs out there are completely different.

02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:32.100
You know, the key way is different. The mechanism is different. But some of the same ways of bypassing those mechanisms are.

02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:37.100
Let me write this down. So in Russia, what kind are they using in Russia? I'm thinking of traveling there. I need this information.

02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:41.100
I'll send you a specific model and details on how to get out of those.

02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:43.100
Just asking for a friend. I'm sorry.

02:52:43.100 --> 02:52:51.100
So what I do is I take a pair of Smith & Wesson handcuffs. I put them in the middle of three people in a class. I spread them out.

02:52:51.100 --> 02:53:00.100
And I have them place them on each other in a just playing manner. I have handcuffs there and I have a pair of bowl cutters there in case somebody gets stuck.

02:53:01.100 --> 02:53:06.100
So they play with each other as far as putting them on randomly. I show them how to put them on appropriately.

02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:13.100
And then I show them a handcuff key and a handcuff key will open up handcuffs, interestingly enough.

02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:19.100
But the thing about a handcuff key is it's not made to be used by the person that is in those handcuffs.

02:53:19.100 --> 02:53:28.100
So that's the first lesson there. If you have a handcuff key, handcuff keys are the most used tool to open up handcuffs in custody situations.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:36.100
Both criminals escaping from the police to people escaping from criminals. Just the standard hidden handcuff key.

02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:42.100
So I show them how to modify the handcuff key so it's more optimal to use on yourself with just basic garbage that you can find.

02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:52.100
A piece of wire, a zip tie piece, basically how to put a leverage arm on the handcuff key so you can actually spin it in the keyway behind your back or in front of you.

02:53:52.100 --> 02:53:55.100
I'm trying to think. I don't think I've ever been in handcuffs.

02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:59.100
Appropriate way to handcuff somebody is palms out.

02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:01.100
How much restriction is there in terms of...

02:54:01.100 --> 02:54:06.100
There's a lot. If it's a hinge handcuff, there's a lot of restriction with no chain in the middle.

02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:07.100
Can you reach back?

02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:16.100
You could try and reach back or you can basically put yourself in a not compromised position and feed the most of your palm meat into the handcuff way.

02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:22.100
So when they shed it on you, you have more space to work with so you can spin your hand.

02:54:22.100 --> 02:54:24.100
We call it a passive resistance.

02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:34.100
Again, you go through a process with them where you deconstruct how people are handcuffed, handcuff keys and how to modify a handcuff key to be able to use on yourself.

02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:37.100
And all of these things, they're constructing as we go.

02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:38.100
So they basically...

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:40.100
Hey, what's a grinding surface?

02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:41.100
Well, there's concrete outside.

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:49.100
So they grind an angle on the key so you can get a key not to go straight into the keyway, but you can get it into the keyway at an angle, for example.

02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:52.100
It's something that is out there as far as a method.

02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:55.100
You can't spin a key behind your back because it's small.

02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:58.100
It's designed to be used by somebody else opening those handcuffs on you.

02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:03.100
So you put an arm on it so you can leverage our arms so you can spin it behind your back.

02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:08.100
You learn how to put yourself in not a compromised position.

02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:13.100
If somebody asks you for your hands so they could be cuffed, you don't do this.

02:55:14.100 --> 02:55:21.100
You do that or you put yourself in a cable grip behind your back, which is a pretty strong grip and it's hard to spread those hands apart.

02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:25.100
It's also something that people go into automatically when they're in fear.

02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:28.100
So all of these things are advantageous for you.

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:36.100
And you learn not only people get restrained, but you see videos of them because I show a bunch of abduction that's actually happening live.

02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:39.100
Again, the best thing is avoidance.

02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:45.100
But specifically when you work around restraints is, number one, learn how some of these restraints work.

02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:52.100
Number two is learning how some of the ready-made tools to get out of those restraints look like function.

02:55:52.100 --> 02:56:02.100
And number three, which is the advanced level, is learn how to construct all these things yourself, which is I think that is the best thing you can show somebody.

02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:08.100
For handcuffs, I just use a standard pair of handcuffs and then we deconstruct other very specialized handcuffs that might be out there.

02:56:08.100 --> 02:56:14.100
And you show them, if you're going to travel somewhere, learn what restraints are commonly available in the environment.

02:56:14.100 --> 02:56:28.100
Somebody going to sub-Saharan Africa carrying a plastic handcuff key, that's going to be useless out there because there's not going to be standard handcuffs out there that would be open with that type of key.

02:56:28.100 --> 02:56:37.100
Out there, you're probably going to be tied up with a chain and a padlock of some sort, maybe a 40-millimeter Chinese padlock with a plastic core that you can open with a lighter.

02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:46.100
If you can burn the core, melt the core open, or if you can leverage that open, that's a pretty easy thing to open, or a bobby pin you could reach all the way in the back and open the latch.

02:56:46.100 --> 02:56:49.100
What about rope? Is that common?

02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:57.100
Yeah, it is common. This is one of my favorite things for rope, something I usually carry in some places.

02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:02.100
It's another gift for you if you want. It's a ceramic razor blade.

02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:03.100
Nice.

02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:06.100
Is it capable of cutting?

02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:07.100
Nice.

02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:15.100
It's small. You can put it behind a label. I've seen some students put the Levi's label on there and just sew it back on.

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:25.100
It is non-metallic, non-ferrous, so in and out of that type of situation, you can get in and it's something you can have with you everywhere.

02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:29.100
This is a pretty fancy one, or you can just grab a simple razor blade.

02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:38.100
You're actually learning how to use or leverage a razor blade between your palms and know how to go up and down with it to be able to cut yourself.

02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:41.100
That's just practice to do that well.

02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:46.100
It's practice, and it's also exposure. This is a possibility. This is how you can hide it.

02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:53.100
Again, the whole smuggling aspect comes from a criminal mindset type setting, so how things are hidden, where they're hidden.

02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:59.100
When I talk about concealing objects of this nature, it usually comes from smuggling.

02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:03.100
The fact that I have something in a notebook comes from heroin smuggling.

02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:10.100
If you're not looking at the school of criminality, you're missing out on a big part of the equation.

02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:16.100
For people who want to learn about this, do you teach courses on this?

02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:17.100
Yeah.

02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:23.100
How do you get in touch with you or learn from you? Do you have stuff online or is it only in person?

02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:29.100
I have some stuff on my Patreon specifically. I have a Patreon where I share a lot of the online material.

02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:40.100
This is my notebook. I have a bunch of stuff that I just met somebody in Philadelphia that showed me a pretty unique way of utilizing a box cutter as a weapon.

02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:44.100
I wrote some of that down. I filmed some of it.

02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:49.100
It's not for any other reason. I'm not trying to create dangerous people out there.

02:58:49.100 --> 02:58:52.100
It's like, hey, look at this. This is something that's out there.

02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:56.100
A lot of that information, some of those notes and stuff like that, I keep on my Patreon.

02:58:56.100 --> 02:59:03.100
I used to share it openly on Facebook and Instagram, but that has not been possible anymore.

02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:09.100
Well, I'm a member of your Patreon and I recommend people sign up. It's really great because you also have philosophy.

02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:19.100
You're the Mexican Miyamoto Musashi. It's not just these skills, it's also the philosophy around it.

02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:24.100
I got that book of five rings before I went into training. I took that with me through training.

02:59:24.100 --> 02:59:32.100
The whole aspect of go to places frightening to the common brand of men, be put in jail and extricate yourself with your own wisdom.

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:40.100
I think he was speaking about experiencing the whole warrior's journey, the hero's journey of going out there and actually risking.

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:47.100
I think that's a pretty big basis and aspect of what the work I do and showing some of these things.

02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:52.100
There's a tendency to people say, hey, I'm afraid to go to Mexico. What do I need to know?

02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:55.100
Well, if you're afraid to go to Mexico, go to Mexico.

02:59:55.100 --> 03:00:01.100
I mean, I was in Detroit. I was pretty afraid when I was in Detroit and some parts of Detroit and the South Side of Chicago.

03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:07.100
But I don't want to be dictated where I can go and where I can't go because of safety.

03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:14.100
I want to take responsibility for that myself and figure out ways of being more capable and an asset to the people around me and myself.

03:00:14.100 --> 03:00:17.100
And that comes from experience.

03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:23.100
And people don't want to risk getting a shoulder injury, rolling a jujitsu or don't want to risk getting a bloody nose in boxing.

03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:24.100
But that is the way.

03:00:24.100 --> 03:00:28.100
Well, there's some aspect to fitting in.

03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:31.100
You quote Hattori Hanzo on imitation.

03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:41.100
The most important thing you should keep in mind when you go on a shinobi mission is to imitate well the language of the target province and the ways of the local people.

03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:49.100
This includes their appearances, the way of wearing clothes, the way of shaving their head, the way of making up their hair,

03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:54.100
the way of making up a sword or short sword and the way of refinement and luxury.

03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:56.100
So how do you fit into some of those places?

03:00:56.100 --> 03:01:04.100
So, you know, Mexico, but a person like me that doesn't know anything about Mexico and say I'm interviewing somebody in a leadership position in a drug cartel.

03:01:04.100 --> 03:01:05.100
Yeah.

03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:08.100
How quickly do you learn how to fit in?

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:09.100
I mean, it's not about fitting in.

03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:11.100
It's about coming up with a narrative for yourself.

03:01:11.100 --> 03:01:21.100
Well, that book is talking that's a that's a quote from the book called A Shoninki, which is like an actual legit ninja manual from like the 1500s or something like that.

03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:25.100
And they're not talking about blending in.

03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:31.100
They're talking about creating a narrative or a lie to your appearance and your behavior and your knowledge base.

03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:32.100
That's what they're talking about.

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:38.100
So I would say first, if you're going to go to a place like that, first off, learn what is common there.

03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:40.100
What type of common restraints might be placed on you?

03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:42.100
What criminal groups work out there?

03:01:42.100 --> 03:01:44.100
What type of guns they have?

03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:52.100
Not only what type of guns they have, but go to the gun range in Vegas and learn how to fire some of these firearms yourself so you know how to load them in case you run into a bad situation.

03:01:52.100 --> 03:02:00.100
How they tie the sword, how they how they wear their short swords could equate to how, you know, if you run into some issues.

03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:05.100
Also, it would give you a good idea how many rounds those hold so you can run at the right moment.

03:02:05.100 --> 03:02:08.100
I like how you focus in on the on the tools of violence.

03:02:08.100 --> 03:02:11.100
There's also the social engineering de-escalation, right?

03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:12.100
Yeah.

03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:19.100
So if you are in an environment like that and you are carrying around a camera, that might be an issue or the opposite and not be an issue.

03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:25.100
Well, if you're asked, like, were you with I'm with the news organization or am I with a Christian aid group here?

03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:26.100
Yeah.

03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:29.100
And if you are with a Christian aid group, it's probably a good idea.

03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:30.100
Learn some of the Bible, right?

03:02:31.100 --> 03:02:35.100
If you want a quick way of having somebody out there trying to stop talking to you,

03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:41.100
you can start talking about Jesus in the middle of a little cartel territory when they approach you and take out the Bible.

03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:43.100
That will quickly de-escalate.

03:02:43.100 --> 03:02:50.100
What I usually prefer to do is I find somebody from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and beat them up in front of the just to send a signal.

03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:51.100
Yeah.

03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:53.100
Journalists and I too don't like journalists.

03:02:53.100 --> 03:02:55.100
That could be that could be a way, but.

03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:56.100
To send a message.

03:02:56.100 --> 03:03:02.100
I think a lot of us miss the fact that we are capable of taking control of our own narrative and what we communicate to people around us.

03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:11.100
I can show up here drinking a Monster Energy drink, dumping it on the ground, scratching, you know what, and just sit down and just be a rude motherfucker.

03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:13.100
That's not who I am, but I can do that.

03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:16.100
And you will believe me if I am good at it.

03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:24.100
Some of us miss the some of us don't know this aspect because it's something we consider predatory or something that is wrong or negative or bad.

03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:28.100
And some of these aspects are actually, you know, they're pretty useful.

03:03:28.100 --> 03:03:34.100
I learned most of my trade craft and skill craft from panhandlers and street performers.

03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:40.100
And when I had some training related to social engineering, those were the people that I learned from.

03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:47.100
I remember we were doing surveillance and there was a guy there that showed us how to do surveillance, you know, on the street.

03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:54.100
And he said, if you can find a way for somebody to smell you before they see you, you'll become invisible.

03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:56.100
And I was like, that's bullshit.

03:03:56.100 --> 03:04:00.100
If you can find a way of somebody smelling you before they see you become invisible.

03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:02.100
I didn't understand what that meant.

03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:08.100
So we went on a three day bender, didn't take a shower, smell like shit, no deodorant.

03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:14.100
You know, you smell like a homeless person, you look like a homeless person and you approach somebody asking for the time and they smell you before they see you.

03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:18.100
And you are not there. You're not a human. You don't exist.

03:04:18.100 --> 03:04:21.100
So that was a pretty valuable lesson that I got there.

03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:23.100
Yeah. So that's interesting.

03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:29.100
But like, I have this belief it has to do with the way I operate in this world, I suppose.

03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:33.100
But if you come off as a person legitimately, I guess you could fake it.

03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:42.100
But I think it just feels like you can be extremely good, possibly the best in the world.

03:04:42.100 --> 03:04:50.100
If you practice it your whole life at being you, at being authentic, at being at showing like you have nothing to hide.

03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:54.100
And a true believer is what a true believer.

03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:56.100
So like, yes, you can come up with a fake narrative.

03:04:56.100 --> 03:05:03.100
But then what I mean is like, live that narrative your whole life then would be like, I understand.

03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:05.100
And then never falter from that.

03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:07.100
Like, you are this person.

03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:09.100
That's what I'm trying to have nothing to hide.

03:05:10.100 --> 03:05:12.100
I consider that a true believer.

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:15.100
And yeah, that is a unique person when you meet them.

03:05:15.100 --> 03:05:19.100
And they are out there. There are people that will fucking walk into places.

03:05:19.100 --> 03:05:22.100
This is who I am. I don't give a fuck.

03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:25.100
This is who I am. If you don't trust me, well, shoot me. Fuck it.

03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:26.100
This is my honesty.

03:05:26.100 --> 03:05:31.100
And if you don't trust me, well, look at all these people that I've interacted with in the past and you can ask them about it.

03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:33.100
Or you can see my effects on other people.

03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:35.100
That's going to be my presentation card.

03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:38.100
And so the way you said it now is using words and it's blunt.

03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:43.100
Usually if somebody is blunt like that, like I'm a no bullshit person, that means they're not.

03:05:43.100 --> 03:05:45.100
That means they are a full of shit, actually.

03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:50.100
But you do that through, I mean, I'm saying I'm verbalizing your behavior, you know, just walking somewhere.

03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:58.100
You know, let's say you're going to interview somebody very dangerous down there and you walk into a room without worry.

03:05:58.100 --> 03:06:02.100
That is a presentation to you.

03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:06.100
I know that's a pretty interesting introduction.

03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:10.100
You know, you're not a threat because you don't consider yourself a threat.

03:06:10.100 --> 03:06:16.100
And you're walking in there with the confidence that you don't consider yourself a threat, which is an interesting way of going about it.

03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:19.100
My life experiences have been different.

03:06:19.100 --> 03:06:25.100
I was in program that way from an early age and it's hard for me to go into that line.

03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:32.100
Although more and more as I get older and as I learn more about the world and I've failed a few more times,

03:06:32.100 --> 03:06:43.100
I can understand or more cognizant of the fact that you don't really have to try that much if you believe in yourself and who you are.

03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:47.100
If you know yourself, I think that is at the core of it.

03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:53.100
If you know yourself enough to be able to kind of communicate that to people around you.

03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:58.100
And you're not hiding from yourself or from the world your flaws too.

03:06:58.100 --> 03:07:06.100
That was the other thing you spoke to that is probably inspiring to others is being honest about your flaws, about your weaknesses as a human being.

03:07:06.100 --> 03:07:08.100
You can't pickpocket a naked man.

03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:12.100
And if you can, if you know how to be naked.

03:07:12.100 --> 03:07:14.100
And again, I'm not there.

03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:18.100
I think I'm working towards that just by, you know,

03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:28.100
hopefully going through shit and showing people not telling them is a show me don't tell me is another valuable lesson that I got long ago.

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:33.100
I travel across the country and I don't not only get to show people what I know how to do,

03:07:33.100 --> 03:07:37.100
but I give examples of it through things that I do out there.

03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:42.100
And I say this a lot, you know, when I travel out there, I'm never alone.

03:07:42.100 --> 03:07:44.100
You know, there's couches out there waiting for me.

03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:51.100
There's homes that I can go and stay at and friends that I have out there that I have never even met.

03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:57.100
But that's been about me not only wearing some of those mistakes and past failures on my sleeve,

03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:05.100
but also turning them into lessons for people and just telling people the fact that, you know, I know how to do all this weird stuff.

03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:07.100
You know, and I show people how to do it.

03:08:07.100 --> 03:08:14.100
But here's a bunch of weird memes that are very humorous about my culture and about being it through going through therapy.

03:08:14.100 --> 03:08:17.100
And this is me doing something goofy.

03:08:17.100 --> 03:08:20.100
And this is me being an idiot in front of all you guys as well.

03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:21.100
You know, this is me being the fool.

03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:23.100
I think that is another aspect of it.

03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:28.100
I love that as part of that journey, you made enemies with the rodeo clown and made up with him afterwards.

03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:31.100
We're still we're in a very toxic relationship.

03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:33.100
You know, he knows who he is.

03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:34.100
He's probably out there listening.

03:08:34.100 --> 03:08:35.100
Love and hate.

03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:44.100
We stop talking to each other for months and then, you know, just send a thick message of some sort and just, you know, we're back at it, you know, back.

03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:46.100
Love expressed through anger.

03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:47.100
I love it.

03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:48.100
It's therapeutic.

03:08:48.100 --> 03:08:51.100
You have both very interesting career paths.

03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:58.100
If we can just jump back to a really interesting topic that I want to mention on narco occultism.

03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:00.100
What are narco cults?

03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:02.100
What's the relationship between?

03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:04.100
You kind of mentioned religion a little bit.

03:09:04.100 --> 03:09:05.100
Yeah.

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:09.100
What's the relationship between religious culture and drug culture?

03:09:09.100 --> 03:09:14.100
First off, Mexico is one of the most Catholic countries on the planet, if not the most Catholic country on the planet.

03:09:14.100 --> 03:09:31.100
Not only that, it is a country that has a root in spirituality through its ethnic culture that other parts of the world got most of that taken away and or suppressed or killed or taken away.

03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:42.100
When the Spanish came to Mexico, they were a product of a recently liberated group of people.

03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:51.100
They just got done being invaded by the Moors, basically, and they brought with them the image of La Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin of Guadalupe.

03:09:51.100 --> 03:10:00.100
Hernan Cortez's vision of that or version of that was a lady holding a crystal scepter, baby Jesus, and standing on a crescent moon.

03:10:00.100 --> 03:10:04.100
That's what he brought with him to the Americas.

03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:12.100
When the conquest happened, a lot of people say, the Spanish came and conquested the Aztec Empire.

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:17.100
The enemies of the Aztec allied themselves with the Spanish and they took them down.

03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:18.100
That's what happened.

03:10:18.100 --> 03:10:21.100
And then the rest was famine and sickness.

03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:24.100
That's what killed most of them.

03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:33.100
They realized that it was going to be hard to suppress some of the spiritual practices in Mexico, so they decided to mill them with Catholic iconography.

03:10:34.100 --> 03:10:44.100
So you see this cult, which is like a fertility variant of a mother goddess in Aztec culture.

03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:51.100
And they turn her into La Virgen de Guadalupe, which is the icon that a lot of Mexicans venerate as La Virgen, the Virgin.

03:10:51.100 --> 03:10:57.100
But in her, she conceals cultural elements from the past.

03:10:57.100 --> 03:11:04.100
She has a black sash across her stomach, which means she's pregnant, something common in the Aztec culture and the Mexica culture.

03:11:04.100 --> 03:11:09.100
She's standing on a chair that has eagle wings, that is a war god.

03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:11.100
That's a symbol of the war god down there.

03:11:11.100 --> 03:11:18.100
She has stars on her, which is a veil of certain stars that are related to some of the spiritual practices from before.

03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:24.100
Basically, they hid these things in that setting.

03:11:24.100 --> 03:11:36.100
Now you skip forward hundreds of years and you start seeing things like Malverde, who was a bandit that lived in Sinaloa way back in the day.

03:11:36.100 --> 03:11:41.100
He would rob rich farmers that would go through the countryside.

03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:46.100
One time he was almost caught and he was shot and injured and he was wanted by the government.

03:11:46.100 --> 03:11:54.100
So he told one of his friends to tell them where he was and to give the reward money to the townspeople.

03:11:54.100 --> 03:11:56.100
So we did that.

03:11:56.100 --> 03:12:02.100
He was hung from a tree and the order was not to bury him, just to let his body rot.

03:12:02.100 --> 03:12:06.100
His body rotted away until it fell onto the ground, bones.

03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:14.100
Each of the townspeople would go over and put a rock on top of his corpse until it became a pile of rocks.

03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:17.100
Then he started granting miracles.

03:12:17.100 --> 03:12:28.100
Again, this whole aspect of these criminals becoming saints and also a middle finger from the downward local populace to the church in a way,

03:12:28.100 --> 03:12:34.100
because he's not a recognized saint, but he has an altar and people venerate that.

03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:42.100
Then you have cartels that have a spiritual practice or spirituality behind what they do, which is part of their culture,

03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:50.100
but it's also like a tool they use to ingratiate themselves with the local populace or the population around them.

03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:58.100
There are icons of power and sometimes of almost a symbol of rebellion.

03:12:58.100 --> 03:13:08.100
You see El Chapo's son, when he was arrested, had a Santo Niño de Atocha on his chest, which is a holy kit of Atocha.

03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:12.100
There's a Spanish legend during the Morris Conquest.

03:13:12.100 --> 03:13:17.100
They said that a statue of that saint would go around and feed some of the hungry.

03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:22.100
That was the legend. He's a saint of the persecuted.

03:13:22.100 --> 03:13:31.100
The fact that when he was arrested, you see him wearing that and then he was liberated is a miracle in and of itself.

03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:34.100
It's proof that that works.

03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:39.100
You can find one of those scapularios anywhere in Mexico.

03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:43.100
It was the most highly sold one.

03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:53.100
You see them utilizing some of these aspects in their own belief system as a symbol or iconography for some of the things they do.

03:13:53.100 --> 03:14:01.100
Then you go into some of the other aspects of it that are out there, like Santa Muerte, which is actually a faith that I grew up in.

03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:04.100
Mexico has a weird relationship to death.

03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:09.100
We have parties at the cemetery on Day of the Dead, and I just went through one recently.

03:14:09.100 --> 03:14:12.100
This is November the 2nd.

03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:19.100
We celebrate our dead, and we celebrate death in a way that I don't think a lot of cultures out there do.

03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:21.100
It's a joyful occasion.

03:14:21.100 --> 03:14:22.100
It is a celebration, yeah.

03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:27.100
My eight-year-old put two beers on an altar, one for my mom, one for my brother.

03:14:27.100 --> 03:14:37.100
She bought a Snickers bar for my mom and a bag of pops for my brother, flower petals and marigolds, and pictures of them on an altar.

03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:38.100
That's amazing.

03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:39.100
What kind of beer?

03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:45.100
Tecate roja for my mother because she was hardcore, and tecate light for my brother.

03:14:45.100 --> 03:14:49.100
He was more of an endurance drinker.

03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:54.100
It's also for me, the relationship to death down there is different.

03:14:54.100 --> 03:14:55.100
There's an icon in Mexico.

03:14:55.100 --> 03:15:02.100
It's actually one of the fastest growing alternative spiritual practices in Mexico.

03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:04.100
Not only in Mexico, but here in the U.S.

03:15:04.100 --> 03:15:08.100
I've been to Santa Muerta temples across the country.

03:15:08.100 --> 03:15:11.100
I found one in Connecticut out of all places.

03:15:11.100 --> 03:15:18.100
How I grew up with it, where I saw it, is my family was all Guadalupanos.

03:15:18.100 --> 03:15:25.100
We were Catholic, and we venerated the Virgin of Guadalupe specifically, the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:31.100
But every now and then there were winks and nods to a skeletal saint in family practices.

03:15:31.100 --> 03:15:38.100
Even when I went to work, the older guys that I was working with would tell me,

03:15:38.100 --> 03:15:43.100
like, hey, we've got to go ask for protection.

03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:47.100
So they would drive me over to the church, and I thought I was going to the cathedral.

03:15:47.100 --> 03:15:50.100
And then we made a left turn, and it wasn't the cathedral.

03:15:50.100 --> 03:15:53.100
It was the market next to the cathedral in Tijuana.

03:15:53.100 --> 03:16:00.100
And in the little corner, there was a big Santa Muerta reaper refugee.

03:16:00.100 --> 03:16:04.100
And then I knew why I had to bring a bottle of tequila.

03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:07.100
I was like, why am I bringing a bottle of tequila to the church?

03:16:07.100 --> 03:16:10.100
It was for her, for death, la muerte.

03:16:10.100 --> 03:16:23.100
It was partly hazing, and also they did believe that they were basically imbued with being agents of death in a way.

03:16:23.100 --> 03:16:29.100
So it was like a cultural thing as well, something that they wore on them as not only protection,

03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:34.100
but also like a samurai would wear this death iconography on them,

03:16:34.100 --> 03:16:41.100
or how the Maori would do haka dances to some of these guys,

03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:47.100
and their kind of warrior culture that they were growing up with or trying to imbue on us, the young guys.

03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:53.100
They would take us there, and they would imbue us with iconography of Santa Muerta to be like a psychological thing.

03:16:53.100 --> 03:16:59.100
So that gives you strength and meaning in the face of struggle, like in the face of difficulties in life?

03:16:59.100 --> 03:17:06.100
I think, you know, your closeness to death and having a relationship to death in the form of a symbolic representation of it,

03:17:06.100 --> 03:17:11.100
like Santa Muerta or an icon like that, makes it not as scary, I guess.

03:17:11.100 --> 03:17:20.100
Or not only that, but it's also something that the other side, the enemy, the cartel's groups, they would venerate it as well.

03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:24.100
So when they would see it on you, it was almost debilitating to them.

03:17:24.100 --> 03:17:29.100
They were like, oh, are you guys cops? Who are you? Why are you wearing that?

03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:38.100
So there was an aspect of that to it, a momento mori type thing where you remember death, you know, type thing.

03:17:38.100 --> 03:17:42.100
There's some aspect in which you don't want to mess with a person who meditates on death.

03:17:42.100 --> 03:17:45.100
There was some of that, yeah.

03:17:45.100 --> 03:17:51.100
There was a saying, I think they probably took it from a movie or something like that, but I don't know where they got it.

03:17:51.100 --> 03:17:56.100
May I earn your need and be your wrath?

03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:58.100
Oh, man, that's a good line.

03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:04.100
They would say that to the statue of La Santa, you know.

03:18:04.100 --> 03:18:07.100
And another thing, people, it's not a cartel-specific saint, though.

03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:15.100
It's like everybody at all levels, from the lady that sells tortillas to the cops, to the military.

03:18:15.100 --> 03:18:17.100
There's some people in the military that venerate it.

03:18:17.100 --> 03:18:25.100
There's a very specific symbol of how this is like a weird relationship specifically in Santa Muerta in Mexico.

03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:31.100
There's a shrine outside of Tijuana right across the La Presa.

03:18:31.100 --> 03:18:34.100
It's like a water reservoir right outside Tijuana.

03:18:34.100 --> 03:18:40.100
And there was a big Santa Muerta altar there, like on the roadside.

03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:44.100
And my former boss, Leza Ola, ordered that thing destroyed.

03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:47.100
So he ordered a truck to destroy it.

03:18:47.100 --> 03:18:49.100
It was a famous thing.

03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:51.100
And it was rebuilt the next night.

03:18:51.100 --> 03:18:57.100
And I know for a fact that some of the people that rebuilt that were some of the same guys that were destroying it.

03:18:57.100 --> 03:18:59.100
Oh, man, that's pretty symbolic.

03:18:59.100 --> 03:19:02.100
So it's just not something that can be killed.

03:19:02.100 --> 03:19:05.100
It's a part of the spirit of the people.

03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:12.100
It keeps getting destroyed by ultra-Christian groups or Catholic groups, and it keeps getting rebuilt.

03:19:12.100 --> 03:19:22.100
Personally, for me, I don't believe that there's a Reaper skeleton in the sky protecting me.

03:19:22.100 --> 03:19:31.100
But I do believe in the aspect of an ending and how the ending is important in all things, and death should be present in life.

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:34.100
And if it's not, then you're delusional about things.

03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:38.100
So to you, it's a mechanism to meditate on death once again.

03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:47.100
Yeah. And having my daughter, who's eight, view it as a benevolent thing.

03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:52.100
She's a kid, and she sees a skeleton that represents death.

03:19:53.100 --> 03:20:02.100
I think, in a way, Mexicans have taken some of those aspects, be it Day of the Dead,

03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:14.100
some of these practices related to some occultism, aspects around St. Judas, St. Judas is the patron saint of lost causes.

03:20:14.100 --> 03:20:17.100
And it's one of the most venerated saints in Mexico.

03:20:18.100 --> 03:20:23.100
Jesus is probably the fourth or fifth you pray to, which is pretty funny and ridiculous.

03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:31.100
But the reason why, and this is something I heard from somebody that was actually, we found him with a gun,

03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:35.100
and on his gun he had a St. Judas effigy.

03:20:35.100 --> 03:20:41.100
And he said, why St. Judas? Porque son Judas?

03:20:41.100 --> 03:20:44.100
And he's like, well, he's the last saint you pray to.

03:20:44.100 --> 03:20:46.100
What do you mean?

03:20:46.100 --> 03:20:52.100
Well, on the list of saints you pray to, he's the last one, because when you pray to Judas, you might get the other Judas on the line.

03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:56.100
That's the last one you pray to. That's why he's like the lost cause of saints.

03:20:56.100 --> 03:21:06.100
I remember even how we try and bribe or maneuver our way, even in spirituality, in spiritual practices.

03:21:06.100 --> 03:21:11.100
Such a fascinating culture that's unlike anything else.

03:21:11.100 --> 03:21:15.100
And it's right next door. And it's here too.

03:21:15.100 --> 03:21:20.100
Again, I found an altar in Connecticut, which is pretty fascinating.

03:21:20.100 --> 03:21:29.100
There's one in Arizona. Again, it's one of the fastest growing spiritual practices, not only in the US, but across the world.

03:21:29.100 --> 03:21:36.100
Somebody from Russia reached out. There's an altar out there, and there's a group of people praying to Santa Marta.

03:21:36.100 --> 03:21:44.100
I've been posting and writing a lot about it recently just from my own experience and some of the stuff that I gathered for myself and all the way out there.

03:21:44.100 --> 03:21:47.100
Those people are fascinated by some of those aspects.

03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:51.100
So I've got to ask you about the dark turn of that spirituality.

03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:57.100
Or maybe you will place this elsewhere, but who was Adolfo Costanza Alpadrino?

03:21:57.100 --> 03:22:04.100
This is a guy that comes up in a period. I think he's at that initial period of cartels.

03:22:04.100 --> 03:22:09.100
This is before my time, and I've talked to some of the people that were there for some of that.

03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:11.100
I mean, he kills a lot of people.

03:22:11.100 --> 03:22:25.100
He was exposed and learned through his family ties about some of the Afro-Caribbean spiritualities that are now also exploding as far as influences across the world, Latin America and in the US.

03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:40.100
When I talk about that, I mean Santeria, Palo Mayombe, basically some old spiritual practices coming out of Africa that utilize things like Ngangas,

03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:49.100
which are basically spiritual vessels that have to be loaded with human remains in some cases.

03:22:49.100 --> 03:23:04.100
He was basically a spiritual practitioner that certain cartel groups would hire for them to curse the other side, to in view them with invisibility, to be able to transport their drugs or protection spells and stuff like that.

03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:11.100
He was very successful at it apparently, or at least that is the experience of the people paying for some of these practices.

03:23:11.100 --> 03:23:30.100
As his spells and his work kept getting bigger and bigger and more and more complicated, the ingredients he needed for these Ngangas or these spells, these cauldrons that he would fill with certain elements grew in complexity.

03:23:30.100 --> 03:23:38.100
Until finally he said he needed the brain of a highly educated American of some sort, which led to his eventual downfall.

03:23:38.100 --> 03:23:46.100
He was basically responsible for abducting and murdering a young American who was a university college student, I think.

03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:54.100
Do you think he believed the, so this guy's murdering people to create what, magical potions?

03:23:54.100 --> 03:23:55.100
Vessels, yeah.

03:23:55.100 --> 03:23:56.100
Vessels?

03:23:56.100 --> 03:24:03.100
Yeah, I think he truly believed that he was capable of doing what he was doing, I guess.

03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:11.100
And there was a culture that's spiritually inclined that kind of was on the same wavelength as him.

03:24:11.100 --> 03:24:19.100
Yeah, it jived. I mean, some of these spiritual practices, again, there's a ritualistic cannibalism done by some of these cartel groups out there.

03:24:19.100 --> 03:24:21.100
Was he involved in cannibalism as well?

03:24:21.100 --> 03:24:31.100
He wasn't involved in cannibalism that I know of, but most of the things that he was kind of known for was basically requesting human body parts for some of the spell works he was doing.

03:24:31.100 --> 03:24:40.100
And then going to such a level where he needed a specific brain or head of somebody that was educated and American.

03:24:40.100 --> 03:24:48.100
So that, again, led to his eventual downfall. His ranch was raided. They found the body parts inside of these cauldrons that he was preparing.

03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:54.100
That's an interesting example of somebody. There's a cartel head somewhere in central Mexico as well.

03:24:55.100 --> 03:25:03.100
El Mas Loco was his nickname. And he basically forced the citizenship around him to turn him into a saint.

03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:14.100
So he made a statue of himself. He was very big into Christianity, specifically kind of like the crusader mentality and all that.

03:25:14.100 --> 03:25:18.100
He kind of imbued himself in some of the people that were around him with that.

03:25:18.100 --> 03:25:23.100
And there's still alters to his death, to him after he died. He died two times.

03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:28.100
One time the government declared him that he was killing a shootout, and it turns out he wasn't dead.

03:25:28.100 --> 03:25:44.100
So that was his first miracle. And then when he was really dead, some of his people and his loyal followers were gunpoint kind of still forced to go and give flowers and venerate these effigies and statues of him as a saint.

03:25:44.100 --> 03:25:47.100
It's a powerful weapon. Spirituality in Mexico is a powerful weapon.

03:25:47.100 --> 03:25:58.100
And the Catholic Church in Mexico has a pretty bad track record, but as far as that being used to control populace and stuff like that.

03:25:58.100 --> 03:26:09.100
And I think it's just another aspect that is being exploited in Mexico in some communities as far as spirituality and the desperate need for people to believe in something.

03:26:10.100 --> 03:26:15.100
And how that leads for some people to go into some horrible predatory behavior around it.

03:26:15.100 --> 03:26:23.100
There's a fascinating dynamic at play here. So it's not just the United States and Mexico. It's also China that you talk about.

03:26:23.100 --> 03:26:35.100
China is the primary source of fentanyl in the world. So fentanyl is an opioid that leads to 70,000 plus or minus overdose deaths in the U.S. every year.

03:26:35.100 --> 03:26:46.100
So reading from Wikipedia, quote, compared with heroin, it is more potent, has higher profit margins, and because it is compact, has simpler logistics.

03:26:46.100 --> 03:26:54.100
It can be cut into or even replace entirely the supply of heroin and other opiates. What do you think is important to understand about fentanyl as a drug?

03:26:54.100 --> 03:27:02.100
There was a prescription opiate epidemic in the United States that kind of went down or stopped.

03:27:02.100 --> 03:27:09.100
Well, it's still out there, but the epidemic specific around it kind of petered out.

03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:21.100
And there was also marijuana legalization happening at kind of the same time period, which people talking about marijuana legalization thought it was going to hit the cartels in their pockets.

03:27:21.100 --> 03:27:25.100
And it was going to be like a death blow to these criminal groups.

03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:33.100
Well, now there's illegal pot grows in the United States being run by cartels in federal lands.

03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:42.100
There's the legal pot grows that are in some way, shape or form influenced and or run or owned by some criminal groups that are kind of utilizing that.

03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:48.100
The marijuana fields in Mexico turned into poppy fields once again.

03:27:48.100 --> 03:27:56.100
The problem is that some of these lands were leached of all the nutrients and they're not as good as something you would find somewhere in Afghanistan.

03:27:56.100 --> 03:28:01.100
So the yield and the quality of it wasn't as strong as it could be.

03:28:01.100 --> 03:28:06.100
So somebody thought about the right idea of putting fentanyl into the mix.

03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:13.100
And not only that, but also figuring out how to get fentanyl into Mexico.

03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:21.100
Mexico has a giant pharmaceutical industry that people kind of also don't kind of know or factor into this equation,

03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:31.100
which leads into the free ability of chemicals going in and out of the country and legal means of it happening.

03:28:31.100 --> 03:28:39.100
Right. So not only the precursors to make it, but also the chemists and the industry to create it in Mexico as well.

03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:44.100
Some clandestine factories of fentanyl have been found in Mexico,

03:28:44.100 --> 03:28:51.100
but realistically it's not needed with the ways that the ports and the borders are down in Mexico.

03:28:51.100 --> 03:29:00.100
You started seeing an influx and a flood of fentanyl into Mexico specifically related to infusing it into heroin

03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:06.100
and not only using that to feed local drug markets, but send it up into the United States,

03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:10.100
which started off this process that we're kind of going through still.

03:29:10.100 --> 03:29:15.100
Are these like similar highs? And drug wise, why do you infuse?

03:29:15.100 --> 03:29:19.100
I mean, probably you're not the right person to have this biochemical discussion.

03:29:19.100 --> 03:29:25.100
I don't know about the biochemical aspect of it, but like speaking to guys that do Chiva down there,

03:29:25.100 --> 03:29:29.100
that's what we call heroin down there. It's like a nickname for it.

03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:36.100
Having them describe some of the older, stinkier, darker heroin they used to get before this whole fentanyl thing

03:29:36.100 --> 03:29:44.100
and the highs they would get and how much they would have to take versus some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl that they have to slow it down.

03:29:44.100 --> 03:29:46.100
Also, there's more higher potency.

03:29:46.100 --> 03:29:49.100
Yeah, there's a higher potency to it and also there's a...

03:29:49.100 --> 03:29:52.100
More money to be made, easier to transport.

03:29:52.100 --> 03:29:53.100
Yeah.

03:29:53.100 --> 03:29:58.100
But then is this how China starts becoming part of the picture?

03:29:58.100 --> 03:30:03.100
One aspect to it that people kind of miss is that there's no Chinese cartel.

03:30:03.100 --> 03:30:13.100
There's no criminal Chinese organization working unseen, getting around government oversight in China.

03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:15.100
I don't know of any such organization.

03:30:15.100 --> 03:30:21.100
So anything that could be labeled as a criminal organization is deeply integrated with the government.

03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:26.100
I mean, I've never heard of a giant criminal enterprise in China operating.

03:30:26.100 --> 03:30:28.100
So we have to assume then...

03:30:28.100 --> 03:30:30.100
Independent of the state.

03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:38.100
I would have to assume that some of these things are happening with the know-how and inaction of the government out there.

03:30:38.100 --> 03:30:47.100
When COVID hit, there was a shortage of fentanyl on the northern side of Mexico specifically related to the Xinaloa cartel.

03:30:47.100 --> 03:30:53.100
These guys were actually trafficking fentanyl from the U.S. down to Mexico to infuse their product.

03:30:53.100 --> 03:31:02.100
But not the new generation cartel, which operates out of the central part of Mexico, the Colima area, which have access to the seaside ports.

03:31:02.100 --> 03:31:12.100
So even during the shutdown, they were getting supplied, which means to me, at least for anybody observing it, that the supply chain was not cut.

03:31:12.100 --> 03:31:22.100
And whatever was coming out of China was being let out of China by whatever official channels would be able to shut down or stop it.

03:31:22.100 --> 03:31:31.100
I would love to know the organizational structure, the governmental structure of China, how they enable it.

03:31:31.100 --> 03:31:40.100
Because I can't imagine at the very top, there's like a portfolio of things we're doing and one of them is fentanyl.

03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:48.100
I think it's more inaction or just the know-how that is happening, but just like hands off, just let this flow. I don't know.

03:31:48.100 --> 03:31:53.100
If I were to understand how large bureaucracies work, it's looking the other way.

03:31:53.100 --> 03:32:09.100
Yeah. You are now seeing pill presses brought to Mexico, industrial level pill presses found in clandestine laboratories where they're not only infusing the yields that they're doing with fentanyl,

03:32:09.100 --> 03:32:20.100
but also making fake pain medication that is flooding US markets everywhere as far as, is that pain medication or is that fentanyl?

03:32:20.100 --> 03:32:27.100
Who knows? And that's how you see a lot of people dying from ODs that are supposedly taking pain pills and that's not what they're doing.

03:32:27.100 --> 03:32:36.100
So the evolution right now you're seeing is making something look legit as far as a pain medication that it isn't.

03:32:36.100 --> 03:32:42.100
Fentanyl is everywhere. They're infusing cocaine with it.

03:32:42.100 --> 03:32:53.100
I've been getting stories from the US of people buying it through Alibaba or just weird online sources and it coming in different packages and just infusing it into whatever is out there.

03:32:53.100 --> 03:32:57.100
It is killing off a whole generation of people.

03:32:58.100 --> 03:33:09.100
And it comes from one place or it's manufactured somewhere where it's being manufactured with the precursors and the elements and know how that comes from one place.

03:33:09.100 --> 03:33:10.100
Are we talking about China?

03:33:10.100 --> 03:33:11.100
We're talking about China.

03:33:11.100 --> 03:33:26.100
Because Mexico seems to have, what's the role of, this is such a complicated, and how do you start to talk about the drug war when more and more and more China is the source of the drug?

03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:28.100
Is there a drug war going on with China?

03:33:28.100 --> 03:33:30.100
There's probably an economic war.

03:33:30.100 --> 03:33:33.100
While you talk about, there's another side to China.

03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:46.100
Most, and this is something that's come out recently, a few years back I think, but basically the ways you would move money back into Mexico after you have a load up here is that you would give it to a Chinese money broker.

03:33:46.100 --> 03:33:51.100
They would put it into the Chinese banking system and it immediately would just disappear from American eyes.

03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:55.100
And then another money broker in Mexico would receive it through a money transfer from China.

03:33:55.100 --> 03:33:58.100
So China is incredibly good at money laundering.

03:33:58.100 --> 03:34:00.100
That's another aspect too.

03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:03.100
I mean their banking system is invisible to the U.S. basically.

03:34:03.100 --> 03:34:04.100
Which allows.

03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:07.100
Which allows the monies to move from one point to another.

03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:12.100
So money brokers and people moving money for the groups down there are Chinese.

03:34:12.100 --> 03:34:16.100
So that's another aspect or element of China as far as its presence.

03:34:17.100 --> 03:34:20.100
What's the role of intelligence in all of this?

03:34:20.100 --> 03:34:27.100
FBI, CIA, the Chinese intelligence agencies.

03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:35.100
Right now Mexico is going through a nationalistic resurgence and leftist presidency.

03:34:35.100 --> 03:34:39.100
Which is not friendly to U.S. interest in a lot of ways.

03:34:39.100 --> 03:34:44.100
The U.S. has had a pretty bad track record with its foreign policy in Mexico.

03:34:44.100 --> 03:34:48.100
With a lot of damage being done by the last president as far as his rhetoric.

03:34:48.100 --> 03:34:49.100
Donald Trump?

03:34:49.100 --> 03:34:54.100
Which has been weaponized and utilized by the left down in Mexico.

03:34:54.100 --> 03:34:58.100
So America is not seen positively?

03:34:58.100 --> 03:34:59.100
No.

03:34:59.100 --> 03:35:01.100
Every now and then I post something about Mexico.

03:35:01.100 --> 03:35:02.100
Some horrible thing happening down there.

03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:04.100
It's like why doesn't the U.S. send people down there?

03:35:04.100 --> 03:35:07.100
Are Mexicans looking for U.S. intervention?

03:35:07.100 --> 03:35:08.100
It's like no.

03:35:08.100 --> 03:35:10.100
That is beyond what anybody in Mexico would want.

03:35:10.100 --> 03:35:13.100
Specifically you see that sentiment out there.

03:35:13.100 --> 03:35:18.100
They don't view the U.S. as somebody that's going to come in and fix anything.

03:35:18.100 --> 03:35:20.100
Or somebody that's going to help or as a friend.

03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:29.100
When the Ukrainian conflict happened, Mexico basically abstained from saying anything.

03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:32.100
Which is a wink and a nod to Russia.

03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:35.100
It has openly been pro-Maduro.

03:35:35.100 --> 03:35:42.100
And openly celebrated some of these regimes popping up across Latin America.

03:35:42.100 --> 03:35:46.100
Which is what people voted for.

03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:47.100
That is a sentiment down there.

03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:49.100
They're going towards the left of the political spectrum.

03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:56.100
Because they've been basically violated over and over again by all these different presidencies that have promised change.

03:35:56.100 --> 03:35:58.100
Brought corruption with them.

03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:00.100
And they are our choices.

03:36:00.100 --> 03:36:02.100
So this is the best we have right now.

03:36:02.100 --> 03:36:07.100
And all of the enemies of the United States are taking full advantage of that.

03:36:07.100 --> 03:36:12.100
We recently had a general kind of address the Senate committee hearing I think.

03:36:12.100 --> 03:36:16.100
He was talking about the prevalence of foreign intelligence services in Mexico.

03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:19.100
And why that is.

03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:26.100
Well, Mexico has a lot of the mineable lithium on the planet underneath parts of it.

03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:28.100
Specifically in the north.

03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:31.100
It is going through a process.

03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:33.100
They call it the Quarta Transformacion.

03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:36.100
The fourth transformation is what the president of Mexico calls it.

03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:42.100
Which is in a way it's basically we're here to stay type thing.

03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:46.100
They just nationalize mining lithium.

03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:48.100
And taking control of that and using that as leverage.

03:36:48.100 --> 03:36:53.100
If the United States ever wants to go to Mexico it's probably not going to be related to cartel issues.

03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.100
It's going to probably be related to energy I think.

03:36:55.100 --> 03:36:58.100
They're kind of thinking ahead I guess.

03:36:58.100 --> 03:37:09.100
Well what about also just imagine a world where India and China are doing fentanyl trade with Mexico or whatever transport.

03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:14.100
Imagine Chinese military moves, makes an agreement.

03:37:14.100 --> 03:37:17.100
A NATO type of agreement with Mexico.

03:37:17.100 --> 03:37:18.100
That's pretty possible.

03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:21.100
Again we're seeing militarized Mexico.

03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:26.100
It's another aspect of Mexico that again I haven't seen talked about a lot here in the U.S.

03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:36.100
The main problem is that the current president had was he was going to make the federal police and the security issues in Mexico civilian.

03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:42.100
He was going to do exactly the opposite as his main rival Felipe Calderon.

03:37:42.100 --> 03:37:45.100
The guy that started off the drug war officially.

03:37:45.100 --> 03:37:47.100
And what does he do?

03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:50.100
He dissolves the civilian leadership of the federal police.

03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:52.100
Dissolves the federal police.

03:37:52.100 --> 03:37:55.100
Creates the national guard which is a military unit.

03:37:55.100 --> 03:37:58.100
And he puts the military in charge of that.

03:37:58.100 --> 03:38:03.100
Now the military has a full monopoly over all federal policing.

03:38:03.100 --> 03:38:07.100
When you cross into Mexico you'll see them wearing these white camouflage uniforms.

03:38:07.100 --> 03:38:13.100
Those are national guard people but they're the military.

03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:20.100
So now you're seeing a militarized Mexico with some of these leaks that happened during the Guacamaya leaks.

03:38:20.100 --> 03:38:26.100
You're now seeing that Mexico has been hosting members of the Haitian military.

03:38:26.100 --> 03:38:31.100
And they've been training them up to go back to police their country.

03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:34.100
That's not something that Mexico has been known for.

03:38:34.100 --> 03:38:37.100
To hosting other nations and training them in such a way.

03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:40.100
It's an interesting maneuver.

03:38:40.100 --> 03:38:44.100
Mexico has been historically neutral about getting involved in foreign conflicts.

03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:50.100
About voting in resolutions as far as invading or not invading or doing all these things.

03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:53.100
Mexico has been historically neutral when it comes to some of these things.

03:38:53.100 --> 03:38:59.100
And now we're training foreign military forces to go and do that role somewhere else.

03:39:00.100 --> 03:39:04.100
We have the military building airports and building infrastructure in Mexico.

03:39:04.100 --> 03:39:09.100
And a lot of their higher-ups are getting very wealthy around it.

03:39:09.100 --> 03:39:15.100
And they basically have a monopoly over who gets to have guns down there.

03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:19.100
There's one gun store in all of Mexico and it's run by the military.

03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:23.100
And the only way you can buy a gun there is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly there.

03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:27.100
And have enough money to sustain that right or that privilege.

03:39:27.100 --> 03:39:34.100
So you're seeing the military not being in its traditional role of just being the security force.

03:39:34.100 --> 03:39:41.100
Now it's policing. It's getting involved in politics in a big way.

03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:47.100
Legislation has passed to keep it on the streets in a policing role for more years now.

03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:51.100
So that should be looked at closer by anybody observing it from afar.

03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:54.100
The militarization of Mexico and where it's going.

03:39:54.100 --> 03:40:02.100
Because if you move towards a world where a World War III happens, it feels like Mexico would be the center.

03:40:02.100 --> 03:40:06.100
Because a hot war would be fought on the ground.

03:40:06.100 --> 03:40:11.100
And so you have a very difficult parallel between Mexico and Ukraine.

03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:15.100
Both don't have nuclear weapons. Both have relationships.

03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:20.100
So Ukraine has a relationship or a pull towards it, the European Union and NATO.

03:40:21.100 --> 03:40:29.100
Mexico, at least currently, has a kind of slow pull towards China, India potentially and Russia.

03:40:29.100 --> 03:40:33.100
And you have this divide between power centers in the world.

03:40:33.100 --> 03:40:43.100
And in terms of just imagine hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops on the border.

03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:45.100
On the US border.

03:40:45.100 --> 03:40:46.100
Yeah.

03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:47.100
On the Mexican side.

03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:54.100
And also the fact that that border doesn't mean anything to any sort of conflict that would happen regionally.

03:40:54.100 --> 03:40:57.100
Because that's a very easy to cross border.

03:40:57.100 --> 03:40:59.100
Doesn't matter how many walls you put across it.

03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:01.100
People are already here.

03:41:01.100 --> 03:41:05.100
This is not going to be a war fought off in some overseas place.

03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:07.100
Like you're not going to.

03:41:07.100 --> 03:41:13.100
This is something if it happens, if destabilization is utilized in Mexico to cause a conflict there.

03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:17.100
And it turns into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there of a sort.

03:41:17.100 --> 03:41:24.100
Which I think in a way you're already kind of seeing some of that through some of the conflicts going on down there.

03:41:24.100 --> 03:41:30.100
You have a new generation cartel that is being fed fentanyl from the Pacific side ports.

03:41:30.100 --> 03:41:39.100
And suspiciously you want to think that maybe it's favored by a foreign government of some sort in some way, shape or form.

03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:40.100
Who knows?

03:41:40.100 --> 03:41:47.100
And then you have a historically in control Sinaloa cartel that may or may not be favored by the US in some way, shape or form.

03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:52.100
You can imagine a further conflict down there and people fostering it.

03:41:52.100 --> 03:41:58.100
And seeing the effects of basically setting a fire on the feet of the United States.

03:41:58.100 --> 03:42:02.100
Its second largest consumer of US products is Mexico.

03:42:03.100 --> 03:42:09.100
The massive wave of immigration that is going to be basically weaponized.

03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:23.100
You saw the collapse of the border security structure with a contingent of 3,000 Honduran, Guatemalan immigrants in that first wave of caravans coming to Tijuana.

03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:26.100
You saw it was pretty bad.

03:42:26.100 --> 03:42:29.100
It was pretty bad and it could have gotten worse.

03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:43.100
Now what is going to happen when that wave is no longer 3,000 but a million people being displaced by violence or being in fear of whatever conflict might originate down there.

03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:47.100
And just that massive wave of migration and move.

03:42:48.100 --> 03:42:59.100
I think that's an interesting thing that people should look at and how can you affect change to try and stop some of these things to happen.

03:42:59.100 --> 03:43:04.100
Well let me ask you at a philosophical, at a human level, what do you think about immigration?

03:43:04.100 --> 03:43:11.100
Illegal and illegal immigration from the direction of Mexico to the United States.

03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:22.100
So we have an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States and an estimated 45 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

03:43:22.100 --> 03:43:30.100
A few things about that. When COVID hit there was no shortages of produce in the supermarkets.

03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:38.100
Which means that illegal immigration is pretty much the backbone of all produce and some of the farming industries out there.

03:43:38.100 --> 03:43:47.100
Most of it. So illegal immigration and illegal workers in those fields are essential workers in a way.

03:43:47.100 --> 03:43:53.100
I think there's a weird relationship in the United States with some of these workers and how they're demonized and how they're called criminals.

03:43:53.100 --> 03:44:01.100
I think there was a state out there that passed anti-illegal immigrant worker legislation.

03:44:01.100 --> 03:44:12.100
The farmers had to look elsewhere for people to show up to work in some of these fields which basically caused millions of dollars worth of losses for some of these farms.

03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:18.100
Anywhere you go out there in the United States you go into the kitchens and there's going to be paisanos there.

03:44:18.100 --> 03:44:30.100
High level French restaurants. You'll see people from Puebla there that made their way illegally and might have legalized or regularized their way into the country or in a sanctuary.

03:44:30.100 --> 03:44:38.100
You go to the service industry hotels. Those are the people changing the blankets. Those are the people in the washrooms.

03:44:38.100 --> 03:44:45.100
You have them doing jobs that no American wants to do realistically and they're everywhere in this country.

03:44:45.100 --> 03:44:50.100
And they are the backbone of some of these industries that are essential in this country.

03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:53.100
Do you think there's a deep sense in which they are American?

03:44:54.100 --> 03:45:00.100
I think they're indispensable and anybody that says they aren't is delusional.

03:45:00.100 --> 03:45:05.100
If you take every single legal worker out of the industry in the United States and send them back,

03:45:05.100 --> 03:45:14.100
like there's a movie out there called like the Yes in Mexicana is a day without Mexicans, everything would stop.

03:45:14.100 --> 03:45:22.100
So the relationship is there. People talk about the history of slavery in this country like it's a thing that's in the past.

03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:26.100
There's endangered slaves in the country right now.

03:45:26.100 --> 03:45:34.100
People that are paying off their people smugglers because they brought them into this country and they haven't been able to pay that fine or that fee yet

03:45:34.100 --> 03:45:38.100
and are basically being held hostage by that here in the United States.

03:45:38.100 --> 03:45:43.100
So they're slaves right now in the United States. People are talking about it's a historical context.

03:45:43.100 --> 03:45:46.100
What do we do about it? How are we supposed to think about it?

03:45:46.100 --> 03:45:53.100
We're going to have to rethink how we look at immigration, illegal or illegal immigration from Mexico

03:45:53.100 --> 03:45:57.100
and how we view Mexico as a foreign country.

03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:02.100
Your relationship to Canada is one thing. Your relationship to Mexico is another.

03:46:02.100 --> 03:46:10.100
The foreign policy towards Mexico has been pretty nefarious as far as the United States in a lot of ways.

03:46:10.100 --> 03:46:19.100
You can go back. There was a student massacre during the Olympics and the president in turn at that time was on the CIA payroll

03:46:19.100 --> 03:46:24.100
and it was a counter communist type maneuver they were doing down there.

03:46:24.100 --> 03:46:30.100
But there's some bloody hands on the US side of some of the things that have been happening in Mexico

03:46:30.100 --> 03:46:35.100
as far as destabilization and influencing and meddling in foreign policy out there.

03:46:36.100 --> 03:46:39.100
Most of the guns that are used down there come from the US.

03:46:39.100 --> 03:46:44.100
That's another interesting aspect and responsibility that people should think about up here.

03:46:44.100 --> 03:46:50.100
So there is on the drug war side a machine that's fueling the drug war.

03:46:50.100 --> 03:46:53.100
I mean there's a giant drug habit up here.

03:46:53.100 --> 03:46:59.100
But also a governmental intelligence and military support through the sale of weapons.

03:46:59.100 --> 03:47:03.100
I don't know about the sale of weapons, but there's some very...

03:47:03.100 --> 03:47:09.100
You talk about poorest borders coming up. There's poorest borders also going down.

03:47:09.100 --> 03:47:16.100
There's a flow of guns going down and munitions, which again, they don't kill anybody by themselves.

03:47:16.100 --> 03:47:23.100
They get put in the hands of the desperate that are trying to feed a giant drug market to the north.

03:47:23.100 --> 03:47:32.100
Mexico has a saying, Mexico, Mexico far from God, but close to the United States.

03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:38.100
There's definitely a responsibility on both sides.

03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:43.100
This is no longer a Mexico problem, a US problem. This is a regional problem.

03:47:43.100 --> 03:47:48.100
And if we don't think of it as a regional problem with our brothers on the southern side of it,

03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:52.100
and with family, we're related in blood.

03:47:55.100 --> 03:48:01.100
Mexico and the United States are like this, but it's become popular in politics to just throw a line.

03:48:02.100 --> 03:48:07.100
And I think we need to get to a place where we can figure out how to make those connections

03:48:07.100 --> 03:48:13.100
and repair some of the damage done by just years and years of bad policy on both sides of the border.

03:48:13.100 --> 03:48:16.100
Policy and rhetoric, the way we talk about it, the way we think about it,

03:48:16.100 --> 03:48:21.100
not just the actual policy, but seeing the humanity and the people that are here.

03:48:21.100 --> 03:48:25.100
Yeah, it's an easy thing. They're coming to take our jobs is something you hear.

03:48:25.100 --> 03:48:33.100
There was a state out there that passed some anti-legislation as far as illegal workers on fields.

03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:37.100
And it led to massive losses. Nobody wanted to show up for those jobs, basically.

03:48:37.100 --> 03:48:40.100
People would show up one day and they wouldn't come back.

03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:43.100
And they were doing jobs that people just don't want to do.

03:48:43.100 --> 03:48:50.100
Are they taking that from the locals, or are they filling an essential role that we feel guilty about?

03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:55.100
And the rhetoric around it is more about guilt than anything.

03:48:56.100 --> 03:49:03.100
I am an immigrant myself. I've gone through the experience of doing it legally,

03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:10.100
and I've seen people not do it legally and are in way better places than I am, basically,

03:49:10.100 --> 03:49:12.100
by going around some of the system.

03:49:12.100 --> 03:49:20.100
The system itself, the immigration system here in the US, there's something wrong. It's kind of broken.

03:49:20.100 --> 03:49:28.100
And people coming here illegally are not only looking for a better life for themselves,

03:49:28.100 --> 03:49:31.100
a better life for people, this whole aspect of vilifying them.

03:49:31.100 --> 03:49:36.100
And they're like, oh, this immigrant did this horrible thing, this immigrant did that horrible thing.

03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:41.100
And people saying, go back to your country.

03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:48.100
At the same time, they go to a hotel where all the service staff is from that part of the world and they're here irregularly.

03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:56.100
Or they go to the Whole Foods and they get some produce there and it's picked by some of the same people they're vilifying.

03:49:56.100 --> 03:50:02.100
And again, we need to think about that and analyze that for ourselves.

03:50:02.100 --> 03:50:09.100
Yeah, the idea of go back to your country and finding the other and having a disdain and a hate towards the other.

03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:13.100
Ever since I had a recent conversation with Yeh, formerly known as Kanye West,

03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:22.100
I got to hear a few things from, let's say, unfriendly messages from white nationalists.

03:50:22.100 --> 03:50:28.100
And I got to learn about this world. I continue on the journey of learning,

03:50:28.100 --> 03:50:35.100
which is the idea that the United States, this country, should look a certain way, should have a certain skin color, should have a certain religion.

03:50:35.100 --> 03:50:39.100
And everything else is a pollution, is a poison to this.

03:50:39.100 --> 03:50:45.100
I made it sound hateful right now, but they usually frame it in a positive way, like the purity.

03:50:45.100 --> 03:50:51.100
I'm sure Hitler also phrased everything in a positive way, especially in the 1930s about the purity of Germany.

03:50:51.100 --> 03:50:55.100
But the reality of the United States and one of the things that makes it,

03:50:55.100 --> 03:51:01.100
at least the ideal of the United States, is the soup, the mix. Unlike so many nations I've traveled to,

03:51:01.100 --> 03:51:07.100
the diversity, the good kind of diversity is what makes this country great.

03:51:07.100 --> 03:51:17.100
And so I think it needs to be based on accepting the different subgroups that make up the United States versus trying to purify it.

03:51:17.100 --> 03:51:24.100
And I think Mexican immigrants are just another flavor of saying this is the other, let's reject the other.

03:51:24.100 --> 03:51:31.100
Yeah, I saw that interview, by the way. You showed abasing restraint in that interview.

03:51:31.100 --> 03:51:37.100
My experience, when I came up here, again, Trump was elected when I came up here.

03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:44.100
So it was a weird time for me as far as being an immigrant and the immigrant experience for myself,

03:51:44.100 --> 03:51:51.100
by both being basically the ones that were talked about in that way,

03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:57.100
and also having a bunch of my friends who were very conservative and wearing some of those MAGA hats around me and like,

03:51:57.100 --> 03:52:09.100
hey, Ed, like, well, I mean, I'm a guest here, so I have to, but it's a balancing act is what I've been looking at it as.

03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:14.100
On one side, there's the woke side of it, which everything goes,

03:52:14.100 --> 03:52:18.100
and then the other side is like, let's hold on to some of these things that make us who we are.

03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:27.100
On my end, I want to get to a place where I can smoke a joint concealed carrier firearm, be it my gay best friend's wedding,

03:52:27.100 --> 03:52:29.100
and I want the government not to say anything about it.

03:52:29.100 --> 03:52:33.100
And I think there's parts in the United States here that kind of feel the same way,

03:52:33.100 --> 03:52:37.100
but there's extremes on both sides that are pulling you to one side or the other.

03:52:37.100 --> 03:52:43.100
And I've seen more of the United States than most Americans. I'm in a different state every weekend.

03:52:43.100 --> 03:52:53.100
So I get to go to, I'm going to Tampa tomorrow, then I'm going back to California, then I'm going to Tennessee later, then Kentucky.

03:52:53.100 --> 03:52:58.100
So I get to see all types of people and all types of mentalities and ways that people live.

03:52:58.100 --> 03:53:05.100
And this country is more diverse than most would think, you know, if you only see it through the lens of television or media.

03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:12.100
What I keep seeing out there that for me is like the reason I came here, I guess,

03:53:12.100 --> 03:53:19.100
and a lot of the reasons that I feel a vested interest in this country, not just because my kid's American.

03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:23.100
So I have a very, very big interest in this country doing well.

03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:30.100
But the thing I see is there's still the opportunity and the ability to do something with yourself

03:53:30.100 --> 03:53:33.100
and opportunities out there for people like me that come here with nothing.

03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:38.100
I came here with an experience base, a truck.

03:53:38.100 --> 03:53:40.100
And some demons.

03:53:40.100 --> 03:53:42.100
And yeah, and a bunch of demons in a bag.

03:53:42.100 --> 03:53:47.100
And I'm here with you talking right now about some of those experiences.

03:53:47.100 --> 03:53:48.100
To another immigrant.

03:53:48.100 --> 03:53:54.100
To another immigrant. And both of us are reaching people out there that, you know, might not,

03:53:54.100 --> 03:54:02.100
might haven't heard a voice of people like us that come here with our own bag of demons.

03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:07.100
But where else in the world can two people like us have a conversation with an audience like us

03:54:07.100 --> 03:54:11.100
and not be shot outside of this because of the stuff we're saying?

03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:20.100
Yeah, listen to with love and respect, not derision.

03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:27.100
Let me ask you for advice. What would you say to young folks wherever they come from?

03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:34.100
So in high school and college, they're thinking of how to live a life, have a career they can be proud of.

03:54:34.100 --> 03:54:41.100
And especially if they're struggling, especially if they're at a low point like you were when you came here.

03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:47.100
Travel. Travel is one of the biggest things in the world that I would ask people to kind of go out to.

03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:53.100
See how other people live. Don't go there with your own preconceived notions or trying to make people act like you act.

03:54:53.100 --> 03:54:56.100
Go out there and travel and actually experience the world.

03:54:56.100 --> 03:55:06.100
It doesn't have to be another country. Going from Tennessee to Seattle is a pretty interesting change of scenery.

03:55:06.100 --> 03:55:10.100
Who's better at knife fighting? Just kidding. You don't have to answer that.

03:55:10.100 --> 03:55:19.100
Tennessee. But the traveling is one and knowing how other people live is one aspect of it that I would tell people.

03:55:20.100 --> 03:55:28.100
It's risky. It's dangerous. But that is part of the journey is one of the things I would ask people, young people to kind of consider.

03:55:28.100 --> 03:55:33.100
Service is essential and it should be at the basis of all of our lives.

03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:40.100
Service. Start there. Start with service. In any industry, you're going to go start your own restaurant.

03:55:40.100 --> 03:55:45.100
You have to work in the kitchen for service. If you're going to be a part, a productive member of this country, service.

03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:51.100
And I'm not talking just about the military because the military, it's a process and it's a lifestyle and it's a thing for some people out there.

03:55:51.100 --> 03:55:55.100
It's not even a choice for other people if they want an education. And I get that.

03:55:55.100 --> 03:55:59.100
Community service of any kind is an essential thing.

03:55:59.100 --> 03:56:04.100
The ability to go out there and interact with the people that you would normally not interact with.

03:56:04.100 --> 03:56:07.100
The homeless population that there is in this country.

03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:13.100
The older population that in Mexico, our old die in our homes.

03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:23.100
But here you send them off somewhere else to die, which is an interesting weird detachment that I've seen in the US as far as how the elders are cast aside.

03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:29.100
If I can say anything to young people is to start figuring out our lives of service.

03:56:29.100 --> 03:56:36.100
And that's going to expose you to a bunch of experiences, to a bunch of people out there that you might not regularly kind of meet and see and react to.

03:56:36.100 --> 03:56:41.100
Education is out there.

03:56:41.100 --> 03:56:50.100
It is expensive, but I've sat through a bunch of really expensive classes that I've managed to see on YouTube and learned a lot from them.

03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:56.100
So education is out there, but it doesn't have to be as expensive as they make it.

03:56:56.100 --> 03:56:59.100
It's all about the individual and what he does with that education.

03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:02.100
The dream is free and the hustle is sold separately.

03:57:02.100 --> 03:57:05.100
It's something else I would watch somewhere online.

03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:11.100
But the ability to take information, process it and use it.

03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:16.100
We're expecting everything to be safe, processed and given to us in a platter.

03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:22.100
And taking that and digesting and thinking that's going to make us somebody that's going to be productive or valuable in society.

03:57:22.100 --> 03:57:25.100
That's up to us.

03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:30.100
The US talks a lot about freedoms, but doesn't talk a lot about responsibilities.

03:57:30.100 --> 03:57:35.100
I think that's a big part of, you know, take responsibility for like I came here without anything.

03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:44.100
And the first thing I thought was I have a responsibility for the people that I work with and the people that are going through the same problems and I am.

03:57:44.100 --> 03:57:46.100
How can I figure out a way to help?

03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:52.100
Yeah, the dark side of thinking a lot about freedom is thinking too individualistically,

03:57:52.100 --> 03:58:01.100
meaning thinking about me, how to optimize my situation, forgetting that the deepest growth you can do as an individual is by taking care of others,

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:08.100
by helping others, by being of service, by being useful to your community locally and then hopefully also at scale.

03:58:08.100 --> 03:58:10.100
And that's how you grow.

03:58:10.100 --> 03:58:13.100
And that's responsibility of like helping those around you.

03:58:13.100 --> 03:58:16.100
There's an isolationist aspect to culture now.

03:58:16.100 --> 03:58:18.100
It's like we are separate.

03:58:18.100 --> 03:58:29.100
There's almost like a spiritual or cultural amputation in a way where, you know, when I was a kid, the house where all the bikes outside of it,

03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:32.100
that was where all the kids were hanging out.

03:58:32.100 --> 03:58:38.100
And now everybody's on their phone, you know, in the separate houses chatting on whatever.

03:58:38.100 --> 03:58:40.100
There's a detachment to there.

03:58:40.100 --> 03:58:42.100
That's a weird aspect to it.

03:58:42.100 --> 03:58:45.100
And also the aspect of I need to be safe.

03:58:45.100 --> 03:58:47.100
I can't be offended.

03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:48.100
Don't hurt me.

03:58:48.100 --> 03:58:49.100
Safe spaces.

03:58:49.100 --> 03:58:50.100
This is my right.

03:58:50.100 --> 03:58:51.100
This is my right.

03:58:51.100 --> 03:58:52.100
This is my reality.

03:58:52.100 --> 03:58:54.100
You need to respect it.

03:58:54.100 --> 03:58:56.100
Respect is earned.

03:58:56.100 --> 03:58:59.100
And where I come from, respect is earned.

03:58:59.100 --> 03:59:02.100
There's freedoms, but there's dangerous freedoms.

03:59:02.100 --> 03:59:06.100
Any freedom you have in Mexico is a dangerous freedom in a way.

03:59:06.100 --> 03:59:09.100
You know, you can drive home drunk in Mexico.

03:59:09.100 --> 03:59:10.100
You can.

03:59:10.100 --> 03:59:17.100
If you bribe a cop on your way there and if you don't die or crash into somebody else, that's a dangerous aspect of freedom.

03:59:17.100 --> 03:59:20.100
But there's a responsibility to all of it.

03:59:20.100 --> 03:59:23.100
It is a twisted responsibility in a twisted way.

03:59:23.100 --> 03:59:25.100
Kind of talk about it and describe it.

03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:36.100
But I think the the aspect of people screaming for freedom up here or their rights or their privilege without the responsibility.

03:59:36.100 --> 03:59:39.100
You know, what are you doing for your community?

03:59:39.100 --> 03:59:40.100
You're complaining about this.

03:59:40.100 --> 03:59:42.100
What are you doing about it?

03:59:42.100 --> 03:59:54.100
You know, another thing I've noticed in traveling around, it's scary, is the whole people, people getting shouted down or canceled because of what they express or say.

03:59:54.100 --> 04:00:04.100
Some of the creepiest experiences I've had in the U.S. has been through universities or just seeing young people that have an opinion that is completely outside of reality, you know.

04:00:04.100 --> 04:00:10.100
People telling me how things are in Mexico because they learned it through a college course.

04:00:10.100 --> 04:00:11.100
Yes.

04:00:11.100 --> 04:00:21.100
And seeing sons of immigrants criticizing me because of my opinion of Mexico or what I have to say about it.

04:00:21.100 --> 04:00:30.100
And, you know, if you want to encounter the worst enemy of a Mexican is usually a second, third generation Mexican up here that shouts you down for what you're saying.

04:00:30.100 --> 04:00:34.100
I mean, in general entitlement, all those kinds of things.

04:00:34.100 --> 04:00:37.100
Some of that comes with just being young in general.

04:00:37.100 --> 04:00:44.100
But yes, humility, humility at a societal scale would benefit significantly, especially the young.

04:00:44.100 --> 04:00:51.100
So I would say some of the service that you're speaking to is comes with being humbled.

04:00:51.100 --> 04:00:52.100
Yeah.

04:00:52.100 --> 04:00:56.100
And that is one of the best things you can do as a young person.

04:00:56.100 --> 04:01:01.100
Whilst maintaining the dream and the ambition, humble yourself to the reality of the world.

04:01:01.100 --> 04:01:02.100
Yeah.

04:01:02.100 --> 04:01:06.100
One small example, a micro example of this.

04:01:06.100 --> 04:01:12.100
My kid, there was a homeless guy.

04:01:12.100 --> 04:01:15.100
She was out with some with family members.

04:01:16.100 --> 04:01:18.100
This homeless guy showed up.

04:01:18.100 --> 04:01:22.100
He was erratic, mentally mentally disturbed, created a scene.

04:01:22.100 --> 04:01:24.100
She was upset.

04:01:24.100 --> 04:01:25.100
There was a little bit of trauma there.

04:01:25.100 --> 04:01:29.100
She was like, oh, now all homeless people are bad.

04:01:29.100 --> 04:01:37.100
So with her, she does art pieces sometimes for me and helps me make designs for the clothing brand that I have.

04:01:37.100 --> 04:01:40.100
And we take some of that money and we buy socks and underwear.

04:01:41.100 --> 04:01:44.100
And sometimes I have them in the car.

04:01:44.100 --> 04:01:49.100
Sometimes I drive around and see somebody who needs something and I give it to her and says, you helped me earn this money.

04:01:49.100 --> 04:01:50.100
That's going to help these people.

04:01:50.100 --> 04:01:52.100
So you should just give them these.

04:01:52.100 --> 04:01:57.100
And she's like, oh, thank you.

04:01:57.100 --> 04:01:59.100
And she's like, cool.

04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:02.100
Roll up the window.

04:02:02.100 --> 04:02:03.100
She used to roll up the window really quick.

04:02:03.100 --> 04:02:05.100
Now she doesn't.

04:02:05.100 --> 04:02:08.100
They cease to be scary.

04:02:08.100 --> 04:02:10.100
Because now some of them have names.

04:02:10.100 --> 04:02:14.100
Now some of them know her name, you know, when they when she crosses by there.

04:02:14.100 --> 04:02:16.100
So she's there's contact there.

04:02:16.100 --> 04:02:18.100
She's more connected than I am in some of these places.

04:02:18.100 --> 04:02:25.100
Now, you know, she has friends in low places and in high places that comes later, I guess.

04:02:25.100 --> 04:02:27.100
But she is learning about service.

04:02:27.100 --> 04:02:36.100
She's learning about not every not everybody out there is an enemy or bad or scary.

04:02:36.100 --> 04:02:38.100
She's learning about service.

04:02:38.100 --> 04:02:42.100
And she's basically learning that lesson that I got from my mom long ago.

04:02:42.100 --> 04:02:44.100
You know, nobody's against you there for themselves.

04:02:44.100 --> 04:02:46.100
Don't take anything personal.

04:02:46.100 --> 04:02:51.100
And if you're not doing something for other people while you're working, then you're not doing anything.

04:02:51.100 --> 04:02:56.100
So when you were young, you were pretty sure you're going to die before you're 30.

04:02:56.100 --> 04:02:57.100
Yeah.

04:02:57.100 --> 04:02:59.100
What's your relationship with death today?

04:02:59.100 --> 04:03:01.100
Do you think about your mortality?

04:03:01.100 --> 04:03:02.100
Are you afraid of it?

04:03:02.100 --> 04:03:03.100
I'm not afraid of it.

04:03:03.100 --> 04:03:14.100
If anything, I'm afraid of meaningless death or at least a meaningless walk towards it.

04:03:14.100 --> 04:03:16.100
I'm afraid of losing use of my legs, I guess.

04:03:16.100 --> 04:03:19.100
I'm afraid of not being able to go out there and do things anymore.

04:03:19.100 --> 04:03:25.100
I'm afraid that I'm not physically capable of doing the job that I used to do.

04:03:25.100 --> 04:03:28.100
So if anything, I'm afraid of stillness.

04:03:28.100 --> 04:03:32.100
You know, something I always quote a lot in my writings, stillness is death.

04:03:32.100 --> 04:03:37.100
So you always want to be challenging yourself, moving, growing, like you're traveling,

04:03:37.100 --> 04:03:41.100
so you get all these experiences and filling your life with all these experiences.

04:03:41.100 --> 04:03:44.100
And if it ends, when it ends, be ready for it.

04:03:44.100 --> 04:03:45.100
Yeah.

04:03:45.100 --> 04:03:46.100
I'm not afraid of the end.

04:03:46.100 --> 04:03:49.100
The ending is important in all things.

04:03:49.100 --> 04:03:53.100
First time I got a promotion, I got two silver coins handed to me.

04:03:53.100 --> 04:03:56.100
Here's a silver coin and this is another silver coin.

04:03:56.100 --> 04:04:00.100
I said, I'll give you the other one when your job ends.

04:04:00.100 --> 04:04:01.100
Yeah.

04:04:01.100 --> 04:04:07.100
It depends on you if you wanted to have it over your eyes or in your pocket, right?

04:04:07.100 --> 04:04:11.100
And the lesson there is that, you know, this job you're getting, it's pretty cool

04:04:11.100 --> 04:04:15.100
and you're going to be in charge of all these people and it's pretty important, but it's going to end.

04:04:15.100 --> 04:04:19.100
So you always have to, the ending is important in all things.

04:04:19.100 --> 04:04:23.100
If we don't keep that in mind, then if you think we're immortal and nothing's going to end,

04:04:23.100 --> 04:04:26.100
I think there's an atrophy, a spiritual atrophy in that.

04:04:27.100 --> 04:04:32.100
For the sake of spiritual flourishing, this conversation too must come to an end.

04:04:32.100 --> 04:04:35.100
So I think a beautiful way to end it and I'm a huge fan of yours.

04:04:35.100 --> 04:04:42.100
Thank you for being a man with a life well lived and for talking with me today is an honor, man.

04:04:42.100 --> 04:04:43.100
It was an awesome conversation.

04:04:43.100 --> 04:04:45.100
Thank you for having me on.

04:04:45.100 --> 04:04:48.100
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ed Calderon.

04:04:48.100 --> 04:04:52.100
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

04:04:52.100 --> 04:04:58.100
And now let me leave you with some words from Al Pacino's character in Scarface, Tony Montana.

04:04:58.100 --> 04:05:02.100
You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.

04:05:02.100 --> 04:05:07.100
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say, that's the bad guy.

04:05:07.100 --> 04:05:12.100
Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
