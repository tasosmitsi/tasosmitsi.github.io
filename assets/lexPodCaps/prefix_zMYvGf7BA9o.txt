WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.360
So she's like, what is going on?

00:08.360 --> 00:11.000
You know, and so we have this conversation

00:11.000 --> 00:15.360
and I tell her, look, people are looking for me.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.520
Who? Law enforcement.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.720
Which ones? All of them.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.860
You know, she's like, that doesn't even, for what?

00:21.860 --> 00:26.740
I go, mostly bank fraud.

00:26.780 --> 00:29.940
And she's like, well, how are they not finding you?

00:30.800 --> 00:33.200
I mean, everybody, you know, people know you,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.060
like, you know, your general contractor,

00:35.060 --> 00:36.840
which I met four months before.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.060
This guy six months before, this one two months before,

00:39.060 --> 00:41.100
you know, she's like, so-and-so, so-and-so, so,

00:41.100 --> 00:42.100
and I'm like, right, right.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.300
Well, I said, well, she's like, I mean,

00:44.300 --> 00:45.180
they've got your name.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.540
They've got your, I go, well, that's identity theft.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.780
And she was like, what do you mean?

00:49.780 --> 00:52.340
I said, well, my name's not, you know, my name's not,

00:52.340 --> 00:53.620
it's not Joseph Carter.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.140
And what is your name?

00:56.140 --> 00:58.260
And I go, look, you know, it's,

00:58.260 --> 01:00.420
you don't need, don't even worry about it.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.820
The following is a conversation with Matthew Cox,

01:04.820 --> 01:07.500
a con man recently released from federal prison,

01:07.500 --> 01:11.620
where he served 13 years for bank fraud, mortgage fraud,

01:11.620 --> 01:15.020
identity theft, passport fraud, and other charges.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.940
He has admitted guilt to all of it.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.380
He has written true crime stories

01:19.380 --> 01:21.100
of many of his fellow prisoners.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.540
And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals

01:24.580 --> 01:27.140
about their crimes on his YouTube channel

01:27.140 --> 01:30.580
that I recommend called Inside True Crime.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.540
Exploring the mind of a criminal

01:33.540 --> 01:36.820
is exploring human nature at the extremes,

01:36.820 --> 01:40.700
often in its most raw and illuminating form.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.660
And that is something I definitely want to do

01:42.660 --> 01:46.380
with this podcast, to understand the human mind

01:46.380 --> 01:48.700
and everything it is capable of.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.780
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.700
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:53.700 --> 01:54.940
in the description.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.300
And now, dear friends, here's Matthew Cox.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.060
What was the first crime you committed?

02:03.060 --> 02:04.820
The first mortgage I ever did.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.540
A mortgage is me borrowing money from a bank to buy a house.

02:09.540 --> 02:13.380
How can you find a way to commit crime in this?

02:13.380 --> 02:16.660
How can you do fraud in this space?

02:16.660 --> 02:20.820
It's very difficult for the average guy to commit fraud

02:20.820 --> 02:23.940
because there's so many safeguards set up.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.260
You know, if you were to go in and say,

02:26.260 --> 02:28.660
I make $300,000 a year,

02:28.660 --> 02:31.100
okay, well, we want your W-2s, we want your pay stubs,

02:31.100 --> 02:32.060
we're gonna call your employer,

02:32.060 --> 02:33.500
we're gonna check to make sure your employer,

02:33.500 --> 02:34.780
how long they've been incorporated,

02:34.780 --> 02:36.740
we're gonna check to make sure they're registered.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.060
It's like, ah, your whole plan fell apart, you know,

02:39.060 --> 02:41.260
because the average guy can't do that.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.900
He can't even come up with the pay stub in W-2.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.460
So the average person, you know,

02:45.460 --> 02:48.420
or I'm gonna put down this much money,

02:48.460 --> 02:51.180
because you're gonna borrow that money from the seller.

02:51.180 --> 02:53.740
You know, okay, well, then they start asking

02:53.740 --> 02:56.060
for bank statements, where does the money come from?

02:56.060 --> 02:57.420
How long has it been in your bank?

02:57.420 --> 02:59.100
Like you can't even have it put in your bank for a day,

02:59.100 --> 03:00.460
get a letter, you know, it's gotta have been there

03:00.460 --> 03:03.420
for 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank.

03:03.420 --> 03:06.860
And so there's all these ways for the average person.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.580
It's very difficult to commit fraud.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.780
The average guy that works at Walmart

03:10.780 --> 03:13.060
and makes $60,000 a year,

03:13.060 --> 03:14.060
and he's been there for five years,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.900
and he saved his deposit, like, it's a very,

03:16.940 --> 03:20.020
that's really the guy that those transactions

03:20.020 --> 03:22.580
are set up for, to borrow a mortgage from Bank of America.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.220
That's the guy they're looking for.

03:24.220 --> 03:26.180
So to commit fraud in this space,

03:26.180 --> 03:30.220
you have to misrepresent some aspect of your identity,

03:30.220 --> 03:32.860
of how much you're worth, how much money you have,

03:32.860 --> 03:33.700
this kind of stuff.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.100
Right, you have to be able to lie to the bank.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.540
Anytime you lie to the bank, you've committed fraud.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.460
And it's funny, when I was, you know, doing it,

03:40.460 --> 03:42.380
I would say, ah, it's in the gray area.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.740
There's no gray area where you're either lying

03:44.740 --> 03:46.780
in some capacity or you're not.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.060
So it's, for instance, the very first loan I did,

03:51.060 --> 03:55.700
I whited out my borrower,

03:56.580 --> 04:01.260
had been 30 days late on her rent.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.180
So they're really looking at the last two years.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.100
So when you go into the bank and they,

04:07.100 --> 04:09.780
most of what they're asking you is a two-year window.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.860
They're saying, how long have you been on their job?

04:11.860 --> 04:13.860
They care about two years.

04:13.860 --> 04:17.300
And how long have you been at your residency?

04:17.300 --> 04:18.620
They're looking for two years.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.940
Now you could be at three places in two years, that's fine,

04:20.940 --> 04:24.940
as long as you consistently paid for two years.

04:24.940 --> 04:27.260
Well, she had been in an apartment complex,

04:27.260 --> 04:28.900
but she'd been 30 days late.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.860
Now she caught it up, but she was late.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.980
Bank, you know, the bank doesn't want to lend you money

04:34.980 --> 04:37.980
if you've been 30 days late.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.900
So I was a broker and I whited out the 30 day late.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.940
I just got rid of it.

04:43.940 --> 04:47.460
And my manager is the person that told me to do it.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.380
She said, it'll be fine.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.100
And she was right, it was.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.020
What did it feel like?

04:53.020 --> 04:56.900
So that was the first fraudulent action you committed.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.900
Yeah, I mean, you know, I was worried.

05:02.340 --> 05:03.940
You know, I always say, you know,

05:03.940 --> 05:06.780
I sweated bullets for four or five days, you know,

05:06.780 --> 05:08.980
but I mean, I was concerned.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.180
And I don't know that I was concerned

05:11.220 --> 05:13.500
that I had broken the law.

05:14.260 --> 05:19.260
I was concerned because I was behind on my truck payment.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.620
I was behind on my mortgage.

05:21.620 --> 05:25.620
Like I had banked on being a mortgage broker

05:25.620 --> 05:29.660
and I'd gone deep, deep behind on all my bills to do this.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.780
So in the last minute when this loan isn't gonna close

05:32.780 --> 05:35.820
and I have to commit fraud to make that happen.

05:35.820 --> 05:39.340
And the idea, my fear was they were gonna figure it out

05:39.340 --> 05:40.420
and maybe I'd get fired.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.780
You know, I didn't think I was gonna go to jail

05:42.780 --> 05:45.540
because my manager assured me you're not going to jail.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.980
Like you'll get fired at best.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.780
So my concern was they were gonna catch it

05:51.780 --> 05:54.100
and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.660
Like I needed that money so bad.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.860
So we'll maybe paint the picture here.

05:58.860 --> 05:59.700
Where were you working?

05:59.700 --> 06:00.900
Who was the manager?

06:00.900 --> 06:02.540
The manager, it's funny

06:02.540 --> 06:05.620
because I don't think I ever really mentioned this.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.660
Her name was Gretchen Zayas.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.260
She eventually, I don't mind saying it,

06:09.260 --> 06:11.580
she eventually ended up going to jail for fraud.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.380
Her name was Gretchen Zayas and she was a manager.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.060
I was working for a company called Eagle Lending

06:17.060 --> 06:21.860
and it was in Tampa and this was like my first month.

06:21.860 --> 06:25.940
So my very first deal, three or four weeks into it,

06:25.940 --> 06:28.780
into that first month and I walk in,

06:28.780 --> 06:32.460
I put the file in front of my manager.

06:32.460 --> 06:36.220
She looks through everything, you know, oh, great, good,

06:36.580 --> 06:40.380
and put this one piece of paper over here and sat there.

06:40.380 --> 06:44.700
And then when she was done, I said, what's going on?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.300
She goes, perfect, file's perfect.

06:46.300 --> 06:50.660
She goes, but your borrower was 30 days late on her rent.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.500
And she says that it's done.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.180
She's like, that's a deal killer.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.100
And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, what do I do?

06:56.100 --> 06:58.860
And I remember she pulled out a thing, a whiteout,

06:58.860 --> 07:01.020
and the whiteout, not the sticks, but the one, shh, shh, shh.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.540
And she started going, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.660
And I was like, what?

07:03.660 --> 07:04.780
She goes, if I was you.

07:05.740 --> 07:07.060
And she handed, she said, I'd white it out,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.460
make a copy, stick it back in the file.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.900
She said, it'll be fine.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.660
And I went, I was like, that's fraud, I could go to jail.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.540
And she goes, and she was like,

07:16.740 --> 07:17.780
they're never gonna catch it.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.860
She said, look, we do stuff, I do stuff all the time.

07:19.860 --> 07:21.380
She said, they're not gonna catch it.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.820
And nobody's calling the FBI.

07:22.820 --> 07:25.900
She goes, the worst case scenario,

07:25.900 --> 07:30.900
if underwriting catches it, then they'll fire you.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.660
That's it, nobody's calling, you're not going to jail.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.660
And I trusted her, I was like, okay.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.660
And so I did what she said, I stuck it in the file.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.900
And I mean, like I said, for four or five days,

07:43.900 --> 07:45.820
I was like, oh my God, I'm so scared.

07:45.820 --> 07:46.780
How old were you at this point?

07:46.780 --> 07:48.460
Probably 29, I think it was 29.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.740
Like I had gone to college

07:51.740 --> 07:55.140
and so many things had not worked out.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.860
I got a degree in fine arts.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.420
There's not a lot of people looking for anyone

08:01.420 --> 08:02.860
with a fine arts degree.

08:02.860 --> 08:07.860
And I tried to be an insurance adjuster.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.660
Tried that for about a year, year and a half,

08:11.660 --> 08:12.660
that didn't work out.

08:13.620 --> 08:18.620
Ended up working construction for a few years.

08:19.660 --> 08:23.220
And so finally, the girl I was dating said,

08:23.220 --> 08:24.500
you gotta be a mortgage broker.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.540
She had just started in the mortgage industry.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.700
And she was like, you have to do this,

08:28.700 --> 08:31.340
like you were born to do this, this is perfect for you.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.700
What did she see in you?

08:32.700 --> 08:34.500
She said, it's just, you're a salesman.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.140
And I was like, cause I was like,

08:36.140 --> 08:37.660
I barely balanced my checkbook.

08:37.660 --> 08:39.100
Like, I don't know anything about numbers.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
And she was like, it has nothing to do with that.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.940
It's sales, it's putting together deals.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.820
You're good at that, you're good at negotiating.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.820
You're a natural salesman.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.460
And I figured I need to try something.

08:53.460 --> 08:58.460
So what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making

08:58.580 --> 09:02.420
and what aspects require the charisma that you clearly have?

09:02.420 --> 09:06.420
Well, one, you've got clients that have lots of options.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.780
They can go to Bank of America, they can go to SunTrust,

09:09.780 --> 09:11.420
they can go to Chase.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.740
They have options if they have perfect credit.

09:13.740 --> 09:17.780
I ended up working for a company that was a subprime lender

09:17.780 --> 09:19.620
and those people didn't have a lot of options.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.900
But honestly, by the time they got to that,

09:21.900 --> 09:24.620
to Eagle Lending, their options were over.

09:24.620 --> 09:27.620
So what ends up happening is you're negotiating

09:27.620 --> 09:31.620
with sellers, you would think that a lot of the stuff

09:31.620 --> 09:36.620
that in that industry that real estate agents should do,

09:37.900 --> 09:39.900
the brokers end up doing.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.980
Because real estate agents are used to,

09:43.980 --> 09:45.620
you meet them at the house or they take you

09:45.620 --> 09:50.300
to several houses, they open the door, they walk around.

09:50.300 --> 09:54.300
They write up a contract that's legit, a legit contract.

09:54.300 --> 09:59.300
And you're already pre-approved, everything works out.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.940
But subprime, that's not the case.

10:03.940 --> 10:07.460
You got borrowers with horrific job history,

10:07.460 --> 10:09.860
they don't have enough of the down payment.

10:09.860 --> 10:10.900
Maybe they have the down payment,

10:10.900 --> 10:12.220
but they don't have the closing costs.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.180
So you have to go to the real estate agent and say,

10:14.180 --> 10:16.620
listen, I need you to raise the purchase price

10:16.620 --> 10:21.060
and have the seller pay the closing costs,

10:21.100 --> 10:24.420
which is legal, but that's not to a degree,

10:24.420 --> 10:26.700
but that's not how they wrote up the contract.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.220
So now you're having to get them to rewrite the contract

10:29.220 --> 10:32.180
or there's little things you're trying to do.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.140
And the more deals you get done

10:35.140 --> 10:37.340
and the more you deal with certain real estate agents,

10:37.340 --> 10:42.340
the more you start to realize that they're...

10:42.900 --> 10:45.540
You know which ones are completely above board

10:45.540 --> 10:49.060
and which ones are willing to twist the rules.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.140
And a lot of it works on personal relationships.

10:52.140 --> 10:52.980
Right, right.

10:52.980 --> 10:57.980
For some reason, people tend to like me and trust me.

10:59.020 --> 11:04.020
I don't know why it hasn't worked out for so many people,

11:04.060 --> 11:07.620
but people naturally seem to trust me.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.860
And so if I say, hey, I can close the loan,

11:09.860 --> 11:12.100
but you gotta do this, it'll be cool.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.380
Don't worry, we do it all the time.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.620
It's like my third loan.

11:14.620 --> 11:18.180
And I've been doing this for years and they go, okay.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.460
And then they raise the purchase price,

11:19.460 --> 11:22.060
they add some money, they have the seller of the house,

11:22.060 --> 11:24.580
give the borrower some money, they stick it in the bank

11:24.580 --> 11:27.140
or they put it in an escrow at the closing company.

11:27.140 --> 11:30.220
Now you're starting to massage deals.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.060
What was the second time you committed a crime?

11:32.060 --> 11:35.420
So how did it start to evolve from the whiteout?

11:35.420 --> 11:37.500
Well, I mean, when that went through,

11:37.500 --> 11:40.940
you know, I think a normal person

11:40.940 --> 11:45.020
probably would have said, wow, it was a one-time thing,

11:45.020 --> 11:47.740
got away with it, whew, I'm good.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.660
But for me, it just emboldened me.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.820
Like I just got a check for like, I don't know what it was,

11:52.820 --> 11:55.580
25, $3,500, I was thrilled.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.540
And by that time I was already working on another deal.

11:58.540 --> 12:03.180
But that guy, he made, I forget something like,

12:03.180 --> 12:08.180
he'd made like, let's say $45,000 the year before in his W-2.

12:09.980 --> 12:14.820
If you, based on his current track record

12:14.820 --> 12:17.260
or his year to date of his pay stub,

12:17.260 --> 12:19.180
he made just enough money.

12:19.180 --> 12:24.180
But if you factored in last year's W-2, he was shy.

12:24.420 --> 12:29.420
So if I changed that 45,000 to 51,000,

12:30.700 --> 12:32.980
then he could, the loan closes.

12:32.980 --> 12:36.340
I get a check for 3,500 bucks, he gets into a house,

12:36.340 --> 12:40.140
I'm doing him a favor, you know, I'm doing God's work.

12:40.140 --> 12:45.140
So I fix it, I kick back, I'm terrified a little bit,

12:45.940 --> 12:47.060
you know, worried about it.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.100
Sure enough, it closes.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.540
Four or five days later, they call me, he's ready to close.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.740
A week later, we close, I get a check.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.900
Next guy that comes in, I mean, I got very, very quickly,

12:58.660 --> 13:00.100
I was concerned, do you have a house?

13:00.100 --> 13:00.940
Do you have a deal?

13:00.940 --> 13:01.760
Is it ready?

13:01.760 --> 13:03.300
I can get you done.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.660
Now, if you were in bankruptcy or something,

13:04.660 --> 13:06.340
there's some things you just, you pull their credit

13:06.340 --> 13:08.060
and you just couldn't help them if they were,

13:08.060 --> 13:10.980
if they had a 550 credit score or something and no job.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.060
I mean, you know, they had to be within reason.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.260
But very quickly, it was changing W-2s,

13:15.260 --> 13:19.620
changing pay subs, changing appraisals, you know,

13:19.620 --> 13:22.860
fixing, like I said, verifications of rent.

13:24.420 --> 13:28.220
So it evolved very quickly for me.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.820
And you're essentially helping people.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.540
That's what I told myself.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.580
Giving them a chance.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.500
People that have been really struggling financially in life.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.420
So you've been telling yourself that this is,

13:40.460 --> 13:43.100
you're doing a good thing for people.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.220
I told myself that right up until,

13:46.220 --> 13:48.180
that those loans were solid

13:48.180 --> 13:50.500
and I was helping those people out

13:50.500 --> 13:52.660
right up until I went to prison.

13:52.660 --> 13:56.060
And I was in prison and I had to write,

13:56.060 --> 13:59.300
the government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course

13:59.300 --> 14:03.140
for, to help teach the nation's mortgage brokers.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.620
You know, all loan officers and brokers have to take,

14:08.620 --> 14:10.900
I think it's nine hours of continuing education

14:10.900 --> 14:12.420
every single year.

14:12.420 --> 14:16.100
And I was approached to write the ethics course.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.900
And it was about that time and about the same period of time

14:19.900 --> 14:22.740
I was writing a book, my book.

14:23.980 --> 14:28.780
And that kind of, I started reflecting on what I had done.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.420
You know, and the truth is like,

14:31.780 --> 14:32.940
and this is a horrible thing to say,

14:32.940 --> 14:34.220
because the first time I ever heard somebody say this,

14:34.220 --> 14:35.900
I remember thinking, oh, that's a horrible thing to say.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.220
Some people should not own a house.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.180
They shouldn't be allowed to borrow.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.900
They're not in a position financially, you know,

14:42.900 --> 14:45.980
and there were many occasions where I put someone in a house

14:45.980 --> 14:48.940
that they 100% swore they could afford.

14:48.940 --> 14:51.180
It was, I was helping them.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.820
I told myself I was helping them.

14:53.820 --> 14:57.220
And a year and a half later, they're going into foreclosure.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.900
Their stuff's on the corner.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.260
They don't know where to go.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.460
And the truth is, is that I'm not smarter than

15:04.460 --> 15:06.220
the actuaries that came up

15:06.220 --> 15:09.100
with those underwriting guidelines.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.100
So in this whole process, how are you making money?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.060
Are you taking a percentage?

15:15.060 --> 15:16.100
Broker fee.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.420
Yeah, I charge a broker fee.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.100
Or you charge yield spread.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.540
So yield spread is, let's say the interest rate

15:21.540 --> 15:23.700
is 8% interest.

15:23.700 --> 15:27.740
If I charge them 25 basis points over the 8%,

15:27.740 --> 15:32.140
so I charge them eight and a quarter, you know, 8.25,

15:32.140 --> 15:35.900
then I get 1% of the loan back as a fee.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.740
So if I charge them eight and a half percent,

15:38.740 --> 15:40.900
I get two points back.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.180
So if it's a $100,000 piece of property

15:44.180 --> 15:48.540
and the bank says your interest rate is gonna be 8%

15:48.540 --> 15:53.540
and I tell you 8.5 and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker fee,

15:55.500 --> 15:57.300
now I'm making $5,500.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.500
So on even $100,000 loan,

16:00.500 --> 16:02.380
you could make a nice chunk of change.

16:02.380 --> 16:03.980
I mean, it's...

16:03.980 --> 16:05.900
So how much gray area is here?

16:05.900 --> 16:08.140
You said that there really isn't when you're lying or not,

16:08.140 --> 16:10.700
but it feels like there is.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.020
Well, every time I changed something,

16:12.020 --> 16:13.060
it wasn't gray area.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.100
I just committed fraud.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.700
At this level, you either meet the guidelines

16:17.700 --> 16:19.700
or someone has massaged it in such a way

16:19.700 --> 16:21.140
that they've committed fraud.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.140
That's it.

16:22.140 --> 16:26.220
And there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud

16:26.220 --> 16:30.660
and they just can't figure it out.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.500
Does that make sense?

16:31.540 --> 16:33.020
I mean, you've committed fraud

16:33.020 --> 16:35.180
and it's like they look at the entire,

16:35.180 --> 16:36.540
they look at all the documents

16:36.540 --> 16:37.940
and they double check everything

16:37.940 --> 16:39.180
and they know there's fraud in here

16:39.180 --> 16:40.300
and they just can't find it.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.540
And just because they can't find it

16:41.540 --> 16:43.220
doesn't mean it's not fraud. Exactly.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.700
Doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.860
As part of this, you did a lot of fascinating things.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.060
One of the things you did,

16:48.060 --> 16:50.980
you talked about creating synthetic people,

16:50.980 --> 16:54.100
meaning creating fake identities.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
What does it take to do that, to do that well?

16:57.180 --> 17:02.180
So your credit profile is made up of your name,

17:03.740 --> 17:06.060
date of birth, your address,

17:06.060 --> 17:08.460
and your social security number.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.660
And those are the kind of,

17:09.660 --> 17:12.580
and then there's other things where you work,

17:12.580 --> 17:13.580
that sort of thing.

17:15.140 --> 17:18.220
But what people don't realize is

17:18.220 --> 17:20.980
there's so many people out there that think

17:20.980 --> 17:24.820
that the credit bureaus already know who you are, right?

17:24.820 --> 17:26.620
But the truth is the first time the credit bureau

17:26.620 --> 17:29.460
has ever heard about you was when you told them.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.380
The first time you applied for a credit card,

17:32.380 --> 17:34.660
they created a credit profile at that moment.

17:34.660 --> 17:36.140
Prior to that, they had no idea.

17:36.140 --> 17:37.700
So the first time you apply,

17:37.700 --> 17:41.660
you give them your full name, date of birth,

17:41.660 --> 17:44.740
social security number, and your address.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.260
And they create a credit profile

17:47.260 --> 17:50.340
and they say, hey, no record found of this person.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.300
He has no credit, nothing, probably got denied.

17:53.340 --> 17:57.340
Well, what I realized through the course of,

17:57.340 --> 18:00.540
because eventually I ended up leaving that one company

18:00.540 --> 18:02.340
and I opened my own mortgage company.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.580
When I opened that mortgage company,

18:07.220 --> 18:10.500
I was on the inside.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.340
Does that make sense?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.020
Like I wasn't just a broker

18:13.020 --> 18:14.580
that was sitting out with everybody else

18:14.580 --> 18:17.700
and would periodically come in and ask questions

18:17.700 --> 18:19.540
or would call underwriting,

18:19.540 --> 18:21.340
but really didn't understand what was happening

18:22.100 --> 18:24.180
exactly what the underwriting guidelines were.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.420
Now I was actually talking to the underwriters

18:26.420 --> 18:29.300
and you're talking to the owners

18:29.300 --> 18:31.340
of the lending institutions and the banks

18:31.340 --> 18:33.900
and you're talking to all of the account executives.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.860
Now it wasn't just Eagle Lending I was talking to.

18:36.860 --> 18:40.620
There were 40 different account executives coming in

18:40.620 --> 18:43.020
on a weekly basis trying to get us to sign up

18:43.020 --> 18:45.020
with their lender.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.940
And they're on the inside telling you,

18:46.940 --> 18:50.780
coming in, showing you programs and saying,

18:50.780 --> 18:55.500
look, if your borrower is self-employed,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
we don't ask for this or this.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.460
We just ask for them to say they're self-employed

19:00.460 --> 19:01.860
like liar loans.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.220
You've heard the term liar loans?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.780
Okay.

19:04.780 --> 19:07.060
No doc loans where they don't ask for any documentation.

19:07.060 --> 19:09.220
If he's got over like, let's say a 700 credit score

19:09.220 --> 19:12.700
and he says he's been a plumber and he works for himself,

19:12.700 --> 19:14.980
then he's got over a 700 credit score.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.420
He just has to say he's worked for himself

19:16.420 --> 19:18.980
for over two years and they don't ask

19:18.980 --> 19:20.300
for any documentation.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.380
He's got the money in the bank.

19:21.380 --> 19:22.740
He's got a 700 credit score.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.580
Says he's been on the job for two years.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.660
He's self-employed.

19:25.660 --> 19:28.900
We're gonna raise his insurer rate by 1%.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.660
And he's got, you know, that's it.

19:30.660 --> 19:31.980
He's got the loan.

19:31.980 --> 19:36.660
So, but you start to know how things work

19:36.660 --> 19:39.820
because I hired a bunch of brokers to work underneath me.

19:39.820 --> 19:44.140
And when they would get caught, I would get the phone call.

19:44.140 --> 19:47.940
So I get the phone call from the owner of a bank

19:47.940 --> 19:50.540
or a lending institute, you know, a lender.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.780
And that lender says, hey, Matt, we got a problem.

19:53.780 --> 19:54.620
I'm like, what's up?

19:54.620 --> 19:57.420
He's like, listen, we caught a fake W-2.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.140
I'm like, what do you mean?

19:59.140 --> 20:03.020
Yeah, your broker so-and-so sent us a file

20:03.020 --> 20:05.460
and this person had, there's two fake W-2s

20:05.460 --> 20:07.380
and we're assuming the pay subs are fake.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.340
And I'm like, are you serious?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.060
How did you even catch that?

20:11.060 --> 20:13.340
And they go, oh, well, here's what we did.

20:13.380 --> 20:18.380
We checked with sunbiz.com, you know, sunbiz.gov,

20:18.700 --> 20:21.100
which is the Secretary of State's website

20:21.100 --> 20:22.700
that registers corporations.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.820
And we checked and the tax ID number didn't match.

20:25.820 --> 20:30.820
And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number

20:31.460 --> 20:34.340
for whatever corporation issued it.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.860
So there's a sequence of checks they do to detect fraud

20:36.860 --> 20:38.740
on different documents like W-2s.

20:38.740 --> 20:39.580
Right.

20:39.580 --> 20:40.860
And then you're slowly learning.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.860
Slowly, yeah, exactly.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.180
What's the process for detecting?

20:44.020 --> 20:45.900
I mean, I had a pretty good understanding anyway.

20:45.900 --> 20:46.740
Yeah.

20:46.740 --> 20:47.580
But so I'm starting to learn that.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.420
There's common sense understanding, yeah.

20:48.420 --> 20:50.180
So I'm putting these things together.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.500
And I remember one time I had a woman come in

20:54.580 --> 20:57.460
and she came in and she had perfect credit.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.500
She had like 750 credit scores.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.340
I mean, it was perfect.

21:00.340 --> 21:04.260
And she came in and one of the brokers came in and said,

21:04.260 --> 21:05.660
hey, man, can I show you something?

21:05.660 --> 21:06.740
I was like, yeah, what's up?

21:06.740 --> 21:08.300
And he goes, look, he said,

21:08.300 --> 21:10.700
I've got this woman's W-2s here.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.540
I said, okay.

21:11.540 --> 21:12.740
I looked at him and he goes,

21:12.740 --> 21:14.620
here's your credit report.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.540
And he goes, here's the application.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.580
This is the social security number.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.060
I went, all right.

21:21.060 --> 21:24.420
And he said, this is the social security number on the W-2.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.740
And I went, okay.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.860
Keep in mind, you go to get a car loan or credit card.

21:27.860 --> 21:29.740
They never asked for these things.

21:29.740 --> 21:32.700
So, and he was like, I'm really shocked he even noticed it.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.580
I probably might not have even caught it,

21:34.580 --> 21:36.340
but they were different.

21:36.340 --> 21:37.540
And I went, really?

21:37.540 --> 21:38.380
And he goes, yeah.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.220
He said, so I did, you know, she just brought them in.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.220
You know, she's here.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.620
I was like, oh, bring her in here.

21:44.620 --> 21:45.660
So she came in, sat down.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.780
I said, listen, here's what we just found.

21:47.780 --> 21:48.860
And she was like, oh, okay.

21:48.860 --> 21:49.700
You know what?

21:49.700 --> 21:50.540
I don't want the loan.

21:50.540 --> 21:51.380
I just, I go, no, no, no, no.

21:51.380 --> 21:52.580
I said, listen, you're getting the loan.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.780
You got a 750 credit score.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.900
Like, I don't care what we have to do.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.740
We're getting you the loan.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.300
I just want to know what's going on.

21:58.300 --> 22:02.020
How did you get 750 credit scores

22:02.020 --> 22:03.500
under this social security number

22:03.500 --> 22:05.660
when clearly this is your real social security number.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.980
You've been working for this company for 10 years.

22:07.980 --> 22:12.260
And your credit profile says it's only like three years old.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.220
And I was like, what happened?

22:13.220 --> 22:16.660
And what she told me she did was she had been,

22:16.660 --> 22:18.500
she went through a divorce.

22:18.500 --> 22:23.500
She had been married for 10 years, used her husband's,

22:23.660 --> 22:25.980
I mean, his surname for 10 years.

22:25.980 --> 22:29.660
So she has no credit under her maiden name.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.460
But when they got divorced, she switched to her maiden name

22:33.820 --> 22:35.940
because when she pulled, tried to get anything

22:35.940 --> 22:40.940
in her husband's surname, it was denied, bad credit.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.180
So he had bad credit, their credit went bad.

22:44.180 --> 22:48.740
So he switched to her, she switched to her name

22:48.740 --> 22:51.380
and a friend told her if she needed to get her electric

22:51.380 --> 22:54.580
or anything turned on, she could use her name

22:54.580 --> 22:58.540
and use her daughter's or son's social security number,

22:58.540 --> 23:00.620
which was like a four-year-old kid.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.740
So she used that and it went through.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.420
She had to put a deposit down, but it went through at least,

23:05.420 --> 23:06.820
wasn't denied.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.940
So that went through.

23:07.940 --> 23:10.860
Then she went and she applied for an apartment with that.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.420
Sure enough, it went through.

23:13.420 --> 23:17.220
She had no credit, but they said, you don't have bad credit.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.980
So she said, once she moved into the apartment,

23:18.980 --> 23:22.180
she then started getting these pre-approved credit cards.

23:22.180 --> 23:24.900
So she goes, but I knew I had applied there

23:24.900 --> 23:27.940
using my son's social security number, let's say.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.620
So she started filling those out and sure enough,

23:30.620 --> 23:33.020
she got a credit card and then she got two.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.580
And then she got a pre-approval from Ford Motor Credit.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.100
She went and got herself a new car, got approved.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.260
She'd been making the payments ever since.

23:40.260 --> 23:41.580
She has 750 credit scores.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.860
She thought she'd try her hand at buying a house in his name,

23:43.860 --> 23:45.780
in his social security number.

23:45.780 --> 23:50.660
And we caught it and she got a house in that name.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.500
We closed it.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.660
I just was like, wow, this is great.

23:53.660 --> 23:54.980
Can I ask you a question about that?

23:54.980 --> 23:58.820
Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.

23:58.820 --> 23:59.940
Right.

23:59.940 --> 24:04.940
So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical?

24:05.740 --> 24:10.100
Is it like, it's unethical in that it's messing

24:10.140 --> 24:12.340
with the system on which a lot of people rely.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.220
But it feels like there's some aspect of the system

24:16.220 --> 24:18.700
that's broken in that it doesn't give people like her

24:18.700 --> 24:19.820
a second chance.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.900
She could have claimed bankruptcy.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.420
And then two years later, listen, two years out of bankruptcy,

24:24.420 --> 24:26.660
you can go into Bank of America

24:26.660 --> 24:28.380
and get a conventional mortgage.

24:28.380 --> 24:31.460
Assuming you have perfect credit outside the bankruptcy,

24:31.460 --> 24:34.020
you have the down payment, you make enough money.

24:34.020 --> 24:35.980
There's a whole bunch of, you know,

24:35.980 --> 24:38.420
a bunch of underwriting guidelines you have to meet,

24:38.420 --> 24:39.980
but that's possible.

24:40.860 --> 24:41.700
But you're right.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.660
For instance, she wasn't getting an apartment using

24:43.660 --> 24:44.500
with her bad credit.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.820
She wasn't getting her utilities turned on.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.340
She wasn't getting any of those things done.

24:48.340 --> 24:50.380
So getting your life back on track is just harder.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.420
It's extremely hard.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.500
So there's a temptation to take the shortcut

24:53.500 --> 24:56.700
and the shortcut is often going to be illegal.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.820
Right, and she stumbled into it,

24:58.820 --> 25:02.620
but she basically explained it to me.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.900
And I mean, I don't think she had walked out

25:04.900 --> 25:07.900
of my brokerage office before I went

25:07.900 --> 25:09.660
and I just started making up names

25:10.300 --> 25:13.060
and I think I went into our file cabinet

25:13.060 --> 25:16.860
and grabbed some people's 1040s,

25:16.860 --> 25:20.180
which we had, you know, their tax returns

25:20.180 --> 25:23.100
and looked up children's social security numbers

25:23.100 --> 25:25.980
and just grabbed some random kid social security numbers

25:25.980 --> 25:28.260
and their name and went and pulled them.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.940
But I changed their date of birth to be an adult.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.780
Pulled it and sure enough, it came up, no file found.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.860
You know, it didn't say fraud alert or fraud or anything.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.180
They didn't say mismatch this, mismatch that.

25:38.220 --> 25:39.060
It didn't say anything.

25:39.060 --> 25:41.580
It just said, you know, no file found.

25:41.580 --> 25:45.500
Well, then we went and we pulled,

25:45.500 --> 25:47.740
applied for a couple of credit cards

25:47.740 --> 25:50.700
using a child social security number.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.580
And then we went and pulled our own credit report

25:52.580 --> 25:55.980
and sure enough, it didn't say no file found.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.780
It just said that there had been two inquiries

25:58.780 --> 26:00.700
applying for credit cards.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.780
So I was like, wow, like that's a credit profile.

26:04.780 --> 26:09.780
So that turns into me going to social security

26:11.780 --> 26:15.980
and calling social security and trying to get them

26:15.980 --> 26:20.140
to issue me social security numbers to adults

26:20.140 --> 26:23.260
that had never had a social security number issued to them.

26:23.260 --> 26:24.740
I need to get social security number

26:24.740 --> 26:27.700
to give me a clean social security number.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.860
But I called up and of course, you know, I'm a novice.

26:29.860 --> 26:30.700
I don't really know what I'm doing.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.100
So I call up and I say, hey, yeah,

26:33.100 --> 26:36.620
I never had a social security number issued.

26:36.620 --> 26:37.740
And they were like, how old are you?

26:37.740 --> 26:40.380
I was like, I'm 31 years old, you know,

26:40.380 --> 26:42.100
and they were, yeah, that's not possible.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.500
Do you have a driver's license?

26:43.500 --> 26:45.740
Yeah, you have a bank account?

26:45.740 --> 26:48.260
Yeah, you have a social security number.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.620
Bring your driver's license in and we'll pull it up.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.580
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen.

26:51.580 --> 26:53.660
Hang up, call back.

26:53.660 --> 26:58.660
Hi, my son is seven years old or three years old

26:59.660 --> 27:03.780
and he had never had a social security number issued.

27:03.780 --> 27:05.780
Oh, okay, was he born in a hospital?

27:05.780 --> 27:06.980
Yes, well, he has one.

27:06.980 --> 27:07.820
He has one.

27:07.820 --> 27:11.580
Go ahead and get your son, come in here.

27:11.580 --> 27:12.820
No, I'm not doing that.

27:12.820 --> 27:14.100
Hang up, call back.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.460
So I called back probably 10 times

27:18.380 --> 27:23.380
and eventually someone said, I kept altering it.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.380
Kept altering what I was saying

27:26.500 --> 27:29.300
till I got to the point where I was saying,

27:29.300 --> 27:34.300
my son was born with a midwife, not in the hospital

27:35.140 --> 27:40.020
and the pediatrician told us that we needed to go,

27:40.020 --> 27:41.380
we need to get social security

27:41.380 --> 27:43.340
to issue a social security number.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.060
And they would say, well, he should have issued it,

27:46.060 --> 27:48.420
but that does happen sometimes.

27:48.420 --> 27:52.900
So bring your son in and we'll,

27:52.900 --> 27:55.340
you know, you fill out paperwork, we'll have one issued.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.580
You know, first we'll check to see he never had one issued

27:57.580 --> 27:59.100
and if he hasn't, we'll issue one.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.580
And so then it turned into my son is out of the country

28:02.580 --> 28:04.100
and I need this.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.620
And then that turned into, oh, I'm sorry.

28:06.620 --> 28:07.460
Well, how old is he?

28:07.460 --> 28:09.740
I was like, you know, he's three.

28:09.740 --> 28:10.940
And they go, well, I'm sorry.

28:10.940 --> 28:14.580
If he's over the age of 12 months old, he has to come in.

28:14.580 --> 28:15.740
Hang up the phone, call back.

28:15.740 --> 28:18.060
My son is 10 months old.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.020
He's out of the country, born with a midwife,

28:21.020 --> 28:22.780
never had a social security number.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.740
And then they go, oh, okay, that's fine.

28:24.740 --> 28:28.700
Just get his birth certificate and his shop record

28:28.700 --> 28:30.980
and you can come in, fill out the paperwork,

28:30.980 --> 28:33.460
we'll issue you a social security number.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.500
And that's what I did.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.660
So I figured out how to create a birth certificate.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.260
You know, I ordered the security paper, you know,

28:41.260 --> 28:44.940
when you make a copy, it says, you know, void if copied.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.100
So I had to order a bunch of that

28:47.100 --> 28:48.420
and I went online and figured out

28:48.420 --> 28:50.660
how to make a fake birth certificate.

28:50.660 --> 28:54.060
It was great too, cause like the county,

28:54.500 --> 28:56.660
they give you a blank form

28:56.660 --> 28:58.060
and then they actually show you

28:58.060 --> 28:59.700
what it looks like filled out.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.540
Like a handwritten one filled out.

29:01.540 --> 29:05.180
So I knew if he was born this day, he got these shots.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.780
Two months later, he got these shots.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.300
Six months later, he got these shots.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.060
So I just filled it out.

29:10.060 --> 29:13.540
I even had to order a seal.

29:13.540 --> 29:16.420
So you have to have a seal that says like

29:16.420 --> 29:18.380
Hillsborough County vital statistics

29:18.380 --> 29:21.500
or Richland County vital statistics or something.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.420
And I couldn't get anybody to make that.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.020
So I changed it to like Richland County

29:27.020 --> 29:30.540
office of virtual records.

29:30.540 --> 29:34.060
And then I took like 220 grit sandpaper

29:34.060 --> 29:37.860
and hit it over and over and over again to wear it down.

29:37.860 --> 29:42.300
And then I did the embossment on the corner

29:42.300 --> 29:45.300
and I printed it on the security paper, embossed it.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.980
Nobody looks at those things.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.260
You could see Richland County, you know,

29:49.260 --> 29:50.100
you could kind of see that.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.620
And really they just grab it and they go like this.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.180
This is what you realize after you,

29:53.180 --> 29:57.660
when I started getting drivers licenses issued

29:57.660 --> 30:00.700
by the state DMV, right?

30:00.700 --> 30:03.780
The state, I figured out eventually it was easier

30:03.780 --> 30:06.660
to just go into the DMV and have them give me

30:06.660 --> 30:09.620
a driver's license than actually make one.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.980
So, but you notice they would just grab the thing.

30:11.980 --> 30:14.060
They feel the form and go, okay.

30:14.060 --> 30:16.020
Like they don't even look at it.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.100
So which is upsetting if you put as much work

30:18.100 --> 30:20.340
into these documents as I am for them to go, okay.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.180
Yeah, that's good.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.020
Sit over there.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.540
And like, hey bro, like take a look at this.

30:24.540 --> 30:25.660
This is artwork.

30:25.660 --> 30:29.340
Yeah, but they're looking for the low hanging fruit

30:29.340 --> 30:31.220
of crappy fraud.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.580
Right, yeah, this stuff was right there, so.

30:34.540 --> 30:37.060
Okay, so birth certificate gets you

30:37.060 --> 30:39.100
a social security number.

30:39.100 --> 30:42.980
So it's interesting because you've also,

30:42.980 --> 30:44.940
you've done a lot of different approaches

30:44.940 --> 30:49.500
to creating synthetic people.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.860
There's homeless people involved.

30:50.860 --> 30:54.260
So sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names

30:55.180 --> 30:57.740
and then you're, like some part is fake,

30:57.740 --> 30:58.940
some part is real sometimes

30:58.940 --> 31:00.900
and sometimes it's completely all fake.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.580
Right, because now I have the name,

31:02.580 --> 31:03.900
I have the social security number

31:03.900 --> 31:05.740
and what's great is they mail you.

31:05.740 --> 31:06.900
What's even better is you get,

31:06.900 --> 31:09.100
then you get to pick whatever name you want.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.140
You know, because when you pick your child's name,

31:12.140 --> 31:14.300
he doesn't even have to have your last name.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.140
You pick any name.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.780
So I would pick a name and I'd just say,

31:16.780 --> 31:19.660
oh, my wife's last name is this, if they question it,

31:19.660 --> 31:21.020
which they never did.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.700
But, you know, I've got a social security number

31:23.700 --> 31:26.380
and then I would go apply for credit cards

31:26.380 --> 31:27.900
and I'd get denied, of course,

31:27.900 --> 31:31.020
but they would all offer me a secured credit card.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.820
So I'd then fill out the secured credit card

31:33.820 --> 31:36.060
and I'd send them, send the bank the money

31:36.060 --> 31:37.620
and they would give me a secured credit card

31:37.620 --> 31:41.700
for $500, $300, a thousand, whatever it was.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.820
And then once you start making the payments,

31:44.700 --> 31:47.540
I pulled the credit and a credit profile shows up

31:47.540 --> 31:50.180
saying that this 31-year-old man

31:51.180 --> 31:54.220
with the social security number that I know was issued,

31:54.220 --> 31:57.900
you know, a couple months ago, has three credit cards.

31:57.900 --> 31:58.900
They don't even say secured.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.580
They just say, there's like, this credit card is $500.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.980
It was issued by Bank of America.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.100
This one was issued by Capital One.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.780
This one, so I've got three of them,

32:06.780 --> 32:08.420
but I had no credit scores.

32:09.380 --> 32:13.060
So at that point, I kind of kicked back and waited.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.700
I just kept making payments.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.660
And I remember thinking to myself,

32:18.020 --> 32:20.700
I'll bet you they know that the credit bureaus

32:20.700 --> 32:23.540
don't generate credit scores for at least a year.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.220
And I was like, God, this is gonna be a year-long process.

32:26.220 --> 32:28.700
And while that was happening, I started other,

32:28.700 --> 32:30.340
I was starting other ones.

32:30.340 --> 32:31.540
Cause I figured at least in a year,

32:31.540 --> 32:34.700
I'll have a bunch of these secure, you know, these,

32:34.700 --> 32:36.220
we call them like phantom borrowers,

32:36.220 --> 32:39.140
but now they call them synthetic identities.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.820
So at least I would have these synthetic identities

32:41.820 --> 32:43.340
and maybe I'd do something with them.

32:43.340 --> 32:45.180
But what happened was at six months,

32:45.180 --> 32:49.300
I went and I randomly pulled the guy's credit,

32:49.300 --> 32:53.660
you know, the person's credit and they had 705 credit scores.

32:53.660 --> 32:56.340
705, 701, 695.

32:56.340 --> 33:00.340
I was like, oh my God, you only needed a 620 to borrow,

33:00.340 --> 33:03.700
to get a 95% loan from the bank.

33:03.700 --> 33:08.540
So I was like, oh my God, this is amazing.

33:08.540 --> 33:09.700
Sure enough, a month later,

33:09.700 --> 33:13.300
the other ones I had started, all of them, bam, bam, bam.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.300
So what do you do with a phantom borrower?

33:15.300 --> 33:17.660
Like what, how do you make money on this?

33:17.660 --> 33:21.180
So I think most people,

33:21.180 --> 33:23.860
if you were just like a scam or a fraudster,

33:23.860 --> 33:28.580
you would probably just get credit cards

33:28.580 --> 33:30.700
and maybe build up that history

33:30.700 --> 33:33.620
or maybe try and borrow a personal loan,

33:33.620 --> 33:36.060
which is limited, you know, it's personal loans are,

33:36.060 --> 33:41.060
used to be, you could go to an FDIC insured bank,

33:41.820 --> 33:42.660
which borrows money.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.900
Those, you know, the personal loans,

33:45.900 --> 33:50.020
they lend out at the max $15,000, you know.

33:50.020 --> 33:52.380
So you could do that.

33:52.380 --> 33:53.660
So you can go through this whole process

33:53.660 --> 33:56.340
of creating a fake identity, getting a card, paying it off,

33:56.340 --> 33:57.180
building up credit,

33:57.180 --> 33:59.300
and then you get $15,000 at the end or something.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.900
Right, you get 15, maybe, you know,

34:00.900 --> 34:02.300
if you want to keep making the payments, you know,

34:02.300 --> 34:06.220
if you could wait a year, you could probably get 15,000,

34:06.220 --> 34:08.580
maybe, you could maybe get 20, 30,000

34:08.580 --> 34:10.220
and a bunch of little smaller ones, you know,

34:11.100 --> 34:14.460
because I did, there was a $7,500 from Citibank,

34:14.460 --> 34:16.940
you know, $5,500 from American General.

34:16.940 --> 34:20.020
So you maybe get what, 25,000, you know,

34:20.020 --> 34:22.260
maybe 30,000 in personal loans.

34:22.260 --> 34:25.900
Maybe you can, you could then apply for,

34:25.900 --> 34:29.420
you maybe get another 20 or 30,000 in regular credit cards,

34:29.420 --> 34:32.340
you know, 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.860
And then you go to the lower department store cards

34:34.860 --> 34:37.540
and you go to Home Depot, you get 1,000, you get 500.

34:37.540 --> 34:40.740
So it ends up being maybe you can get 50, 60,000,

34:40.740 --> 34:41.900
maybe if you're really good,

34:41.900 --> 34:44.380
you could get up to 80 or $100,000

34:44.380 --> 34:46.340
in credit cards and personal loans.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.140
If you really knew what you were doing, but-

34:49.140 --> 34:50.300
Per person, per identity.

34:50.300 --> 34:53.140
Per identity, but I had the ability to,

34:54.500 --> 34:56.580
to leverage that perfect,

34:56.580 --> 35:00.180
those perfect credit profiles against properties.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.020
And I mean, ultimately that's what I ended up doing.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.460
And so each one of those identities was worth

35:07.900 --> 35:09.100
a few million.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.900
Can you explain how that works

35:10.900 --> 35:12.580
to leverage them against property?

35:12.580 --> 35:14.100
So how does that work with a mortgage?

35:14.100 --> 35:16.980
So what I did eventually,

35:16.980 --> 35:18.980
I mean, this was like, is down the road,

35:18.980 --> 35:21.740
but you know, I mean, at this point,

35:21.740 --> 35:22.980
when things are just,

35:22.980 --> 35:25.500
my whole life had kind of gone off the rails,

35:26.340 --> 35:27.700
I was on federal probation.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.180
And so what I did decide what I was gonna do

35:30.180 --> 35:32.940
was start running a scam, a much larger scam.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.900
And what I was going to do was,

35:36.660 --> 35:38.980
I was gonna start flipping properties, right?

35:38.980 --> 35:41.580
Like buy houses cheap, fix them up and sell them.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.860
There's an area of Tampa called Ebor City.

35:45.660 --> 35:49.660
So I was gonna start flipping houses in Ebor City.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.900
And you know, I thought, okay,

35:52.860 --> 35:54.540
I can buy these houses for,

35:54.540 --> 35:56.580
you could buy a really crappy house at that time

35:56.580 --> 35:59.740
for 50, $60,000, let's say 50.

35:59.740 --> 36:03.580
And then you could put $25,000 into it in renovations.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.820
You could renovate it for 25.

36:04.820 --> 36:07.780
And maybe you could get an appraisal for a hundred.

36:09.380 --> 36:13.220
So I thought what I could do is,

36:13.220 --> 36:18.220
I can buy these houses,

36:18.260 --> 36:21.900
renovate them and sell them to regular people.

36:23.980 --> 36:27.340
But I also had been working on the synthetic identities.

36:27.340 --> 36:28.340
And then I thought, well,

36:28.340 --> 36:30.900
or I could just sell them to synthetic identities.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.780
And then I wouldn't have to dump 25,000 into it, right?

36:33.820 --> 36:34.900
And these guys are perfect.

36:34.900 --> 36:35.820
They have perfect credit.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.620
I can provide W-2s and pay stubs

36:37.620 --> 36:42.620
because by this point, I'm manufacturing businesses.

36:43.100 --> 36:46.860
So I've incorporated businesses.

36:46.860 --> 36:49.900
I've got websites for the businesses, W-2s, pay stubs.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.900
So these guys look perfect.

36:51.900 --> 36:55.380
So I figured I'll buy these properties for 50,000,

36:55.380 --> 36:56.740
sell to these guys for a hundred.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.540
Maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000.

36:58.540 --> 37:00.940
I don't really have to do anything.

37:00.940 --> 37:02.740
But that seemed short-sighted.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.220
So I thought what'd be even better

37:04.220 --> 37:06.540
is that if I did a little bit of renovations

37:06.540 --> 37:08.620
and then I sold it for much higher,

37:08.620 --> 37:11.140
maybe I put 10,000, clean up the outside of it

37:11.140 --> 37:11.980
because these guys don't care

37:11.980 --> 37:13.900
what the inside of the property looks like.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.940
You know, they don't exist.

37:15.940 --> 37:18.500
So, and then I, but I can't,

37:18.500 --> 37:21.340
how am I gonna get an appraisal for a hundred thousand dollars?

37:22.660 --> 37:25.220
Well, do you know how appraisals work?

37:25.220 --> 37:29.140
Okay, so the bank sends an appraiser out

37:29.140 --> 37:32.500
or at that time you could provide an appraisal.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.980
They can review it.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.780
So they'll do what's called a desktop review.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.020
They review it.

37:37.020 --> 37:40.780
They review it on the computer.

37:40.780 --> 37:41.900
They never go out to the property

37:41.900 --> 37:43.420
or they send someone out.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.820
They call that, you know, it's like a field review.

37:45.820 --> 37:48.420
They send someone out and they just look at the house.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.260
They don't go in it though.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.220
So I have to clean up the outside of the house.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.340
So what I did was, but the problem is,

37:55.340 --> 37:57.940
if your house is, you're trying to sell that house

37:57.940 --> 38:01.020
for let's say 200,000, the other houses,

38:01.020 --> 38:05.140
they have to pick three comparable sales in the area

38:05.140 --> 38:10.140
that are also going to support a $200,000 sales price.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.220
Well, there's no other house is selling

38:13.220 --> 38:15.540
for 200,000 near this house.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.420
So I thought if I wanna get these things appraised

38:18.420 --> 38:23.420
for 200, 250,000, I have to have comparable sales

38:23.860 --> 38:26.260
and that appraisal is going to be reviewed.

38:27.260 --> 38:30.980
So what I did was I started, I went out

38:30.980 --> 38:34.340
and I bought this house for 50,000

38:34.340 --> 38:39.340
and I recorded the sale at 200,000.

38:40.940 --> 38:43.020
So when you buy a house for $100,000,

38:43.020 --> 38:45.140
you pay $700 in doc stamps.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.740
But if you pay an extra 700 bucks,

38:48.740 --> 38:50.820
the sale shows up for 200,000.

38:51.940 --> 38:54.940
I'm buying these things for 50, so I'm paying $350.

38:55.100 --> 39:00.100
And I'm just paying an extra $1,050.

39:01.180 --> 39:05.260
So it ends up being $1,400,

39:05.260 --> 39:07.100
but the sale shows up at 200,000

39:07.100 --> 39:11.260
on a house that's a crack house I bought for $50,000.

39:11.260 --> 39:14.500
Now I go, I trim the trees, we mow the yard,

39:14.500 --> 39:17.540
we clean up the porch, we put the porch rail on maybe,

39:17.540 --> 39:21.660
we paint it real nice, we black out all the windows,

39:21.660 --> 39:24.660
you can't see inside, but from the curb,

39:25.580 --> 39:26.420
it looks great.

39:26.420 --> 39:28.940
And I get an appraisal, so I do that with that house,

39:28.940 --> 39:31.340
I do that with another house, all within a mile.

39:31.340 --> 39:35.380
So I buy four houses knowing I could use the all,

39:35.380 --> 39:38.060
there's a subject and three comparables for all of them.

39:38.060 --> 39:40.300
So the first thing I did is I bought four houses

39:40.300 --> 39:43.260
for 50,000, 60,000, 40,000.

39:43.260 --> 39:48.260
And I recorded the values at 210, 200, 190.

39:49.020 --> 39:52.940
So I get an appraiser to come out there, he appraises it.

39:52.940 --> 39:54.500
He said, of course he says it's horrible,

39:54.500 --> 39:56.020
but there's comparables here.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.460
Now, of course it is in bad shape

39:57.460 --> 39:58.740
and he says it's in bad shape,

39:58.740 --> 40:01.580
but I go ahead and I correct all that.

40:01.580 --> 40:02.420
So I correct it.

40:02.420 --> 40:04.980
So now if you review the appraisal

40:04.980 --> 40:07.460
and you're in California,

40:07.460 --> 40:10.100
or even if you drive your car down,

40:10.100 --> 40:11.980
the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it

40:11.980 --> 40:14.820
from the street, it looks fine.

40:14.820 --> 40:17.940
But the truth is I've got $60,000 into this property

40:17.940 --> 40:20.180
and you're appraising it for 200,000.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.540
So the bank's rated, they're not gonna lend 200,

40:22.540 --> 40:25.020
but they'll lend 190.

40:25.020 --> 40:30.020
So the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower

40:31.300 --> 40:35.700
$190,000 on a house that I have 60,000 in.

40:35.700 --> 40:40.700
So I schedule a closing and we close on the house

40:42.820 --> 40:44.900
and I walk away with $60,000.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.820
And the thing is like, the problem was

40:49.820 --> 40:51.820
is by the time I got to this point,

40:51.820 --> 40:54.420
I knew so many people in the industry.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.380
Nobody had to really at that point show up,

40:56.380 --> 40:57.740
although I've had people show up

40:57.740 --> 41:00.220
for the synthetic identities and sign for them.

41:00.220 --> 41:03.740
Almost all the closings, nobody ever showed up.

41:03.740 --> 41:07.460
I just showed up and said to the title agency

41:07.460 --> 41:10.100
and said, hey, my borrower, he's at work right now.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.300
He can't make it.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.580
Can I just take the file and I'll have him sign

41:14.580 --> 41:17.660
all the documents at his work and I'll bring them back.

41:17.660 --> 41:19.700
He's like an hour and a half away from here.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.820
I'll be back in two or three hours.

41:20.820 --> 41:24.220
They're like, oh, wow, man, Matt, thank you so much.

41:25.140 --> 41:25.980
And they would give it to me

41:25.980 --> 41:27.140
and I'd go sit in the parking lot

41:27.140 --> 41:28.340
and I'd sign all the documents.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.740
I'd wait an hour or two and I'd come back in

41:30.740 --> 41:32.580
and say, here you go.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.580
How are we able to keep all of this in your mind?

41:34.580 --> 41:36.020
Because you have to not slip up

41:36.020 --> 41:37.780
in any of these conversations.

41:37.780 --> 41:42.580
It's pretty easy for me to keep them,

41:44.460 --> 41:47.260
everything in the correct category.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.100
Does that make sense?

41:48.100 --> 41:51.100
It's, I'm not great at a lot of things,

41:51.100 --> 41:53.740
but this I was very good at.

41:53.740 --> 41:56.780
There's these phantom people that exist

41:56.780 --> 42:01.060
and they were becoming real people in your mind.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.860
Isn't like you're able to tell good stories

42:02.860 --> 42:04.300
with those people, right?

42:05.420 --> 42:06.780
Because if you're talking to the appraiser,

42:06.780 --> 42:09.940
if you're talking to everybody involved.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.060
Well, keep in mind, the appraiser

42:11.060 --> 42:13.260
almost never meets the borrower, never.

42:13.260 --> 42:16.420
Not even almost like 99.99% of the time,

42:16.420 --> 42:17.380
they never meet him.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.380
But you have to talk about them.

42:19.380 --> 42:20.940
Yeah.

42:20.940 --> 42:22.260
I guess what I'm asking is you're able

42:22.260 --> 42:26.620
to converse fluently about these synthetic identities.

42:26.620 --> 42:29.060
Yeah, they all had different jobs.

42:29.060 --> 42:31.500
They all had, all the jobs were basically,

42:31.500 --> 42:33.100
they were all on the job for five years.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.220
They were all, a lot of it was-

42:34.220 --> 42:35.660
Sure, there's a template.

42:35.660 --> 42:37.500
Yeah, exactly.

42:37.500 --> 42:38.340
But-

42:38.340 --> 42:39.180
Yeah, got it.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.140
Listen, matter of fact,

42:40.140 --> 42:43.060
almost every one of them had the same birthdate, you know?

42:43.060 --> 42:45.260
So, because I, you know, who knows?

42:46.260 --> 42:49.740
There's, so, yeah, it wasn't difficult.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.780
And keep in mind, a lot of the brokers

42:51.780 --> 42:53.940
barely ever meet the borrower.

42:53.940 --> 42:55.900
They call in on the phone, but it didn't matter anyway,

42:55.900 --> 42:57.300
because I'm walking in saying,

42:57.300 --> 42:59.500
I got a slam dunk deal for you.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.820
And they're like, oh, wow, Matt,

43:00.820 --> 43:02.340
you got the W-2s, the pay stubs,

43:02.340 --> 43:05.180
you've got all the, you got all their rental history.

43:05.180 --> 43:06.420
You have everything done.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.260
It's perfect.

43:07.260 --> 43:08.300
Thank you so much.

43:08.300 --> 43:09.540
They're happy to do it.

43:09.540 --> 43:12.140
Hey, I print up the docs and I'll have them go sign it.

43:12.140 --> 43:14.380
Great, wow, thank you.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.620
You know, assuming they didn't already know about it,

43:16.620 --> 43:18.260
and almost everybody involved in this,

43:18.260 --> 43:20.020
by the time I was done, was involved.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.980
There was probably 15 or 20 people

43:21.980 --> 43:23.780
that all knew what was going on.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.780
The full of it.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.100
They knew the full depth of it.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.340
Yes.

43:27.340 --> 43:30.180
Yeah, maybe not 100% everything,

43:30.180 --> 43:32.420
but they definitely knew this is fraud.

43:32.420 --> 43:34.460
And they were still going along with it.

43:34.460 --> 43:35.860
Yeah, yeah.

43:36.780 --> 43:40.300
Keep in mind that, even when,

43:40.300 --> 43:41.940
I'll give you an example.

43:42.820 --> 43:46.100
One of my, you know, let's say,

43:46.100 --> 43:48.260
and this happened with almost all of them,

43:48.260 --> 43:51.020
was he would buy five houses.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.460
So the guy bought, what happens,

43:53.460 --> 43:57.260
the basic design was, I buy the houses,

43:58.300 --> 43:59.940
I record the values higher,

44:00.940 --> 44:05.940
and this person buys all five houses, refinances them.

44:06.380 --> 44:08.180
He ends up borrowing a little bit

44:08.180 --> 44:10.300
over a million dollars in his name.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.500
Then, of course, then I go and I get

44:15.060 --> 44:17.100
personal loans from several banks.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.420
I get credit cards.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.060
I run up all of his credit cards.

44:20.060 --> 44:22.100
By this point, I've got $10,000, $20,000

44:22.100 --> 44:23.540
worth of credit cards in the guy's name.

44:23.540 --> 44:27.300
So the guys are all worth like a million, million and change.

44:27.300 --> 44:30.540
Well, once I stopped paying,

44:30.540 --> 44:33.140
you start getting letters from the collection companies,

44:33.140 --> 44:34.100
right, from the banks, you know,

44:34.100 --> 44:34.940
and then they sell them off.

44:34.940 --> 44:37.860
So after about three months, you're getting tons of letters.

44:37.860 --> 44:42.460
What I would do is I would take my borrower's name,

44:42.460 --> 44:44.940
I would go online and I would find,

44:44.940 --> 44:47.500
or I'd go in the newspaper and I would find,

44:48.580 --> 44:50.140
I would find an article about, let's say,

44:50.140 --> 44:52.660
like a 12-car pileup, you know,

44:52.660 --> 44:55.420
so there's a huge accident on I-4.

44:55.420 --> 44:56.620
It's very dangerous.

44:56.620 --> 45:00.500
So there's a 12-car pileup and someone in the accident

45:00.500 --> 45:04.460
was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.900
I would cut and paste that article

45:08.980 --> 45:13.300
and I would just insert my borrower's name into the article

45:13.300 --> 45:16.420
saying that, you know, Brandon Green was life flighted

45:16.420 --> 45:17.460
to Tampa General Hospital,

45:17.460 --> 45:19.180
is currently in critical condition.

45:19.180 --> 45:23.180
I would then print that article out on newsprint

45:23.180 --> 45:25.100
and then make a copy of the, cut it up,

45:25.100 --> 45:27.340
make a copy of the newsprint, highlight his name

45:27.340 --> 45:31.180
and I would write a letter from Brandon Green's

45:31.180 --> 45:34.620
fictional sister to the collection companies

45:34.620 --> 45:36.900
saying several months ago,

45:36.900 --> 45:39.900
my brother was in a horrible car accident.

45:39.900 --> 45:42.180
He is currently, they've got the article,

45:42.180 --> 45:43.340
they have the highlighted name.

45:43.340 --> 45:46.660
He clearly was in this accident.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.140
He is currently in a coma and the doctors say,

45:49.140 --> 45:53.660
even if he wakes up from the coma, he will never work again.

45:53.660 --> 45:56.460
That, you know, so you might as well just foreclose on,

45:56.460 --> 45:59.140
stop writing those letters and take the houses back.

45:59.180 --> 46:02.660
And that's all they're looking for is a reason.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.420
At this point, even if they look into Brandon Green,

46:06.420 --> 46:08.940
they can't figure out if he's a real person or not

46:10.620 --> 46:12.020
because he's got a social security number.

46:12.020 --> 46:14.700
He's got, and everything went bad at the same time.

46:14.700 --> 46:18.900
He's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence.

46:18.900 --> 46:20.220
All of his credit cards went bad.

46:20.220 --> 46:21.060
Everything went bad.

46:21.060 --> 46:24.020
We have an excuse, we have a letter, that happens.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.820
People get divorced, they lose their job,

46:25.820 --> 46:27.900
they get in accidents, it's reasonable.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.140
When they look into it, all looks legitimate.

46:30.140 --> 46:32.540
Even if they ordered another appraisal,

46:32.540 --> 46:34.900
by this point, it's not four comparable sales

46:34.900 --> 46:36.140
or three or four comparable sales.

46:36.140 --> 46:39.700
By this point, it's like 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50,

46:39.700 --> 46:43.060
because I kept making more and more of these guys.

46:43.060 --> 46:45.460
What was your, just almost like a tangent,

46:45.460 --> 46:47.420
what's your thinking process?

46:47.420 --> 46:49.540
There's a lot of cleverness going on here.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.380
So like the car pile up as a solution,

46:53.380 --> 46:55.020
the newspaper and you mail it.

46:56.020 --> 47:00.140
Are you sitting there alone and thinking through this?

47:00.140 --> 47:01.740
Like how do you come up with that idea?

47:01.740 --> 47:05.420
It's a very interesting, a very clever, innovative idea.

47:05.420 --> 47:08.300
So at first I thought about making

47:08.300 --> 47:10.660
like a fake death certificate.

47:10.660 --> 47:13.420
He died, you know, but I thought, I don't know.

47:13.420 --> 47:16.620
Like what if, you know, like some of these places

47:16.620 --> 47:19.740
had like, you know, primary mortgage insurance.

47:19.740 --> 47:21.460
Like what if the primary mortgage insurance,

47:21.460 --> 47:23.580
like what if they try and claim because he was dead?

47:23.620 --> 47:25.740
Like, I don't know, I don't know that side.

47:25.740 --> 47:28.020
So I'm like, I don't want to do that.

47:28.020 --> 47:29.980
I want to do something that's semi-verifiable

47:29.980 --> 47:32.100
and third party, it's like a third party telling you

47:32.100 --> 47:32.940
this is what happened.

47:32.940 --> 47:36.140
I thought, well, like the newspaper, you know,

47:36.140 --> 47:39.380
and you know, or do I claim bankruptcy?

47:39.380 --> 47:42.500
And I've done that, I've gone and got the bankruptcy forms.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.180
Right, you can go to the bankruptcy court

47:44.180 --> 47:47.940
and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors

47:47.940 --> 47:49.820
and you mail them, they stop contacting you.

47:49.820 --> 47:53.260
They wait to be located by or notified

47:53.260 --> 47:55.300
by the bankruptcy court.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.340
But my fear there is, you know,

47:57.340 --> 47:58.860
nobody's ever going to notify them.

47:58.860 --> 48:00.260
Like I'm not going through bankruptcy

48:00.260 --> 48:01.700
for one of these guys.

48:01.700 --> 48:04.300
So it was like, this is a better bet

48:04.300 --> 48:06.580
than just writing a letter saying,

48:06.580 --> 48:08.660
I'm going through a divorce,

48:08.660 --> 48:10.940
my wife's keeping those houses, that's her problem.

48:10.940 --> 48:12.380
You know, you could, there's lots of things you could do,

48:12.380 --> 48:14.660
but to me, this was, they're not going to try and,

48:14.660 --> 48:18.500
how do you shut it down without him dying?

48:18.500 --> 48:19.660
How do you shut that down?

48:20.500 --> 48:21.340
This is how you shut it down.

48:21.340 --> 48:23.140
He's in a coma, he'll never work again.

48:24.140 --> 48:25.500
He was in a car accident.

48:25.500 --> 48:26.660
Here's the proof.

48:26.660 --> 48:28.740
He can't even write you, I'm his sister.

48:28.740 --> 48:29.740
I wrote you the letter.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.940
It's a one-time letter that seems to tie up all the sends.

48:32.940 --> 48:34.900
Exactly, exactly.

48:35.860 --> 48:38.180
You know, I don't know exactly how that,

48:39.300 --> 48:42.980
you know, what sparked that as much as

48:42.980 --> 48:45.260
there were so many other avenues that I could have gone

48:45.260 --> 48:46.620
that I was, I just didn't know.

48:46.620 --> 48:48.460
But you were thinking through all those different avenues.

48:48.460 --> 48:49.300
Yeah.

48:49.300 --> 48:51.180
What were you thinking alone?

48:51.180 --> 48:54.940
I mean, you know, I had guys that I was bouncing ideas off of.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.780
There were other guys that were involved in the scam.

48:57.780 --> 49:02.100
You know, everybody, I think that scam ended up making like,

49:02.100 --> 49:05.340
the FBI said, I think it was like 11 and a half million

49:05.340 --> 49:08.820
or something, and you know,

49:08.820 --> 49:11.460
but there were so many other people that were involved

49:11.460 --> 49:13.500
in that scam that were, you know, this guy's getting 50,

49:13.500 --> 49:17.580
this guy's getting 20, you know, 17,000, 20,000, 25,000.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.780
We're just doing it constantly.

49:19.780 --> 49:22.540
And so the bank would foreclose on that property.

49:22.540 --> 49:23.660
They'd take it back.

49:24.540 --> 49:27.020
They'd put it back on the MLS.

49:27.020 --> 49:29.900
They put it back on the MLS for 100, for 200,000,

49:29.900 --> 49:31.100
it wouldn't sell.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.460
Then they drop it to, you know, 150, wouldn't sell.

49:33.460 --> 49:36.340
Then they drop it to 125, 130, wouldn't sell.

49:36.340 --> 49:38.580
They drop it to 90 and somebody buy it for like 90.

49:38.580 --> 49:40.260
It wasn't worth 90.

49:40.260 --> 49:42.420
But by that point, that whole area had,

49:42.420 --> 49:45.300
we'd done so many houses at that point,

49:45.300 --> 49:47.340
the whole area shot up.

49:47.820 --> 49:50.540
The FBI said we did 109 houses.

49:50.540 --> 49:51.820
I don't think that's true.

49:51.820 --> 49:56.820
But we, when I ended up leaving Tampa

49:57.220 --> 50:00.340
after that scam falls apart and the FBI shows up,

50:00.340 --> 50:03.660
Forbes came out with an article, whatever, six months later,

50:03.660 --> 50:08.660
and they said that the Ybor City zip code

50:09.580 --> 50:13.500
was one of the top 20 fastest growing zip,

50:13.500 --> 50:16.380
appraising areas in the country.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.620
And everybody was like, oh, that's mad

50:18.620 --> 50:19.780
because this place is a dump.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.100
Like this is a horrible place.

50:21.100 --> 50:23.700
Like this is, and I remember one time I had talked

50:23.700 --> 50:25.740
to a guy years later and he was like,

50:25.740 --> 50:28.180
oh, all the comparable sales have dried up.

50:28.180 --> 50:29.340
Like when you left,

50:29.340 --> 50:32.180
there was just nothing even close to 200,000.

50:33.660 --> 50:36.660
You mentioned right before telling the story

50:36.660 --> 50:39.580
of this elaborate scam that you were on federal probation.

50:39.580 --> 50:41.060
How did that happen?

50:41.060 --> 50:43.980
So I mentioned that I own the mortgage company, right?

50:43.980 --> 50:45.620
So I had started a mortgage company.

50:45.620 --> 50:48.260
I had maybe a dozen guys working for me.

50:48.260 --> 50:50.620
And there was fraud.

50:50.620 --> 50:53.660
Like I would say, it wasn't all fraud, but whatever,

50:53.660 --> 50:57.260
60, 70% of it was fraud that was going in there.

50:57.260 --> 50:59.540
And from the outside of that business,

50:59.540 --> 51:01.140
it looked very legitimate.

51:02.460 --> 51:03.860
We were an FHA approved lender.

51:03.860 --> 51:05.380
We were a VA approved lender.

51:05.380 --> 51:07.220
We did conventional,

51:07.220 --> 51:10.020
probably signed up with 40 or 50 subprime lenders.

51:12.660 --> 51:14.780
But there was a considerable amount of fraud.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.460
And it kept getting,

51:18.620 --> 51:20.740
it became a game, right?

51:23.580 --> 51:25.620
I started getting just more and more creative.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.340
Like I said, every time I would get away with something,

51:27.340 --> 51:28.940
like you become emboldened by it.

51:28.940 --> 51:31.780
It's like, nice, like, hey, the underwriter's looking

51:31.780 --> 51:32.780
for this and looking for this.

51:32.780 --> 51:34.540
And you sit there and go,

51:34.540 --> 51:38.020
man, so that she, that's, what am I gonna do?

51:38.020 --> 51:39.020
You know what we could do?

51:39.020 --> 51:41.940
We could create our own bank.

51:41.940 --> 51:42.780
What?

51:42.780 --> 51:43.820
Yeah, here's what we're gonna do.

51:43.820 --> 51:44.660
We're gonna go on,

51:44.660 --> 51:46.380
like, how do they know if this bank exists?

51:46.380 --> 51:47.580
These people are in California.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.420
They're in New York.

51:48.420 --> 51:49.500
Like, they don't know.

51:49.500 --> 51:53.780
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go online.

51:53.780 --> 51:56.340
And keep in mind, this is 2000.

51:56.340 --> 51:58.660
You know, this is 2000, 2001.

51:58.660 --> 52:03.660
Like this is the internet's in its infancy still, right?

52:04.140 --> 52:07.820
So we figure out, I remember GoDaddy, I think,

52:07.820 --> 52:08.780
had just come up with a site

52:08.780 --> 52:10.180
where you could build your own website.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.140
Like, how cool is that?

52:11.140 --> 52:13.780
So I go online with a buddy of mine

52:14.780 --> 52:17.100
and we create something called the Bank of Ebor.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.900
You know, we cut and pasted things

52:18.900 --> 52:21.020
that we liked from other banks.

52:21.020 --> 52:24.460
And we got a 1-800 number you could call

52:24.460 --> 52:26.060
or a 1-86 number, whatever it was.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.540
And you could call it and it would go to a voicemail.

52:28.540 --> 52:29.500
And so we set up this bank.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.460
And then I ended up making bank statements,

52:31.460 --> 52:32.580
which by this point,

52:32.580 --> 52:34.820
I already had been making bank statements

52:34.820 --> 52:38.020
to prove someone has their down payment.

52:38.020 --> 52:39.340
Because a lot of times people,

52:39.340 --> 52:42.940
they have good enough credit to borrow 95% or 90%,

52:42.940 --> 52:44.540
but they don't have their down payment.

52:44.540 --> 52:47.420
So we'd raise the purchase price high enough

52:47.420 --> 52:50.140
to cover their five or 10% down payment.

52:50.140 --> 52:54.460
And we would bring their down payment for them,

52:54.460 --> 52:57.140
or we'd have the owner of the house

52:57.140 --> 52:58.940
bring the down payment for them.

52:58.940 --> 53:01.380
And then we would have a check cut

53:01.380 --> 53:03.300
out of the closing statement

53:03.300 --> 53:07.420
to a construction company that I owned.

53:07.420 --> 53:08.820
And we get our money back.

53:08.820 --> 53:11.380
So they get into the house for 100% financing

53:11.380 --> 53:14.140
or 110%, some of them turned into 130.

53:14.140 --> 53:15.620
We want to pay off their car,

53:15.620 --> 53:17.220
give them an incentive to sign.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.700
They still don't have the money to buy it.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.900
So we're doing all kinds of insane things.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.540
Well, at some point,

53:26.580 --> 53:31.580
remember Gretchen Zayas, my old manager?

53:32.100 --> 53:33.060
Yeah, the original.

53:33.060 --> 53:33.900
Yes.

53:33.900 --> 53:34.740
The OG.

53:34.740 --> 53:37.660
She came and worked for me for a short period of time.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.660
And then she and her husband went

53:40.660 --> 53:43.780
and opened their own mortgage company,

53:43.780 --> 53:45.980
which you should have known it was gonna be fraudulent

53:45.980 --> 53:46.820
from the get go,

53:46.820 --> 53:48.740
because it was called Creative Financing.

53:48.740 --> 53:53.020
It was, yeah, CFM, Creative Finance.

53:53.020 --> 53:54.700
No, Creative.

53:54.700 --> 53:55.540
Creative was in the name.

53:55.540 --> 53:57.500
Yeah, yeah, Creative was in the name.

53:57.500 --> 53:58.700
Oh, boy.

53:58.700 --> 53:59.700
So.

53:59.700 --> 54:00.740
It's really on the nose.

54:00.740 --> 54:04.540
So she's doing very well.

54:05.460 --> 54:07.460
And we became very close, by the way.

54:08.460 --> 54:12.460
We'd go on vacation, went to Puerto Rico together.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.060
I got married at the time.

54:14.060 --> 54:15.860
I was married.

54:15.860 --> 54:17.740
Our kids play together.

54:17.740 --> 54:18.820
We babysit.

54:18.820 --> 54:19.980
We go to each other's parties.

54:19.980 --> 54:20.820
We're close.

54:20.820 --> 54:21.820
We're good friends.

54:21.820 --> 54:23.780
And she's got her own mortgage company.

54:23.780 --> 54:25.220
She calls me up periodically and asks me,

54:25.220 --> 54:26.500
hey, can you make a W-2?

54:26.500 --> 54:27.820
Or hey, can you make me a pay stub?

54:27.820 --> 54:29.020
Sure, no problem.

54:29.020 --> 54:30.060
We're friends.

54:30.060 --> 54:31.940
That's what fraudulent friends do.

54:31.940 --> 54:36.060
So, if I needed somebody to verify rent

54:36.220 --> 54:41.060
or verify somebody's rental history or employment,

54:41.060 --> 54:42.940
she had cell phones she would answer,

54:42.940 --> 54:45.060
that sort of thing for me.

54:45.060 --> 54:48.060
Well, what ends up happening is

54:52.460 --> 54:54.060
she gets in trouble.

54:54.060 --> 54:58.780
She starts doing fraudulent loans for some guys, you know.

54:59.700 --> 55:04.700
And these guys are doing what's called a cash back scam.

55:05.660 --> 55:08.700
So, they're getting like a half a million dollar loan

55:10.220 --> 55:15.220
on a house that's worth $300,000.

55:15.220 --> 55:18.500
So, they're buying the house for, whatever, 600,000.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.420
It's really only worth 300, 350.

55:21.620 --> 55:22.980
But she happened to be in an area

55:22.980 --> 55:25.300
where she could get the appraisal jacked up.

55:25.300 --> 55:28.020
So, they buy the house.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.460
They get two, $300,000 back.

55:31.460 --> 55:34.460
And it's a straw man scam, right?

55:34.460 --> 55:36.020
It's a cash back, straw man scam.

55:36.020 --> 55:37.980
So, it's a real person that's buying the house.

55:37.980 --> 55:39.020
He's got perfect credit,

55:39.020 --> 55:42.260
but he's willing to let to ruin his credit

55:42.260 --> 55:44.460
to get a couple hundred thousand in his pocket.

55:44.460 --> 55:46.460
So, he never has any intentions.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.020
So, it's not a synthetic identity.

55:48.020 --> 55:48.860
It's not a stolen identity.

55:48.860 --> 55:49.780
It's a straw man.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.740
He's a fake, kind of a, not a fake person,

55:51.740 --> 55:52.580
but he's just a straw man.

55:52.580 --> 55:53.420
He's a stand-in.

55:53.420 --> 55:56.740
So, he stands in, he signs a paperwork, he buys the house.

55:56.740 --> 55:58.220
They end up getting two, 300,000.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.620
Well, this guy buys like five houses.

56:00.620 --> 56:02.820
So, it's two, $3 million.

56:02.820 --> 56:07.300
They've lost six, $700,000.

56:07.300 --> 56:10.180
And these guys never even make the first payment.

56:10.180 --> 56:11.620
They just let them go in a foreclosure.

56:11.620 --> 56:13.300
So, the bank immediately investigates

56:13.300 --> 56:15.140
and realizes this is fraud.

56:15.140 --> 56:18.580
So, the FBI comes in, they grab Pete and Gretchen.

56:18.580 --> 56:20.860
She has to hire an attorney, of course.

56:20.860 --> 56:22.380
And she doesn't get thrown in jail or anything.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.580
They just come to their office

56:23.580 --> 56:25.540
and they tell them they're investigating them.

56:25.540 --> 56:26.380
They know what's going on.

56:26.380 --> 56:27.700
And they wanna talk to, they're like,

56:27.700 --> 56:28.940
well, look, we wanna talk to you

56:28.940 --> 56:30.660
and you're going to be indicted.

56:30.660 --> 56:31.500
Okay.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.140
So, she comes to me, well, actually,

56:33.140 --> 56:33.980
Pete came to me and said,

56:33.980 --> 56:35.300
look, man, can you refinance our house

56:35.300 --> 56:38.260
and get us 75,000 out to pay our attorney?

56:38.260 --> 56:39.220
I said, no problem.

56:41.540 --> 56:44.460
Gretchen gives me W-2s, pay subs, fake.

56:44.460 --> 56:45.500
The whole thing's fake.

56:45.500 --> 56:48.500
I refinance, I get a second mortgage on our house,

56:48.500 --> 56:51.060
$75,000, they pay their attorney.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.780
Their attorney immediately says,

56:53.780 --> 56:55.660
you need to wear a wire on this guy.

56:56.660 --> 56:58.780
Like, he just got you $75,000.

56:58.780 --> 57:00.860
I don't know how you got $75,000.

57:00.860 --> 57:01.940
The attorney knows something's wrong

57:01.940 --> 57:03.100
because the attorney's like,

57:03.100 --> 57:05.100
your whole mortgage company was just shut down.

57:05.100 --> 57:07.900
There's no way you could borrow $75,000.

57:07.900 --> 57:10.020
So, he's like, this guy's doing fraudulent stuff.

57:10.020 --> 57:11.420
And she says, yes, of course he is.

57:11.420 --> 57:13.420
And he says, you need to work with the FBI,

57:13.420 --> 57:14.900
wear a wire against this guy.

57:16.340 --> 57:17.860
So, she calls me one day and says,

57:17.860 --> 57:18.740
listen, I gotta talk to you.

57:18.740 --> 57:20.180
The FBI is asking questions about you.

57:20.180 --> 57:21.020
And I go, what?

57:21.020 --> 57:22.060
And she goes, yeah.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.980
I was like, meet me at the pizza place down the street.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.620
So, don't come into my office

57:26.620 --> 57:28.020
because everybody knows she's been indicted.

57:28.020 --> 57:29.860
Like everybody in her office quit.

57:29.860 --> 57:32.620
When the FBI shows up and gives you a business card

57:32.620 --> 57:36.020
and announces they're the FBI, everybody quits.

57:36.020 --> 57:40.260
So, I said, don't come here

57:40.260 --> 57:42.860
because they already know they're already concerned.

57:42.860 --> 57:44.220
So, I go and I meet her and Pete

57:44.220 --> 57:47.860
and we sit down at a restaurant, a little pizzeria.

57:47.860 --> 57:51.060
And I sit down and she starts telling me

57:51.060 --> 57:52.780
that the FBI is asking questions about me.

57:52.780 --> 57:53.940
And I'm like, well, what are you talking about?

57:53.940 --> 57:54.780
Like, what are they asking?

57:55.620 --> 57:58.180
She goes, look, they came in, they took all our files.

57:58.180 --> 57:59.780
And like, I was like, I don't know any of this.

57:59.780 --> 58:00.780
I'm like, when did this happen?

58:00.780 --> 58:02.340
She's like, yeah, they have a couple of weeks ago.

58:02.340 --> 58:05.900
And they have some of your files

58:05.900 --> 58:10.900
because I had closed several loans for my wife at the time.

58:13.860 --> 58:16.380
We were buying rental properties.

58:16.380 --> 58:18.140
My wife didn't have a job.

58:18.140 --> 58:19.460
So, it's all fraud.

58:19.460 --> 58:23.020
But I could not close those loans

58:23.020 --> 58:27.260
at my mortgage company because I own the property.

58:27.260 --> 58:28.980
So, I'm selling those properties.

58:28.980 --> 58:30.740
I bought properties, renovated them,

58:30.740 --> 58:32.660
and sold them to my wife

58:32.660 --> 58:35.300
to get around something called seasoning.

58:35.300 --> 58:38.060
Seasoning says you have to wait six months to a year

58:38.060 --> 58:40.460
to refinance at the market value.

58:40.460 --> 58:42.300
Otherwise, if you wanna refinance, that's fine,

58:42.300 --> 58:43.140
but you have to refinance

58:43.140 --> 58:45.100
at the price you purchased the property at.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.700
But I bought these properties for 80 or 100,000,

58:47.700 --> 58:50.020
renovated them, sold them for 200,000, 300,000

58:50.020 --> 58:52.140
to my wife who got a very,

58:52.140 --> 58:53.500
didn't even get a big mortgage.

58:53.500 --> 58:58.140
We were just trying to kind of get around a guideline.

58:58.140 --> 59:01.500
So, but my wife was not working

59:01.500 --> 59:03.380
and I provided W-2s and pay stubs.

59:03.380 --> 59:05.220
So, when she says all this, she says,

59:05.220 --> 59:09.060
yeah, they're looking at the loans you gave me

59:09.060 --> 59:10.300
at your wife's loans.

59:10.300 --> 59:14.500
And I went, oh my God.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.780
I said, well, you didn't tell them

59:15.780 --> 59:17.860
that the W-2s were fake, did you?

59:17.860 --> 59:20.340
You didn't tell them the pay stubs were fake, did you?

59:20.340 --> 59:22.180
You didn't tell them that the down payments were,

59:22.180 --> 59:24.460
you didn't tell them that we were married, did you?

59:24.460 --> 59:27.580
I mean, just absolutely buried myself.

59:27.580 --> 59:29.620
And as I'm telling her this,

59:30.820 --> 59:34.260
I was like, okay, I kind of caught myself

59:34.260 --> 59:36.380
and I'm like, okay, wait a minute, look.

59:36.380 --> 59:37.940
Okay, here's what you're gonna tell them.

59:37.940 --> 59:41.460
You're going to tell them you never met her.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.740
She called on the phone, like I start trying to devise

59:43.740 --> 59:45.620
a plan that will answer their questions

59:45.620 --> 59:49.220
without getting my wife in trouble or them in trouble.

59:49.220 --> 59:52.660
And if nobody cooperates, the whole thing should shut down.

59:52.660 --> 59:54.540
You know, it doesn't go anywhere.

59:54.540 --> 59:55.540
There's nowhere for them to go.

59:55.540 --> 59:57.540
Everybody just kind of stonewalls them.

59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.940
So, as I'm saying all this,

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.620
Gretchen says, Matt, we can't lie to the FBI.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.540
I go, what are you talking about?

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.780
You're already lying to the FBI.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.260
I mean, you've been lying to the FBI.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.660
I mean, I just refinanced your house

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.220
and before I can really say anything,

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.220
Pete jumps up, her husband stands up

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.420
and he says, we've never lied to the FBI.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.860
We may not have told them everything,

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.300
but we've never lied.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.020
And I thought like, who are you talking to?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.380
Like, I know that's not true.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.780
So, you're not saying that for my benefit.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.500
So, I was just, I kind of look at him and I'm like, what?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.100
And I remember looking down and this may mean nothing,

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.180
but both of their cell phones were right next to me, right?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.420
And I remember, they were probably just wearing wires,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.660
but I just remember thinking

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.300
those cell phones are microphones.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.580
They probably weren't, but I remember thinking, oh, wow.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.700
And I just, I looked at her and I went, wow.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.620
And I said, well, I hope you're gonna get something for this.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.020
And she immediately starts crying and she says,

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.020
Matt, I'm sorry, I have a kid, I can't go to jail.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.500
You have kids at that point?

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.140
Yeah, I have a kid, like I have a kid.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.620
And I was like, wow, I, wow.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.460
What have you learned about friendship from that?

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.060
Like loyalty.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.380
Oh yeah, there's, no, there's, that's a, that's, it's sweet.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.340
That must've hurt.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.340
It's cute.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.660
I mean, I love the idea of it.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.700
You don't think that?

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.500
No, I'll tell you why.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.180
So, I go back to my, I go back to my office.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.020
I remember I told her, I said,

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.900
tell the FBI agent to call me on the phone,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.460
do not come in my office.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.020
So, I go back, I'm still trying to figure out

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.900
how to weather this, right?

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.180
I go back, I sit down.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.660
Phone rings.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.140
My secretary comes in and says,

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.540
hey, agent, I'll never forget the guy's name,

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.980
agent Scott Gale with the FBI.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.740
And I was like, okay, he is on the phone.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.580
And she's standing there.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.900
I was like, close the door, get out and close it.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.740
She's like.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.580
So, get on the phone.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.020
He asked me if I'll come down.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.180
I said, yeah, absolutely.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.100
Let's schedule it for next Tuesday.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.100
You know, I put it off four or five days.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.100
I go to my brother-in-law immediately who's a lawyer.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.420
And he says, oh yeah, yeah.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.140
I mean, I don't really tell him exactly what's going on,

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.260
but I tell him this is what's happening kind of,

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.260
and I may be in trouble.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.500
I need a federal defense attorney.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.620
I don't even know what a federal defense,

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.460
I don't even know the difference,

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.780
but he said you need a federal defense attorney,

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.620
it's the FBI.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.820
So, we go on a couple, we meet a couple lawyers.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.420
I end up getting a lawyer.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.140
I give him like 75 grand.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.140
And he started to have me convinced.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.060
Initially, he had me convinced

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.820
I was probably gonna go to jail for a few years,

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.900
but really that's what they kind of do

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.420
to justify you giving them $75,000.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.260
Right.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.500
And then, but the more I thought about it and read,

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.340
he gave me the guidelines that supposedly I had,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.540
I had the fraud that I had committed

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.100
and the guidelines that oversaw that.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.660
And I read it and I was like, I'm not really in trouble here

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.660
because I'm looking at a felony,

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.740
but I'm not gonna go to jail

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.420
because there was no potential

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.140
for the bank to lose money.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.140
So, because I bought the house with like a hard money loan,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.580
and then I renovated it with my own cash.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.100
And when I sold it, it appraised at 250,000.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.060
My ex-wife borrowed like 180.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.020
So there's plenty of equity.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.740
If the whole thing had gone into foreclosure,

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.100
they still would have got their money back.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.620
And to be honest, by the time all this happened,

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.580
there was only like three of the three properties.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.300
It was like five, but we'd already sold a few.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.420
And at this point, we had just sold another two.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.500
There's like one or two properties left.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.980
So we're selling at that moment we were selling them.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.300
So I was like, no, I kind of argue with them,

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.540
but then he wanted 75 grand, I gave him 75 grand.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.940
And then he comes back and he says, good news.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.860
There was no potential fraud.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.940
So I can get you three years.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.220
Now, here's the thing.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.380
Here's what I always kind of look back at.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.980
When I first got, went into his office, he said,

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.780
he said, listen, you haven't been indicted yet.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.660
I spoke with the FBI, I spoke with the US attorney.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.660
They believe and they've been told, and he said,

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.940
look, they didn't tell me exactly what they have,

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.620
but they said what the evidence that they have on you

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.900
based on two confidential informants

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.260
that you cannot go to trial.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.460
And I was like, right, of course I knew that.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.380
And I was like, okay.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:36.300
He said, but he said, you haven't been indicted yet

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.980
and they are fairly certain that you're running a mill,

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.820
right, a fraud mill over there.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.660
And then you guys are churning out fraudulent loans.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.780
Now they can't come and they can't come and raid your office

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.260
and do anything about it yet,

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.940
because so far they only have you.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.780
But here's what I'm saying is that he said,

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.660
I can keep you from being indicted.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:02.100
It's called pre-trial, it's a pre-trial intervention

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:07.980
where we go in and what we'll do is you go in,

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:13.620
talk to the FBI, you go grab a bunch of your mortgage brokers,

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.340
most egregious files, grab them,

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.860
bring those files to the FBI, go work with the FBI,

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:27.460
they will indict them and you will not be indicted.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:32.300
And I said, which I kick myself to this day,

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.780
I said, absolutely not.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.780
I'm not gonna snitch on them.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.620
I'm not gonna cooperate.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.540
I'm not going to, you know, I'd seen the Godfather.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.980
You're not supposed to cooperate.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.700
You're supposed to be loyal.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.460
I'm not gonna do any of that.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.820
And, you know, and so I say all of this where, you know,

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.460
looking back, like I would have,

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.620
if I could go back in time,

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:58.940
I would have gone into our weekly meeting with a dolly

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.460
and I would have walked in front of everybody

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.660
and scooped up two or three of the file cabinets

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.700
and put them in the back of a truck and said,

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.180
listen, you guys are gonna be talking to the FBI soon.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.300
I suggest you get attorneys.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.980
And I would have driven off, but I didn't.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.700
I thought, no, be loyal.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.500
You know, don't do that.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:22.500
And what happened was when my,

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.660
when the other thing falls apart, right?

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.140
When the next scam falls apart,

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.980
every one of these people go to the FBI.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.740
Like they're not even coming to them.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.620
These guys are going to the FBI with lawyers.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.580
I wanna cooperate.

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.180
I wanna tell you what Cox did.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.100
I wanna help.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.500
I wanna, and I'm thinking like,

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.220
I never had to get indicted to begin with.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.260
So you think that most of these people from your experience

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:48.180
are going to sacrifice all integrity.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.180
That's a funny word.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.020
Sacrifice.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.180
I'm not sure that applies to this, but that's all right.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.020
They're going to sacrifice friendships

01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:00.900
and loyalty for just to save their own ass.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.740
Yeah.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.700
Now I only had one person that did not talk to the FBI.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.420
I had one person that every time the FBI

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.220
or the Secret Service went to that person's door,

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.420
she said, don't come into my house again.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.700
I don't have anything to say about Matt.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.380
I have nothing to do with any of this.

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.380
Talk to my lawyer.

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.540
And this happened over and over again.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.140
And that's my ex-wife.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.220
She's a gangster.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.380
So are there people in this world you trusted

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.980
or you still trust?

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:35.140
I, you know, the problem is eventually I cooperate.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.660
And at the time, I didn't want to cooperate.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.780
I didn't believe in cooperation.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.220
But after seeing how many people cooperate

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.660
and the way the system is set up,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.660
I think that my understanding of loyalty

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.660
is vastly more realistic now.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:02.020
And I think that if you're committing crime,

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.060
if you're absolutely like the things I did,

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.060
I did a bunch of scumbag things, you know?

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.220
I mean, I'm not killing people,

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.220
but I'm doing scumbag things.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.460
I'm lying, cheating, stealing.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.020
I'm a thief.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.020
You boil down to it.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.420
That's what I am.

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.380
So you can't go around behaving like a scumbag,

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.860
dealing with scumbags,

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.860
and then expect those same scumbags

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.860
to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.700
and not roll over on you.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.540
You know, and it does happen,

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.140
but it's like it's in the 90 percentile

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.500
of people that cooperate, 90 something percent.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.460
And people cooperate

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.540
when they're not even looking at any real time.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.700
So if you're looking at 30 years,

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.660
and especially after going to prison,

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.780
you go to prison and it's like,

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.020
this guy's a standup guy over here.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.860
He got 30 years.

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.780
He could have cooperated against all of his co-defendants,

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.580
but he didn't.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.780
Nobody comes to see him.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.180
His wife divorced him.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.180
You know, his kids ended up in foster care.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:14.180
His, you know, his friends are cleaning out his house.

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.940
Nobody puts money on his books.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.260
Nobody comes to see him.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.420
Nobody answers his phone, nothing.

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.460
He took 30 years.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.940
Most of those guys turned around.

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.420
They end up getting indicted for other things.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.260
Years later, they cooperate.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.060
And the best thing this guy's got going for him

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.940
is that he can walk around and say,

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.420
well, he's a standup guy.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.220
That guy's going to the same halfway house as me.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.700
He's probably, he's gonna do 30 years

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.780
where I'm gonna do 10.

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.900
The standup guy meaning he never snitched.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:42.740
Right.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.380
And so everybody's seeing this example

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.740
and saying, well, I'm going to snitch then.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.620
But it sounds like what people are doing

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.380
is they're signaling, virtue signaling.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.500
Like there are, they would never snitch

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.020
and actually do secretly.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.380
I mean, what is it?

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.140
I remember I talked to one of the COs

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.420
at the prison one time.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:09.500
And he said, he said, I said, shit,

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.420
I said 50% of the guys here snitched.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.420
He goes, it's more than that.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.300
He said, but listen,

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.420
he has 100% of them are lying about it.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.180
He said, so there's nobody here

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.540
that's going to tell you they snitched, nobody.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.260
So there's guys, tons of tons of them that cooperate.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:28.260
If 80, 90% of defendants cooperate,

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.820
you start doing the math.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.780
And if you ask 10 guys in prison,

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.140
all of them say, I didn't cooperate,

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.220
I didn't cooperate, I didn't cooperate.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.940
Like, okay, you ask 100, I didn't cooperate.

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.740
Nobody's gonna say I cooperated.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.620
Does that break your heart a little bit

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.100
that people backstab each other like this?

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:49.100
It does, but I have such a low opinion of people.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.100
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.740
It's not that I don't like people.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.220
I just don't expect anything of them.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.220
I don't expect you to look out for me.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.980
There was a time when I did, I thought I look out for you,

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.820
you should look out for me,

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.100
but I just don't expect that anymore.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.780
See, but I think humanity flourishes

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:11.940
because there is a lot of people out there

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.500
that do the thing that is difficult to do

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.020
in terms of integrity.

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.180
That may be, but these aren't people with integrity.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.300
These are criminals.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.060
If these were decent human beings,

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:24.900
and all of them will tell you,

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.740
well, why'd you do that?

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.620
Oh, you know, I was a drug addict or I needed the money.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.340
Well, if you were a decent human being,

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.900
you would have gotten off the drugs,

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.020
you would have gone and gotten three jobs.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.860
You can work 80 hours a week, I've done it.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.860
You can work 84, 85, 80, you can work 90 hours a week.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.680
You can do that.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.520
Oh, I did it for my kids.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.460
No, you're lazy.

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.620
You could have worked three jobs for your kids.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.180
Instead, you decided to sell methamphetamine.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.740
Well, I was addicted, you could have gotten off me.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.380
It wasn't important, it was the easy way out.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.180
You're not someone with integrity.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.220
So for you to sit there and say,

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.140
hey, I'm gonna act like a scumbag,

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.260
but now I got caught or you got caught

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.580
and I don't want you to tell on me,

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.980
well, you're a guy that robs banks.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.540
You stick guns in people's faces.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.380
You kidnap people, you torture people, you sell drugs.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.660
You're not a moral, ethical person,

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.320
but you want everybody else to hold up

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.620
to some ethical code.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.300
While you're robbing grandma.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.580
That's not right.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.580
So I get the whole Omar to a code

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.980
and there was a time when I was delusional enough

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.980
to believe that, but after you're going through it, no.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.780
And after going through it multiple times, no.

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.540
I have to really think about that.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.140
And I deeply appreciate your honesty on this.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.180
I think, I mean, there's all kinds of criminals

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.420
in this world and they all have all kinds of stories.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.780
And your story is one of, I don't know if it came

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:17.780
from desperation versus a love of this kind of game.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.060
Right?

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:25.580
Like it wasn't part of it, an attraction

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.020
to the creative aspect of this,

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:33.900
of breaking the rules when nobody else can

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.580
and you figure out a way to do it.

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:41.940
I think, I think initially it was, I needed the money.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.300
Like that's the first thing, you know, you say, oh, okay.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.140
Well, I need it.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.940
And if you ask most guys, oh, well, man, I needed the money.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.260
You needed the money.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.620
But, and then I definitely needed the money.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.380
But then you get $50,000 in your bank

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.500
and then you get a hundred and then it's 200

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.180
and then it's half a million and then it's a million.

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.700
And what the hell are you still committing fraud for?

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.980
You've got half a million or a million dollars in the bank

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.340
or worth of real estate or you've,

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.220
you're making five, $10,000 a month just in rental income.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.380
Why are you still committing fraud?

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:21.380
So it turned, I think it morphs into the creativity

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:26.220
in part for me and two, it was a chance for me

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.900
to prove to everybody how smart I was, you know?

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.340
I mean, it was done out of desperation initially

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.340
and then it just turned into pure narcissistic arrogance.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.580
Look at me, look at how I can do things

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.220
that nobody else can do.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.500
Look how smart I am.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.980
I just walked into Bank of America,

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.380
handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.820
and they cut me a check for $250,000.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:56.060
Like, wow, I'm amazing, you know?

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.100
And guess what?

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.780
They're never gonna get their check

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.300
and they won't know even know where to start

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.340
to try and find the person

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.180
because they're looking for a phantom.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.820
So, you know, and you feel great.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.740
I felt great.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:10.740
I used to, I felt like James Bond.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.180
I felt like 007.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.900
It was amazing.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.660
And, you know, and it did it.

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.660
It feeded my need to feel important, you know?

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.660
Even if it was, even if that was a lie

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.820
because all that success was just a lie.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.460
Well, no, you were good at it.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.700
It was good at it, but it was, it's not.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.540
It was illegal.

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.300
It's not like I'm Elon Musk.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.140
You know what I'm saying?

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.460
Like there's, it's not like you're an,

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.580
I'm an exceptional human.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.580
I'm an exceptional human being

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.900
at a horrific thing at committing fraud.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.380
Well, the question is how many people are getting hurt

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.740
because...

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.580
Initially, the thing is initially nobody got hurt.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.900
That's the thing.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.900
Nobody ever lost any money directly.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.260
Like I didn't go and say, give me $50,000

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.540
and I ran off with your money.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.380
Like I wasn't doing that.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.540
And that was a great justification.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.460
But at some point, and we'll get into that,

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.620
you know, I take off on the run and people do lose money.

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.860
I didn't take that money directly.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:16.420
And for some reason in my, you know,

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.220
sick mind or whatever the case may be,

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.260
that seems like a distinction to me

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.700
that makes me feel okay.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.460
Is that I never said, give me 300, give me $10,000.

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.020
And I ran off with it.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.220
But I put people in a position where

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.220
I damaged the credit or damaged the title to their house.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.780
And they had to go get a lawyer to fix that.

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.740
You know, and so that they had to go pay a lawyer $10,000.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.340
So I absolutely caused that person that I stood to meet

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.940
to your victim and I owe you that money.

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.300
And it was a shitty thing to do

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.620
because even at the time I was like,

01:16:58.620 --> 01:16:59.820
oh, they'll make a couple of phone calls.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.860
It'll be fine.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.700
It wasn't fine.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.260
And if I had really put any thought into it all,

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.900
I would have known it's gonna really affect these people.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.260
And those people had done nothing wrong

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.460
with the exception of trusting me.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.020
They rented me their house

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.180
or they own or finance their house.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.540
They made the mistake of bumping into me

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.580
and now they owe 10,000, $20,000, you know,

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.780
and I'm sure a ton of anguish.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.980
So what happened when you were caught that first time?

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.180
So I was caught, I got three years probation.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.100
You know, I took the probation.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.100
What does that involve?

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.420
Initially, it was such a slap on the wrist.

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.060
Were you allowed to still practice?

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.660
No, well, okay, so I wasn't.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.540
I had to, I couldn't own the mortgage company anymore.

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.420
That was a good question because like you would think,

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.180
you know, wouldn't it be great if I could keep on going?

01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.380
But what they said was, you know,

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.860
you have to forfeit your brokerage,

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.740
your brokerage license and your brokerage business license.

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:10.740
And what I did was I transferred my brokerage business

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.660
license to a guy that essentially bought my business.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.740
They allowed me to work as a consultant

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.900
in the mortgage industry, you know,

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.940
cause they went, you know, they go,

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:25.500
my lawyer goes to the judge and says, what else can he do?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.500
So, and so I have a friend, his name's Dave Walker.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.700
He was a CPA.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.700
He came in and he bought my business

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.660
and he paid me like $9,000 a month.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.700
And that covered my bills.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.700
My wife and I got divorced.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.660
So she's my ex-wife.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.660
And I don't know what to do, right?

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.220
Like I don't, I'm, I could, you know, and I was saying,

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:54.620
you know, I could have like, you know,

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.820
do you look back and it's like,

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.420
I could have claimed bankruptcy.

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.100
I could have moved into my parents' spare room,

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.140
you know, something like that.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.740
But, you know, cause I had, I had,

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.300
I lost everything in my divorce.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.580
I had huge child support payment, you know,

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:12.460
not that that has anything to do like with my,

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.700
my ex-wife, like I absolutely signed up for that.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.060
Like I wanted to pay that.

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.300
But it was, it was, it was a chunk of change, you know?

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.820
So we're gonna make a couple thousand dollars a month for,

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.900
you know, for child support.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.260
She got all of the apartments that we had.

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.100
We had about a million,

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.100
million and a half dollars worth of apartments,

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.660
which isn't a lot now,

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.140
but that's probably a five or $6 million now.

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.820
So she got all the apartments.

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:38.660
So she got everything.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.020
So now I'm sitting here, like I got,

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.940
I can't be a mortgage broker.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.860
I can get my $9,000,

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.860
but I have to help this guy run this company,

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.660
train people, do that sort of thing.

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.700
So what I decided to do was I was gonna start

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.940
flipping houses.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.220
Legitimately or not?

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.380
Well, initially I thought about doing it legitimately,

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.220
right?

01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.100
But at the same time,

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.180
I was also in the middle of figuring out

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.180
how to make these synthetic identities.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.540
So I'm making the payments every month, remember?

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.140
Two months in, three months, no, no credit scores,

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.060
no credit scores, no credit scores.

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.100
And I'm also saying, I'm gonna go,

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.100
I'm gonna start buying houses, renovate them, sell them.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.740
So the truth is we actually renovated

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.140
probably one house completely.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.500
I remember it was on 26th Street.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.900
We renovated the house completely.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.740
On the outside and the inside?

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.980
Yeah, outside, inside.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.020
It's done, it's good.

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.180
Okay, great.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.060
Me and this guy, actually Dave,

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.100
Dave Walker, the guy that bought my business.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.780
So we renovated and it just so happens at the same time,

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:42.260
I go to pull credit one day and wow,

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:45.100
700 plus credit scores.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:49.260
And I went, we don't have to sell this thing at all.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.020
Like we just, I can sell it and put it in this guy's name

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.940
and let him refinance it.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.380
And so that's what we did.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.620
I ended up selling it to this synthetic identity.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.020
Do you remember the first synthetic identity, the name?

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.140
The first one was a Joel Colon.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.420
And then I started getting creative

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.620
because the ones after that, I started naming.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.580
So I had like Joel Colon and an Alan Duncan.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:16.180
But then I, do you remember the movie, Reservoir Dogs?

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.660
So I started naming the characters

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.300
after guys in the Reservoir Dogs.

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.300
So I had a James Red, I had like a Michael White,

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:32.300
Lee Black, I had a William Blue, David Silver,

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.060
Brandon Green.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.500
So then I start developing these guys.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.300
Now I thought, oh, forget those normal names.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.540
I'm going with the Reservoir Dogs.

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.380
And I thought I was so cute too.

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.220
You think in retrospect, that was a mistake?

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.060
That was so stupid.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.060
That was just, there's so many things,

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:49.900
so many mistakes I made.

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.980
I mean, within the fraud, there are mistakes I made,

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:56.740
but you know, other than just the overall committing fraud.

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.940
But it was just like, I thought it was so cute.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.340
And then, you know, you get in front of the judge

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.460
and the judge is hearing about the Reservoir Dogs

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.820
and Mr. Green and Mr. Black, Mr. White, Mr. This, Mr. That.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.780
And he's looking at me just like, you jackass.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:11.980
Like, and you know, what am I saying?

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:14.940
It's cute, you know, but nothing's cute.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.340
So, you know, plus I'm making fake banks.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.780
What's the purpose of the fake banks?

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.420
Well, sometimes you have to have your down payment

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.700
in the bank, right?

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.900
So they want three months worth of bank statements

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.420
to see that, hey, he's got his $50,000 in the bank.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.260
And then the more properties you buy,

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.460
they start to want to see what's called reserves.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.940
They want to make sure that you can pay

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.700
all your mortgage payments.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.980
If this guy loses his job,

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.540
can this guy maintain all these mortgage payments

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.660
for the next six months?

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.380
And so they do that and they think you're going to go,

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.900
you know, oh, no, he can't do it.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.260
They go, well, then we won't lend it.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.540
Well, when they do that to me, I go, of course I do.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.780
Of course he's got it.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.620
Let me send you over the bank statements.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.060
Oh, you want to call the bank?

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.220
Call them.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.020
So there's a phone number, there's a website.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.540
Yes, you can call.

01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:03.380
We'll get on there.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.860
I'll do the whole, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.700
You know, and hold on, okay, what's the name again?

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.900
Do you have the account number?

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.340
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.980
Hold on.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.220
You wait a little bit, you know, you come out.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:15.140
Oh, okay, I got to hear.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.940
I can't tell you the exact amount right now,

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:20.900
but what was his balance last month in the data?

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.300
Oh, yep, that's it, exactly.

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.220
Okay, thank you, click.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:25.220
Would you do different voices or would you be?

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.500
No, I've done different voices

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.900
or I'd just have somebody else do it.

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.140
You know, Gretchen would have done it

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.740
or one of the brokers, Susan would have done it,

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.140
one of the brokers that worked for me

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.060
or, you know, Kelly or Johnny Moon.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.460
I have so many guys and, you know,

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.620
they just get on the phone and they do it

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.660
because they're all doing something fraud

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.620
and we're all working together.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.820
So, hey, I need you to call this guy,

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.100
I need you to call this guy and verify this

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.780
and say, oh, I'm at the bank.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.300
Okay, I'm at the bank, okay, cool.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.540
And they call back and.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.260
Does this feel like an organized system

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.940
or was it more improv,

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.980
just like dealing with the different situations?

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.700
The government would definitely say it was organized.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.700
I would say it was, you know, you're a bunch of,

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:03.540
you're just a bunch of guys, you know,

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.580
you're joking around with everybody

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.340
and you're helping each other

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.060
and it's not like everybody's, you know,

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.380
kicking up the Tommy, you know, so.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.460
So, and then all these new puzzles come up

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.300
and you figure out where to start.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.900
Right, you go in and you say,

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.860
hey, I've got this loan,

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:20.860
I need to get this loan

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.140
and this guy's trying to buy this house

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.460
and I need a loan that looks like this,

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.700
where can we go?

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:27.180
And by the way, they cannot,

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.900
they cannot order a copy of his tax returns.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.100
So you don't want to have to sign what's called a 4506.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.660
So they're like, oh, okay, listen,

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.860
so and so's got a program that, you know,

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:37.700
and you go back and what,

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.220
you have to have this much in reserves,

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.220
but you got the bank, right?

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.500
Yeah, yeah, I got the bank, I could do that.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.540
You know, so you go in and you throw it out there

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.700
to five or six guys

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.460
and you're gonna come up with an answer.

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:50.860
So you're on probation here, just to self-reflect.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.900
Did you start doing this while on probation

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.660
because of the money or because it gave you meaning?

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.700
God, you know, I mean, part, a big part of that,

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.740
the reason is I did not want to move back in with my parents

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.820
and I didn't want my father to see me struggling

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:14.740
and I didn't want him to,

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:21.060
it was my success, he had no idea.

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.300
My success had been the first time

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.940
he'd ever really been proud of me.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.220
Does that make sense? Your financial success?

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.220
Yes. At which point,

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:31.100
what was the first time you told him you did something

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.500
and it was like, you could sense him being proud?

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.340
Oh, when I became a mortgage broker,

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.460
when I became a mortgage broker

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:37.780
and I went to work for the company

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:40.860
and we're talking about within a week, I got a client.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.460
Three days later, I got a client.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:43.620
A week later, got a client.

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.580
Two days later, got a client.

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.900
Like I closed four loans my first month

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.940
and my dad was like, well,

01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.740
well, how much money are you gonna make?

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.500
And I'm like, oh, I'm charging this much, this,

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.700
I got a point on the back, I got this, boom.

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.540
I'm thinking I'm gonna walk home after taxes,

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.780
like 10, 11,000.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.340
Jesus, God Almighty.

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.940
Are you still, well, we'll see.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.740
Don't start counting your chickens before that.

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.660
And then, two, whatever, three weeks later,

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.500
four weeks later, boom, I got a check.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.980
It's like $9,000 or something.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.300
And then the next month it's 12

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.380
and the next month it's 16

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.620
and then they make me a manager and it just-

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.780
He didn't know any of it was illegitimate?

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.220
No, he thinks, he thinks, my son, he's brilliant.

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.780
He's great, he's wonderful.

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.780
I had, was certainly not proud of me prior to that,

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:42.500
but my dad was athletic, he was extremely bright.

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.420
I mean, brilliant.

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:50.420
And I was a kid who had to be put into special schools,

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.300
who barely graduated high school,

01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.980
who ended up going to college

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.300
and getting a degree in fine arts

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.020
because I was never gonna be able to get a degree in business.

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.380
It wasn't gonna happen.

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.660
So when I graduated college,

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:06.900
I remember with the degree in fine arts,

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.180
he said, the best thing you could do with that

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.500
is maybe you could draw caricatures at Disney World.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.340
You know what I'm saying?

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.180
Which wasn't a compliment by any,

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.180
it wasn't like, hey, you could draw.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:22.180
So yeah, he, you know, and then I turned around

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.180
and I tried to go to work for State Farm Insurance,

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:26.300
which is who he worked for.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.580
He worked for them for like 40 something years

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.660
and I failed the aptitude test.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.660
So then I went and worked for another insurance company

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.900
and I was an insurance adjuster,

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.580
but I couldn't keep up with the workload.

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.380
And then I ended up working construction.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.900
I'm still barely paying my bills.

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.220
You know, that's basically where my dad felt like,

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:47.700
that's, you know, he was polite to me.

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.380
You know, we were, you know, cordial,

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.860
but yeah, I wasn't,

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.780
I think he felt he deserved a better kid.

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.940
So-

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:59.740
Well, when you started doing mortgages,

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.780
that's when he was like-

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.620
Of course, he was like-

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.180
Oh, this kid's got something.

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.700
I'm driving, I'm driving a new,

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.700
I got to just pulled in in a new car

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.940
and I got to, I just bought a house that was,

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.980
you know, four or five blocks away from his house,

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.860
from where I grew up, from where he lives,

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.340
you know, lived at that time, you know,

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:20.700
six blocks away from where my sister's married

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.580
to her lawyer husband.

01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.980
Like, I'm doing pretty good.

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.380
And then within three months, we bought, you know,

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:33.220
where my new wife, we buy a quadplex

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.100
and then we're buying a triplex and another quadplex

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.100
and a 10 unit and a duplex and another duplex and a quadplex.

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.100
And it's like, what the hell's going on?

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.860
This guy is blowing up.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.660
He's going on vacation here and vacation here.

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.460
And, you know, so he, you know,

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.860
and so when the FBI comes in and they indict me

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.460
and I take the three years probation,

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.060
like, I mean, probably the worst thing in the world,

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.660
you know, other than going to prison

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.780
would have been just having to just sell everything

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.660
and go move in and start over and sell used cars.

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.100
Not that there's anything wrong with selling used cars,

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.700
but I just felt like, you know,

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.460
I just didn't want to disappoint him

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.180
any more than I already had.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.420
So I thought I'm gonna flip houses

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.180
and then I'll start maybe a development company.

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.580
So I'll buy some vacant lots and all this and that.

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:21.820
The problem is these houses, I'm buying for 50,000.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.740
If I fix them up and sell them, maybe I make 20, 25,000.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:28.300
And then you got to find a qualified borrower.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.420
It's very hard to find a qualified borrower

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.140
that wants to live in Ybor City back then.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.060
It's, I still think it's rough,

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.140
but those same houses are going for three and 400,000.

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.580
So, you know, I'm buying houses.

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.340
I got to get qualified borrowers.

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.900
I have to do all the renovations.

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:49.420
It's a nightmare, you know?

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:52.540
And if I, you know, looking back, it's like,

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.100
okay, well then you got to bite the bullet.

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.300
It's just what you have to do.

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.780
I didn't want to do that.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.300
I didn't want to do it, whether it was laziness

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.860
or I don't know, you know,

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.980
I just thought I'm good at this.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.220
I'm gonna run.

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.980
I'm just gonna start running a scam.

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.340
I'm gonna figure out how to drive the prices up,

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.540
buy the houses for 50, record them at 200,000

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.180
and then have these synthetic identities,

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:16.700
buy all the properties, refinance them,

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.140
pull out the cash, make six months worth of payments,

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.260
let them all go into foreclosure.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:26.260
And that really, really started working well, very well.

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.540
I had one time where I had a guy,

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.100
it was James Redd, the synthetic identity was James Redd,

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.700
and he had bought two or three houses.

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:37.020
And there was somebody at the office

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.780
who was friends of somebody who knew the title company

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.540
where we were closing the loans.

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:46.260
And he called her, her name was Mary and said,

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.820
Mary, this guy, James Redd,

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:51.300
like Cox is doing something shady.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.820
James Redd doesn't even exist.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.940
She goes and looks at her last couple of files

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.220
and she realizes, of course, obviously,

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.820
like this guy never showed up.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:04.340
She remembers Cox picked up the files.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.460
And he's saying he doesn't exist.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.780
So she freaks out.

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:10.740
She calls the mortgage broker, mortgage broker calls me,

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:11.860
mortgage broker calls me up and says,

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:15.780
listen, Mary said she's not closing the next loan

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.220
unless James Redd shows up.

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.220
And I went, wow, that's a tough one.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.620
And she's like, okay, so what do you wanna do?

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.660
Do you wanna go to another title company?

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.180
Like we're supposed to close in like three days,

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.740
two, three days.

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.220
I said, well, I mean, he's gonna have to show up then.

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.380
I said, I'll figure it out.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.620
Like, give me a couple of days, let me figure this out.

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.020
And she's like, okay, well, I don't know

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:35.900
how that's gonna happen.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:36.740
He doesn't exist.

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.700
Keep in mind, at this point, I don't need IDs.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.180
I don't need a real ID.

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.300
I mean, I figured out how to kind of make a real ID, right?

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.820
Like I could make one, I could take sandpaper

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:50.220
and sand off the information on a regular ID.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:54.980
And then I would print the corrected information

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.980
in reverse on a piece of transparency

01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:59.660
and I would glue it over there.

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.540
And you could still see the holograms and stuff.

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.260
It actually worked pretty good.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.140
I don't, a cop's not gonna,

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.780
it's not gonna pass mustard with a cop,

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.980
but somebody at the bank,

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:08.900
like I was able to go in

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.620
and I would open a bank account with it.

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:16.060
Well, so one of the things I had done

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:21.100
when I was closing these loans was I would go online

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.740
and I would pick,

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.500
you have to pick a photo of somebody, right?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.060
To put on the driver's license, right?

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:31.020
So I'm not making a fake ID for all these guys

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.620
because I don't need a fake ID for all these guys.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.580
Not with my picture on it, but I need a fake,

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:39.020
I need a copy of an ID, but I need a picture.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.220
Where do I get the picture?

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:43.700
So I go to Hillsborough County's arrest website

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.620
and I would find people that I knew that had been arrested.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:53.500
And so I found a guy named Eric Tamargo

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:55.860
who had been arrested.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.740
He had like, I don't know what it was,

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.140
the DUI or domestic violence, I forget what it was,

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:01.940
but there was a picture of him.

01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.780
So I print out the picture, I cut it up,

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:07.660
I paste it onto a driver's license

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:11.140
and I make a copy of it for James Redd.

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.180
That's what I'd been giving the title people.

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.900
When I would close, I'd sign all the documents

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.180
and I'd leave them that copy

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.500
so that it looked like they made a copy of it.

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.140
And then they would notarize all the documents,

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.420
even though they'd never seen this person.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.700
They have a copy of his driver's license,

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.300
everything's signed, Cox said he signed it.

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.740
It's good, notarized, here's your check.

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.300
So what I do is I think,

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.860
let me see if I can get Eric to do this.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.620
He's been, I knew he'd been in prison before.

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.100
So I call up Eric and I remember one of my buddies,

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.980
like, he's never gonna do this.

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.980
And I was like, I think he will, I think he will.

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.940
So that's how, and that's really that kind of like,

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.020
you think, what do you think?

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:51.020
No, let me try, let me call him.

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.140
I don't know, bro.

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:53.860
Like that's the kind of conversations you're having,

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.180
like, but really looking back-

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:58.540
I would love to hear the opener few sentences

01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.980
that you have with him.

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.620
I can tell you exactly what I said,

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:03.260
cause it's burned in my mind.

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.860
He comes in, so what Eric was doing at that time,

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.020
he was actually working for us.

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.460
He worked for somebody else, but periodically we would,

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.380
you know, we'd buy a house and we'd call him up.

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.300
We'd say, hey, can you, you and your boss,

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.700
can you guys come over and trim the trees of this house?

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.180
Trim all the trees, take all the crap in the yard,

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.020
clean it up.

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.100
They go, yeah, sure, no problem.

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.260
Cause that's what he did, work for like a handyman service.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.940
So they would come and they clean it up and they do that.

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.900
So I say, can you come over?

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:26.740
And he goes like, yeah.

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.860
So he comes to the office, whatever, a few hours later,

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.340
and he comes in the conference room.

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.060
I said, hey, Eric, what's going on?

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.900
And he says, he says, hey, you know, how's it going?

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.900
I said, yeah, I said, um,

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.060
listen, I said, I'm gonna tell you something.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:39.900
I need a favor.

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.780
He's like, okay, cool.

01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:42.460
He's like, what is it?

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:43.540
I said, you know all these houses

01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.460
we've been having you go and clean up?

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.300
He's like, yeah, we had that,

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:48.820
you painted that one house, you did this.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.420
Right, so here's what we've been doing.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.820
I've been buying these houses for $50,000,

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.220
recording for 200.

01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.900
And then I have these fake people buy them.

01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.500
And I explain, I just lay it out for him.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:03.020
And he's like, wow, that's, he's like, that's fucking,

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.300
bro, that's ingenious, man.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.460
That's some, that's smart.

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.940
Like, oh, you know, I was like, okay.

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.980
I said, yeah, I know, that's great.

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.300
So here's the thing.

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.980
I said, the title company

01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.500
who's been closing some of these loans,

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.660
and we have a closing in a couple of days,

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.420
she wants this guy, James Red, to show up.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:23.180
And I need someone to show up as James Red.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.660
And he goes, wow, he goes, who are you gonna get to do that?

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:29.260
And I was just thinking, just like,

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.220
okay, you're not understanding.

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.380
I'm not confiding in you,

01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.260
because I need a friend, you know?

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.420
So, and I looked at it, I said,

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.700
oh, I was thinking you might do it.

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:39.380
He was like, because that's a big favor.

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.540
I said, it is a big favor.

01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:41.780
I could be in a lot of trouble.

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.620
I said, I know.

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.220
And he goes, well, wait a minute.

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.820
He goes, I can't go.

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.700
He said, you have to give these people a driver's license.

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.180
You said the driver's licenses,

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.540
you were using mug shots.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.020
You said she's closed a couple of these.

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.940
She already, she's seen this guy's picture.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.620
And I go, she has seen his picture.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.500
I said, the thing is for James Red,

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:04.100
I pulled the mug shot offline of you

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:05.980
when you were arrested a couple of years ago.

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:09.700
And he jumps up and he goes, you motherfucker.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:10.540
And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.940
I said, Eric, I said, whoa, wait a minute.

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.140
I said, hold on, hold on.

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:14.660
I said, listen, I said, I only did that

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.620
because I knew if it came down to this moment,

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.500
you were the only person that I knew

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.580
that could pull this off,

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.100
that had the balls to walk in and do it.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.500
And he sat there and he went,

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.700
yeah, you're right.

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.700
And I mean, I couldn't believe he fell.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.540
Listen, this guy would beat the brakes off me.

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:36.980
He was, he's like 5'10, 5'11, he's boxed.

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.820
He's a big guy.

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:41.700
So, it's like I've weathered that part of the storm.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.020
And he sat there and he goes, right, right.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.940
And he goes, well, I'm not doing it for free.

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.780
I'm not doing it for nothing.

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.700
I said, no, bro, of course not.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.060
I mean, what are you like?

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:48.900
You're making a lot of money.

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:49.740
I said, well, keep in mind,

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.580
a lot of that money goes back in the property.

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.060
It's not like we're walking away with,

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.100
I think I said like tens of thousands,

01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.100
we're really walking away with hundreds of thousands.

01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.900
It's not like we're walking away with a bunch of money

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.820
or, you know, we gotta buy more properties,

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:04.580
we gotta keep it going, we gotta make the payments.

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.260
No, I know, but still I could get in a lot of trouble.

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.700
I said, I understand, bro.

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.660
I go, well, what do you want?

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.220
And I remember thinking if he asked

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.940
for more than like 10 or 15,000,

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.860
like I'll just, I'll do it myself.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.060
We'll just change title companies

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.340
and we'll go and I'll do it myself.

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.740
And he sat there and he went,

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.740
I want $500.

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.580
And I went, $500?

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:26.980
Listen, I almost started laughing.

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.660
I mean, I was like, I put my hand over him.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.660
I was like, $500, it's gonna take you 30 minutes.

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.260
And he's like, he's like, I don't care, bro.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.100
I get in a lot of trouble.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.660
I was like, oh, well, yeah, I'm not paying you now.

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:39.060
You gotta sign first.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.220
And he's like, oh, you know, I'll sign, I'll sign.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.500
I know you're good for it.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.460
He did it for 500 bucks.

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.980
I made a fake ID for him.

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.900
He goes in to the place, he signs James Red.

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.100
Comes out, what was funny about that

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.540
was when we walked into the title company,

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.380
we're sitting in the lobby and Mary comes walking out.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.820
She looks at me and she goes, Mr. Cox,

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:02.140
I don't know why you're here.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.100
She goes, I told Kelly, that was the broker.

01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:09.100
She goes, I told the broker that I'm not closing the loan

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.340
unless James Red shows up.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.260
And Eric stands up on cue and he goes, I'm James Red.

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:18.020
And she was like, and she goes, hold on a second.

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.700
And she goes, hold on a second.

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.500
She runs in the back, comes back with a file,

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.940
opens it up, looks at the picture and she's like,

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.660
oh, I'm so sorry.

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.820
Give me five minutes, I've got the file.

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.540
Prints up the docs, he goes in, signs.

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.220
And when we're there, she's passing out the checks.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:38.580
5,000 here, 25,000 here, 35,000 here,

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.900
7,000 here, 6,000 here.

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.860
So he sees all these checks and I'm like,

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.060
oh, I got that, and then the construction company,

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.380
no, no, no, I have that.

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.700
I'll take care of that, I'll take care of that.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.140
So I get all the checks and I leave.

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.220
We go sit in my Audi and he sits down and he's like,

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.220
bro, there's a lot of money.

01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:57.020
A lot of that money goes back in the properties, Eric.

01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.100
And he's like, ah, still, bro.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.900
And I said, and I counted down 500 bucks.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.940
But listen, a week later, we had another closing.

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.140
So he comes in, I said, hey, bro.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.420
He's like, hey, what's going on?

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:13.620
And I said, I need you to do the James Red thing.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.180
He goes, yeah, I've been thinking about that.

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.260
I did that way too cheap.

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.420
I said, I get it, man.

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.780
Well, how much do you want?

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.140
What do you want?

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.700
And I'm thinking if it's more than 10 or 15,

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.340
I'll do it myself.

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.900
And he sits there and he goes, I want $1,000.

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.100
I got $1,000, like, oh my God.

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.900
So I gave him $1,000 and he did another one.

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:41.780
And, but by that point, it was like five or six.

01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.220
We'd done five or six with that guy.

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.380
And after five or six, plus the credit cards,

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.300
plus all the other things,

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.740
like their credit scores start dropping.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.060
If it was 700, now it's down to like 600.

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.740
And at 600, you couldn't really borrow enough

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:55.700
to make it worth it.

01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.220
So I have other people in the wings waiting.

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:01.300
So we would just, I'd go out

01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.420
and I'd run up the credit cards

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.500
and pull all the money out of the banks

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.820
and close the accounts and then stop paying.

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.300
And you said a lot of people knew.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.100
So he was one of the people.

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.660
He was one of the people.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.100
Why do you think nobody said anything?

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:20.100
Well, I mean, I think everybody was making money.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.340
The appraiser, at that time I had an appraiser.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.780
Eventually I ordered the appraisal software

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:26.500
and I just start doing the appraisal myself.

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:28.300
Like, why give this guy 500 bucks?

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:31.300
So you were doing the appraisal yourself.

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.140
Bro, I'm doing the appraisal.

01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.060
How's that possible?

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.660
How's that?

01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:35.820
Is there a check against it?

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.300
Is there?

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.140
There is, it's funny.

01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.540
Nobody ever questions that.

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.220
You actually have to have a license

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.460
to get the appraisal software.

01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.860
So I get an appraisers that we're working with.

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:52.860
I get her license and I create an email address as her.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.820
So it was a synthetic appraiser.

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.300
Right, it was a real person

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.100
but I ended up ordering the appraisal software

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:09.100
by emailing, it was called Alamo, Alamo appraisal software.

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.580
So I ended up emailing them as her.

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.780
And they go, well, we can't sell you the software

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.540
unless we need a copy of your license.

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:18.900
Boom, here's your license.

01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:21.740
So I send them the license

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.500
and then we paid for it with a credit card.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.300
You could go get like a green dot card.

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.460
You go put 500 bucks on it or a thousand.

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.900
The software was like 1500 bucks or something.

01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.940
So you pick them like back then, it was a long time ago.

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.740
So 1500 bucks, they mail it to us

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.340
and now I've got the software.

01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:41.060
So now I can do the appraisals myself.

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.140
What stops you from appraising it?

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:45.260
Not for 200,000, but even more.

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:47.180
There's no comparable sales.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.300
So no matter what you sent to the bank,

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.500
they're gonna look at it.

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.060
Like they're gonna have their in-house appraiser

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:55.780
is going to do a desktop review.

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:56.900
He's gonna go online.

01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:59.020
He's gonna check to make sure all the appraised,

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:03.060
all of the comparable sales are sold

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.380
for what you said they sold for,

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.220
are the same square footage were built,

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.260
what the pictures look like,

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.020
how far they are.

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:10.460
He's gonna double check everything.

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.300
But he's some guy who's on salary

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.220
and he does whatever 40 or 50 of these a day or something.

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.620
It doesn't take them long.

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:18.700
And so it's cheaper that way

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.780
where we pay for the appraisers, appraisals,

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:21.980
the whole thing.

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:22.820
Got it.

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.940
So everybody's getting paid.

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:24.780
Right.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.140
And so at this point I'm doing that, right?

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:30.100
And I'm getting caught periodically.

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.220
Can you give an example?

01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.580
What do you mean getting caught?

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:35.220
I'm living in Tampa Heights,

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:37.300
which is right next to Ybor City in Tampa, right?

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:38.140
So this is all,

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.420
these are all like little suburbs of Tampa

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.500
and they're all built back in the 1920s, right?

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.980
1890s, 1910, 1920.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:48.620
So I bought this eight unit building.

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.700
I renovated it into a triplex.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:52.620
I mean, I'm driving an Audi.

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.700
I'm dating a woman that I should not have been dating.

01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:59.220
Like, I mean, I don't know what she was thinking.

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.220
So I'm, you know, we were going on vacations.

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:03.420
Like everything, life's good.

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:06.220
So, but every once in a while, you know,

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.780
like we're, you know, where things happen,

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.620
you get a phone call.

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.180
Hey, this is what just happened.

01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:15.660
And I, one time I got a phone call from same broker, Kelly.

01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.260
Kelly called me up and said, listen, we got a problem.

01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:23.020
This was, I want to say this was Alan Duncan.

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.940
This was one of the first ones that I had done, right?

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.460
We used him, but, and so he,

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:33.020
so she calls me up and says, listen,

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:37.420
Alan Duncan never made his first mortgage payment.

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:42.660
And I had a friend of mine or one of my co-defendants,

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.420
when we closed on that loan,

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.540
we both got checks for whatever, 40 or 50 grand.

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.020
Keep in mind, we're also buying,

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.620
some of this money is going into a business account.

01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:57.460
We're buying property.

01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:00.380
So it's not like I'm pocketing hundreds of thousands

01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.380
of dollars or even, you know,

01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:05.220
even 20 or $30,000 on every closing.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.540
I'm more like I'm getting 25, 10, 20,

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.860
and this guy's getting 10 and this guy's getting 15.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:13.740
And then we're taking 60

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.140
and we're putting it into the business account.

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.500
We're buying a bunch of vacant lots

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.980
or we're building some new houses.

01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.100
So we're trying to kind of take all this

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.100
and turn it into a development company.

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:25.460
But we still have to pay our bills.

01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.500
So, you know, my buddy's got to go to,

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.580
he's got to go to Amsterdam at least for two weeks,

01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.420
you know.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.340
He's from Belgium.

01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.540
That's, you apparently have to do that

01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.500
at least once a year.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.980
So he was, so when I gave him his check,

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.220
the check, I said, look,

01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:40.260
you're going to make the,

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.940
here's like 20 grand or 15 grand,

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.300
but you got to make the payments on this thing

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.140
for the next six months.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.140
He was no problem.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.580
I said, okay.

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:50.300
So she calls me up a month and a half later and says,

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.580
hey, Alan Duncan did not,

01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.740
did not make his first payment.

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.300
And I went, oh my God.

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.220
And he was actually renting the apartment downstairs for me.

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.220
So I run downstairs and I opened the door and I go,

01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:06.060
bro, I'm like, did you make Duncan's payment?

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.860
And he turns around and he's like, is it due?

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.300
And I was like, oh my God.

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.900
So I run back, you know, I grabbed the phone.

01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.740
I'm like, he didn't make it.

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.580
He didn't make it.

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:13.820
She's like, okay, well, here's what's happening.

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.420
The account executive is calling.

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:19.860
They've got the file and it was called South Star Bank.

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.180
South Star Bank has it.

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.260
They're reviewed it.

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.100
They've already been ordering documents.

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.500
They're saying that this guy, there's a problem.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.220
They are, it's falling apart.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:31.060
Like the whole thing's falling.

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.460
They know something's wrong.

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.700
But they don't know exactly what.

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.380
It's just something suspicious.

01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.060
She didn't tell me that on the phone.

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.820
Like she's saying there's something wrong.

01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.900
They're freaking out.

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.620
Cause the account executive didn't really know.

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.300
She just got a phone call saying, hey,

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.260
have you ever met this broker?

01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:46.460
Did she meet the guy?

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:47.340
Who is the guy?

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.180
He hasn't paid.

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:49.060
We're calling the cell.

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.180
Nobody's answering.

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:53.940
And really most of this was my buddy Rudy's fault.

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.060
He's just not doing any of this stuff.

01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:56.580
Any of the things he's supposed to be doing.

01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:00.740
So we go to the office and I call South Star Bank.

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.460
I get the secretary and I said, look,

01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.980
I need to talk to whatever the guy, the big guy was.

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:07.380
It was one of them was like the president.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.100
And one was like the somebody else.

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.780
Anyway, vice president.

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.020
So I said, I need to talk to so and so the vice president.

01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.420
She says, I'm sorry, he's in a business meeting.

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.780
I said, well, listen, tell him this is Alan Duncan.

01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.780
Like, you need to go tell him

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.140
is Alan Duncan's on the phone right now.

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.820
I'm sure you, he wants to talk to me.

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:25.380
And she's like, all right, hold on.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:30.260
And I mean like 20 seconds later, you know, speakerphone.

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:34.020
Hey, Mr. Duncan, this is so and so.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.740
And you know, I'm here with our lawyer

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:40.140
and the president of the bank and our head of fraud.

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:41.900
We were just discussing you.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.580
And I was like, okay.

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.860
I understand that you guys,

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:46.300
I haven't made my first payment.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.540
I said, it actually came back in the mail.

01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:49.500
I had the wrong address.

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.580
That was completely my fault.

01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.420
And I apologize.

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:54.500
I said, but I can get your cashier's check today.

01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.140
I will overnight it.

01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.660
No problem.

01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.580
Hope that's gonna be okay.

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.500
I said, wait, we're way past that.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.940
Way past that.

01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:03.860
I said, okay.

01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.540
Well, what's the issue?

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.380
And they were like, I mean, look, to be honest,

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:10.980
I don't think I'm talking to Alan Duncan.

01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.180
I don't think there is an Alan Duncan.

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:13.780
He's like, I mean, your social security number

01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.420
was issued a couple of years ago.

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:21.380
We called the bank and this was why we had gone with like

01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:24.100
South or Sun Trust Bank, right?

01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:26.100
So it was a real bank.

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.420
So it wasn't our normal bank.

01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:32.260
And they called, they don't have any record of you.

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:33.500
And I was like, well, I've never been happy

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:34.620
with South Star Bank there.

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.140
If you know, it sounds like a banking error and they're,

01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:40.460
and they're like, yeah, I don't think this isn't cute.

01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:42.020
He says, I don't think I'm talking

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:43.420
to Alan Duncan right now.

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:44.260
Right.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:45.100
And you were-

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.340
Terrified, terrified.

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:48.460
But you have to be playing it cool, I guess.

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:49.860
I mean, I know what am I gonna say?

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.820
No, you're talking to Matt Cox.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.980
Like, I can't say that.

01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.340
Like, I'm just gonna keep running with it.

01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.260
It's just like, okay, well, look, you know,

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.140
and he's like, you know, we called the DMV this, you know,

01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.380
they don't have a list for you in the, in the, you know,

01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:03.740
in their website.

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:07.220
We think that the, you know, we don't think you exist.

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:09.020
You know, we're still waiting for a phone call back from

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.540
who, so and so and so and so.

01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:12.300
And I'm just like, oh my God.

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:15.780
And I said, have you called,

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:16.900
have you called the authorities yet?

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:18.140
And they were like, no, we haven't.

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.500
But once we put our file together, we will.

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.300
And then the head of the fraud department, they said,

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.620
oh, by the way, Mr., I forget his name,

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.740
but the head of the fraud department,

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.700
worked for the FBI for like 10 years or something

01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.700
or 12 years.

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.620
And I, and I, so, I mean, I'm just like,

01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:39.060
and by the way, the, the broker is there

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:42.180
and my buddy Rudy is there.

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:44.980
And I mean, there, he's pacing the room.

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.500
She's in tears, crying like there.

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:50.100
And I'm like, okay, well, fellas, I say,

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:50.940
where's this headed?

01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:51.780
Where's this going?

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.100
What are we doing?

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.900
So they're kind of chuckling and joking about it.

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.500
And I remember being like, thinking, what's the deal?

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.940
Like, it's weird.

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:03.740
And I said, look, why don't I just,

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.500
let me just pay you back.

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.060
They said, yeah, we'll get the money.

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:08.900
We're not worried about it.

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.620
I said, you don't seem worried about the money,

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.060
about getting any of the money back.

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.340
Like don't, why don't you just let me,

01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.180
I'll cut you a check.

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.000
I can get you the money back.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.900
Like what do I, I owed him like 150 or something.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:17.740
I forget exactly.

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:18.580
It was nothing.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:19.420
I owe you 150,000.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.980
Let me cut your check for 150,000.

01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:25.300
And they were like, no, no, you know, that's a,

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.340
we'll get the money back when we foreclosed on the property.

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.380
And that's when I was like, oh,

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:36.500
they think the property is worth like $195,000 or something.

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:39.180
And I went, oh, I said, I understand.

01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:41.980
Okay. I said, do you have the appraisal in front of you?

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:43.140
And they were like, yeah.

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.140
And I said, open it up.

01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:46.580
I said, take a look at comp number one.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.740
That's owned by a guy named, you know, Lee Black.

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.500
Comp number two, you know, is owned by, you know, whatever,

01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.420
David Silver, whatever the names were.

01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:01.140
And I'm like, you know, like black, silver, red.

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:03.720
I said, I am all those people.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.140
And I said, let me tell you what I've done.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.140
And I tell them just laid out, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:11.860
I said, so you can call the FBI,

01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:13.740
but you're not gonna get all your money back.

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:17.420
Or you can let me give you your money back.

01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.100
And we can let this, we let sleeping dogs lie.

01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:24.180
The whole thing goes away.

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:26.060
I apologize.

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.900
You know, I had every intention of making all the payments.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.740
It's a glitch.

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.580
You caught me.

01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:31.420
No, my bad.

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:34.140
And so these guys are all just like, oh my God.

01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:36.140
Like now they're, they put me on hold.

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:37.340
They're looking through the file.

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:38.580
They come back.

01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:40.860
And I remember at some point we go back, forth, back, forth.

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:41.980
And finally they come back and they said,

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:44.300
listen, you still have the money?

01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.140
I said, yeah.

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.820
Well, first they come back, they threaten me.

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:50.460
Oh, well when we give us to the FBI, you're.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.300
I said, that's not true.

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.300
I said, the money was deposited into a bank account.

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.300
It has since been moved.

01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.380
The bank account has been closed.

01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.780
It's been removed in cash.

01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.780
That money is gone.

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.260
You will never see that money.

01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.100
I will be cutting you.

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.700
If I pay you back at all, it'll be from another account.

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:06.660
And so the FBI agent ends up saying he's right.

01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:09.660
Even if we caught him red-handed,

01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.580
the likelihood that any of these funds

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.020
will ever be recouped is zero.

01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.700
Like there's almost no monies ever recouped.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.620
And so we end up, they put me on hold again.

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:22.780
They come back and they go,

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.780
how quickly can you get us a cashier's check?

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:29.620
And I go, like that day I go get them a cashier's check

01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.060
overnight the cashier's check.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:34.100
They never called the FBI.

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.060
They never did anything.

01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:38.260
Now at that point, we actually ditched that whole,

01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:41.300
that James or Alan Duncan.

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.420
I remember at that point we went to the mall,

01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:44.540
ran up all the credit cards

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.860
and just threw everything away and walked away

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:48.700
because it was shot.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.980
You know, that whole, that guy was shot.

01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:53.740
I think we borrowed whatever, $800,000 or $900,000

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.580
in his name.

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.140
With the banks, it's really, really all about the money.

01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.500
Listen, when I go on the run,

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.380
I got one where I was caught so red-handed.

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.220
It's insane how bad it was.

01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.420
And listen, that's nothing.

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:10.300
I got caught by Washington Mutual one time.

01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.740
I was caught by Washington Mutual

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:16.780
where we had done six owner-occupied duplexes.

01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.940
So if you say you're gonna live in a house,

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:22.660
you can get about 95% financing.

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.220
But if it's an investment property,

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:25.420
you gotta put down 20%.

01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.540
You get about 80% financing.

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:32.540
So a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's deputy,

01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.620
we had his wife buy,

01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:40.940
I'm gonna say six owner-occupied duplexes

01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.140
saying she lived in every single one of them.

01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.620
Well, you can't own or occupy six dwellings.

01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.860
Like that's fraud.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.780
Now granted, her W-2s and pay stubs were correct,

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.340
but she didn't put the down payments down,

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.740
even the down payments we didn't put down.

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.700
We actually got cash back.

01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:00.900
But months later, they called a lawyer

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:05.900
from Washington Mutual ends up calling the mortgage broker

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:11.260
and saying that they ended up with two

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.740
of the owner-occupied duplexes

01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:18.740
because Washington Mutual had a credit line extended

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.220
to one of the lenders who'd lent the money.

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.340
So it actually was Washington Mutual.

01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:26.020
So it was a couple months later when they went to sell it

01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:28.300
and they package them together and sell them.

01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:30.300
They realized we have the same customer

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:33.820
with two duplexes side by side, both owner-occupied.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.060
This is fraud.

01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:36.780
So she comes in, she tells me,

01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.900
oh my gosh, this lawyer's on the phone.

01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.740
This is what happened.

01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.700
I'm like, oh wow, this is horrible.

01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:43.500
I ended up getting on the phone with him.

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.380
We have a conversation and I'm like,

01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:48.260
he's like, look, this is a big deal.

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:49.420
We could call the FBI.

01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:51.900
I'm like, look, who knows who was involved in this?

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.540
Maybe somebody on your side was involved.

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.660
Maybe somebody on my side.

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:56.220
I don't know what my mortgage broker did.

01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.820
I'll deal with her on my own.

01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:00.740
Why don't you just let us refinance the properties?

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.620
Not only did we talk him into allowing us

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.580
to refinance the properties,

01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:10.580
he gave us a reduced balance of what we owed him

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.900
because we couldn't borrow enough to pay him off.

01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:19.620
So they took like a $20,000 hit

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.740
just to refinance those properties.

01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:24.380
Never called the FBI.

01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:25.220
Never did anything.

01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.140
It was absolutely fraud.

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.740
I had a broker one time we got caught

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.820
with over a million dollars in loans that he had done

01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:32.820
that were fraudulent.

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:37.500
Pinnacle Bancorp, which was out of Chicago,

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.380
the owner called me and he was like,

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.460
look, your mortgage broker did this.

01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:44.580
Like there was a bunch of canceled checks.

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.220
They were fake canceled checks.

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.100
So they looked like they had run through the bank

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:51.620
for somebody's rent, but they hadn't.

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.460
Does that make sense?

01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.100
Like you pay your rent, they deposit it.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.780
It goes to the bank and they've got all the numbers

01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.620
and everything.

01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.020
Well, I had a bunch that were blank

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:01.660
that all you had to do was fill out your borrowers

01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:06.100
information and then you cut and pasted his name

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.100
and his address at the upper left-hand corner.

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.060
You make a copy of it.

01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:10.140
It looks like canceled checks.

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.380
We had 24 of them.

01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.980
Well, one of my brokers was using them

01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.700
for all of his files.

01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:17.100
Like even if the person really had a rental history,

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:17.980
he didn't want to order it.

01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.940
He just did this.

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:19.780
It was easier.

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:20.620
It's faster, yeah.

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.460
Yeah, just.

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.300
Wow.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:24.700
So they catch a million dollars worth of loans.

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:27.380
They called me up and then they caught another

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:29.820
million dollars, but they had already sold them

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:31.700
to a household bank.

01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.780
So while I'm on the phone with the owner,

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:36.220
his name's Gary, and we're talking, he's like,

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:37.420
look, this is what we found.

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:38.260
This is this.

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.100
This is what happened.

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.700
And I remember I said,

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.980
Gary, at the end of this conversation,

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.700
if you think I'm cutting you a check for a million dollars,

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.140
I said, I just don't have it.

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.540
They don't have it.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.580
This is when I owned the mortgage company.

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:53.580
And he says, no, I'm asking you for your word

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.660
that if any of these come back on us,

01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.540
they're in Florida.

01:55:58.540 --> 01:55:59.780
They're in your area.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.740
You'll help us get rid of the properties.

01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:02.740
We'll foreclose.

01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:03.620
We're going to have to resell them.

01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.020
I don't want to be flying down there.

01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:06.940
Just help us get rid of them.

01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:09.900
I said, absolutely, of course, no problem.

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.100
I said, what about the, I said,

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:11.940
well, what are you going to do with them?

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.340
He goes, well, they're going to be a part of a package,

01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:17.460
like a $3 million package we're selling to household bank.

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.860
The other ones they had caught had already been sold.

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.860
The ethical thing to do is to contact household banks,

01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:26.460
say we will buy those back.

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.660
We are going to take care of it.

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:28.660
It's not what happened.

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:31.500
In fact, Gary flew down a couple of weeks later,

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.140
took me and several of the brokers, not that broker,

01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:36.860
but several of the brokers out to dinner,

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:38.860
had a few drinks, and he openly admitted it.

01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.900
He's like, look, I don't care

01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:42.780
if all the loans have fraud in them,

01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.740
as long as they don't come back on me.

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.220
That's what I'm concerned about.

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:49.380
Because there's a clawback clause for one year.

01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:51.460
He's like, so if they can perform for one year,

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:52.720
I don't care.

01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:54.540
That was it.

01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:58.060
How many people in the industry do you think

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.340
are operating like this?

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:07.120
And by like this, I mean in the aforementioned gray area?

01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:13.620
I would say there's probably after like the,

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:17.660
like after the 2008 financial crisis,

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:21.060
I would say it cleaned up considerably.

01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:22.580
But I would say at this point,

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.500
it's just as bad as it ever was.

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.500
And keep in mind these,

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:30.140
a lot of the loans that caused the problems

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.700
were like, you know, they called them liar loans

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:38.700
or, you know, no qualification, no qual loans, right?

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:39.980
No income.

01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.120
Well, those loans are, they exist again.

01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:48.180
Like there are subprime companies

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.180
that are doing that again.

01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:51.380
They don't think they call them subprime anymore.

01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:53.460
They call them, so they got some other name.

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:54.300
Yeah, rebranded.

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.540
Yeah, they rebranded a little bit,

01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:57.520
but it's happening all over again.

01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.740
It just seems the whole real estate slash banking system

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:07.580
is very prone to this kind of corruption.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:10.300
I mean, but how can you fix it?

01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:14.940
Like if a lot of the things they fixed,

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.580
a lot of the manipulation they fixed,

01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.440
but if you tighten it too much,

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.640
then the average person can't get a loan.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:24.080
Like you, so you, you know,

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.600
and the thing is some of these loans,

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.480
sometimes changing a W-2, you know,

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:31.200
should that person have gotten into that house?

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:32.120
No, he shouldn't have.

01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:35.940
He didn't qualify, but he makes all of his payments.

01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:37.240
So it's like, is it a fraudulent loan?

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:39.040
Yeah, but it performs.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.480
So, you know, I think that I would say that,

01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:45.360
I forget what the FBI statistic was.

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:50.360
It was like 20% or 30% prior to the financial crisis,

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.400
it was like 20 or 30% of like bank loans,

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.600
they were saying that contained some kind of fraud,

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.460
even if it was just a lie.

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.640
You know, if you want to cut 30% out of the,

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.160
out of the, you know, that's a ton, that's a ton.

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.680
So you're on probation and you're doing these,

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.480
you're almost getting caught, you're almost getting caught

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:12.300
and you're doing these really large scale scams.

01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:17.300
So how does it get to the point where you're on the run?

01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.160
So I'm doing multiple scams, right?

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.100
So it's not just that I'm doing the scams

01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.700
with the, the reservoir dog scams, right?

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:27.140
I'm not just doing those guys.

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:32.140
I'm also creating other identities

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.980
because I've got other people that are involved.

01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:36.380
They want to do a scam.

01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:40.500
So this chick I was dating, she wanted to,

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.540
she wanted to run a scam.

01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:45.820
So I set up a scam, it's semi-complicated,

01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:50.620
but the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person.

01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:52.600
We, we, we steal a real person's identity.

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.460
I have a real person's identity.

01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:57.140
We get a driver's license in her name,

01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:59.080
open up some bank accounts,

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.700
go rent a piece of property in her name.

02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:07.100
And I transfer the deed or the deed from the property

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.540
out of the real owner's name.

02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:13.200
I transfer it into her stolen identity.

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:19.140
We then refinance the house like three or four times.

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.940
And so she starts going to these different closings

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.540
and she's, her name is Allison

02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:27.260
and she's pretending to be a Puerto Rican woman

02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.060
named Rosie De Perez.

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:35.540
Allison has brown hair and blue eyes.

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.900
Rosie De Perez clearly doesn't.

02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:40.940
So Allison, when we make the ID,

02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:45.740
she dyes her hair black, curls it a little bit,

02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.500
and gets the pictures taken of herself.

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.020
But before she goes to the first closing

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.580
to get a check for like $100,000,

02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:58.580
we've got like three of these scheduled.

02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:05.520
She, she changes her hair color.

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.440
She dyes it back like a dirty blonde

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.080
and she goes to the first closing and she gets a check.

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:14.320
A check for 100,000, let's say.

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.860
I don't know what it was like, 95 or 105, whatever,

02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:18.280
roughly $100,000.

02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.920
She gets a check at the closing, they give it to her.

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.660
We then go to the next closing.

02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.640
Well, at the next closing,

02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:29.640
the title person has her sign all the documents

02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.960
but she's looking at her like something's not right.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:36.520
Looks at her ID, makes a copy of the ID,

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:39.000
looks at it and says, this doesn't look like you.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:43.320
And she's like, you know, you don't look Hispanic.

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.880
And she's like, oh, I'm half Hispanic, what do you,

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.480
and she's like, you don't,

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.480
but keep in mind, the photograph was her.

02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.440
So she's saying, this doesn't look like you, but it's her.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.840
Granted, she had the curly hair a little bit, but that's it.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.720
So Allison is like, it's me.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.400
And she's like, look, I'm not gonna cut you,

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:03.880
I'm not gonna give you the check.

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:05.280
Yeah.

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.440
I'm gonna let you sign the documents, you know,

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.440
we can get you the check, I'll let you know.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.800
So she goes, gets in my car.

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.060
She said, yeah, listen, there's a problem.

02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:13.900
So we're driving down the road.

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:15.160
She explains it to me.

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.340
I realized, you know, okay, that's done, it's over.

02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:19.180
We're not going back.

02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:20.200
She's like, what about the other closing?

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.280
No, no, no more closings, we're done.

02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:25.800
And I, you know, and it was probably more of a yell,

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:28.160
screaming and yelling, like, what the hell did you do?

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.880
Why I told you not to change your hair?

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:31.200
Why would you change your hair?

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.120
When she came in, like the day before,

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:34.480
and I was like, what did you do?

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:35.760
What did you do?

02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:37.000
And she's like, I changed my hair, what's the big deal?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.480
It's still me, sure enough.

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:44.360
You know, and that's like, it's not that I knew

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.280
that that was gonna happen, but why tempt fate?

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:48.200
How'd you meet Allison?

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.040
Like, what-

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.480
She was a mortgage broker.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.320
Oh, okay.

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:52.800
And I had done some fraudulent.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.840
She needed, she worked for another mortgage company.

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.880
Sorry, she worked for another mortgage company.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.600
She couldn't get a loan closed.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.920
The owner of that mortgage company called me

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.960
and said, look, we got a loan, we need it closed.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:04.800
And I said, great.

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.560
And I, when guys would call me, I'd say, great,

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:07.720
I'll come pick it up.

02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.040
I'll give you a $300 or a $500 referral fee.

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.920
No, no, it's a couple hundred thousand dollars.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:14.800
We wanna close it.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.200
Well, if you, then close it.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.040
Well, I can't close it.

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.920
We need a W-2 or we need this, we need that.

02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.680
We can't figure out how to do it.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.960
So I go over there and typically I convince them,

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.800
just give it to them, it's not gonna close.

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:30.760
She was, she was, she was, you'd have to see this chick.

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:31.840
She was gorgeous.

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.800
She was gorgeous, very flirtatious,

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.880
made me feel like I was thin and handsome.

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:40.800
So, like she gets whatever she wants.

02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:43.480
So I'm like, okay, look, here's what you do.

02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.480
And I explained to her, do this, do this, do this,

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.160
send it here, it'll close.

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.120
And she, we closed it.

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.440
Well, then she starts calling me, right?

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:51.680
Hey, how's it going?

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.680
We go to lunch, next thing you know,

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.040
we start sleeping together.

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.760
She realizes what's happening.

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.800
She says, I wanna, I wanna end on this.

02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.040
So now we do the closings.

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:03.800
We're on our way.

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:06.520
I say, look, that check's dead.

02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.800
What, she goes, what about the other, the other one?

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:09.880
I go, no, no, it's all dead.

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.440
We're walking away.

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.080
Now, that was easy for me to say,

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.200
because for me, I had money.

02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:20.280
She's going through a divorce, she's broke.

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.760
You know, like none of this did I take into consideration

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.200
at the time, by the way.

02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:26.240
To me, it's like, nah, that's dead, we're done.

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.520
We'll start over again.

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.840
And when she's, to her, in her mind,

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:33.040
she was about to make, we were getting probably,

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.840
that was a million dollar scam.

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:37.000
She was about to end up getting, you know,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.800
whatever it was, half or one third

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.040
of half a million dollars in the next week.

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.760
Now she's got nothing.

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:47.680
So she says, look, let's at least cash this one.

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.800
And I had a buddy named Travis Hayes,

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:55.880
who had been, you know, we actually were,

02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.360
we've been friends since high school.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.800
We were like best friends, right?

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.920
Really close friends in high school.

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:02.800
We were still close.

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.600
Travis was running a scam.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.480
This one, hers was in Clearwater, his was in Orlando.

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.560
So I'm getting all over the state at this point, right?

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.400
So he's running an Orlando scam

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:18.800
that's already yielded half a million, maybe more.

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.640
He's still pulling,

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.240
we're still refinancing properties, right?

02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:23.240
So he's about to close on another half a million dollars

02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.480
worth of properties.

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.080
He's got a bank account that's open.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.320
She says, let's give it to Travis,

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.200
have him deposit it in his account.

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.560
He's already pulled out like 300,000 out of the account.

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:33.720
And she's like, shouldn't be a problem.

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.080
I was like, no, no, no.

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.160
And she was, let me call him.

02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.080
She calls him.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.680
I think I called him and I explained the situation.

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.520
He's, do you think it's okay?

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:43.720
And I said, no, I don't think it's okay.

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:45.040
I don't think it's okay at all.

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.080
And he's like, no, it's not a big deal.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.320
Just give me the check.

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:51.160
So I give him the check.

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.440
He goes, he deposits the check.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.360
They say they're gonna hold it till it clears.

02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:58.080
That was kind of a thing back then.

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:01.520
It takes, I don't know.

02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.880
I don't know how long it took, five days, six days,

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.600
whatever it was, he was supposed to go back

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:08.920
and it would have cleared and he would have been able

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.800
to start pulling money out.

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:13.400
And so I call him one day because Allison's bugging me.

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.160
So I call him and I go, hey, where are you at?

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.800
He goes, I'm actually on my way to Orlando.

02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.640
And I said, oh, okay.

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:21.400
So he let Allison know I'm not getting any money.

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:24.000
He said, the bank manager called and said

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.640
that because the check was over $100,000,

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:31.040
they have to witness me endorsing the back of the check

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:34.840
or they had to see my something, right?

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.160
And for me to come in, I went, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.160
I said, something's wrong.

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.000
Something's wrong.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.840
Don't go to the bank.

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:40.680
What do you think's wrong?

02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.760
I think the cops are waiting for you.

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.880
That's what I think's wrong.

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.720
And he goes, no, the cops aren't.

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.240
He goes, man, I'm in the parking lot right now.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.080
I just pulled in the parking lot.

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:46.920
There's no cops.

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.320
I'm like, they're not gonna be in squat cars.

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.400
Like, then he's like, no, he said, it's fine.

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.960
You're overreacting, bro.

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.760
And I'll never forget what he said.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.680
He said, you're shaking like a little girl, bro.

02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.520
Calm down.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.360
I got this.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.760
I'm cool with the manager.

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:02.280
Like the manager, like because you've chopped it up

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.680
with the manager, he's gonna let your fraudulent check

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.000
go through.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.720
So he walks in, the cops are in there.

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:10.600
They locked the door.

02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:13.680
This told me later, they closed the door, locked it.

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.880
The cops are in there.

02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:19.440
They grab him and they bring him downtown.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.840
He didn't say anything.

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:22.840
He won't say anything.

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.720
That's not true, by the way.

02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:26.720
But he, so here's where he told me he wouldn't say anything.

02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:29.080
I told him I'm not talking to you coppers.

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:31.600
Oh, he told you, but he actually did talk to him.

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.440
He actually did talk to him.

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.280
So what he ends up doing, what ends up happening is

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:39.480
we can't get in touch with him.

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.520
So we're calling and calling and calling.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.200
And then finally I decide, you know what?

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.000
I'm not gonna call his cell phone anymore.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.800
I'm gonna call the name of the person he was,

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:53.160
the synthetic identities number, right?

02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.160
So I go and I call the synthetic identities number.

02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.480
I call and I say, somebody answers and I go,

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:02.120
hey, is so-and-so there?

02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:05.800
And he said, and it's a gruff authoritarian voice,

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:07.240
you know, this is law and order.

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:09.440
And he's like, no, who's this?

02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.800
He goes, no, this is officer so-and-so, who's this?

02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:14.560
And I go, I was like, oh, this is Lee Black.

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.600
I said, he said, he goes, how do you know so-and-so?

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.320
I was like, oh, no, no, click and I just hung up.

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:20.800
And I called for like a payphone.

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:23.160
So I turned around, I said, he got arrested.

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:24.200
And then later on that night,

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:27.360
he showed up on the county website,

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.320
you know, the arrest website showing he had been arrested.

02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.720
And the next day he calls me

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:36.960
and he asked me to get him out of jail.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.320
Like, hey, you gotta go.

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.840
So I have to give his brother-in-law money.

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:43.840
You know, we get him out on jail.

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:44.680
He actually got out.

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.520
For bailing?

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.400
Yeah, he got out for like nothing.

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.200
And here's where I should have known

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:49.760
that he was cooperating.

02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:54.080
It went from like $300,000 bond down to like $10,000.

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:54.960
So it's a thousand bucks.

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.320
So right then, I didn't know it at the time,

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:59.760
but obviously that means we're gonna let him out of jail.

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.200
He's cooperating.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.440
So they let him out of jail.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.120
I go and I get him a lawyer, a state.

02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:07.520
This was state, by the way.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.440
It wasn't federal.

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:12.600
So I get him a lawyer for like $15,000.

02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:15.840
He comes, you know, of course he tells me,

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.040
look, they asked me a bunch of questions.

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:20.440
I told him that, you know, that he, you know,

02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.720
he made up some story about there's an,

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:23.760
he's working with another guy,

02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.960
but he doesn't know the guy's name.

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.800
He made up a name.

02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.520
Like there's a whole, he has this whole kind of thing

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.040
where he tells them about me, but not me.

02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.960
And he's like, and then, you know, the numbers,

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.200
none of the numbers led anywhere.

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.080
So they all lead to cell phones

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.320
that are only being used for those scams.

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.520
So it's a dead alley or blind alley.

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.200
And I'm like, okay, okay.

02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:44.360
And I mean, I'm paying him.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:47.760
Like he's coming in, man, I, my truck's no good.

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.600
I need another truck.

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.440
I buy him another truck.

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.240
Hey man, my, the electric's gonna get turned off

02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:55.840
and I don't have, oh, I'm, I need a thousand dollars.

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.000
Of course, here's a thousand dollars.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.960
I don't know what I was, I'm embarrassed you had to ask.

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.440
Here's a thousand, you know, a week later, you know,

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.320
he needs 2,000 for this, a thousand for this,

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.160
2,000 for this.

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:05.840
He wants to start a tree trimming company.

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.240
He needs to buy a tree trimmer.

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.200
How much are those?

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.120
5,000, of course, 10.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:11.680
So I give him another 25,000 starts

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.040
like a tree trimming business,

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.320
which he runs to this day.

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:20.080
What I don't know is that, you know,

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.760
the whole time he's actually working with a task force

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.120
that's been put together.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:26.240
Federal or?

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.480
This is state at this point.

02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.400
It's a state task force

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.440
because there's multiple counties involved at this point.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:33.520
And it wasn't hard for him to explain.

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.080
Like this, this is, this comes back to reservoir dogs.

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:38.320
I got a much, all he had to say to the officers was,

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.120
listen, you gotta let me go.

02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.400
I can't do any prison time.

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.760
I'm going to tell you about a much, much bigger scam.

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:46.040
And they go, okay, well, how can you prove that scam?

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:47.360
Pull up Hillsborough County,

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.720
Hillsborough County's tax appraiser website.

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:52.920
Okay, look up the name James Redd.

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.600
Look, all of these were bought six months ago.

02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.360
Six months later, they're all in foreclosure.

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.720
Pull up Lee Black.

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:02.040
All of these were bought.

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:04.680
Look, six months later, all of them are foreclosure.

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:07.520
Hey, pull up James Redd.

02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.560
Pull up Brandon Green, pull up.

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.640
So all of these are going in foreclosure.

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:15.520
It's like, you know, that what I thought was so cute,

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:18.080
not cute, it was just stupid.

02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.480
And so he very quickly, they put together a task force.

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.520
He's working with them on the task force.

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.520
And we're still buying houses,

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.840
flipping houses, doing everything.

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.120
Cause I believe him, I believe he's not, you know,

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.080
he's saying, look, if I have to go to jail for,

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.560
you know, a year or so, like, you know,

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.760
and he's also paying, you know,

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.360
he hasn't paid them back yet,

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.120
but we're saying he can pay them back.

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:44.120
Like, it's like, look, if we get to the point,

02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:45.280
you know, when we get to that point,

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.320
like we'll pay them back.

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.680
But we haven't paid them back yet

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.600
cause we have no way to show where that money came from.

02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.200
We can always go to like one of his relatives

02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.560
and give his dad 40 grand, give his mom 20 grand,

02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:58.400
you know, that kind of stuff

02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.560
and start putting money that way.

02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:01.440
And all that money was taken out in cash too.

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:03.800
So we could always show up with a chunk in cash.

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:06.800
Regardless, you know, it's still in the process.

02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.120
And I think that we're still in the process

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.720
and it could be six months or a year away

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:10.560
cause it's a slow thing.

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.320
I've already been through the process

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.800
my first time when I got in trouble.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.280
And it was a year, but from the time that I was spoken to

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.680
until I pled guilty and was sentenced.

02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:24.000
So I'm not concerned about it.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.080
Well, that's happening.

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:27.440
We're still flipping properties.

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:32.440
And one day I have a buddy named Steve Sutton.

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:35.280
Remember the sheriff's deputy.

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.080
And keep in mind, it's funny because like

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.640
I've done bad loans for police officers,

02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:44.040
sheriffs, lawyers, doctors, like, you know,

02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:47.440
across everybody across, these aren't like all, you know.

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.600
Yeah, everybody.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:51.000
Guys that, you know, these aren't all like, you know,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.880
construction workers or guys that work in, you know,

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:53.720
or mechanics or something.

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.560
These are like the legitimate,

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.800
these are legitimate people that have credit problems

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:58.480
or whatever the case may be.

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:01.000
So one day I'm sitting at work

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
and I'd been getting phone calls for the prior week

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.280
from people at title companies saying,

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.520
Hey Matt, wanted to let you know,

02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.320
we just had some subpoenas served

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.600
on several of your files.

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:20.960
And I'm concerned like that had me concerned.

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.960
Then a guy named Jeff Testerman starts making phone calls.

02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.000
Jeff Testerman is a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.120
He's calling people saying,

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.120
Hey, I noticed that you sold a piece of property

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.360
to Lee Black.

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.560
Have you ever met Mr. Black?

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.840
He seems like, and they're like just hanging up on him

02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.200
or saying, no, I don't know what you're talking about.

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.880
I'm not sure what that guy's name was.

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:46.240
Let me call you back.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:47.480
I'm getting phone calls from people.

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:49.200
So I know something's up with the newspaper.

02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.240
Now I know something's being looked at,

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:53.000
but nobody's really talking.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.720
I know that there are subpoenas being served.

02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.560
And I'm nervous.

02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.640
I'm very concerned.

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.800
And then one day I'm in my office

02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.680
and the sheriff's deputy walks in, Steve Sutton,

02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.200
in his uniform too, which everybody always stiffened

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.040
when he would walk in.

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.120
So he walks in, I go, Steve, I said, what's going on?

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.000
He said, and usually he's jolly and laughs and stuff.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.720
And he goes, and he says, I gotta talk to you outside.

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:19.880
I was like, okay.

02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:21.800
I walk outside, what's up?

02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:24.680
And he says, I used to date this girl

02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.480
in the Tampa police department or something, right?

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:28.760
I was like, okay.

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.920
He said, she showed up at my house this morning

02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.960
at like six o'clock in the morning.

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960
I went, okay.

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.080
He said, she said that she's been working on a task force.

02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.760
And he said, apparently one of your buddies

02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.400
got arrested in Orlando.

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.560
They're investigating some other thing in Clearwater.

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:49.760
They're investigating a ton of properties here

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.600
in Ebor, Tampa Heights.

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.880
And I mean, there's like a hundred properties involved.

02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.000
And my name came up because you've sold some properties

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.360
to me, which I had.

02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.160
And he's like, so she came to me and said,

02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:07.960
look, your buddy Cox.

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.640
He said, and I was like, okay.

02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:12.560
He goes, he said, well, the task force is on you.

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.360
And she said to stop talking to you

02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:17.280
because they're gonna come arrest you in a couple of days.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.280
They just handed over the task force findings

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:24.520
to the FBI and the FBI is going to come arrest you

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:25.640
in a couple of days.

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.320
And she said, not to talk to you

02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.160
because you're going to cooperate

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.880
and because all white collar guys cooperate.

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.720
So she thinks you're gonna cooperate

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.520
and not to talk to you

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.960
because she's afraid you're gonna get me hemmed up.

02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.280
And she said just to walk away.

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.000
And he was like, so I thought you should know.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.760
And I was like, okay.

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.880
And he said, what are you gonna do?

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.200
I said, oh, you know, I don't know.

02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.800
Well, first he said, what should I do?

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:56.160
And I go, tell them, tell them

02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.760
that I arranged all the loans for you.

02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.520
You came in, you signed the paperwork.

02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:01.680
I filled out all the documents.

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.800
You signed the paperwork.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.560
You, you know, I arranged everything.

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.720
I'm like, you're not a mortgage broker.

02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.680
You don't know if this is legit.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.640
Like you signed, you have perfect credit.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:10.640
You signed the paperwork.

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:12.400
You walked away with a check for 30,000.

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:13.600
You don't know.

02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.600
And he was like, cause he did it cause he had a job.

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:16.480
He was a sheriff's deputy.

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:19.080
Like I'm not a, you know, I went in,

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.840
I applied for a loan at a bank.

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.600
They said if we can buy, you can buy the house

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.040
and we'll give you $30,000.

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.960
So of course I'm going to do that, you know,

02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:30.200
that's not going to happen, but he doesn't know he's.

02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:31.520
And I said, just tell him, yeah,

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.520
tell him you'll cooperate.

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:33.640
Like, absolutely.

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.360
He's, what are you going to do?

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.320
I said, me, I said, I'm, I'm leaving, bro.

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.160
I'm leaving.

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:41.080
I said, I can't, I can't stay here.

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.560
I can't go to prison.

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:43.480
Like I was just sentenced.

02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:44.840
I'm on federal probation right now.

02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:45.960
Like the judge isn't going to be cool

02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.760
with me getting popped again.

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:51.040
Like, I mean, he, I can't do it.

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.040
I said, I'm leaving.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:53.880
Can't go to prison.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.280
I'm adorable, bro.

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.720
Like, you know, I can't, I saw Shawshank Redemption.

02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:58.880
I know what's going to happen.

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:01.040
I can't, yeah, I can't do that.

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.360
That's not going to happen.

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:03.640
Like I can't, you know, I can't,

02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:06.080
I'm not going to defend myself against a guy

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.240
who's six foot three and tatted up.

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.360
No.

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.960
So, and you know, and I can't, I'm not going,

02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:13.640
I'm no benefit to a gang.

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:16.080
Like I'm not, I'm a nonviolent, you know,

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:18.200
soft white collar criminal.

02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.800
So I was just like, I was like, yeah, I'm leaving, bro.

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.000
I'm leaving.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.120
So I actually went home.

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.280
Well, actually I was able to,

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.240
I started cutting checks to people, right?

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.360
So I cut checks to Alison, to Johnny,

02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.400
to like everybody I could think of.

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:35.440
Here's 5,000, here's 7,000, here's 8,000,

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.640
here's six, here's nine,

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:38.760
and had them go into all these different bank accounts,

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:39.840
pulling out cash.

02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:42.120
But this is like a Thursday at four o'clock.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.240
So the next day they show up with cash,

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:46.480
write some more checks, they go again.

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.800
I get about 80 grand in cash.

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:48.840
That's all I can get.

02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:54.680
I go home that night, I start packing my bags

02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.720
and I was dating this chick named Rebecca Halk.

02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.560
We've been dating about a month

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.240
and she shows up at my house.

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:06.200
You know, I hadn't returned her phone calls all day

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:07.240
and apparently we were supposed to go out

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:08.080
and I'd forgotten about it.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:09.280
I had bigger issues.

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.600
And so I'm packing a couple of duffel bags

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.400
and she walks in and she's like, what's going on?

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.360
I'm like, I'm leaving.

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.200
Where are you going?

02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:19.080
Are you supposed to go out at such

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:20.240
and go do something tonight?

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.840
I'm like, I'm leaving.

02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:22.800
It's over.

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:24.200
And she says, what happened?

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:25.120
I tell her what happened.

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:25.940
This is what happened.

02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:28.000
She's like, oh my God.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.440
Like she had no idea.

02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.080
But she had no idea about anything you were doing.

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.760
No, I barely knew her.

02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:35.120
Like, I mean, she's coming over two, three times a week

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:35.960
for a month.

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.840
Like I've, you know, this isn't love.

02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:42.360
This isn't, you know, this is a booty call.

02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:43.200
That's all it is.

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.320
Like we're hanging out, we're having sex and that's it.

02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:46.400
I don't even know you.

02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:51.400
So she suddenly just begs to come with me.

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.240
You gotta bring me with you.

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.320
You have to this, you have to that.

02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.160
I'm like, what are you talking about?

02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.640
Like you've got a son.

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.440
You have your mom lives here.

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:06.040
And she's just in tears and crying.

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:08.080
And she suddenly said, and this is what's so funny about it

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.880
is that she had just moved from Vegas

02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.440
to St. Petersburg to work at the dog track,

02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:19.440
to work for a company that owned the dog track, right?

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:24.240
The casino interest or yeah, like a gambling company.

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:28.120
And she said, you don't even know why I'm here.

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.840
I was like, okay, why are you here?

02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.480
She said, I'm here because I was working for a law firm

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:38.680
that worked for the casino company that I worked for.

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:43.040
She said, I got caught embezzling nothing.

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.320
It was like 10 or $15,000 from my boss

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.640
because she had a gambling habit.

02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:52.080
And she said, he didn't call the police

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.240
because we were sleeping together

02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.400
and he was afraid his wife would find out.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.400
She said, so instead he banished me here to St. Pete.

02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:03.440
My son just came to live with me.

02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:06.000
He's been caught sneaking out

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.160
because the father had raised him.

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:10.520
He'd only been living with her since she got to Florida.

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.640
And she's like, I was about, I was gonna send him back.

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:14.320
He's failing school, he's smoking pot.

02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.320
He's been caught sneaking out after curfew.

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.560
I'm like, okay, I don't know any of this.

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.200
She's like, he was going back in December.

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:22.760
No, he was going back after the school year,

02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.760
which would have been like May.

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:29.760
Okay, and I'm like, so where before five minutes earlier,

02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:34.160
I thought she was this sweet secretary,

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.880
sweet innocent secretary.

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:40.560
And she's like, I've been married three times.

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.320
I am a gambler.

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.400
I've blamed bankruptcy.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.560
I'm sleeping with my old boss.

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:50.560
I got like, she went from this thieving adulteress

02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:56.360
and I thought these are all really beneficial

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:59.680
to my future plans.

02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.800
And I shouldn't have at that moment,

02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:06.160
I was so just flipped out and concerned

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:09.040
and up and leaving your life

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.680
and everything you know behind, that's terrifying.

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:17.040
And so now you're alone in a strange place.

02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.000
Is that the first time you've done something like that,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
like leave to go on the road?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.040
Yes.

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.600
So I never just up and moved.

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:25.480
And keep in mind now, I can't call home.

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:27.080
I can't like, I'm leaving.

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.680
There are things that I feel like get you caught.

02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:31.720
I've watched tons of these TV shows

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.280
and there are certain things that get you caught.

02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:37.320
And one of them is keeping in contact with anybody

02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:38.160
in your old life.

02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:41.600
So I'm thinking that's not gonna happen.

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:42.960
Like I'm not contacting anybody.

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.880
I'm leaving and that's it.

02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:44.720
That didn't really happen.

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:45.560
I kept in touch.

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:46.440
I called my mom every once in a while,

02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:51.440
but I was like, okay, that's cool.

02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:55.520
Did the loneliness of that hit you early on or no?

02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.880
Like as you're packing?

02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:57.720
I never did.

02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:00.880
Well, you're leaving your life.

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:04.920
I mean, there's a, it feels like a fundamental transition.

02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:09.480
Oh, listen, I mean, listen, not just that.

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:11.760
Like I'm leaving my son.

02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:15.960
I have a son and I'm, you know, I was leaving everything.

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:19.000
I was just terrified of going to prison.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:23.160
And you know, I mean, I was just, it was just so stupid.

02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:24.000
It was just arrogance.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.960
And you know, I should have stayed.

02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:28.040
Like I made things so much worse,

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.480
but I also thought I'm smart.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.480
I can figure this out.

02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:36.680
Like I can change my identity, blend in.

02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:37.520
I'll be fine.

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:38.680
Aren't you already like,

02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:40.480
people know what your face looks like.

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:41.320
They do.

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.160
They do.

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:44.360
But one of the first things I did was I got plastic surgery.

02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.600
What kind of plastic surgery?

02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.560
I've got a nose job.

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.760
I got what they call a mini facelift.

02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:52.200
They go in through your back of your ears

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.400
and they suck out all the fat in your neck.

02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:56.560
Does that change appearance much?

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:57.880
A little bit.

02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:59.560
I got, I was balding.

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:02.520
I got a two hair transplants, you know, two hair grafts.

02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.560
So the hair in my head, this isn't my hair.

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:06.640
It's my hair, but it's from back here.

02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:08.480
So there's, they cut it here and they-

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:09.320
That's great.

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.600
I appreciate it.

02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:12.960
So they re-implanted it there, you know,

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:15.440
got liposuction, just some, you know, other stuff.

02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.280
And you know, got my teeth done, that sort of thing.

02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.960
You know, so, you know,

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:22.760
and I, that was kind of like my plan.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.720
I'll go, I'll take off.

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.560
I got 80 grand.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:26.720
I'll steal some more money, you know,

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:29.400
but I let her come with me

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:32.480
and we ran up all my credit cards over the next few days,

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:35.760
packed up the car, traded in my Audi

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:38.760
and got like an Audi, you know, was it like an A6

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:42.040
or like a Ford or like a big Ford or whatever it was,

02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:46.720
got that and drove straight to Atlanta.

02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:53.200
And so I wrote a letter to my parents

02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.560
before I left, just explaining,

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.480
this is what's happening.

02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:58.120
I'm leaving, I'm done.

02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.320
I'm not going to prison.

02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:02.160
Love you.

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.120
Sorry.

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:03.960
Sorry.

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:05.240
Sorry, sorry.

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:06.320
I know I'm a disappointment.

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:07.400
Sorry.

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:08.720
Bam.

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:12.920
So I take off, go to Atlanta.

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:16.440
When we went to Atlanta,

02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:21.440
I already had the name of a guy named Scott Kugno

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:23.880
that I'd done a loan for.

02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:30.240
So I had his, you know, his vital information, right?

02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.080
Like I have his name, date of birth, social security number,

02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:36.320
mother's maiden name and where he was born.

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.560
One day we were having a conversation

02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:42.480
and I just slowly pried all that out of him, right?

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.920
Like I already, we'd done a loan form.

02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.200
So I had his name, date of birth, social security number,

02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.520
but I need to steal his identity.

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:51.320
I need to know where he was born

02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:53.040
and his mother's maiden name.

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.920
So through the course of a conversation, I just pried,

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:58.600
you know, hey, you know, Kugno, is that, you know,

02:24:58.600 --> 02:24:59.440
what is that?

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:00.280
Is that like Irish?

02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:01.120
Is it?

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:01.960
No, it's such and such.

02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:02.800
What's your mom's name?

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:03.640
Oh, such and such.

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.480
Oh, okay.

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:05.320
Yeah.

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:06.160
You know?

02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:07.000
Oh, were you born here?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.320
You're born in, and why aren't you from?

02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:09.280
Oh man, I was born here.

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.120
I was born in such and such.

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:12.000
Oh, Hillsborough County.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.600
You know, like I, so it was no big deal.

02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:18.000
We get to Atlanta, I make a fake ID for both of us,

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.120
but keep in mind, I don't have,

02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.600
I don't have a driver's license.

02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.480
I do, but they're fake.

02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:25.840
Like I can't give this to a cop.

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:28.520
Can't give a driver's license that says David Freeman.

02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:29.760
What's David's residence?

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:31.240
Florida or is this Georgia?

02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.120
No, this is Florida, but it was just a made up name.

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.880
I'd gone to like high school with a kid named David Freeman.

02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:41.240
So I had an ID, but I can't give that to a cop.

02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:43.080
Like that's enough to get like rent a place

02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:43.920
or do something.

02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:44.760
Yeah.

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:49.760
So we go, go to Atlanta, make an ID,

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:52.920
set it up, make some business cards,

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.840
set up a couple of websites, set up some,

02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.880
get an HQ, which is that like a,

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:01.000
it's a company that will, you can do virtual,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.840
you can rent offices and they'll answer your phone

02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.160
for like a hundred bucks a month and they'll afford them.

02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:08.040
So it seems like you have an office.

02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.320
They'll, you know, they give you a phone number

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:11.000
that you call up and they say, you know,

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.920
hi, United Southern Bank, you know,

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:15.000
and they'll answer the phone and forward messages.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.960
So we get one of those, make a business card for Becky.

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.800
She rents a house from a guy named Michael Shanahan.

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:26.480
So we rent Michael Shanahan's house.

02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:29.880
It's like $200,000, $200,000 house in Alpharetta.

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:35.200
And I then go to Alabama, wait,

02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.360
I then order Scott Kugno's birth certificate,

02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:41.000
social security card.

02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:45.360
I think I registered to vote in his name

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:49.600
and I made a lease agreement in his name.

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:53.040
And I think that's all I needed.

02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.600
And then I went to Alabama

02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:57.720
and got a driver's license in his name.

02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:00.640
So I went into DMV, give them all these documents

02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:05.320
and which are almost all real except for the lease.

02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.360
They said, sit over there.

02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.760
I sit over there, I sit down, boom.

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.560
20 minutes later, I have a driver's license.

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.520
You know, it was $20 something, it was nothing.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.240
So I get the driver's license, now I'm driving this.

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:15.920
I'm still driving a car that,

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:18.560
an Audi that is in the name of Matt Cox.

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.200
So I parked that.

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:24.560
I then go get social security to issue me

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:27.920
a social security number in the name Scott Kugno.

02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:30.000
And I then turn around and I go and I get a loan.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.920
You put down 20, 30%, there's all these first time

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:34.480
or first time buyers.

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.480
30% down, get like a Honda or something.

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.760
So now we're living in a house.

02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.200
We've got some furniture, bedroom furniture.

02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:45.360
And I go downtown, I pull the title to this guy,

02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.040
Michael Shanahan's house.

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:54.480
And I go downtown and I satisfy the loan on his house.

02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.000
So he had two loans with Bank of America.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.360
And so I create two satisfaction of loans

02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.960
from Bank of America.

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.440
So Michael Shanahan owns a house

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:09.520
in the name Michael Shanahan.

02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.440
He has one mortgage with Bank of America and a second one.

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.760
When you pay your mortgage off,

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.520
the way public records knows it's paid off

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:23.520
is they mail public records a satisfaction of mortgage.

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:25.880
It's a one page document and it's notarized.

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.680
So I filled out two, I created two of them.

02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.640
I just ordered, you can read, do research.

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.680
So when I went downtown,

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.960
I researched Bank of America satisfaction of mortgages

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:41.640
and thousands show up.

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:42.960
So I just grab a couple of them.

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.520
Now I know what the basic template is.

02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:46.240
And they're all different by the way.

02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.560
So it's not like you even have to be that close,

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:52.200
but whatever, I mimicked some of them.

02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.360
I had a notary stamp, not hard to get.

02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:00.360
You go into three different office depots

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.560
and you say, hey, I need a notary stamp

02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:06.040
and you give them the information

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:08.200
and you come back four day or whatever a week later

02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:09.640
and they give it to you.

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.080
So I've got these notary stamps.

02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.840
So I notarize the satisfactions.

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.400
I go downtown, I file them, boom, the mortgages are gone.

02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:18.800
Keep in mind Bank of America,

02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:19.880
he's still paying the mortgages.

02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:21.480
They don't know that they've been satisfied

02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:23.680
in public records, they're not notified.

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.320
So those are gone, but it takes about a month or two

02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:27.160
for it to show up.

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:29.640
Atlanta was that far behind.

02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:31.960
There was Fulton County, they were just way behind.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:35.000
So we just kind of have to dick around for a while, right?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.960
So we're going on little vacations.

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.560
We're going to New Orleans.

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:41.200
We're going to different places

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.080
as Scott Kugno driving a car as Scott Kugno.

02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.480
We opened up several bank accounts.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:49.240
We have multiple bank accounts.

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:52.640
And then we ended up going to Vegas

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:55.240
and we do go to Vegas, but what happened

02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:57.560
was we were driving around and I remember thinking,

02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.480
telling her, I was like, this is a problem.

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:04.880
We have to get real IDs, real driver's licenses.

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.920
This is real, but this is a real person too

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.360
and he may stumble across it.

02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:13.200
And so what I did was I started running ads in magazines

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:18.080
saying, home loans available, good credit, bad credit,

02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.560
no problem, call now, government loans,

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:25.480
government, VA, FHA, finding whatever, call this number.

02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:29.120
So people start calling and I'm getting their information.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:32.600
One of the guys I got was Michael Eckert.

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:35.920
Yeah, I remember Michael Eckert, poor Michael Eckert.

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:39.400
I actually legally changed his name

02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.000
to Michael Johnson at one point,

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.360
but at this point it was just Michael Eckert.

02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:48.360
So I don't, I wanted to see, you know, I'm bored.

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:49.680
I want to see what the process is.

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.960
How much does it cost and is this possible?

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:53.880
Let me see if I can change this guy's name.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.200
It was 1500 bucks, I changed it.

02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:57.920
Without him ever showing up anywhere.

02:30:57.920 --> 02:30:59.320
So you can-

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.320
I have a driver's license in his name.

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:02.160
I am him.

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:02.980
So he did show up.

02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:05.120
He showed up at the lawyer's office.

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:10.040
So, you know, so I'm, so I do that.

02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:15.040
I'm living in the house and we're driving along one day

02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:18.760
and I'm saying, we gotta get real.

02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:20.840
Like these people that are calling like that,

02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:23.400
one guy I get his information,

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:25.440
but during the course of taking the application

02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:28.480
and I'm asking like these government survey questions

02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:29.480
at the very end.

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:32.360
It's like 20 questions and I'm rambling them off.

02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:35.400
And at some point he was like, he said, he volunteered.

02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.240
Like I didn't, I never even asked anybody

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:38.200
about criminal history.

02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.840
And he just, he ended up saying something.

02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.280
Well, I do have a felony.

02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:43.120
Does that matter?

02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:44.880
I mean, he's like, he was, I mean, it was a DUI.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.160
I've had a couple DUIs, but I got my license back.

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.240
And that was part of the reason he had bad credit.

02:31:49.240 --> 02:31:51.880
And it was like, okay.

02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:53.200
No, no, it doesn't matter.

02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:54.040
Don't worry.

02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:55.080
I'm thinking, you're not getting along.

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.400
So this is, I'm just taking your,

02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:58.480
I'm just stealing from you, stealing your information.

02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:01.800
So I get all this information, I'm gathering it.

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:04.160
And so one of the things I said to Becky

02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.600
while we were sitting at this stoplight is I'm like,

02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:10.480
we gotta get real, people's real information.

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:11.760
And I said, like, for instance, I said,

02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:13.040
what if I steal somebody's identity?

02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:15.000
I get a driver's license in his name,

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:18.080
four states from where he lives and he gets a DUI.

02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:20.480
I could get pulled over two years later

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:24.320
and get arrested for a DUI that he got in Florida.

02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:25.920
And she's like, well, what do you,

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:26.760
what are you thinking?

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:28.120
Are you thinking like criminals?

02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:30.520
Or are you thinking like, like prisoners?

02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:32.040
Like mental patients?

02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:33.920
Like, and I went, I mean, I don't,

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:36.160
and I looked over and there was a homeless guy

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.240
holding a sign.

02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:40.200
And I went, like that guy.

02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:42.800
And I never forget, she goes, she's the hobo?

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.720
Like, I don't know who calls them hobos.

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:45.960
And she's like, the hobo?

02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:48.880
I said, yes, that guy.

02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:49.960
I said, hold on.

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:52.120
Pulled over to a subway, got out.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.360
She went inside to get subway.

02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:56.760
I walk across the street, pulled out like 20 bucks.

02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:57.600
And I said, hey, bro,

02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:58.880
can I ask you some quick questions real quick?

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.120
He's like, yeah, what's up?

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.040
And I go, here's 20 bucks.

02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:01.880
I said, listen.

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:06.280
I said, when was the last time you were gainfully employed?

02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:09.440
He's like, ah, whatever, 10 years.

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.760
I'm like, oh, okay.

02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:12.200
Do you have a criminal record?

02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.280
He's like, ah, I've been arrested in misdemeanors,

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:16.200
like, you know, vagrancy.

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:17.600
And he names off some things, you know,

02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:19.000
drunk in public, whatever.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.080
And I was like, are you on probation?

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.320
He goes, I can't, I can't, I can't do probation.

02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:25.040
They don't give us probation.

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:25.880
They keep us for 90 days.

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:26.960
They release us.

02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:29.080
Like they, the judge knows I can't do,

02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:30.960
I'm not gonna show up for a probation.

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.760
I'm like, okay, do you have a driver's license?

02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.560
He's like, maybe.

02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.400
I don't think so.

02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:37.840
I think it's just, I go, is it DUI?

02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:40.120
He's like, no, I think it's just expired.

02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:41.320
Did you have a driver's license with you?

02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.360
He's like, no, I got nothing.

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:44.840
I'm like, okay, well, you know.

02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:47.520
He told me he lived in like a tent in the woods.

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.280
And so I gave him like another 20 bucks,

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:53.120
asked him a few more questions.

02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:57.520
And then, oh, and I remember in the middle of it,

02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:00.720
he said, he goes, are you taking a survey or something?

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.600
And I went, I remember thinking, I go,

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:04.600
I kind of chuckled.

02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:06.440
I go, you get a lot of surveyors out here?

02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:07.280
Like that.

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:08.560
And he goes, yeah, and sometimes.

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:09.560
And I was like, really?

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:11.320
He goes, yeah, he said like the,

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.480
he said people from like halfway houses

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.160
and what do you say, social workers and stuff.

02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:22.400
They'll come out and they'll pass out stuff

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:23.720
and they'll ask us questions and stuff.

02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:25.160
And I'm like, oh, okay.

02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.240
And I was like, I thought that's good to know.

02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:31.400
So I go back, I get, grab Becky and she's like,

02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:32.840
oh, she's like, did you give him money?

02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:35.400
I said, give him like 40 or 60 bucks or something.

02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:36.240
Forget what?

02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:37.440
And she was like, yes, what a waste of money.

02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:38.280
I thought it was good.

02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:40.160
That was money well spent.

02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:42.320
I said, that guy's perfect.

02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:47.160
I said, that guy is, he's got everything.

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.760
He has no way to be contacted.

02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:51.400
He has no documentation on him.

02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:53.800
I said, he's not gonna drive a car.

02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.880
He's not gonna get into UI.

02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:56.280
He has an expired license.

02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:59.640
I just have to get his license reinstated and I can be him.

02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:01.880
So I went home.

02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:04.600
I typed up a, what I called a federal statistical

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:07.000
survey form and I made a little thing.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.080
I mean, I went online.

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.200
I mean, I'm always filling out federal documents

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:11.040
as a mortgage broker.

02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:12.200
So it looked identical.

02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:15.760
I mean, I had like this little, like the recycle symbol

02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:19.000
and it was like, federal form 17-0-17, you know?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.880
And so I print out these forms.

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:25.040
I go buy a clipboard.

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:27.880
I make a little, a Salvation Army ID.

02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:31.680
I pin it on me and I go out and I start.

02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.560
Do surveys.

02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.360
I start surveying homeless people.

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:35.400
Don't judge me, bro.

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:36.920
I was in a bad spot.

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:38.040
I was in a bad spot.

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.280
I see the judgment.

02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:41.920
I see the judgment.

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:43.920
Let's maintain civility here.

02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:46.360
Like stay neutral, stay neutral.

02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:48.800
So these homeless guys, I mean, they have,

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.760
they have a social security number.

02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.920
They have a birth certificate, I guess.

02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:55.200
I mean, they're a real person.

02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.040
Right, they're perfect.

02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:56.880
They're a real person with.

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.000
They're just not using their real person.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Yeah, they're not actively engaging

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.600
with the economic system, the financial system.

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.600
They're not employed.

02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:07.440
They don't have housing, all that kind of.

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:08.840
They don't file taxes.

02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.680
They don't.

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.560
So I, one of the questions I even asked the guy,

02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.680
one of the last questions I said,

02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:18.120
do you believe that you will be gainfully employed

02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:20.520
within the next two years?

02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:23.440
Every one of them said, no, no, no.

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.360
So, you know, it was like, okay,

02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:26.800
they're not even, they're not even trying.

02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:28.520
And they all had alcohol problems.

02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:30.240
Or honestly, the few of them I talked to,

02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:31.840
like was pretty clear.

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:34.360
I mean, it takes literally five minutes,

02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:35.800
less than five minutes to fill out the form.

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:38.200
And I filled it out for them, of course.

02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.120
But even filling it out and that brief,

02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:42.920
just asking questions back and forth,

02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:44.080
half of them you could tell,

02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:45.240
you've got some mental illness.

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:46.600
Like something's not right with you.

02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:47.920
Like these aren't guys that aren't gonna go out

02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:49.720
or going to get jobs.

02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:50.800
They're not cleaning up.

02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.640
So they were perfect for my purposes,

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:56.560
as horrible as I know that sounds.

02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:57.400
So-

02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:59.920
Do you feel bad about this little small tangent?

02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:01.400
No.

02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:02.880
Do I feel bad about it?

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.920
The homeless people in society are really,

02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.680
it's a difficult life.

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.120
Like dealing with mental illness,

02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:11.880
dealing with drug addiction, all that kind of stuff.

02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:13.840
I mean, being in prison,

02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:16.120
and then the kind of the people that are in prison

02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:19.800
that are going to be homeless or have been homeless

02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:22.000
or the mental illness that I've dealt with

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.720
in halfway houses and even doing this.

02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:27.560
I don't know what you do with these people.

02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:29.320
I don't even know that you house them.

02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:32.280
You can't necessarily even house them together.

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.240
They cause such problems.

02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.360
Like I don't know what the solution is

02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:40.600
other than just kind of keeping them fed maybe

02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:45.400
and keep them away from normal people

02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.160
so they don't cause crime or whatever.

02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:48.840
I don't know about housing them in one area.

02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:50.280
That seems like a mistake.

02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:54.880
Like there is absolutely no good solution to that problem.

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:56.320
None, because it's not like,

02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:58.440
hey, if we gave you a house

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.320
and we gave you job training and we gave you this,

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:04.080
okay, you might get 5%, 10,

02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:05.400
but most of them are on the street

02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:09.000
because they've just messed up over and over and over again.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.480
And they just kind of gave up.

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.880
But I guess we still have to remember

02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:14.080
that they're human beings.

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.920
And we mentioned off Mike, soft white underbelly.

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:20.640
He highlights the humanity of people

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:23.800
who've had a real difficult life and he does it well.

02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:27.560
He's, Mark Lada is amazing.

02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:28.480
He's amazing.

02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:30.520
And one of the things he had said was like,

02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:32.960
these are, he was like, these are real people

02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:34.600
and he's like, they're stories.

02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:37.160
He's like, they have stories and they need, you know,

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:39.320
but if you also talk to Mark,

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:42.280
he'll tell you, you can't just, you can't give him money.

02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:43.840
You can't like, you can't like,

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.800
every time he's reached out and tried to help these guys,

02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:51.280
put them in apartments, fed them,

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:52.800
got them back on their feet,

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:54.760
within six months they're back on the street.

02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:58.040
I mean, it just happens over and over and over again.

02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:00.880
I mean, I think the amount of money

02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:05.040
that would have to be dumped into correcting that problem,

02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:06.760
I don't know.

02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:09.400
I mean, you can say, well, yeah, but just, you know,

02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.880
you should do it because it's the right thing to do.

02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.840
I don't know who's paying for it.

02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:15.800
It's complicated, but for your purpose,

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.240
they have a social security number.

02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:20.360
They got 20 bucks, they seem very happy.

02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:22.720
There you are with a clipboard taking survey.

02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:27.720
Right, took a survey, went home, ordered their,

02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:29.680
and they, you know, of course they give me everything,

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.160
name, date of birth, social security number,

02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:34.080
mother's maiden name, where they were born,

02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:36.400
have they ever been in the armed services?

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.000
Have they ever had a passport issued?

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.960
What states have they had identification in?

02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:41.560
Have they ever been arrested?

02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:42.600
They were been on probation.

02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:46.520
Have they ever claimed social security disability, SSI?

02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:48.440
I mean, I had like 17 questions

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:50.280
and it absolutely answered everything.

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:51.720
What high school did you go to?

02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:54.200
Because high school transcripts are great for documentation.

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:56.200
A lot of times they'll ask you for high school, you know,

02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:57.960
can you get us a copy of your high school transcripts?

02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:59.400
Like, that's a good note.

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.360
And I'm a big believer in overkill.

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:03.120
So, I mean, I ordered a ton of stuff.

02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:07.280
If I needed three things to get a driver's license

02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:09.000
in your name, right?

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.120
You know, I'd come in with like six

02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.480
because what you do is you get in front of the guy at the DMV

02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:15.920
and you kind of fumble through like,

02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:17.080
oh, I got this.

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:17.920
What else do you need?

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:19.800
You know, I know exactly what you need.

02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.640
But, you know, they'll be like,

02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.840
oh, is that high school transcript?

02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.680
Yeah, I'll take that.

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:25.240
And, oh, voter's registration card.

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:26.080
Give me that.

02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:26.900
Yeah, that's, you're perfect.

02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:27.740
You're good.

02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:28.580
Sit down right over there.

02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:29.400
That's it.

02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:31.560
Who is, by the way, lurking in the shadows

02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:32.840
trying to catch you?

02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:35.400
You've mentioned FBI, Secret Service.

02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.880
You mentioned, I think I've heard you mention US Marshals,

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:40.200
which is interesting.

02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:42.480
Cops in general, the police, CIA.

02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.680
I guess CIA is international only.

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.200
FBI is internal.

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:47.040
Okay.

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.320
Well, so who is, when you're doing this,

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.320
who are you afraid of?

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.840
So by the time I've gotten to Atlanta

02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.680
within four or five days, the FBI raided my office.

02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:00.000
I guess I kind of missed that.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:00.960
Back in Florida.

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:01.800
Back in Florida.

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.040
When I left and drove to Atlanta and left,

02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:08.000
remember the FBI was gonna show up a few days later.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:08.840
They were gonna arrest me.

02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:09.680
And they did.

02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:13.000
They showed up like I left on a Sunday night or something.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.680
Because for some reason in my stupid thought,

02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.920
I thought, well, they won't arrest me on the weekend.

02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:20.760
Like they don't work on the weekends.

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.520
So they came on like a, whatever it was,

02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.320
like a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday.

02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:26.240
Like within a few days, they come in the office,

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:28.960
they raid it, they're looking for me, but I'm gone.

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:30.560
Nobody knows where I am.

02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:33.720
And so now I'm surveying the homeless guys

02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:36.720
and I turn around and I'm ordering their documents.

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.560
And as their documents are showing up,

02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:45.120
you know, I'm going to different states and getting IDs.

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:48.720
So I'm going to Florida.

02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.520
So over the course of this whole thing,

02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.520
I've had 27 driver's licenses in like seven different states.

02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.760
I've had two dozen passports.

02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:00.760
Because if you're gonna get the driver's license

02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:04.360
in the guy's name, you might as well get, or an ID even,

02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:06.280
you might as well get a passport.

02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:08.400
Because a passport's not difficult to get.

02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:09.960
They don't fingerprint you.

02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:12.000
You know, all they look, all they're doing is saying,

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.920
this is your ID and where you're born here.

02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.240
And then they run a check.

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:17.640
And if it comes back or it doesn't.

02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:19.160
And back then you could do it expedited

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:20.560
and I'd have it in like two weeks.

02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:24.200
Like now it takes like 90 days or 60 to 90 days to get one.

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:25.040
But-

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:26.680
And if you have multiple ideas for a single identity,

02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:27.880
that's more proof.

02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:29.320
Right.

02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:30.160
So-

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:31.040
Wait, what number did you say?

02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.760
How many, how many IDs, how many identities?

02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.360
Well, I've had over 50 identities,

02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:40.840
but I've had 27 driver's licenses issued

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.840
from state DMVs, Department of Motor Vehicles.

02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.680
Like legitimately.

02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:46.520
Legitimately.

02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:51.480
I walked into the DMV, said, hi, my name's Michael Eckert.

02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:54.240
And I just moved here about three weeks ago,

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:57.000
four weeks ago, here's my lease.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.320
And here, I lost my driver's license, bro.

02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:01.320
Like, I don't know what I did with it.

02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:02.360
I don't know what happened.

02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:03.200
I don't know.

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:04.040
And they're like, it's all right.

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:04.880
What do you have?

02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:06.800
I need a proof of residency.

02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:07.720
Well, I have my lease.

02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:09.240
Oh, okay.

02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:11.880
I need a primary.

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.640
Okay, here's my birth certificate.

02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:14.480
Okay.

02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:16.360
And I need a secondary.

02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:17.840
Here's my social security card.

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:20.800
But I also registered, you know, I registered to vote.

02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:22.960
My girlfriend made me vote immediately

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:23.800
and she said I would need it.

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:24.840
You're like, oh, yeah, that's perfect.

02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:26.120
You're good.

02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:27.360
I don't even need that.

02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:28.200
Okay, great.

02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:29.320
Stand over there.

02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:30.160
Pay that person.

02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:32.160
They call your number, 275.

02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:33.760
You know, 45 minutes later, you go,

02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:35.520
you pay your 25 bucks.

02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:37.080
You stand in front of the screen.

02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:37.920
They take a picture.

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:38.760
You got a driver's license.

02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:40.240
You walk out, it's still warm.

02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:41.080
It's beautiful.

02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:42.640
It smells like hot plastic.

02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:43.760
It's amazing.

02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:48.760
And so I'm opening up different bank accounts

02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.480
in these guys' names.

02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:53.360
And just about-

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:55.800
What are you mostly doing with the identities?

02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:57.640
You're opening up different bank accounts.

02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:58.480
Right now.

02:43:58.480 --> 02:43:59.840
Are you doing credit,

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:01.320
starting to establish credit or no?

02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:02.520
Some of them.

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:07.520
Like I might order a secured credit card.

02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:09.800
So I can't get credit.

02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:11.400
You know, I'm building their credit.

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.720
Like it's not helping me in any way.

02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:16.760
I'm just sending out $500 to get a capital one card

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.040
or a American, I'm sorry, a Bank of America

02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:22.000
secured credit card, whatever.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000
So I'm building their credits, but not all of them.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:27.840
Only a few because I'm collecting,

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:29.480
although I'm collecting them,

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.000
I'm also gonna be moving soon.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.080
I'm only here to get a few hundred thousand dollars

02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:35.280
and move.

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:36.920
I need some kind of a base.

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:38.880
So I don't wanna start getting credit cards

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:43.760
and building up a history in Atlanta in anybody's name,

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:47.040
but I am getting driver's licenses in other states.

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.840
So I've been like North Carolina, South Carolina.

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:52.360
What's the primary method of income here

02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:55.160
when you move to a place, South Carolina?

02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:57.320
How do you make a hundred thousand at this time?

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:59.440
Oh, well, right now I'm living in this guy's house

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:00.960
and I satisfied his loans.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.080
The house is worth 200,000.

02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.800
So what happens is one day we go and we check public records.

02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:09.000
Remember I told you it takes months for it to show up

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.360
and it shows up.

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.520
He's got no mortgages on the house.

02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:16.040
So now I turn around and I make a fake ID

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:17.960
in the name Michael Shanahan.

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:22.600
And I'm living in his house, but I have no credit.

02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:24.080
Right, there's no credit.

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:29.080
So I've got the ID, I've got a social security number

02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.760
and I order some secure credit cards in his name.

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:35.960
So if you pull that credit profile,

02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.680
it shows up saying he's got some credit cards,

02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:40.840
but they're only a month or two old.

02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:43.000
So I can't go to like Bank of America.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I mean, I could, but I needed to get the money

02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:49.200
as quick as possible.

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:50.640
Like I wanna get out of Atlanta.

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.320
So, and at this point, by the way,

02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:58.280
there's multiple articles showing up in Tampa.

02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:02.920
So the St. Petersburg Times is writing multiple articles

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:03.800
about me.

02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:04.680
With your face.

02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:06.280
With my picture, yeah.

02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:08.760
But it's honestly, it's pre, I mean, not pre-internet,

02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:11.440
but it's post-internet, but it's in its infancy.

02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:13.440
Like nobody's, it's not huge.

02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.440
And honestly, it's a local newspaper in Tampa.

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.000
It's not that big of a deal.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.040
Like I'm not concerned about that so much at this point.

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:25.160
What I'm concerned about is getting a chunk of money

02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:27.440
and just moving on and kind of reestablishing ourselves

02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:30.640
in a better way where we're not living in a building

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:34.680
that we're going to be committing fraud in with our house.

02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:37.080
So, but I'm living in this place.

02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:39.400
I make a fake ID in the name Michael Shanahan

02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:43.920
and I call up three secured, or sorry,

02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.880
three hard money lenders.

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:49.280
A hard money lender is a guy that lends his own money

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:53.120
or other investors' money on property.

02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:55.920
Kind of like a bank, but he's lending his own money.

02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.440
So he doesn't have to really meet the banking requirements

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.400
and he can charge a much higher interest rate.

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:05.240
These guys are charging 12, 13% interest, simple interest.

02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:09.280
And they're only lending you a much lower percentage

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:11.560
of the value of your home.

02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:13.640
So they're not lending you 90% of the value.

02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:17.080
They're lending you 65%, 60%.

02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:19.160
So I call three of these guys.

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:21.480
They all come out to the house at different times

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:25.160
and each one of them says, I'll lend you 100,000

02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:26.920
or it's like 150,000, 150,000.

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:28.760
Like they all lend roughly 150,000.

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:33.320
So we schedule three separate closings.

02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:35.800
None of them know about the other person.

02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.800
So what I do is I close one loan on let's say Monday

02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:44.480
and then one on Tuesday and then one on whatever,

02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:46.600
Wednesday or Thursday, or that may have all been

02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:48.320
the same day to be honest, but I don't remember.

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.920
The point is I go to three separate title companies

02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:54.920
or real estate attorneys and we close.

02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:59.160
And I get checks for, you know, after costs and everything,

02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:01.400
the total ends up being roughly 400,000.

02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:04.200
So I've got 400,000.

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:08.880
Becky and I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida

02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:11.040
and we get like 50 grand.

02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:14.880
And plus the 80s dwindled down to close to nothing.

02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:16.720
Cause we had gone on several vacations.

02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.280
We went to like Bermuda and I think we went to Jamaica.

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.760
We actually stayed at the Ritz in Jamaica.

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:26.080
So it was very nice.

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.120
And Becky, so Becky turned out to be pretty good

02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:30.520
in terms of scams on the road.

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:31.640
No, she was useless.

02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:33.120
She was horrible.

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:34.920
And she just spent money all the time.

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:38.160
And by the, what I realized too very quickly

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:40.160
is she's bipolar.

02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:45.160
So she's bipolar and she's absolutely insane.

02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:48.000
She smokes pot all the time.

02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:50.640
Did that matter for you personally

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.240
or did it actually affect how good you were able

02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:56.440
to do these particular scams?

02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.160
It was that she was the type of person

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:03.400
that would start an argument at one o'clock in the morning

02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:07.560
and scream at the top of her lungs

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:08.760
and get the cops called.

02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.040
So I can't have the police called.

02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.960
I can't get taken downtown and fingerprinted.

02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:17.120
I can't have the police showing up.

02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.040
I don't know who's really, who's looking.

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.880
We haven't had plastic surgery at this point.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.760
We're still pulling money together.

02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:24.600
So.

02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:27.720
Oh, Becky.

02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:29.880
Yeah, Becky's a problem.

02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:34.440
And at some point, I actually, so we send her to

02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:37.560
like a psychiatrist and they give her,

02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:39.080
they put her on Zoloft.

02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:42.800
She takes it for like a month or two

02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:43.920
and then she stops taking it.

02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.920
She thought she was all better.

02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:48.200
Like you're not all better.

02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.760
So can you give me a timeline here?

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:53.160
How long are you able to be on the road here successfully?

02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:54.000
Three years.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:54.840
Three years.

02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:55.680
This is me.

02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:56.520
This is the first few points.

02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:57.600
Three years.

02:49:57.600 --> 02:49:58.520
Well, so.

02:49:58.520 --> 02:49:59.360
Three years.

02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:04.480
What happens is we get that little chunk of money.

02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:06.920
We put it deposited into these bank accounts

02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:08.640
and we start pulling out cash.

02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:12.640
And which works out fine

02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:13.680
because we got a bunch of accounts

02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:15.200
and we're pulling out little amounts,

02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.520
7,000, 5,000, 8,000.

02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:20.600
And, you know, I would cash checks against her accounts

02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:24.320
and they would call her to verify,

02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:27.720
is there someone here trying to cash a check for $9,000?

02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:30.440
You know, can you verify the payee?

02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:32.800
And they go, oh yeah, that's Scott Kugno.

02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:33.640
Oh, okay, thank you.

02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.680
And they cash the check, you know.

02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:36.240
These are new accounts.

02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:39.440
So it looks odd, but you know, we're always,

02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:40.400
I open the account.

02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:43.160
So what ends up happening is

02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:44.880
we're cashing them.

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:46.440
And I remember getting really frustrated

02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:48.440
because it was just taking forever.

02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:50.680
And I had gone into a bank one time

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:56.640
and they have banks where they cash,

02:50:56.640 --> 02:51:00.240
they actually cash like large checks.

02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:01.360
Like if you go into Bank of America

02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:04.320
and you try and cash a check for $15,000 or $25,000,

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:05.880
they probably won't do it.

02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:07.840
They'll tell you we don't have that much cash on hand.

02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:09.360
We don't this, we don't that.

02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:10.960
They have certain bank accounts

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:11.800
that do that.

02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:13.640
So they told me where one of those was.

02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:16.040
I went there, I had a check for like 29,000

02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:22.560
that had been cut on a closing for Michael Shanahan.

02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:24.600
Remember I refinanced Michael Shanahan's name.

02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:28.600
I've got a check for 29,000 that was issued to Scott Kugno.

02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:30.520
So I'm sitting in the bank.

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.920
I go in there, I say, I need to cash this.

02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:34.040
And she says, you're gonna have to talk to the manager.

02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:34.880
I go, okay.

02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:36.000
She says, go sit down over there.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.240
I go sit down in the little glass cubicle.

02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:39.240
He comes over and he says,

02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:40.560
I see you're trying to cash this check.

02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:41.400
And I was like, right.

02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:43.080
He goes, why don't you just deposit in your own bank?

02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:44.920
And I went, my bank account,

02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:46.840
my bank is a credit union or something

02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:48.520
and it's in like Florida.

02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:50.480
Like they'll hold this thing for like two weeks.

02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:52.040
Like I need the money now.

02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:54.280
I have people I need to pay.

02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:58.120
He's like, well, I'm not sure.

02:51:58.120 --> 02:51:59.320
And I was like, well, it's fine.

02:51:59.320 --> 02:52:00.160
It's a cashier check.

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:01.320
Like it's good.

02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:02.840
And he goes, no, it's good.

02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:03.680
It's good.

02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.720
As you have the money.

02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:06.520
And he's like, yeah, I'm gonna go to the bank.

02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:07.920
As you have the money.

02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:09.240
And he's like, yeah, we have the money.

02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:10.600
He said, it's just odd.

02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:12.800
Hold on.

02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:17.000
He goes back in the back and he comes back and he says,

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.600
where'd you get the check?

02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:19.440
Cashier's check.

02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:20.360
I said, it was a cashier's check.

02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:24.480
It was drawn off of a closing for somebody's property

02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:27.560
that I were doing the company I worked for.

02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:29.240
We're putting on an addition on.

02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:31.760
Okay, that makes sense.

02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:33.840
Comes back and why do you need cash?

02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:35.800
And I was like, I'm cashing guys checks

02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:36.640
that work for the company.

02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:38.400
Like there's a lot of these guys that are like Mexican guys.

02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.240
They give them a check.

02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:40.640
They go to a check cashing company

02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:42.400
or they get charged five, 10%.

02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.240
So I cashed them.

02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:46.080
I'm like, I don't under, like what?

02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:47.600
The check's good, right?

02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:50.240
Like my, and he's like, yeah,

02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:51.480
we're just trying to verify some stuff.

02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:55.440
And he went, yeah, hold on.

02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:56.280
And he leaves again.

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:58.360
And I remember my cell phone rang

02:52:58.360 --> 02:52:59.920
and I pick up the phone and it's Becky.

02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:00.760
She's like, what are you doing?

02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.580
What's taking so long?

02:53:01.580 --> 02:53:02.520
I go, ah, the guy's being a jerk.

02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:04.040
You don't wanna give me the money.

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.600
Oh, she's like, oh my God, get out of the bank.

02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:08.440
And I went, I can't get out of the bank.

02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:09.920
The guy's got my ID.

02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:14.040
He's got my credit card, my ID and the check for 29,000.

02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:17.640
Like he's gonna call the police if I just jump up and run.

02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:19.680
And I go, don't call me again.

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:20.520
I'll let you know.

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:21.360
It'll be fine.

02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:23.000
Hang up the phone.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.560
She calls back, same conversation.

02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:26.960
I'm bouncing on the walls.

02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:28.840
I'm like, I'm going crazy.

02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:29.680
It'll be fine.

02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:30.520
Hang up the phone.

02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:33.400
He comes back out and he goes, he said,

02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:35.080
I said, hey, so what's taking so long?

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:37.120
And he goes, we're trying to get in touch

02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:40.160
with Michael Shanahan to verify the check.

02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:42.920
That's not good for me.

02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:47.760
Like, I'm thinking, right, right, okay, okay.

02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:51.400
And he walks away, the phone rings.

02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:53.040
It's Becky, what's going on?

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.560
I go, they're trying to get ahold of Michael Shanahan.

02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:58.440
She goes, oh my God, oh my God.

02:53:58.440 --> 02:53:59.680
And I'm like, oh my God.

02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:02.600
And I remember thinking I shouldn't let her get the keys.

02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:04.600
There's a good chance I run out of this place

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:05.760
and she does, she's not there.

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:06.960
But by the way, when you're sitting there,

02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:08.960
you're who, Scott, you're Scott?

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:10.000
I'm Scott Kugno.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.440
And then the other guy is calling Michael Shanahan.

02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:13.440
Right, they're saying they're trying

02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:15.120
to get in touch with Michael Shanahan.

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:17.400
So then the phone rings.

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:18.680
My phone cell rings again.

02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:21.840
I look and it's not Becky's, not Becky.

02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:23.160
So I pick up the phone, I go, hello.

02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:24.720
And she says, hi, this is Kim.

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:26.080
Is it from SunTrust Bank?

02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:27.840
Is this Michael Shanahan?

02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:31.800
So I'm like, yes, it is Michael Shanahan.

02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:33.400
And she says, there's a guy here.

02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:34.520
He's trying to cash a check.

02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:35.360
It's very large.

02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:36.560
Could you verify the payee?

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:37.480
And I go, sure.

02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:38.880
It's Scott Kugno.

02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:41.800
I said, I believe the amount's $29,000.

02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:42.960
And she goes, that's right.

02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:43.880
Thank you very much.

02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:44.720
I appreciate it.

02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:45.560
I said, okay.

02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.360
I said, hey, by the way, how'd you get my number?

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:48.200
This is my cell number.

02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:49.240
And she's like, oh, I'm sorry.

02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:52.360
We called the title company

02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:57.120
and the title company gave us your phone number.

02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:58.480
Well, I closed those loans.

02:54:58.480 --> 02:54:59.320
That's my cell.

02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:03.360
That's why if they looked in any other way,

02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:04.240
they could have gotten in touch

02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:05.760
with the real Michael Shanahan.

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:07.840
So I was like, oh, okay.

02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:09.160
Hang up the phone.

02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:12.000
You're sitting, you answered the phone from the bank

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.560
while sitting in the bank.

02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:14.760
As Scott.

02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:15.600
As Scott Kugno.

02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:17.760
As Scott pretending to be Mike.

02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.960
So I just, right.

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.720
So I just verify the check myself.

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.200
As Matthew pretending to be Scott,

02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:24.160
as pretending to be Mike.

02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:25.280
Right.

02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.920
So I wait there, terrified still.

02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.000
They come out about two minutes later.

02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:34.240
The manager comes out plus a woman.

02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:35.520
I'm assuming maybe it was Kim.

02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:36.360
She never said anything.

02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.280
And she walks out and she says,

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.680
and he counts out the money twice, 29,000, 29,000.

02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:45.760
And I stand up and I mean, just like,

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:47.440
I'm like shoving the money in my pockets.

02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:48.600
Like I'm trying to get out of there so quick.

02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.560
I'm like, hey, I'm like, okay, cool.

02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.800
Like I'm thinking this whole thing is, you know, feels bad.

02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:59.520
And I'm getting up and I'm starting to walk out of the bank

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:04.520
and he goes, he said, excuse me, Mr. Kugno?

02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:06.080
And I said, yes, sir.

02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:08.520
I turn around and he goes, I'd like you to know

02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.440
that I feel very apprehensive about this transaction.

02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:13.760
And I go, really?

02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.240
What is it exactly?

02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:17.080
He goes, I can't put my finger on it.

02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:18.360
And I go, it'll come to you.

02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.040
And I turn around and I just bolt right out of there.

02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.120
And to keep in mind, a week or so later,

02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:25.240
the secret service shows up.

02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:27.880
Did you cash a check for $29,000?

02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:30.480
So what's so funny is like,

02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:32.200
that was one of the last checks we cashed.

02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:33.960
So we ended up with like 400,000.

02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:35.680
Was there a connection between the secret service

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.160
and this guy?

02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.000
No.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:38.840
The apprehension.

02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:41.480
So the FBI is looking for me kind of in Tampa.

02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:42.320
Yeah.

02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:44.800
And they've put out a fugitive warrant for me,

02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:47.000
which is how the US Marshals got involved.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.000
So US Marshals tracked down fugitives.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.160
Yes, federal fugitives, they tracked down.

02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:55.480
But everybody's after you.

02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:57.520
You're on every list.

02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:58.360
Right.

02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:00.320
I'm on the FBI's most wanted list.

02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:03.280
At that point, the secret service got involved

02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:04.880
once I leave Atlanta.

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:09.360
So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta,

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:11.240
the secret service got involved.

02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:16.240
Because of identity theft, banking, identity theft,

02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:19.760
the secret service doesn't just do counterfeiting

02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:20.800
and protect the president.

02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:23.600
They also protect the financial infrastructure

02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:24.440
of the United States.

02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:26.720
And they especially have jurisdiction

02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.960
when identity theft is involved.

02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:32.320
So identity theft plus bank fraud,

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:33.480
that's when they move.

02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:34.320
Yeah, that's it.

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:36.520
That's their territory.

02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:37.360
So they don't-

02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:39.400
US Marshals are just fugitives?

02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:40.520
US Marshals are just fugitives.

02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:42.080
They don't do any investigation.

02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:44.240
Okay, but they're all kind of working together?

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.640
Yeah, like the US Marshals are, let's say,

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:53.640
an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies,

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.440
federal agencies, not the states.

02:57:57.440 --> 02:57:59.520
The states have their own fugitive task forces

02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:00.760
or fugitive-

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:03.880
So when you leave Atlanta, basically everybody's after you.

02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:05.080
Everybody's after me.

02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:06.560
Did you know this at that time?

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:08.320
Or did you sense it?

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:10.840
No, I mean, now, every day you're looking up,

02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:12.320
you're just looking your name up every day.

02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:15.160
Like I'm not, because I'm just trying to get a bunch

02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:18.120
of money and just blend in, right?

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:20.640
Things were not as interconnected at that time

02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:21.720
as they are now.

02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.560
But they're starting to get interconnected.

02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:25.520
But of course, I have no idea how much.

02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:28.400
I barely go on the internet for anything, you know?

02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:31.080
Dating, that's the only thing on the internet.

02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:32.560
I'd never been on Facebook.

02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:35.400
At this point, Facebook isn't even out yet.

02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:38.080
This is 2006.

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.760
Still, are you trying to stay low?

02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:42.120
Yeah, I am, because I'm not a flashy person.

02:58:42.120 --> 02:58:43.640
Like I'm not driving, you know,

02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:46.720
like I didn't go out and buy a red Lamborghini.

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:51.240
You know, I'm driving $40,000, $50,000 cars, you know?

02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:53.680
I've had some sports cars, 70, 80, you know,

02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:55.560
maybe that's $150,000 sports car now,

02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:56.760
but it's still not flashy.

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:58.600
It's not like it's bright red or yellow.

02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:02.400
I mean, these are, it's always something, you know,

02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:03.720
nondescript.

02:59:03.720 --> 02:59:06.960
And I'm living in areas that these cars are everywhere.

02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:09.160
You know, I go to, so I ended up going

02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:10.760
to Charlotte, North Carolina.

02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:13.480
We rent an apartment.

02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:18.480
We decided to run a scam in South Carolina.

02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:19.800
South Carolina.

02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:22.200
So I go to Columbia, South Carolina.

02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:27.200
And in between this period of time, we go to Las Vegas.

02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:30.320
And I, when we go to Las,

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:32.920
we go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money

02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:37.920
to Becky's son's father, who's taking care of her son.

02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.440
We drop off some money there.

02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:42.800
We go and we start, and while we're there,

02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:45.480
it's like, hey, there's homeless people here.

02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:50.480
So we, you know, usually I don't feel bad

02:59:51.880 --> 02:59:52.720
telling these stories.

02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:54.320
You make me feel bad.

02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:56.320
I'm sorry, my judgment is showing.

02:59:56.320 --> 02:59:59.360
No, but you have to be collecting identities, I guess,

02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:02.280
to be constantly creating new identities.

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:04.720
So I got my survey forms.

03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:09.720
So I go and, you know, we go out and we're taking,

03:00:09.720 --> 03:00:13.280
I'm taking surveys and I end up going up to this guy.

03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:14.760
There's like two or three guys that are standing

03:00:14.760 --> 03:00:16.800
on like a bench or sitting on next to a bench or something.

03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:19.120
And I see them and I walk up and the guy,

03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:20.200
one guy gets up and he comes over.

03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:22.040
He's like, hey, what do you need?

03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:25.040
And I went, I'm taking surveys for the Salvation Army

03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:27.440
to determine where we place our next homeless facility.

03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:29.120
And the guy goes, oh, I'm not interested.

03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:29.960
And they always said that.

03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:31.520
And I said, it pays 20 bucks cash right now.

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.960
It'll take you five minutes.

03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:35.040
And they're like, what, $20 cash right now.

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.520
I was like, yeah, show them the cash.

03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:38.200
And they go, okay, yeah, yeah, what do you need?

03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:40.160
Name, date of birth, social security number.

03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:43.960
So when I get to criminal record,

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.240
the guy, he says, criminal record.

03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:47.760
He was like, yeah, I've been arrested.

03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.080
He said, I've been arrested like three, four times for,

03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:51.720
he said, for prostitution.

03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:54.800
He said, but they're like misdemeanors.

03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:56.000
And I went, okay.

03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:01.480
And it was like, okay, well, prostitution.

03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:03.880
To me, women get charged with prostitution, you know?

03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:05.760
Men get charged with solicitation.

03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:06.760
I went, prostitution?

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.720
And he goes, and he went, he said, yeah, yeah.

03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:12.120
He said, I offered to blow an undercover cop for 20 bucks.

03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:12.960
He said, that's what I thought

03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:14.480
you were coming out here for.

03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:17.080
And I was like, and I was like, no, no, bro.

03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:17.920
I said, okay.

03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:20.160
And he's like, yeah, he said, you know, he goes,

03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:22.440
he goes, I mean, he said, I mean, a girl's gotta do

03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:23.280
what a girl's gotta do.

03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:25.040
You know, and he made some comment or something.

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:26.240
I was like, okay.

03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.280
So I jot down the rest of it.

03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:29.120
We're good.

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:29.940
I give him 20 bucks.

03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:30.780
I get in my car.

03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:31.620
I leave.

03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:36.320
We get back to North Carolina.

03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:37.440
I order all of his documents.

03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:39.240
His name was Gary Sullivan.

03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:42.840
I then go to South Carolina.

03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:48.920
When I go to South Carolina, I get a real estate agent.

03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:51.360
We drive around for a day.

03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:52.980
We look at like five or six houses.

03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:57.980
I put five owner financing contracts

03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:00.560
on five different houses.

03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:03.040
So I get him, he writes up five contracts.

03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.680
All of them are asking for owner financing.

03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:07.740
I'll put down 10%.

03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.700
I want owner financing.

03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:12.700
Two of them end up coming back and saying, yes, we'll do it.

03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:15.500
I have two closings.

03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:18.620
One of them's a house that's worth like 225,000.

03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:20.380
I put down 25 grand.

03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:23.180
Another one's 110,000.

03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:24.980
I put down 11,000.

03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:26.300
So I buy these two houses.

03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:30.140
I then satisfy the loans on both the houses.

03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:33.980
Everything seems like it's going okay.

03:02:33.980 --> 03:02:36.560
Although Becky's a lunatic.

03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:39.040
At this point, she's had so many,

03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:40.680
she won't take her medication.

03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:44.280
She's had so many outbursts that,

03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:46.680
and we've had, by this time we've had plastic surgery.

03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:48.700
Like she's gotten plastic surgery.

03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:50.200
She's gotten a boob job.

03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:52.560
She's gotten liposuction.

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:55.440
I mean, all kinds of stuff.

03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.280
So.

03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:57.240
Look way different?

03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:00.040
Like appearance changes or?

03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:02.980
Thinner, better looking, you know,

03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:04.440
just tightened everything up, I guess.

03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:07.200
You know, she was in her, she'd had a kid

03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:11.160
and she was 30, 33, 34.

03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:13.000
I don't know how old she was, 20, 32, 33.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.680
I don't know, roughly my age.

03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:16.800
So yeah, I thought she looked, you know,

03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:18.160
she lost like 15 pounds.

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:19.840
Like she was not because of the surgery,

03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:22.240
but just in general, we're just working out.

03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:23.900
We're going mountain climbing.

03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:25.560
We're, you know, riding bikes.

03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:27.900
We're doing, you know, fraud's not a full-time job.

03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:29.880
So, you know, we have plenty of time.

03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:32.560
So we're goofing off and

03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:36.920
but she's also a lunatic.

03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:38.720
You know, she's getting the cops called.

03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:41.400
She's able to go out and she's able to stay stoned

03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:42.520
24 hours a day.

03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:46.280
She's going out with friends, drinking.

03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:48.060
I never leave the house.

03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:49.500
You know, even to this day,

03:03:49.500 --> 03:03:50.640
I really barely ever leave the house.

03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:53.000
I'm very much a homebody kind of person.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:56.920
So like the idea that I'm able to make my living

03:03:56.920 --> 03:03:59.840
doing YouTube and I'd never have to leave my house.

03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:01.040
I love that.

03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.160
I don't ever go anywhere except for the gym and back home.

03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:04.000
That's it.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.000
So what happens is I've actually moved her out

03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:11.040
of my apartment.

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:13.800
Like I had an apartment downtown, 30 story building.

03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:15.800
I actually move her into another apartment.

03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:16.960
She's that much of a lunatic.

03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:18.340
We can't even be in the same place.

03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:19.900
Multiple times I've tried to leave her.

03:04:19.900 --> 03:04:22.640
She's called me up and begged me to come back.

03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:23.680
It's horrible.

03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:25.360
So I ended up buying a couple of houses

03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:27.480
in Columbia, South Carolina.

03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:30.580
I satisfy the loans on the houses.

03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:33.600
I've got an ID, not a driver's license,

03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:36.340
but an ID in the name of Gary Lee Sullivan.

03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:41.880
And I refinanced those houses

03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:44.560
because keep in mind they were owner financing,

03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:45.720
but they also had mortgages.

03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:47.680
So there's something called a wraparound mortgage.

03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:50.080
So these guys did wraparound mortgages.

03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:55.240
So let's say you buy a house for $250,000

03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:58.280
and the bank lends you 200,000

03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:00.760
and then you owner finance the house to me.

03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:03.360
I give you 50 grand down,

03:05:05.580 --> 03:05:07.440
but I'm not able to get a loan from the bank

03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:08.320
to pay off your mortgage.

03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:11.600
So what we do is you do a wraparound mortgage.

03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:15.360
So I'll pay you your mortgage and you pay the bank.

03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:17.480
So there is a second mortgage on the property,

03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:18.960
but it's called a wraparound.

03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:21.080
It's wrapped around your first.

03:05:21.080 --> 03:05:22.240
That's legal.

03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:23.520
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:26.040
So I wouldn't lie to you.

03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:29.160
So these have wraparound mortgages.

03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:32.160
You're always selling and you're good at it.

03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:36.840
So I go, I satisfy the loans,

03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:39.400
the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages,

03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:44.240
and I satisfy the loans, the original loans

03:05:44.240 --> 03:05:46.840
that these people took out on their own mortgages.

03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:48.480
One of them, by the way,

03:05:49.840 --> 03:05:53.080
you have to sign as the president of the bank, right?

03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:53.920
Yeah.

03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:57.040
So I sign it as C. Montgomery Burns,

03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:59.800
which is the aging tycoon and the guy that owns

03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:01.760
a power plant in The Simpsons TV show.

03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:03.880
So I sign that and I notarize it,

03:06:03.880 --> 03:06:04.800
which I thought was cute.

03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:07.680
I actually wanted to sign all of them cartoon characters

03:06:07.680 --> 03:06:09.800
and Becky was screaming her head off

03:06:09.800 --> 03:06:11.280
and wouldn't let me do it, right?

03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:13.400
Like I wanted to do all The Simpsons, right?

03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:14.520
But she wouldn't let me do it.

03:06:14.520 --> 03:06:15.480
She's screaming and hollering.

03:06:15.480 --> 03:06:16.680
So I ended up, you know,

03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:18.560
nobody knows who C. Montgomery Burns is.

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:20.760
So I sign it, notarize it.

03:06:20.760 --> 03:06:22.560
All of those are satisfied.

03:06:22.560 --> 03:06:27.360
I then go to the multiple banks and I refinance,

03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:32.360
start refinancing all these properties multiple times.

03:06:32.560 --> 03:06:35.160
So I'm applying for these loans

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:36.960
and I'm getting the loans and I'm closing.

03:06:36.960 --> 03:06:40.520
So I've got like five or six loans on this one house.

03:06:40.520 --> 03:06:42.600
So house is like 225,000.

03:06:43.960 --> 03:06:46.320
I think it was like 230, whatever.

03:06:46.320 --> 03:06:49.400
I borrow like four or five loans on that house.

03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:53.200
So I borrowed like $190,000 like five times.

03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:55.280
So I've got like $800,000.

03:06:55.280 --> 03:06:57.960
And then I borrow another three or 400,000

03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:00.280
on the other house, the one, the smaller one, right?

03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:02.480
So it ends up being like $1.3 million.

03:07:02.480 --> 03:07:05.440
It's actually like 1.5 million.

03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:08.120
It was more, but what happened with that was,

03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:11.240
so keep in mind, you can only open up

03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:13.320
so many bank accounts in your name.

03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:15.000
You can go to Bank of America, they'll open one.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.680
Then you go to SunTrust, they'll open one.

03:07:16.680 --> 03:07:18.360
They're gonna ask, they might even ask you,

03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:21.760
did you open another bank account today?

03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:22.800
Because every time you do it,

03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:25.600
there's an inquiry into something called check systems

03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:27.720
or AccuCheck.

03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:29.120
And so then they go,

03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:31.600
so then by the time you go to the third bank,

03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:33.760
they'll say, listen, something's not right.

03:07:33.760 --> 03:07:36.160
You've got multiple inquiries.

03:07:36.160 --> 03:07:38.440
You know, if you go to whatever mercantile bank,

03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:39.800
they might go, okay, we're gonna open one.

03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:41.040
They're gonna need an explanation,

03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:43.440
but you're not opening more than three.

03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:44.440
By the third one, they're gonna be like,

03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:46.600
absolutely not, something's wrong.

03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.720
So, you know, I've got multiple identities,

03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:51.280
but I can only open up so many banks.

03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:54.120
The other problem is that these checks,

03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:56.440
they'll only give you so much money on a refi,

03:07:56.440 --> 03:07:58.120
usually after $100,000.

03:07:58.120 --> 03:07:59.280
They only wanna let you walk away with,

03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:01.360
let's say, $100,000.

03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:04.880
So one of the things I did was I would typically record

03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:07.480
another mortgage and have them pay that mortgage off.

03:08:08.560 --> 03:08:13.320
So I had to open, I opened a corporation to do that,

03:08:13.320 --> 03:08:14.360
so I could then turn around

03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:16.720
and go open corporate bank accounts.

03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:18.680
Because now it's not going off my information,

03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:20.160
it's going off the corporation.

03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:22.840
So I can open up multiple corporate bank accounts.

03:08:22.840 --> 03:08:24.600
These corporations are fake or real?

03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:28.040
No, no, I went to a real corporate bank attorney

03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:28.880
and had him open them.

03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:31.280
I gave him, whatever, I gave him like $1,500, $2,000,

03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:34.400
and he opened up a corporation for me, Gary Sullivan.

03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:36.160
And I then turned around and I went

03:08:36.160 --> 03:08:37.840
and opened up multiple bank accounts

03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:39.800
in that corporation's name.

03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:41.600
How are you keeping track of all this?

03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:42.920
I don't, so I'm only-

03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:44.200
Is it in your head or do you have good-

03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:48.280
I have, every single identity has its own file

03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:53.280
with plastic inlays, sleeves for their passports.

03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:55.440
That's nice and organized.

03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:56.520
It's so organized.

03:08:56.520 --> 03:08:58.520
You open this, I'm Gary now.

03:08:58.520 --> 03:09:00.120
Right, that's exactly what it is.

03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:01.600
Like you kind of go over boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:02.920
you sit in your car for a minute,

03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:04.480
you put it down, you walk in.

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:09.800
Well, what happens is it went up to like 1.5 million

03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:11.280
and I'm pulling money out of the bank

03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:13.000
and then one day I got a phone call

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.680
on Gary Sullivan's cell phone.

03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:17.320
The guy, it's a lawyer.

03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:18.160
They call up, he says,

03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:20.000
hey, I'm lawyer with Washington Mutual.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:21.120
We have an issue.

03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:23.320
I said, what's that?

03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:25.960
He says, we got a phone call from the title company.

03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:28.320
One of the title companies that I was attempting

03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:31.440
to refinance one of the pieces of property with,

03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:34.680
noticed that I, they had been sent,

03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:36.000
they'd been sent a document

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.760
that showed that I had purchased the property.

03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:42.120
And I said, I purchased it cash.

03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:45.040
And I, the documents that I purchased it cash

03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:48.880
and they got that.

03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:51.200
And there was actually a mortgage on the property.

03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:53.560
And so somehow or another they connected it

03:09:53.560 --> 03:09:55.280
and they called Washington Mutual

03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:57.080
and they said, look, there's an issue.

03:09:57.080 --> 03:10:00.440
There's a fraud, we have a fraudulent document here.

03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:03.080
And he was like, he said, so we went and we looked

03:10:03.080 --> 03:10:06.920
and it turns out that we pulled public records

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:11.320
and that there is a mortgage in front of us,

03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:13.400
several mortgages in front of us.

03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:15.280
So there's like three or four mortgages

03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:17.960
in front of me, Washington Mutual.

03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:20.240
You owe us, and it wasn't that much.

03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:23.440
It was like a hundred grand, right?

03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:25.280
Like 95 or a hundred.

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:27.040
And I said, okay.

03:10:27.920 --> 03:10:30.280
And he said, so there's an issue here.

03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:31.960
You've got a few mortgages in front of us

03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:34.200
and we're supposed to be a first mortgage.

03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:36.840
And we're not supposed to be two mortgages behind or three.

03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:40.360
And I was like, okay, sounds like an error.

03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:41.680
Not a big deal.

03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:43.000
Have you contacted law enforcement?

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:43.840
He said, no, I haven't.

03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:45.920
I was hoping we could rectify this some other way.

03:10:45.920 --> 03:10:47.360
I said, you know what, I think we can.

03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:49.360
I'm gonna have my lawyer call you back.

03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:50.720
I'm gonna go to his place right now.

03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:52.440
Give me about two hours.

03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:53.280
No problem.

03:10:53.280 --> 03:10:55.520
I immediately run, jump in my car,

03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:58.600
head towards South Carolina, call my corporate lawyer,

03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:00.440
tell him, look, I need to talk to you.

03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:01.280
Here's what's going on.

03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:02.120
I explain it to him.

03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:03.920
He doesn't really understand.

03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:05.960
He says, this sounds pretty complicated.

03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:10.960
I have a, my law partner is a criminal defense attorney.

03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:15.160
I'm gonna set up a meeting right now with all of us.

03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:16.000
Okay.

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:17.680
I get there 45 minutes later.

03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:18.520
I walk in the door.

03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:19.360
I sit down.

03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:20.720
He says, what happened?

03:11:20.720 --> 03:11:24.280
I said, they said, Gary, this doesn't sound right.

03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:25.360
What happened?

03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:27.560
I said, okay, so listen, bought this house.

03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:29.880
I bought it cash.

03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:31.160
I then refinanced it.

03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:33.960
I didn't buy it cash, but I told him, I bought it cash.

03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:37.520
I refinanced it like four or five times

03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:38.680
within a day or two of each other.

03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:40.280
And they were like, how is that even possible?

03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:41.640
I was like, well, I went to different title companies

03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:42.640
and I explained how I do it.

03:11:42.640 --> 03:11:44.920
I said, Washington Mutual just found out

03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:47.800
that they're in like second position or third position.

03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:50.280
Or I said, but they're probably,

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:51.520
they may be in fourth position.

03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:54.480
You know, they mail these things in, so you never know.

03:11:54.480 --> 03:11:57.040
And he was like, oh my God.

03:11:57.040 --> 03:11:59.400
He's like, that's, what do you wanna do?

03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:01.600
I said, I want you to contact them

03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:04.400
and agree for them to not contact the authorities

03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:06.960
provided we pay them, I paid them off.

03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:07.800
He's, do you have the money?

03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:08.640
I said, I do have the money.

03:12:08.640 --> 03:12:10.800
I can go get the money right now.

03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:12.360
He calls the lawyer.

03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:14.640
They, this is back when faxes, right?

03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:16.360
So they fax some documents back and forth.

03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:19.360
They make, they do a couple emails back and forth

03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:21.720
and they have a conversation.

03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:23.280
I remember the lawyer started arguing

03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:26.760
cause he wanted to charge me like yield spread

03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:27.720
and fees and stuff.

03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:29.160
And I was like, what are you talking about?

03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:30.000
Like, I'll pay it.

03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:32.680
So it ends up being a little over a hundred thousand.

03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:33.760
And I'm like, that's it.

03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:35.400
So he's like, okay.

03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:39.600
And so he says, okay, that sounds good.

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:41.840
And so he said, okay, all you have to do

03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:43.520
is go get the check.

03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:46.120
And he said, bring it to a Washington mutual branch.

03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:46.940
Tell them to call.

03:12:46.940 --> 03:12:49.160
I said, I'm not going in a Washington mutual branch, bro.

03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:50.400
I'll bring you the check.

03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:51.360
So he calls him back.

03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:52.200
He's not doing that.

03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:54.520
And he's like, okay, I'm not, I'll bring it here.

03:12:54.520 --> 03:12:55.360
You guys take care.

03:12:55.360 --> 03:12:56.240
He said, no problem.

03:12:56.240 --> 03:12:58.640
Okay, hang up the phone.

03:12:58.640 --> 03:12:59.480
And he turns to me and he says,

03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:00.440
okay, well, we have a problem.

03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:01.480
He said, we still have the problem

03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:03.680
of these other mortgages.

03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:05.060
And I went, right.

03:13:05.060 --> 03:13:08.120
And he said, and he goes, okay, well,

03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:09.440
I said, they don't know anything.

03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:11.620
He said, I know, but Gary, he said,

03:13:12.660 --> 03:13:14.040
what if they find out?

03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:15.960
I said, they find out that they're like in second,

03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:17.480
third and fourth place.

03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:18.320
He's like, right.

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:20.360
I said, I leave town.

03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:22.160
And he went, so they both laugh.

03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:25.160
They go, Gary, you can't just leave town.

03:13:26.120 --> 03:13:28.280
They have a copy of your driver's license.

03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:29.560
They have your social security number.

03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:30.800
They have your birth certificate.

03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:31.880
I said, they'll find you.

03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:33.040
It's the FBI.

03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:36.280
And I go, you're assuming I'm Gary Sullivan.

03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:37.840
Wow, you tell them.

03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:40.280
And he, listen, they looked at me and they went,

03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:44.680
and I remember he said, he goes,

03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:47.600
we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:48.420
I said, it's right.

03:13:48.420 --> 03:13:51.240
My immediate problem is getting rid of these people.

03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:52.660
And he goes, right, right.

03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:57.920
So I go get the check, bring it back, give it to them.

03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:59.960
Never called the FBI.

03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:02.680
I can't believe you got away with the Washington Mutual.

03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:04.360
Oh, no, this is-

03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:07.640
I mean, these are all really close calls, it seems like.

03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:09.880
No, this is the close call.

03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:11.040
I have two more close calls

03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:14.440
that my hands sweat thinking about it.

03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:20.040
I walk into Wachovia.

03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:22.200
I just opened this account two months ago.

03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:23.340
So it's a new account.

03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:24.560
So whenever I would go in there and I'd say,

03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:27.440
hey, I need a $7,000, $6,000,

03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:28.640
anything over $3,000,

03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:30.680
they had to call to get permission, right?

03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:32.640
Like authorization.

03:14:32.640 --> 03:14:34.080
So she was like, okay, I gotta go call.

03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:35.280
I said, no problem.

03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:37.720
So the girl walks in the back,

03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:38.600
I'm sitting there waiting.

03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.600
All of a sudden, a massive person reaches over my hand

03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:46.160
and grabs my wrist.

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:47.640
And somebody grabs it from the other one

03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:49.940
and they pull my hands behind my back.

03:14:49.940 --> 03:14:52.940
These are two of possibly the largest law enforcement

03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:54.880
officers I've ever seen in my entire life.

03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:56.660
And they're massive.

03:14:56.660 --> 03:15:00.980
And they handcuff me and they say,

03:15:00.980 --> 03:15:05.500
you're Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained.

03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:09.100
We're taking you into custody and putting you,

03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:12.060
we're holding you until a detective gets here.

03:15:12.060 --> 03:15:12.900
Who are these guys?

03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:15.340
Is this US Marshals or is this cops or what?

03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:16.740
These are sheriff's deputies.

03:15:16.740 --> 03:15:17.700
Sheriff's deputies, okay.

03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:20.780
And as they walk me in the back,

03:15:20.780 --> 03:15:22.660
they're calling me Mr. Sullivan.

03:15:22.660 --> 03:15:24.680
They sit me down.

03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:28.960
And by now, the Secret Service are looking for me.

03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:30.280
They're calling me,

03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:32.640
well, they were calling us John and Jane Doe,

03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:34.680
but now they figured out who we were.

03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:37.800
And so now I'm on the Secret Service's most wanted list.

03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:41.240
I'm not like number one at that, right?

03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:42.220
Like I probably was,

03:15:42.220 --> 03:15:45.720
but we just found out I was on that list.

03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:47.360
So it's getting bad.

03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:49.360
So they sit me down and I'm waiting.

03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:52.400
And I remember thinking that the FBI was coming.

03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:54.400
I don't really know.

03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:55.240
At that point,

03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:56.680
I couldn't tell you the difference between everybody.

03:15:56.680 --> 03:15:59.600
And then five minutes go by and you know,

03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:00.840
I'm sitting there going, what is going on?

03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:01.840
Do you guys have any idea what's going on?

03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:03.520
They're like, we don't know.

03:16:03.520 --> 03:16:04.520
We're just grunts.

03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:05.800
We just do what we're told.

03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:07.480
So suddenly this guy walks in.

03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:09.600
He's probably in his early thirties.

03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:12.600
Maybe he walks in gray suit.

03:16:12.600 --> 03:16:14.160
I think he looks like he's FBI.

03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:16.740
He says, hey, I'm a detective with the,

03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:19.600
I want to say Richland County, you know, whatever,

03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:22.200
sheriff's department or police department, whatever.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:23.840
And I was like, oh, okay.

03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:24.880
And he says, yeah, listen, we've got an issue.

03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:26.880
Wachovia Wachovia wants this.

03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:28.680
They want us to arrest you.

03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:31.800
He said that they they're saying that you've got

03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:35.840
three mortgages on, on your house.

03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:37.360
And I go, is that illegal?

03:16:38.200 --> 03:16:40.480
And he looked at me and he went, you know, to be honest,

03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:41.320
I don't know.

03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:44.200
And I, I, and I distinctly remember thinking

03:16:44.200 --> 03:16:45.520
I'm walking out of here.

03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:46.960
All I have to do is convince this guy.

03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:47.920
I haven't done anything wrong.

03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:49.760
He's already said he doesn't know.

03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:51.240
So he gets on the phone with the head

03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:53.600
of Wachovia's fraud department.

03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:56.440
And he's telling saying this guy is running

03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:58.920
what's called a shotgunning scam,

03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:00.560
which is absolutely right.

03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:02.280
And so what is the shotgun?

03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:05.360
It's where you're, you, you close on so many loans

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:07.840
simultaneously, they can't catch it.

03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:11.240
Anyway, they, they start going back and forth

03:17:11.240 --> 03:17:13.680
and he's on the phone and he's like,

03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:15.040
why did you close three loans?

03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:18.440
And I said, I, you know, what, why are you pulling?

03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:19.560
I said, it's not illegal.

03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:21.560
I have a first mortgage, a second mortgage

03:17:21.560 --> 03:17:23.760
and a home equity line of credit.

03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:25.280
That's perfectly legal.

03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:26.640
And he goes, and you can hear the guy,

03:17:26.640 --> 03:17:28.440
that's not, they're all first mortgages.

03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:30.240
And I said, I read every one of those documents.

03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:32.360
Not one of them said they were first mortgages

03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:33.320
and they don't.

03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:35.160
First mortgages don't say they're first mortgages.

03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:37.200
It's the placement of the mortgage,

03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:38.480
placement of the lien that determines

03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:40.440
is their first, second or third.

03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:43.040
So it's possible that I wouldn't have known it.

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:44.640
Certainly that I could have read those documents

03:17:44.640 --> 03:17:45.480
and not known.

03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:47.840
And he's like, that's not true.

03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:48.920
And he's screaming.

03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:51.640
So I go, yeah, listen.

03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:53.920
And he said, well, you're taking out all cash.

03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:54.880
Why are you taking out all cash?

03:17:54.880 --> 03:17:56.720
I said, well, I mean, I don't know if this sounds,

03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:57.960
I said, I don't know, this might be illegal.

03:17:57.960 --> 03:17:58.800
I said, I don't know.

03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:03.800
I said, I mean, I work for a labor company,

03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:05.480
labor on demand.

03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:09.560
I pull out my business card.

03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:10.840
You can call.

03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:12.520
So I'm like, I work for labor on demand.

03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:15.840
And I said, we hire a lot of guys

03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:16.880
that like they don't have banking out.

03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:18.600
So the company pays them.

03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:20.600
And then usually I'll pull out money

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:23.280
and I'll cash their checks because they get charged

03:18:23.280 --> 03:18:25.040
like 10% of these check cashing companies.

03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:25.880
And I feel bad.

03:18:25.880 --> 03:18:26.720
I know the checks are good.

03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:28.040
So I just deposit them.

03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:28.880
I mean, I don't think that,

03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:30.280
I said, but I don't know if that's illegal.

03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:31.160
I don't think that's illegal.

03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:32.960
Like if, and he's like, no, no, no, that's fine.

03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:34.480
That's a decent thing to do.

03:18:34.480 --> 03:18:35.520
It's not, that's fine.

03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:37.280
I'm like, oh, okay.

03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:39.720
So he's talking to the guy

03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:42.080
and you know, Wachovia is screaming and hollering.

03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:45.680
He says, he's doing that.

03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:47.200
He's going back and forth, back and forth.

03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:49.200
So we're going back and forth

03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:53.400
and I'm just derailing everything this guy says.

03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:56.600
And at one point he says,

03:18:56.600 --> 03:18:58.440
he's screaming, he's committing fraud.

03:18:58.440 --> 03:18:59.920
We want him arrested.

03:18:59.920 --> 03:19:02.000
And he's like, I don't know what to charge him with.

03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:07.000
And he's like, you know, he's saying these aren't,

03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:10.240
you know, how did you, you know, how did you,

03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:12.200
he's like, hey, look, how did you even do this?

03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:14.800
I go, look, I didn't do this.

03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:16.040
He said, I came to Wachovia.

03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:17.360
I met with a loan officer.

03:19:17.360 --> 03:19:18.520
I said, I need a first mortgage.

03:19:18.520 --> 03:19:19.920
I need to pull out like a hundred thousand dollars.

03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:21.280
I want to start buying houses.

03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:22.120
He says, that's right.

03:19:22.120 --> 03:19:23.320
You own another house here too, don't you?

03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:24.680
I said, I do.

03:19:24.680 --> 03:19:26.080
I said, we're putting a new roof on it.

03:19:26.080 --> 03:19:27.120
We're going to build an addition.

03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:28.240
We're putting in a pool.

03:19:28.240 --> 03:19:29.920
I'm buying one right down the street from that one.

03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:33.200
I said, so I'm obviously, I'm pulling out money.

03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:36.320
I said, so I told him I need a hundred thousand dollars.

03:19:36.320 --> 03:19:37.520
They said, that's fine.

03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:39.960
They said they could only get me a hundred thousand dollars

03:19:39.960 --> 03:19:43.880
out for something about Fannie Mae guidelines, which is true.

03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:48.040
And I said, so then she said, I can get you,

03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:49.920
I can send you to a friend of mine who's a loan officer.

03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:51.920
She can get you a second mortgage, which she did.

03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:54.240
I said, then I told her she could only get me

03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:56.760
a hundred thousand or so, 190,000 in the out.

03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:59.160
And she said, you should get an equity line of credit

03:19:59.160 --> 03:20:02.760
if you're going to be doing like renovating properties.

03:20:02.760 --> 03:20:03.800
So she sent me to somebody

03:20:03.800 --> 03:20:05.000
and they got me an equity line of credit.

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:09.400
I said, I haven't committed fraud.

03:20:09.400 --> 03:20:11.920
I said, I wouldn't know how to commit fraud if you told me.

03:20:11.920 --> 03:20:14.480
I said, what sounds more reasonable?

03:20:14.480 --> 03:20:16.480
A guy that works for a labor company

03:20:18.680 --> 03:20:21.800
ripped off a bunch of banks for over half a million dollars.

03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:24.240
I said, or some loan officers got together

03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:25.640
and did something illegal.

03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:28.080
I said, there's a problem at the bank.

03:20:28.080 --> 03:20:31.000
And he says, I think you've got a problem at the bank.

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.840
And this guy goes nuts.

03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:35.080
And while he's screaming, he needs to be arrested.

03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:35.960
This is fraud.

03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:38.680
My loan officers have not done anything illegal.

03:20:38.680 --> 03:20:40.400
They wouldn't do that.

03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:42.200
He says, look at his ID.

03:20:42.200 --> 03:20:44.080
His ID is fake.

03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:46.560
His ID starts with zero, zero, zero.

03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:51.440
South Carolina IDs start with zero, zero, zero.

03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:53.280
This guy's in California.

03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:54.760
He has no idea.

03:20:54.760 --> 03:20:56.240
So when he says that,

03:20:58.600 --> 03:21:01.600
the detective looks at my ID and he goes,

03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:06.200
listen, he said, this is a real ID.

03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:08.600
I ran this guy through NCIC.

03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:11.560
He said, this is Gary Sullivan.

03:21:12.720 --> 03:21:15.320
And I looked at him, I go, now I'm not Gary Sullivan.

03:21:15.320 --> 03:21:17.320
I go, come on, bro, what are we doing here?

03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:19.200
And he goes, I know, Gary, I know.

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:23.440
And he says, I'm gonna take him downtown.

03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:26.840
I'm going to talk to my, whatever,

03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:28.400
lieutenant, whoever, captain,

03:21:28.400 --> 03:21:30.200
and I'm gonna fill out a police report

03:21:30.200 --> 03:21:31.720
and I'll let you know.

03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:32.560
And he hangs up.

03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:36.560
I get up, they've taken the handcuffs off.

03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:38.520
I stand up.

03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:41.320
As we're walking out with the detectives,

03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:42.840
as we're all kind of walking out,

03:21:42.840 --> 03:21:44.280
he goes, hey, you have an ID.

03:21:44.280 --> 03:21:46.360
Do you have a driver's license?

03:21:46.360 --> 03:21:49.680
And I went, I do, but it's in like Nevada.

03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:51.920
And he goes, oh, that's right.

03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.720
He goes, you're from Vegas.

03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:57.920
And he looks at the two deputies and they all kind of grin.

03:21:57.920 --> 03:22:01.920
And I think he ran me through NCIC,

03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:05.600
which means he ran a statewide criminal database,

03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:07.360
which means he thinks I've been arrested

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:09.760
three times for prostitution in Vegas.

03:22:09.760 --> 03:22:10.760
Right.

03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:13.320
I listen, I'm humiliated.

03:22:14.240 --> 03:22:16.800
I was just like, and the grin told me,

03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:19.400
and I was just like, oh man.

03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:22.800
And so one of the cops goes, here, give me the ID.

03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:25.080
Takes the ID, he goes, I'll check and see.

03:22:25.080 --> 03:22:27.280
Because I have to follow him back in my car.

03:22:28.360 --> 03:22:32.720
So he goes, and by the way, my car is in the name

03:22:33.760 --> 03:22:35.480
Michael Eckert.

03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:37.680
So Michael Eckert, he doesn't have a photograph

03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:38.720
of Michael Eckert.

03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:39.560
Right.

03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:42.280
Because you can't pull up photographs from other states.

03:22:43.320 --> 03:22:44.520
So he doesn't have a photograph,

03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:46.720
but he knows that's not my car.

03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:48.240
And he asked me, whose car are you driving?

03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:50.200
I said, oh, that's my boss, Michael Eckert.

03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:51.280
I said, that's my boss.

03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:52.120
And he goes, oh, Michael Eckert.

03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:53.520
I said, yeah, exactly.

03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:55.640
And he's like, and I'm like, oh my God.

03:22:55.640 --> 03:22:58.120
So I'm thinking he knows Michael Eckert,

03:22:58.120 --> 03:23:00.480
knows it's registered in North Carolina,

03:23:00.480 --> 03:23:02.960
knows the address, which is where I was currently living.

03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:04.200
That's a problem.

03:23:04.200 --> 03:23:07.280
So the police officer or the, I'm sorry,

03:23:07.280 --> 03:23:11.040
deputy grabs the ID, walks outside, comes back.

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:12.640
I have no idea if this homeless guy

03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:14.840
has a driver's license in Nevada.

03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:15.680
I don't know.

03:23:15.680 --> 03:23:17.040
He had nothing on him.

03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:19.560
He comes back and he goes, does he have a valid license?

03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:20.600
He goes, yeah, it's valid.

03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:24.000
And he hands it to him, or he hands me the ID

03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.400
and he says, he goes, it's valid.

03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:29.080
And he looked at me and he goes, yeah, well.

03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:32.440
He said, it says he's like, he says he's five foot 11.

03:23:32.480 --> 03:23:35.160
Like, it was like five, 10, five, 11.

03:23:35.160 --> 03:23:36.920
I'm clearly not five, 10 or five, 11.

03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:38.760
And they all look at me and I go,

03:23:38.760 --> 03:23:41.360
fellas with a good pair of shoes like that.

03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:44.760
And they all go, ha ha ha, follow us, Gary.

03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:48.720
I follow them back to the police station.

03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:53.480
Becky is calling me on the phone, screaming her head off.

03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:58.240
Now I'd always told Becky, if I ever get arrested,

03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:03.280
yeah, immediately go get me a lawyer.

03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:06.400
The lawyer will be able to get me out on bond

03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.960
because I'll be arrested for something stupid.

03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:11.840
I said, it'll be something like trying to cash a check,

03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:14.920
you know, a fake check or, you know, use of something.

03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:16.680
I said, it won't be, all my IDs are real.

03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:18.080
So it won't be for a fake ID.

03:24:18.080 --> 03:24:20.600
So my ID won't be in question.

03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:25.600
And most police departments and sheriffs at that time

03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:30.000
did not run your fingerprints through APHIS.

03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.480
So they didn't, because they charge them for that.

03:24:32.480 --> 03:24:33.680
So they don't typically do it

03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:35.280
unless your identity is in question.

03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:36.120
Mine wouldn't be.

03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:39.800
I have a valid driver's license or a valid ID in that state.

03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:41.320
So I go back, she's screaming.

03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:43.320
She's like, oh my God, you don't understand.

03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:48.320
I just checked the internet, the website.

03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:52.000
You are number one on the secret services

03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:52.960
most wanted list.

03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:56.280
And I was like, I got bigger problems right now.

03:24:56.280 --> 03:24:57.320
They just held me in the bank.

03:24:57.320 --> 03:24:59.760
I'm following them right now.

03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:03.320
And she was like, get on the interstate, go, go.

03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:06.000
I cannot go, the detective's in front of me.

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:07.720
The cops are behind me.

03:25:07.720 --> 03:25:09.040
They're escorting me to the police.

03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:10.680
Listen, she's like, oh my God, run, run.

03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:13.560
I go, look, I'm not a NASCAR driver.

03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:17.000
Like I'm driving, it's a sports car,

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.040
but it's not gonna outrun a radio or a helicopter.

03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:20.360
Like I have not, that's not gonna happen.

03:25:20.360 --> 03:25:21.880
I know it looks, it seems nice.

03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:22.840
I'm not that guy.

03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:24.840
So I was like, I can't.

03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:25.680
I said, look, you don't understand.

03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:27.000
I was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago.

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.280
I just talked my way out of them.

03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:29.560
I'm gonna get out of this.

03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:33.160
And I said, the worst that happens is I'll be arrested

03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:36.080
as Gary Sullivan.

03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:40.920
You can get me a police, you can get me an attorney.

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:42.080
He can get me out.

03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:44.800
And she goes, I'm not getting you an attorney.

03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:47.160
I'm not getting your hump on.

03:25:47.160 --> 03:25:50.320
I'm not risking everything I've got for you.

03:25:50.320 --> 03:25:52.160
Because she has all the money.

03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:55.640
We've got seven, $800,000 at this point.

03:25:57.800 --> 03:25:59.000
Oh, and by the way,

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.240
she's not even in North Carolina at this point.

03:26:01.240 --> 03:26:05.000
She's relocated to Houston, Texas.

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:08.280
Because when this scam fell apart,

03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:10.400
we were gonna move to Texas.

03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:12.320
So we were already moving there.

03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:16.400
But by the way, just a small tangent,

03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:19.000
where do you store money in situations like this

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:22.280
that like when you talk about 800,000,

03:26:22.280 --> 03:26:23.920
do you have to keep moving accounts

03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:27.120
to make sure it's not accessible by FBI?

03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:29.280
Well, there's about six or 700,000 accounts.

03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:31.600
But keep in mind, I'm getting that out in cash.

03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:32.840
Like there's no Bitcoin.

03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:34.880
There's no, none of that stuff exists.

03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:37.920
So my, you know, I probably should have bought diamonds

03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:40.640
or bought gold or bought like, I don't know any of that.

03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:43.800
All I could think of is go in slowly, be patient.

03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:48.280
Don't drain the accounts, you know, fluctuate them.

03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:51.120
Like I was writing, getting cashier's checks

03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:53.280
from one account to another.

03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:55.360
So the balances were doing this, you know,

03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:58.080
they weren't just going, they were doing this.

03:26:58.080 --> 03:26:59.640
And then one day, boom, they're gone.

03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:00.560
Okay, got it.

03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:04.440
So we got out like, whatever.

03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:06.400
We got now like six or 700,000.

03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:08.960
There's still like six or 700,000 in the bank,

03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:10.760
but I'm not going back, I'm done.

03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:12.040
I actually, to be honest with you.

03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:14.680
So, well, look, I go in.

03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:16.840
So I go into the police station.

03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:19.760
And what first she says,

03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:22.800
if you go in the police station, I'm done.

03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:24.400
If you get arrested, you're done.

03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:26.080
I said, well, then I better not get arrested.

03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:29.040
I hang up the phone, cop standing behind my car.

03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:30.840
Get out, I go in the police station.

03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:33.960
I walk in, I fill out the police report.

03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:36.720
He tells me, I got to talk to my captain real quick.

03:27:36.720 --> 03:27:37.560
Can you wait?

03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:38.880
He couldn't leave me in his cubicle.

03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:40.320
He goes, can you wait in the hallway?

03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:42.400
I can't leave you in the, I said, no, no problem.

03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:43.840
So I go and I wait in the hallway.

03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:47.800
In the hallway are a whole wall full of, on the corkboard.

03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:51.080
Wanted posters, black and white, black and white,

03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:54.880
like, you know, car thief, you know, rapist, murderer,

03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:58.240
secret services, most wanted.

03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:01.000
And I'm on the, on my face is right there.

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.720
I'm like, holy Jesus.

03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:06.920
And, you know, everything in me told me,

03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:08.600
run bro, just fucking haul ash right now.

03:28:08.600 --> 03:28:12.000
Right now, just go, your luck's run out.

03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:13.640
Not that I even thought it was, there were so many,

03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:15.800
I didn't think he was going to see it.

03:28:15.840 --> 03:28:19.240
But it just, everything in me just said, run.

03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:22.280
The problem is if you've ever been into a police station,

03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:23.680
you're not getting out of it.

03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:24.520
Do you understand?

03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:26.040
There's a lot of cops around.

03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:28.680
Well, not just that, but they buzz you in.

03:28:28.680 --> 03:28:30.880
You get in the elevator, you have to punch in a code.

03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:32.800
You have to punch in a code to get back out of the elevator.

03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:34.480
You have to punch in a code to get into the next door.

03:28:34.480 --> 03:28:37.960
There's like, I mean, it was, it's impossible.

03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:40.160
Like I'm never, I'm not going to get in the elevator.

03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:42.960
So guy comes back up, the cop comes back up.

03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:45.440
He said, hey, Gary, appreciate it.

03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:46.280
No problem.

03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:47.560
My captain said, we're good.

03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:50.240
We're going to wait for a phone call from the, no,

03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:52.920
the district attorney called already.

03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:54.240
They're looking into it.

03:28:55.760 --> 03:28:57.560
I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

03:28:58.520 --> 03:28:59.360
I go downstairs.

03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:00.720
He walks me out to my car.

03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:02.920
He said, look, do me a favor.

03:29:02.920 --> 03:29:05.200
He's like, we do have some serious questions at this point.

03:29:05.200 --> 03:29:07.120
Like the district attorney said, there's some,

03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:09.040
something is up.

03:29:09.040 --> 03:29:11.560
He said, I said, not with me.

03:29:11.560 --> 03:29:13.240
And he said, well, just do me a favor.

03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:14.720
He goes, don't leave town.

03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:16.280
I said, bro, I own two houses here.

03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:17.600
I'm not going anywhere.

03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:18.440
I said, I'm telling you right now.

03:29:18.440 --> 03:29:20.920
I said, Wachovia, they, they fucked up.

03:29:20.920 --> 03:29:22.040
And he's like, I believe you.

03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:22.880
I believe you.

03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:23.720
He said, I worry.

03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:24.560
He said, whatever.

03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:25.480
He's like, I hope you, I hope they were right.

03:29:25.480 --> 03:29:26.880
I'm sure you're right.

03:29:26.880 --> 03:29:28.600
Okay. So I get in my car.

03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:29.440
I leave.

03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:32.080
I go to two more banks, pull out more money.

03:29:32.080 --> 03:29:33.640
But at one point I go into a bank

03:29:33.640 --> 03:29:36.840
and like two of the cashiers practically slam

03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:38.320
into each other, trying to get to the phone.

03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:39.880
And I could tell something's up.

03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:41.280
Like, oh, no, no, no, no, something's up.

03:29:41.280 --> 03:29:43.000
So I back, I get my car back out.

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.400
One of them even just kind of runs out

03:29:44.400 --> 03:29:46.360
and looks at the tag number, you know?

03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:47.640
So I drive, I get in the interstate.

03:29:47.640 --> 03:29:50.760
I go, you know, Becky, of course, she's, you know,

03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:53.600
I'm sorry, I, I love you.

03:29:53.600 --> 03:29:54.680
I would have never done that.

03:29:54.680 --> 03:29:55.520
I was just scared.

03:29:55.520 --> 03:29:56.360
I understand.

03:29:57.560 --> 03:29:58.400
I go-

03:29:58.400 --> 03:29:59.280
Becky sounds like a handful.

03:29:59.280 --> 03:30:00.280
Oh my God, bro.

03:30:02.120 --> 03:30:04.440
So I go all the way back to Charlotte.

03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:05.720
I pack up my apartment.

03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:08.600
I drive all the way to Houston

03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:10.520
with my entire apartment packed up, by the way,

03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:12.200
in a U-Haul, like the next day,

03:30:12.200 --> 03:30:13.800
the next morning we pack,

03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:16.320
she's got people there packing it up, movers.

03:30:17.840 --> 03:30:18.840
We pack it up.

03:30:18.840 --> 03:30:21.280
I drive the U-Haul all the way to Houston.

03:30:21.280 --> 03:30:22.440
Takes a couple of days.

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:28.560
I unload it into, we have some guys unload it into a,

03:30:29.520 --> 03:30:31.200
into a storage unit,

03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:32.400
because I'm going to stay with Becky

03:30:32.400 --> 03:30:34.080
until I find my own apartment.

03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:36.880
As we're driving around the neighborhood, super nice.

03:30:36.880 --> 03:30:38.800
She's living in like, whatever, like on like that

03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:42.400
20th floor or something of some huge high rise,

03:30:42.400 --> 03:30:43.400
great apartment.

03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:46.920
We drive by and I go, oh, stop the car.

03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:48.120
And I go, I want to get out.

03:30:48.120 --> 03:30:49.880
And it was one of those cone things

03:30:49.880 --> 03:30:52.720
where there's flyers for the house, for a house.

03:30:52.720 --> 03:30:54.920
I jump out and I get the flyer.

03:30:54.920 --> 03:30:56.800
And she's like, what are you doing?

03:30:56.800 --> 03:30:57.760
I go, well, I just want to, you know,

03:30:57.760 --> 03:30:59.560
I just look at the flyer.

03:30:59.560 --> 03:31:01.880
And she says, I don't want to do a scam here.

03:31:01.880 --> 03:31:02.720
I want to live here.

03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:03.560
This place is nice.

03:31:03.560 --> 03:31:04.400
I love it here.

03:31:04.400 --> 03:31:06.240
And I went, right, I understand.

03:31:06.240 --> 03:31:07.080
I said, I'm not going to, I said, no,

03:31:07.080 --> 03:31:09.280
but I have a fine, an apartment.

03:31:09.280 --> 03:31:12.440
And she goes, oh, you just, I'm just so disgusting.

03:31:12.440 --> 03:31:15.840
You can't stand to spend even a couple of weeks with me.

03:31:15.840 --> 03:31:18.200
You just, and she goes, just ballistic.

03:31:18.200 --> 03:31:21.240
She's screaming at the top of her lungs.

03:31:21.240 --> 03:31:23.200
And I know she's going to get me caught.

03:31:24.200 --> 03:31:26.640
She's never going to get me out, right?

03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:28.560
She's already told me that.

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:30.400
So we go back to the apartment.

03:31:30.400 --> 03:31:31.560
We go upstairs.

03:31:33.680 --> 03:31:36.160
I was so scared of this chick, bro.

03:31:36.160 --> 03:31:37.000
I was so scared.

03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:39.000
I remember I was going up in the elevator

03:31:40.040 --> 03:31:44.320
and this girl gets on this, clearly a stripper.

03:31:44.320 --> 03:31:49.320
I mean, drop dead, just, but wearing stripper clothes.

03:31:49.760 --> 03:31:52.600
And I'm staring like, and as soon as she got on,

03:31:52.600 --> 03:31:54.560
Becky gave me that, where the face.

03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:56.960
And I'm like this, I'm like staring in the corner

03:31:58.120 --> 03:31:59.720
and never look at the girl.

03:31:59.720 --> 03:32:02.400
And I remember we get off the elevator, it opens.

03:32:02.400 --> 03:32:04.200
I bolt off it.

03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:07.480
Becky bolts office and I off the elevator.

03:32:07.480 --> 03:32:09.040
And I remember she squeals,

03:32:10.040 --> 03:32:12.440
I bet you just love to fuck that tramp.

03:32:12.440 --> 03:32:14.400
And the girl, as the elevator doors are closing,

03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:15.600
she goes, hey.

03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:18.600
I thought that was funny.

03:32:18.600 --> 03:32:20.800
So I go to the apartment.

03:32:23.280 --> 03:32:25.640
We have a screaming match, kind of.

03:32:26.600 --> 03:32:28.640
Tell her I want to split up the money.

03:32:28.640 --> 03:32:31.400
She tells me she's not going to give me split the money.

03:32:31.400 --> 03:32:32.600
Why?

03:32:32.600 --> 03:32:36.080
Because she said, you can go somewhere else

03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:37.920
and do this again.

03:32:37.920 --> 03:32:41.920
You'll have a million dollars in six months, you know?

03:32:41.920 --> 03:32:44.520
I have to live off this money.

03:32:44.520 --> 03:32:45.760
Did she threaten you?

03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:47.720
Oh, she threatened the, it was funny too

03:32:47.720 --> 03:32:49.000
because the conversation back and forth,

03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:50.880
I remember saying, no, I want to have it.

03:32:50.880 --> 03:32:54.280
And she goes, and she said, I'll give you $10,000.

03:32:54.280 --> 03:32:55.600
I said, you're out of your mind.

03:32:55.600 --> 03:32:56.880
I said, I'm telling right now,

03:32:56.880 --> 03:32:59.400
you come up with something reasonable, I'll take all of it.

03:32:59.400 --> 03:33:02.360
And she said, what did she say?

03:33:02.360 --> 03:33:03.200
I said, I'll take all of it.

03:33:03.200 --> 03:33:04.080
She's in what?

03:33:04.080 --> 03:33:05.600
Escape in that U-Haul they're going to,

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:08.240
she has a cops are going to be looking for in five minutes.

03:33:08.240 --> 03:33:10.400
And I went, I just remember thinking, oh, wow.

03:33:10.400 --> 03:33:12.040
And keep in mind, all of my IDs,

03:33:12.040 --> 03:33:14.240
everything are in the storage unit that she has a key to.

03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:15.920
Like I'm not getting those, it's over.

03:33:15.920 --> 03:33:19.720
I got an ID right now that says, my name is Michael Eckert.

03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:23.480
I am driving, I got, I'm driving a U-Haul van.

03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:26.600
Yeah, sounds like she has a lot of negotiation leverage.

03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:28.480
Right, so we start arguing back and forth

03:33:28.480 --> 03:33:30.520
and she says, $100,000.

03:33:30.520 --> 03:33:31.360
I'll give you 100,000.

03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:32.280
I said, I'll take it.

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:35.560
She counts it out, counts out the 100,000.

03:33:35.560 --> 03:33:37.720
Later when I recounted, it wasn't even 100,000.

03:33:37.720 --> 03:33:38.880
It was like 98,000.

03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:39.720
That's fine, that's fine.

03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:41.840
So, but you know, we've got them all marked,

03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:43.560
you know, 2000, 5,000, 6,000.

03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:46.200
And she's like, 2,000, 5,000, that's 12,000.

03:33:46.200 --> 03:33:48.000
She ends up stiffening me.

03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:49.520
That's fine, it's not my money.

03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:51.800
So I take it.

03:33:51.800 --> 03:33:54.080
I end up, you know, I take it.

03:33:54.080 --> 03:33:55.360
I leave and as I'm leaving,

03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:57.000
she'd always called me before on the phone

03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:58.480
and begged and pleaded and cried.

03:33:58.480 --> 03:34:00.120
I messed up, please give me a chance.

03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:02.440
I'm sorry, I'll take my medication.

03:34:02.440 --> 03:34:03.640
I'm sorry, I thought it was better.

03:34:03.640 --> 03:34:04.480
I thought it was okay.

03:34:04.480 --> 03:34:05.520
And I remember walking out,

03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:08.880
I put my cell phone on the counter and just walked out,

03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:11.920
went downstairs, got in the truck and drove.

03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:18.920
And drove, when I got to Louisiana,

03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:23.760
I stopped at Baton Rouge and got a,

03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:26.640
I mean, at some point I stopped and I got like,

03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:29.200
I think I got a room or something.

03:34:29.200 --> 03:34:31.000
At one point, I know I stopped.

03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:32.800
So you drove without a plan, essentially?

03:34:32.800 --> 03:34:37.280
I drove back to Charlotte to get my car.

03:34:37.280 --> 03:34:38.120
Got it.

03:34:38.120 --> 03:34:41.240
So I can't be driving, I can't be driving this truck.

03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:45.080
So I stopped at Baton Rouge at one point

03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:49.360
and got a cell phone, you know, like a burner phone,

03:34:49.360 --> 03:34:52.840
like a Verizon Virgin mobile or something,

03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:53.680
one of those little phones.

03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:55.080
So I bought one.

03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:58.520
I call a few people at home, back home, called my mom.

03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:01.640
She's in tears, crying.

03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:03.600
My dad's yelling in the background.

03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:05.400
I call...

03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:07.520
What's your mom, just a small attention,

03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:09.160
what did your mom and dad say?

03:35:09.160 --> 03:35:11.480
Did your mom anything stand out to you?

03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:14.520
My dad, you know, you know,

03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:15.960
well, I hope you're happy.

03:35:15.960 --> 03:35:16.800
You know, your mother,

03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:20.080
every time someone mentions your name, your mother cries.

03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:22.160
Which is funny to me, cause like growing up,

03:35:22.160 --> 03:35:25.360
like he was never concerned about her crying, you know?

03:35:25.360 --> 03:35:28.920
So it was like, since when did you care, you know?

03:35:29.760 --> 03:35:33.400
And I just, so, I mean, my dad, like, he's an alcoholic.

03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:36.720
You know, he's been sober for two years,

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:40.760
a month and a half drunk, drunken binge,

03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:42.240
or drinking, sorry, drinking binge,

03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:44.720
and then sober for six months and then did it again.

03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:47.000
And sober, you know, it just went back and forth.

03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:52.000
And in and out of alcohol, you know, drug programs.

03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:54.160
But like I said, it worked for State Farm

03:35:54.160 --> 03:35:58.120
and State Farm, he was a top selling manager.

03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:00.360
And so what they would do is they put them

03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:02.040
into a 30 day program.

03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:05.080
And I mean, like he has to stay there.

03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:07.080
And they were the only ones that had that kind of control.

03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:08.240
Cause they're like, you're gonna do this

03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:12.080
and you're gonna pass it or we're firing you, you know?

03:36:12.080 --> 03:36:13.280
He made a lot of money

03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:16.000
and he made a lot of money for State Farm and he hired,

03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:19.000
he hired and trained a ton of agents

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:22.000
and he had one of the top performing agencies.

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:23.920
So he was worth a lot to them.

03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:28.960
And so I end up, what ends up happening is

03:36:30.560 --> 03:36:32.480
I'm driving through, I get that phone

03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:34.120
that I was telling you about and I call.

03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:36.400
So I call, talk to my mom.

03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:37.840
She's, you know, she's crying.

03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:39.160
She's like, I love you so much.

03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:41.760
You know, I just wanna make sure you're safe.

03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:43.640
I ended up calling Susan Barkow,

03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:46.400
which was one of the brokers that worked for me at the time.

03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:48.120
Call her and I say, hey, what's going on?

03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:48.960
How's it going?

03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:50.360
She's like, oh, Matt, you know, what's going on?

03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:51.520
FBI is everywhere.

03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:53.760
Like they've been talking to everybody.

03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:57.760
And this has been, it's like a year and a half

03:36:57.760 --> 03:36:59.280
at this point.

03:36:59.280 --> 03:37:00.840
And she's like, it's not, you know,

03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:03.600
they're, they come around every once in a while.

03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.720
Everybody's gone in, everybody's cooperating,

03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:07.960
everybody's talking, everybody's blaming you,

03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:10.120
including her.

03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:13.240
And so as we're talking, she said, look,

03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:18.240
I've, the main FBI agent on the case,

03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:23.440
she told me if I ever spoke with you

03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:25.880
to have you call her and I was like, yeah, I'm good.

03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:30.480
So she goes, her name is Candice and she wants you to call her.

03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:32.240
She says, at least call her for God's sakes.

03:37:32.240 --> 03:37:33.480
Maybe you could just turn yourself in.

03:37:33.480 --> 03:37:36.400
Maybe you can negotiate just like a couple of years,

03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:38.840
like, cause if they're not gonna catch you,

03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:40.560
then maybe turn yourself in, maybe it'll help,

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:41.480
at least hear her out.

03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:42.960
And I was like, okay, all right, you're right.

03:37:42.960 --> 03:37:44.800
Hang up the phone, I call Candice.

03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:46.840
She picks up the phone and I go, hey,

03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:47.680
she goes, who's this?

03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:49.200
And I go, this is Matt Cox.

03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:52.000
And she goes, hey, hello, Mr. Cox.

03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:52.840
How are you?

03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:53.960
I go, I'm doing okay.

03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:54.800
How's it going?

03:37:54.800 --> 03:37:55.640
I understand you wanna talk to me.

03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:56.480
She goes, I do.

03:37:56.480 --> 03:37:57.320
I said, what can I do for you?

03:37:57.320 --> 03:37:58.160
She goes, you can turn yourself in.

03:37:58.160 --> 03:37:59.720
I go, well, that's not gonna happen.

03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:01.440
I said, what else do you need?

03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:03.640
And she said, I think that you should think

03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:04.520
about turning yourself in.

03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:05.360
I said, why?

03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:06.180
Well, what am I looking at?

03:38:06.180 --> 03:38:08.400
She goes, well, that's not how it works.

03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:10.800
The way it works is you turn yourself in

03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:13.480
and you know, we take that into consideration.

03:38:13.480 --> 03:38:14.800
I said, no, no, no, no.

03:38:14.800 --> 03:38:15.800
I said, that's not good enough.

03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:17.760
I said, I'm not stupid enough to turn myself in

03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:18.840
and hope for the best.

03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:23.840
And so she says, well, let's talk about this.

03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:26.120
And I said, well, what am I looking at?

03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:27.080
And she goes, I don't really know.

03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:30.480
I can't, you know, really, I can't tell you that.

03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:32.880
And she's, I said, well, then we don't really

03:38:32.880 --> 03:38:33.720
have anything to talk about.

03:38:33.720 --> 03:38:34.560
She goes, well, wait a second.

03:38:34.560 --> 03:38:35.980
She said, let me, hold on.

03:38:35.980 --> 03:38:37.100
Let me call the US attorney.

03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:38.360
Maybe we can work something out.

03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:41.080
So she calls the US, she, so I said, okay,

03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:42.360
I'll call you back.

03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:48.340
And she said, well, give me your phone number.

03:38:48.340 --> 03:38:49.540
I'll call you.

03:38:49.540 --> 03:38:50.380
And I went, no, no, no.

03:38:50.380 --> 03:38:51.420
I said, I'll call you.

03:38:51.420 --> 03:38:52.380
I said, I'm gonna hang up the phone.

03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:53.420
I'm gonna turn the phone off.

03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:55.240
I said, for all I know, you're triangulating

03:38:55.240 --> 03:38:57.220
this phone call right now or something, you know?

03:38:57.220 --> 03:38:58.900
And she says, oh, give me a break.

03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:00.940
She says, you're not that important.

03:39:00.940 --> 03:39:05.220
And I remember thinking, who do you think you are?

03:39:05.220 --> 03:39:06.780
Like, she's like, right?

03:39:06.780 --> 03:39:09.700
Like, you're just some little fraudster guy

03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:10.980
running around, you know?

03:39:10.980 --> 03:39:14.260
Like, you're not a terrorist, you know?

03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:15.720
And I almost,

03:39:18.140 --> 03:39:20.980
I almost was like, oh, okay, here's my number,

03:39:20.980 --> 03:39:23.260
which she probably already had.

03:39:23.260 --> 03:39:25.920
But I almost was like, okay, I'll wait for your call

03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:26.760
and left my phone.

03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:27.600
I said, no, you know what?

03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:28.460
I said, I'm gonna hang up the phone.

03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.660
I'm gonna turn it off anyway and I'll call you back.

03:39:30.660 --> 03:39:31.580
She's all right, whatever.

03:39:31.580 --> 03:39:32.660
I hang up.

03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:33.860
I turn off the phone.

03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:35.100
It turns out, I found out later

03:39:35.100 --> 03:39:37.060
when I ordered the Freedom of Information Act,

03:39:37.060 --> 03:39:39.020
she actually immediately called the US marshals

03:39:39.020 --> 03:39:41.100
and they immediately called, took the phone number

03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:42.300
and tracked back the phone

03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:46.820
and immediately had two marshals from Baton Rouge

03:39:46.820 --> 03:39:49.980
go immediately to that place where I had been.

03:39:51.740 --> 03:39:52.580
Damn.

03:39:52.580 --> 03:39:53.400
Oh, listen.

03:39:53.400 --> 03:39:54.660
Yeah, I mean- They work fast.

03:39:54.660 --> 03:39:55.500
Yeah, she's-

03:39:55.500 --> 03:39:56.540
And she's good too.

03:39:56.540 --> 03:40:00.260
Not just that, I made the initial calls sitting there

03:40:00.260 --> 03:40:02.760
in that, where I went and bought the phone.

03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:03.860
It was like a gas station.

03:40:03.860 --> 03:40:05.700
There was also like a subway station.

03:40:05.700 --> 03:40:06.860
I had ordered like a subway.

03:40:06.860 --> 03:40:09.100
I was eating a subway, playing on my computer,

03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:11.220
programmed the phone and making phone calls.

03:40:11.220 --> 03:40:15.940
So by the time I talked to her and they're driving,

03:40:15.940 --> 03:40:17.940
by that point, I walked and gotten in the vehicle,

03:40:17.940 --> 03:40:20.880
my vehicle and I leave, but who knows?

03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:22.260
I don't know if they showed up 30 minutes late.

03:40:22.260 --> 03:40:23.100
I don't know.

03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:24.500
Like I could have hung out like,

03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:27.100
oh, I'm just gonna finish my food, could have shown up.

03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:31.740
So I go, I call her back an hour or two later.

03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:36.120
She says, listen, the first time he wasn't,

03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:38.060
hadn't gotten back with her, then he did.

03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:38.900
Then he came back.

03:40:38.900 --> 03:40:41.740
I said, seven years, he's got to turn himself in here.

03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:45.720
So, okay, seven years, that seems like a lot.

03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:48.380
And I was like, seven years, and that's seven years for,

03:40:48.380 --> 03:40:51.460
I go, and I kept saying, is that seven years for everything?

03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:53.820
And she goes, yeah, that's for everything.

03:40:53.820 --> 03:40:55.000
I was like, that's everything.

03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:58.860
Like everything that happened like in Atlanta,

03:40:58.860 --> 03:41:00.880
like in some stuff that you don't know about.

03:41:00.880 --> 03:41:02.020
She said, look, what's important

03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:04.700
is you turn yourself in in Tampa.

03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:07.500
And I was like, okay, well, I'm closer to Atlanta.

03:41:07.500 --> 03:41:10.440
Why wouldn't I turn myself in Atlanta?

03:41:10.440 --> 03:41:13.260
And she's like, look, you know, you don't wanna do that.

03:41:13.260 --> 03:41:14.100
You don't wanna do that.

03:41:14.100 --> 03:41:15.340
Well, cause that would have been the secret service

03:41:15.340 --> 03:41:18.140
would have gotten credit if I'd walked in there, right?

03:41:18.140 --> 03:41:20.420
So, you know, and I don't know anything

03:41:20.420 --> 03:41:23.180
about rivalries and how they work at that time.

03:41:23.180 --> 03:41:26.780
I do now, but so we go back and forth, back and forth.

03:41:26.780 --> 03:41:27.980
And I continually ask her,

03:41:27.980 --> 03:41:30.060
does that include Atlanta and everything?

03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:31.380
And at some point I realized like,

03:41:31.380 --> 03:41:33.180
oh, she's just not answering.

03:41:33.180 --> 03:41:35.500
And so finally I said, listen,

03:41:35.500 --> 03:41:37.420
you keep dodging this question.

03:41:38.500 --> 03:41:43.060
And she said, all I can speak for is Tampa.

03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:44.860
So if you come back to Tampa

03:41:46.660 --> 03:41:49.860
and you cooperate against everyone seven years,

03:41:51.620 --> 03:41:52.780
and she's telling me,

03:41:52.780 --> 03:41:55.340
she wants me to cooperate against my ex-wife.

03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:57.100
And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that.

03:41:57.100 --> 03:41:59.180
I said, my ex-wife didn't do anything.

03:41:59.180 --> 03:42:00.540
She doesn't know anything.

03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.460
She didn't do anything.

03:42:01.460 --> 03:42:03.820
She's never, you know, that's not what I heard.

03:42:04.060 --> 03:42:06.060
And she's going on and on.

03:42:06.060 --> 03:42:07.380
And I was like, no, no.

03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:08.220
I was like, oh wow.

03:42:08.220 --> 03:42:09.820
I was like, so that's just for,

03:42:09.820 --> 03:42:10.740
and she's like, that's right.

03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:11.860
I said, all right, we're done.

03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:15.460
She's no, wait, I can call the Atlanta US Attorney.

03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:16.820
I said, no, lady, I wouldn't believe you

03:42:16.820 --> 03:42:18.540
if you told me water was wet.

03:42:18.540 --> 03:42:19.380
I don't trust you.

03:42:19.380 --> 03:42:21.980
And I hung up the phone, threw it out the window.

03:42:21.980 --> 03:42:25.460
And I ended up going to Charlotte,

03:42:27.980 --> 03:42:29.460
drop off the U-Haul van,

03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:32.940
go to my,

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:35.260
I would have possibly brought it back to the dealer.

03:42:35.260 --> 03:42:37.420
It's not like Ivan and I brought it back.

03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.500
So I bring it back.

03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:43.300
I go to my old apartment in downtown Charlotte.

03:42:44.300 --> 03:42:46.340
And I remember thinking I would be okay.

03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:51.340
I know by this point that they knew Michael Eckert's name.

03:42:53.780 --> 03:42:55.660
They had the address in Charlotte.

03:42:55.660 --> 03:42:59.140
So I know they, by this point it's been five, six days.

03:42:59.140 --> 03:43:01.380
So I know they've tracked him back there.

03:43:03.140 --> 03:43:05.340
So I figured if I could get my car, I'm fine.

03:43:05.340 --> 03:43:07.260
So I go into the apartment complex and it, you know,

03:43:07.260 --> 03:43:10.940
it's like four, five, six story apartment.

03:43:10.940 --> 03:43:14.460
You know, those are parking things that stack up.

03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:16.780
So I go into this, you know, underground,

03:43:16.780 --> 03:43:17.860
it's not underground, but whatever,

03:43:17.860 --> 03:43:19.380
this parking garage thing.

03:43:19.380 --> 03:43:21.340
So I go in, I'm on like the third floor or something.

03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:25.060
I look at my car, you know, and I get in my car.

03:43:25.060 --> 03:43:27.620
And I remember as soon as I drove out of the parking garage,

03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:29.980
I was like, whew, I'm good.

03:43:29.980 --> 03:43:32.020
So I can go ahead and pull across the street

03:43:32.020 --> 03:43:33.820
and just stop at Starbucks.

03:43:33.820 --> 03:43:35.620
So I stop at Starbucks.

03:43:35.620 --> 03:43:38.140
I walk into Starbucks, I order a Starbucks.

03:43:38.140 --> 03:43:39.940
I'm standing there waiting for the barista.

03:43:39.940 --> 03:43:42.380
I look over and it's two people

03:43:42.380 --> 03:43:45.620
from the apartment complex staring at me.

03:43:48.220 --> 03:43:49.060
That's what I'm like.

03:43:49.060 --> 03:43:51.140
And there's, they're whispering and pointing and none.

03:43:51.140 --> 03:43:53.900
And I remember thinking, this is like the fifth of the month.

03:43:53.900 --> 03:43:56.100
I hadn't paid my rent and been there.

03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:56.940
So I thought that-

03:43:56.940 --> 03:43:58.380
That makes sense.

03:43:58.380 --> 03:44:01.100
Maybe they, like I'm picturing an eviction notice

03:44:01.100 --> 03:44:03.340
or a three-day notice on my door or something.

03:44:03.340 --> 03:44:04.540
And I'm like, okay.

03:44:04.540 --> 03:44:07.220
And then one of them bolts out the back, the woman,

03:44:07.220 --> 03:44:09.860
there's a guy and a girl, the woman runs out the back.

03:44:09.860 --> 03:44:11.340
He's standing there staring at me.

03:44:11.340 --> 03:44:16.340
I get my Venti vanilla latte, right?

03:44:16.780 --> 03:44:19.620
I get my little, I get my frou frou drink.

03:44:19.620 --> 03:44:21.100
So I got my frou frou drink.

03:44:21.100 --> 03:44:23.020
I walk out, I get into the car.

03:44:23.020 --> 03:44:24.740
He follows me.

03:44:24.740 --> 03:44:26.380
Get in the car, I set everything up.

03:44:26.380 --> 03:44:27.900
I put my seatbelt on, I'm okay.

03:44:27.900 --> 03:44:29.900
He's standing there staring at me.

03:44:30.140 --> 03:44:32.620
I'm thinking something's wrong, like what's up?

03:44:32.620 --> 03:44:35.380
And all of, and I checked to see there's no traffic.

03:44:35.380 --> 03:44:36.340
I'm good.

03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:38.420
I'm about to leave.

03:44:38.420 --> 03:44:40.860
And he starts screaming, he's right here.

03:44:40.860 --> 03:44:41.900
He's right here.

03:44:41.900 --> 03:44:43.420
I look in the rear view mirror.

03:44:43.420 --> 03:44:46.620
There's two guys running towards the back of my car.

03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:49.100
I punch it and I take off.

03:44:49.100 --> 03:44:51.900
Sounds dramatic, wasn't that dramatic.

03:44:51.900 --> 03:44:53.140
I'd already, there was no cars.

03:44:53.140 --> 03:44:55.540
I knew there was no cars already pulling out.

03:44:55.540 --> 03:44:58.180
Wasn't like a TJ hooker where I jumped over the slit

03:44:58.180 --> 03:45:00.980
across the hood and slung, you know,

03:45:00.980 --> 03:45:03.020
they didn't catch the car and hang on the back.

03:45:03.020 --> 03:45:06.620
But you know, I, so they're running and I boom, hit it.

03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:08.100
Did you spill the coffee or?

03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:09.380
No, cause it was one of those little things.

03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:10.740
It was actually nice, but it just sounded.

03:45:10.740 --> 03:45:12.620
You're making it sound like you were pretty calm.

03:45:12.620 --> 03:45:13.700
Wasn't you panicking here?

03:45:13.700 --> 03:45:15.300
I was terrified.

03:45:15.300 --> 03:45:16.140
Yeah.

03:45:16.140 --> 03:45:16.980
Terrified.

03:45:16.980 --> 03:45:19.260
So you're under, under fear.

03:45:19.260 --> 03:45:21.180
You're still operate like.

03:45:21.180 --> 03:45:22.980
Yeah, I operate like.

03:45:22.980 --> 03:45:27.940
It's funny you say that because the secret service,

03:45:27.940 --> 03:45:30.540
when they talk to these guys, they,

03:45:30.540 --> 03:45:33.340
all the people that they spoke with said the same thing

03:45:33.340 --> 03:45:35.140
over and over again.

03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:36.300
The guy was a professional.

03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:38.420
He never seemed upset.

03:45:38.420 --> 03:45:40.460
He never seemed agitated.

03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:43.460
He always, he was never in a hurry.

03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:44.300
Yeah.

03:45:44.300 --> 03:45:48.580
He, you know, like, but most of the time I wasn't

03:45:48.580 --> 03:45:50.740
because I, you know, it wasn't until the police got involved

03:45:50.740 --> 03:45:53.220
or should the law and federal law enforcement got involved

03:45:53.220 --> 03:45:57.100
that I, I started really, you know, getting anxious.

03:45:57.140 --> 03:46:00.460
So at that point I drive, I take off.

03:46:00.460 --> 03:46:02.220
I drive about a mile down the road.

03:46:02.220 --> 03:46:04.220
Who were the two guys by the way?

03:46:04.220 --> 03:46:05.380
I thought it was FBI.

03:46:05.380 --> 03:46:07.020
I ordered the freedom of information act

03:46:07.020 --> 03:46:10.140
when I got to prison at some point, you know, in the future.

03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:13.580
And it was, it was U.S. Marshals, right?

03:46:13.580 --> 03:46:14.540
So.

03:46:14.540 --> 03:46:15.740
Sounds pretty dramatic to me.

03:46:15.740 --> 03:46:17.300
U.S. Marshals running towards your car.

03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:18.260
You pull, I mean.

03:46:18.260 --> 03:46:19.260
I mean.

03:46:19.260 --> 03:46:20.300
You know, but it's all right.

03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:22.220
It's hard not to tell it like it's dramatic.

03:46:22.220 --> 03:46:23.180
I understand.

03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:24.020
But it was.

03:46:24.020 --> 03:46:24.860
There's not much traffic.

03:46:24.860 --> 03:46:25.700
It was okay.

03:46:25.700 --> 03:46:27.460
It's not like they're, you know, their fingers

03:46:27.460 --> 03:46:28.620
were at the back of the car.

03:46:28.620 --> 03:46:30.540
They're holding on, you know, but it was, yeah.

03:46:30.540 --> 03:46:33.060
If I had waited an extra 20 seconds, yeah.

03:46:33.060 --> 03:46:34.020
They would have been on my car.

03:46:34.020 --> 03:46:35.100
They would have been right there at the door.

03:46:35.100 --> 03:46:37.860
Did you consider giving up there or no?

03:46:39.700 --> 03:46:41.580
No, all I could think of was haul.

03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:43.260
Listen, my instinct is get out.

03:46:43.260 --> 03:46:44.580
Is go, go, go, go, go, go.

03:46:44.580 --> 03:46:45.820
You're already on the run.

03:46:45.820 --> 03:46:47.060
I'm already in trouble.

03:46:47.060 --> 03:46:48.660
It's not like they're going to be, they're going to,

03:46:48.660 --> 03:46:49.740
they're going to add anything.

03:46:49.740 --> 03:46:52.460
Although to be honest, you know, it only got worse

03:46:52.460 --> 03:46:54.260
because at that point, actually at that point

03:46:54.260 --> 03:46:55.180
I drive down the road.

03:46:55.180 --> 03:46:56.500
I stop at a homeless facility.

03:46:56.500 --> 03:46:58.100
I survey three guys.

03:46:58.100 --> 03:46:59.540
I'm a mile down the road.

03:46:59.540 --> 03:47:02.700
Like looking back on it, I think, what were you thinking?

03:47:02.700 --> 03:47:05.860
But there were three, three homeless guys

03:47:05.860 --> 03:47:07.740
that were in their early thirties

03:47:07.740 --> 03:47:09.380
and they were, they were all Caucasian.

03:47:09.380 --> 03:47:10.660
That's hard to find.

03:47:10.660 --> 03:47:12.580
So trust me, I've looked,

03:47:12.580 --> 03:47:15.100
spent hours before track of finding these guys.

03:47:15.100 --> 03:47:18.340
So that's like the golden thing you're looking for

03:47:18.340 --> 03:47:20.420
is white guys in their thirties.

03:47:20.420 --> 03:47:21.260
Right.

03:47:21.260 --> 03:47:22.100
Cause that's why I was in my thirties

03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:23.900
that I wasn't an old man like I am now.

03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:26.580
So I, I surveyed them.

03:47:26.580 --> 03:47:28.380
I drive straight to Nashville.

03:47:28.380 --> 03:47:29.220
Yeah.

03:47:29.220 --> 03:47:33.460
Get to Nashville, drive through an area called Green Hills.

03:47:37.140 --> 03:47:38.740
Well, I first like, when I got to Nashville,

03:47:38.740 --> 03:47:42.260
I stayed the night and the next day I went into,

03:47:42.260 --> 03:47:44.020
I'm going to say a UPS store.

03:47:44.020 --> 03:47:45.140
It was actually a Kinko's.

03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:46.660
There used to be something, they used to be called Kinko's,

03:47:46.660 --> 03:47:48.060
but like going to-

03:47:48.060 --> 03:47:49.020
I remember Kinko's.

03:47:49.020 --> 03:47:49.860
Oh yeah.

03:47:49.860 --> 03:47:52.500
They got bought by FedEx, I feel like.

03:47:52.500 --> 03:47:53.460
Oh, is it FedEx, FedEx?

03:47:53.940 --> 03:47:54.780
Then it was a FedEx store.

03:47:54.780 --> 03:47:57.860
So I go in there and you give them like 50 bucks

03:47:57.860 --> 03:47:59.180
or something or 20 bucks or something.

03:47:59.180 --> 03:48:01.140
They'd give you like a hundred business cards.

03:48:01.140 --> 03:48:05.180
So I go get a phone number, a burner phone.

03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:06.740
I go in there, I make up,

03:48:06.740 --> 03:48:10.460
oh, I call and get a phone number from HQ, the local HQ.

03:48:10.460 --> 03:48:13.500
I come up with a name, manufactured funding group.

03:48:13.500 --> 03:48:14.740
I've got two phone numbers.

03:48:14.740 --> 03:48:17.580
I get business cards made with a name.

03:48:17.580 --> 03:48:19.580
One of the guys' name that I surveyed was,

03:48:20.540 --> 03:48:24.900
his actual name was Joseph Marion Carter Jr.

03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:25.820
I went by Carter.

03:48:25.820 --> 03:48:28.340
So I get business cards made at Joseph Carter.

03:48:29.900 --> 03:48:32.340
I then drive through Green Hills,

03:48:32.340 --> 03:48:34.300
took him like an hour to get the card.

03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:35.900
So I'm driving through Green Hills.

03:48:35.900 --> 03:48:37.740
I'm planning on going to an apartment,

03:48:37.740 --> 03:48:39.140
but I'm still, I don't have an idea.

03:48:39.140 --> 03:48:39.980
I don't have anything.

03:48:39.980 --> 03:48:41.260
Like I'm wondering, what am I going to do?

03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:42.460
How am I going to get a place to stay?

03:48:42.460 --> 03:48:43.460
I'm going to stay in a hotel.

03:48:43.460 --> 03:48:44.420
Like, what am I doing?

03:48:44.420 --> 03:48:47.380
I'm using an idea that the cops are looking for.

03:48:48.300 --> 03:48:50.620
So as I'm driving,

03:48:50.620 --> 03:48:52.580
trying to find this big apartment complex,

03:48:52.580 --> 03:48:55.020
there's a guy putting a sign in the front yard

03:48:55.020 --> 03:48:58.460
of like a townhouse, because several townhouses.

03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:00.220
And I, probably in his sixties,

03:49:00.220 --> 03:49:02.820
I pull in, jump out of the car and I said,

03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:03.980
hey, is that this for rent?

03:49:03.980 --> 03:49:05.780
He said, yes, it is.

03:49:05.780 --> 03:49:07.420
I said, oh, okay.

03:49:07.420 --> 03:49:08.260
Yeah, can I see it?

03:49:08.260 --> 03:49:09.100
Sure.

03:49:09.100 --> 03:49:12.380
I go in, check it out, come back downstairs.

03:49:12.380 --> 03:49:13.460
It's perfect.

03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:16.380
Said, listen, I, you know, I work for a company,

03:49:16.380 --> 03:49:17.700
you know, manufactured funding group.

03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:18.540
Boom, hand them thing.

03:49:18.540 --> 03:49:22.620
I said, I've been in Europe for the last,

03:49:22.620 --> 03:49:23.460
I forget what I said.

03:49:23.460 --> 03:49:25.980
I said, England, I have some little town outside of London

03:49:25.980 --> 03:49:27.740
in, you know, whatever, Dexter, you know,

03:49:27.740 --> 03:49:29.020
London for the past five years.

03:49:29.020 --> 03:49:30.580
I don't really have any credit,

03:49:30.580 --> 03:49:33.220
but I said, I can put down a double the security deposit

03:49:33.220 --> 03:49:34.060
or, you know, whatever you need.

03:49:34.060 --> 03:49:35.060
Here's my business card.

03:49:35.060 --> 03:49:39.300
He looked at me and he looked at my car and he goes,

03:49:41.020 --> 03:49:43.060
you look like an honest young man.

03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:48.100
He said, I'll take the first month's rent and deposit.

03:49:49.380 --> 03:49:51.540
And he said, now go get a leash right now.

03:49:51.540 --> 03:49:52.380
And I said, okay.

03:49:52.380 --> 03:49:53.780
And I said, oh, okay.

03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:57.420
Filled out a leash right then, gave me the keys.

03:49:57.420 --> 03:50:02.420
Like, nice, like very trusting in that town.

03:50:02.860 --> 03:50:05.060
Oh yeah, but there must've been also something about you

03:50:05.060 --> 03:50:09.060
where you're just, got a nice car.

03:50:09.060 --> 03:50:10.540
I know you're gonna get a lot of comments

03:50:10.540 --> 03:50:11.940
that say white privilege,

03:50:11.940 --> 03:50:16.940
but I think the charisma has something to do with it.

03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:20.460
Well, so he gave, I appreciate that.

03:50:20.460 --> 03:50:21.700
So he gave me the keys.

03:50:22.940 --> 03:50:27.940
Listen, I ordered all of Joseph Carter's vital information,

03:50:30.980 --> 03:50:32.900
right, like all of his birth certificate,

03:50:32.900 --> 03:50:35.740
social security card, everything that night

03:50:36.580 --> 03:50:39.820
from like a Kinko's or some of the, I forget where,

03:50:39.820 --> 03:50:41.900
but from one of these places, I went online,

03:50:42.900 --> 03:50:43.740
you could go online back then, right?

03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:44.700
Like there wasn't wifi everywhere.

03:50:44.700 --> 03:50:46.700
So I ordered the stuff.

03:50:46.700 --> 03:50:48.740
It shows up a couple of days later.

03:50:48.740 --> 03:50:50.060
I take that information.

03:50:50.940 --> 03:50:53.300
I go and I get a driver's license.

03:50:53.300 --> 03:50:56.140
Remember within like seven or eight days,

03:50:56.140 --> 03:50:58.300
I've got a driver's license in his name.

03:50:58.300 --> 03:51:01.460
I get in that car, Michael Eckert's car.

03:51:01.460 --> 03:51:03.020
I drive it all the way back to Nashville.

03:51:03.020 --> 03:51:04.980
I leave it in long-term parking,

03:51:04.980 --> 03:51:07.020
get on a plane, fly back to Nashville,

03:51:08.300 --> 03:51:10.660
go in and buy myself a brand new car.

03:51:10.660 --> 03:51:12.260
It was a brand new, it was a couple of years old.

03:51:12.260 --> 03:51:15.980
But from like CarMax, within two weeks,

03:51:15.980 --> 03:51:18.100
I am completely 100% set up.

03:51:19.020 --> 03:51:21.180
I start dating for three, four months.

03:51:21.180 --> 03:51:22.940
That gets really boring.

03:51:22.940 --> 03:51:23.780
And-

03:51:23.780 --> 03:51:25.260
Where again?

03:51:25.260 --> 03:51:26.080
Nashville?

03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:26.920
Nashville.

03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:27.760
Okay, got it.

03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:28.620
So I start dating a bunch of chicks

03:51:28.620 --> 03:51:30.300
and then I ended up meeting this one girl.

03:51:30.300 --> 03:51:31.540
By the way, are you lonely here?

03:51:31.540 --> 03:51:32.820
Cause you're on the run.

03:51:32.820 --> 03:51:34.340
Man, listen, I'm telling you right now,

03:51:34.340 --> 03:51:38.140
being on the run was the best part of my life.

03:51:38.140 --> 03:51:38.980
Really?

03:51:38.980 --> 03:51:42.140
But you know how all these guys say it was horrible.

03:51:42.140 --> 03:51:45.380
And I was always so concerned and looking over my shoulder

03:51:45.380 --> 03:51:47.260
and it wasn't, I wasn't.

03:51:47.260 --> 03:51:50.940
Keep in mind, I've gotten five or six traffic tickets

03:51:50.940 --> 03:51:51.940
while on the run.

03:51:51.940 --> 03:51:54.340
I went to traffic school as someone else.

03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:56.220
I got so many traffic tickets in his name.

03:51:56.220 --> 03:51:58.300
I went to traffic school as him.

03:51:58.300 --> 03:52:00.620
Like if I got pulled over, like I'm not concerned.

03:52:00.620 --> 03:52:03.900
So your confidence just was over the top here.

03:52:03.900 --> 03:52:06.620
Driving a vehicle in the name of the driver's license

03:52:06.660 --> 03:52:09.420
that I have that was issued by that state,

03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:11.680
full coverage insurance.

03:52:11.680 --> 03:52:12.520
I'm not an idiot.

03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:14.020
I'm not driving around a stolen car

03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:16.260
with a broken tail light and a body in the trunk.

03:52:16.260 --> 03:52:17.660
Like I'm covered.

03:52:17.660 --> 03:52:20.860
Like I'm not concerned about the local cops.

03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:23.720
Plus you're going to Starbucks, sipping your coffee

03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:25.860
and driving away from US Marshals.

03:52:25.860 --> 03:52:27.140
Right, right.

03:52:27.140 --> 03:52:30.020
You could start believing that it's impossible to catch you.

03:52:30.020 --> 03:52:31.220
That is exactly what it is.

03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:34.380
It's every time I just kept getting more and more emboldened,

03:52:34.380 --> 03:52:36.740
more and more cocky, arrogant,

03:52:36.740 --> 03:52:37.580
like they're not going to catch you.

03:52:37.580 --> 03:52:39.180
I'm too good.

03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:41.900
You know, which is great until they catch you.

03:52:41.900 --> 03:52:46.900
And so I meet a girl named Amanda Gardner.

03:52:47.120 --> 03:52:49.540
Well, what I ended up doing is,

03:52:49.540 --> 03:52:52.020
let's keep in mind I'm only got a hundred thousand or so.

03:52:52.020 --> 03:52:56.580
So I go and I start buying houses in the area,

03:52:56.580 --> 03:52:58.380
in this area called JC Napier,

03:52:58.380 --> 03:53:01.140
next to it's just close to downtown.

03:53:01.140 --> 03:53:03.260
And I buy these houses and I start,

03:53:03.260 --> 03:53:05.380
I buy them for like 60, 70,000.

03:53:05.380 --> 03:53:09.020
And I record the sales at 210, 190,

03:53:09.020 --> 03:53:11.220
one to 205, that sort of thing.

03:53:11.220 --> 03:53:12.220
Same thing.

03:53:12.220 --> 03:53:15.020
And I refinance the house as I start pulling out money.

03:53:16.020 --> 03:53:18.900
I meet this girl, Amanda Gardner.

03:53:18.900 --> 03:53:21.040
She, we hit it off within a few months.

03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:24.180
She's moved in to, we move into a house in that area.

03:53:24.180 --> 03:53:25.860
I renovate a house.

03:53:25.860 --> 03:53:26.820
We move in there.

03:53:27.980 --> 03:53:30.500
I borrow three and a half million dollars

03:53:30.500 --> 03:53:31.540
and I'm buying houses.

03:53:31.540 --> 03:53:33.300
Now I'm buying houses, recording the value.

03:53:33.300 --> 03:53:34.140
I started all over.

03:53:34.140 --> 03:53:35.780
You know, I borrow like, whatever,

03:53:35.780 --> 03:53:37.080
three and a half million dollars.

03:53:37.080 --> 03:53:39.740
I meet Amanda, we move in together.

03:53:40.580 --> 03:53:42.180
We're buying houses.

03:53:42.180 --> 03:53:43.020
Do you tell her?

03:53:43.020 --> 03:53:43.860
Do you tell her about all of you?

03:53:43.860 --> 03:53:45.980
She kind of, you know, what she knew was that,

03:53:45.980 --> 03:53:48.620
you know, it's odd, right?

03:53:48.620 --> 03:53:50.060
I have no photographs.

03:53:50.060 --> 03:53:52.060
Everything I own is brand new.

03:53:52.060 --> 03:53:52.960
She's like, you don't,

03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:56.220
there's nothing in this house

03:53:56.220 --> 03:53:58.180
that's more than four months old.

03:53:58.180 --> 03:54:00.500
So six months old, you have no photographs.

03:54:00.500 --> 03:54:02.340
You have no internet presence.

03:54:02.340 --> 03:54:04.100
You have no, you know, it's,

03:54:04.100 --> 03:54:06.700
every stick of clothing is brand new.

03:54:06.700 --> 03:54:08.700
You don't have old pairs of jeans.

03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:10.780
Do you tell her stories about the past of any,

03:54:10.780 --> 03:54:12.980
like, is there a fabricated?

03:54:12.980 --> 03:54:15.380
The initial, initially there was a fabricated version

03:54:15.380 --> 03:54:17.500
that I owned, I owned a mortgage company.

03:54:18.940 --> 03:54:21.540
My typical story was like, I owned a mortgage company

03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:24.180
and I got bought out by Household Bank.

03:54:24.180 --> 03:54:25.580
Started doing very well.

03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:27.160
I got bought out by Household Bank.

03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:29.180
I have a non-compete clause.

03:54:29.180 --> 03:54:31.740
I got, you know, I ended up with like half a million dollars

03:54:31.740 --> 03:54:34.060
after paying off all my bills

03:54:34.060 --> 03:54:36.540
and just decided to kind of travel around the US

03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:39.700
and now I'm here, I'm gonna start renovating houses.

03:54:39.700 --> 03:54:43.020
But that, you know, you don't call home.

03:54:43.020 --> 03:54:44.300
Nobody calls you.

03:54:44.300 --> 03:54:45.420
Your family doesn't call you.

03:54:45.420 --> 03:54:47.620
You tell stories about your mom, your dad,

03:54:47.620 --> 03:54:49.700
your brother, your sister, friends.

03:54:49.700 --> 03:54:50.740
I don't know any of these friends.

03:54:50.740 --> 03:54:51.820
Never seen any of these friends.

03:54:51.820 --> 03:54:52.900
They never call you.

03:54:52.900 --> 03:54:55.700
They never, you know, it's just like, it's like, oh shit.

03:54:55.700 --> 03:54:58.460
So at some point I basically just said to her, look,

03:54:59.180 --> 03:55:04.180
I'm, listen, at one point I had to have a check cut.

03:55:04.740 --> 03:55:06.220
I refinanced the house, right?

03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:09.420
And I had like, I'm gonna say something like,

03:55:09.420 --> 03:55:11.500
it might've been 30,000, but let's say 20,000.

03:55:11.500 --> 03:55:15.060
I had a $20,000 check cut to Amanda Gardner

03:55:15.060 --> 03:55:16.100
because you have to have these checks.

03:55:16.100 --> 03:55:17.500
You can't have them cut to me.

03:55:17.500 --> 03:55:19.940
So I would say, hey, there's a second mortgage on there

03:55:19.940 --> 03:55:22.020
and I'd provide a second mortgage or I'd provide, you know,

03:55:22.020 --> 03:55:22.860
I'd provide different things.

03:55:22.860 --> 03:55:27.140
And I knew I need names of people to cut these things too.

03:55:27.140 --> 03:55:29.540
So I had a check cut for whatever.

03:55:29.540 --> 03:55:30.900
So I remember we were at dinner one night.

03:55:30.900 --> 03:55:32.620
This is before she really knows who I am.

03:55:32.620 --> 03:55:34.780
And I said, hey, I said, oh, and she was,

03:55:34.780 --> 03:55:35.740
oh, you had a refinance.

03:55:35.740 --> 03:55:36.620
She was, how'd that thing go?

03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:37.460
You're refinancing.

03:55:37.460 --> 03:55:39.100
I went, oh, thank God you said that.

03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:41.700
Boom, I said, I need to deposit this.

03:55:41.700 --> 03:55:42.700
Get a check for 20,000.

03:55:42.700 --> 03:55:47.700
She's like, I can go tomorrow and I can deposit it.

03:55:49.260 --> 03:55:52.220
And I'm like, no, no, I'm like, look, it's fine.

03:55:52.220 --> 03:55:53.060
Just deposit it.

03:55:53.060 --> 03:55:54.020
She said, I can get, as soon as it clears,

03:55:54.020 --> 03:55:56.180
I'll get you a cashier's check.

03:55:56.180 --> 03:55:59.380
I was like, no, just deposit it and keep it in your bank.

03:55:59.380 --> 03:56:01.020
It's fine.

03:56:01.020 --> 03:56:04.180
So she's like, what is going on?

03:56:04.180 --> 03:56:06.820
You know, and so we have this conversation

03:56:06.820 --> 03:56:11.220
and I tell her, look, people are looking for me.

03:56:11.220 --> 03:56:12.380
Who? Law enforcement.

03:56:12.380 --> 03:56:14.540
Which ones? All of them.

03:56:14.540 --> 03:56:17.700
You know, she's like, that doesn't even, for what?

03:56:17.700 --> 03:56:22.580
I go, mostly bank fraud.

03:56:22.580 --> 03:56:25.740
And she's like, well, how are they not finding you?

03:56:26.580 --> 03:56:29.020
I mean, everybody, you know, people know you.

03:56:29.020 --> 03:56:30.860
Like, you know, your general contractor,

03:56:30.860 --> 03:56:32.620
which I met four months before.

03:56:32.620 --> 03:56:34.860
This guy six months before, this one two months before.

03:56:34.860 --> 03:56:36.900
You know, she's like, so-and-so, so-and-so, so.

03:56:36.900 --> 03:56:37.900
And I'm like, right, right.

03:56:37.900 --> 03:56:40.100
Well, I said, well, she's like, I mean,

03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:40.980
they've got your name.

03:56:40.980 --> 03:56:43.380
They've got your, I go, well, that's identity theft.

03:56:43.380 --> 03:56:45.580
And she was like, what do you mean?

03:56:45.580 --> 03:56:48.140
I said, well, my name's not, you know, my name's not,

03:56:48.140 --> 03:56:49.420
it's not Joseph Carter.

03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:51.940
And what is your name?

03:56:51.940 --> 03:56:54.540
I go, look, you know, it's, it's, you don't need,

03:56:54.540 --> 03:56:56.700
don't even worry about it.

03:56:56.700 --> 03:56:57.780
This is what's happening.

03:56:57.780 --> 03:56:58.620
This is where I'm at.

03:56:58.620 --> 03:56:59.900
And this has been months into the relationship.

03:56:59.900 --> 03:57:02.980
I mean, this is where, I'd say maybe a month or two in,

03:57:02.980 --> 03:57:06.020
but you know, she was just too inquisitive.

03:57:06.020 --> 03:57:07.140
And oh, I know what it was.

03:57:07.140 --> 03:57:12.140
She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night.

03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:15.060
That was another thing that happened.

03:57:15.060 --> 03:57:19.420
She went to get a popsicle and she opened up the flip

03:57:19.420 --> 03:57:22.300
to get a popsicle and she opened the wrong one.

03:57:22.300 --> 03:57:24.740
And there was all cash.

03:57:24.740 --> 03:57:26.860
And she was like, like, you know, I have the other day,

03:57:26.860 --> 03:57:27.700
you know, in this conversation,

03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:30.100
she's like, the other day I opened up the popsicle box

03:57:30.100 --> 03:57:30.940
and there's cash.

03:57:30.940 --> 03:57:33.460
And I'm like, so I kind of explain it,

03:57:33.460 --> 03:57:35.740
but I had a feeling she's not going to,

03:57:35.740 --> 03:57:37.820
she's going to be okay with this, you know?

03:57:37.820 --> 03:57:38.660
So she was okay.

03:57:38.660 --> 03:57:39.500
She was okay with it.

03:57:39.500 --> 03:57:40.340
I mean, to me,

03:57:40.340 --> 03:57:43.420
that's just a fascinating conversation to have, like.

03:57:43.420 --> 03:57:44.980
It was a great conversation.

03:57:44.980 --> 03:57:46.660
Because oftentimes in relationships,

03:57:46.660 --> 03:57:49.060
you learn about each other and you find out new things.

03:57:49.900 --> 03:57:50.860
That's a doozy.

03:57:50.860 --> 03:57:52.620
Yeah, it's a good one to find out.

03:57:54.620 --> 03:57:57.820
The name you're using is not your real name.

03:57:57.820 --> 03:58:00.260
And the Secret Service, the FBI,

03:58:00.260 --> 03:58:02.500
and everybody else are looking for you.

03:58:02.500 --> 03:58:03.340
Yeah.

03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:04.620
And you're like, to be honest,

03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:06.540
you're not a violent criminal.

03:58:06.540 --> 03:58:08.780
So it's like, you know.

03:58:08.780 --> 03:58:10.300
But she didn't know my name.

03:58:10.300 --> 03:58:12.380
Like she was like, she,

03:58:13.340 --> 03:58:15.260
and I told her, I said, look, if you start digging,

03:58:15.260 --> 03:58:17.140
if you find out my name, like I'll leave.

03:58:17.140 --> 03:58:19.620
Like there's certain things that catch you.

03:58:19.620 --> 03:58:23.100
Staying in contact with people that you know,

03:58:23.100 --> 03:58:24.780
that's how you get caught, you know?

03:58:24.780 --> 03:58:28.020
Going back to see people, that's how you get caught, you know?

03:58:28.020 --> 03:58:30.860
Telling people who you are, that's how you get caught.

03:58:30.860 --> 03:58:34.060
And I was like, so I'm Joseph Carter.

03:58:35.340 --> 03:58:36.340
Everything's fine.

03:58:36.340 --> 03:58:38.620
And she was like, okay.

03:58:38.620 --> 03:58:40.340
You know, and keep in mind too,

03:58:40.340 --> 03:58:43.980
this girl, do you, oh, your car's broken?

03:58:43.980 --> 03:58:45.580
Or your car's not doing well?

03:58:45.580 --> 03:58:46.420
Take it and trade it in.

03:58:46.420 --> 03:58:47.300
We'll go get you another car.

03:58:47.300 --> 03:58:50.140
We'll go get you, you know, an Infiniti, you know,

03:58:50.140 --> 03:58:53.700
FX or whatever, you know, a $55,000, $60,000 vehicle.

03:58:53.700 --> 03:58:57.500
She's driving the equivalent of a beat up old Nova.

03:58:57.500 --> 03:58:59.900
You know, I mean, it's, you want to go on vacation?

03:58:59.900 --> 03:59:00.740
We'll go on vacation.

03:59:00.740 --> 03:59:01.580
You want to do this?

03:59:01.580 --> 03:59:02.420
You want to do that?

03:59:02.420 --> 03:59:03.500
So, you know, we're buying houses.

03:59:03.500 --> 03:59:06.060
We're renovating houses.

03:59:06.060 --> 03:59:08.020
We're building brand new houses.

03:59:08.020 --> 03:59:09.180
We're buying lots.

03:59:09.180 --> 03:59:10.740
Like she's like in the middle of this.

03:59:10.740 --> 03:59:12.700
Like, holy Jesus.

03:59:12.700 --> 03:59:15.060
There's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank,

03:59:15.060 --> 03:59:17.900
in our bank account, her bank account.

03:59:17.900 --> 03:59:20.020
I open up a corporation in her name.

03:59:20.020 --> 03:59:21.540
She's opening up bank accounts.

03:59:21.540 --> 03:59:23.300
She's got web, there's websites.

03:59:23.300 --> 03:59:24.940
It's a lot.

03:59:24.940 --> 03:59:28.300
And while this is happening,

03:59:30.180 --> 03:59:34.620
we start seeing a friend of hers.

03:59:34.620 --> 03:59:37.180
So this other girl comes in the picture.

03:59:37.180 --> 03:59:38.540
Her name's Trina.

03:59:38.540 --> 03:59:41.980
And Trina is

03:59:42.060 --> 03:59:46.420
um, semi-lesbian.

03:59:46.420 --> 03:59:47.260
So.

03:59:48.420 --> 03:59:49.820
Is this like a sexual thing?

03:59:49.820 --> 03:59:50.660
Yeah.

03:59:50.660 --> 03:59:51.500
Or actual relationship?

03:59:51.500 --> 03:59:53.100
No, it's more like a,

03:59:53.100 --> 03:59:54.580
she's coming over a couple of times a week.

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:55.420
Okay.

03:59:55.420 --> 03:59:57.780
So we've got a ton of tons going on.

03:59:59.380 --> 04:00:00.220
And,

04:00:02.460 --> 04:00:03.300
how do I put this?

04:00:03.300 --> 04:00:05.700
So while this is happening,

04:00:05.700 --> 04:00:09.100
I end up coming out in like several magazines.

04:00:09.100 --> 04:00:12.740
So I'm thinking this whole thing's dying down,

04:00:12.740 --> 04:00:13.900
but it's not dying down

04:00:13.900 --> 04:00:16.500
because now I just got caught and handcuffed in a bank,

04:00:16.500 --> 04:00:19.460
walked out of the police station, outran marshals.

04:00:19.460 --> 04:00:20.580
Although then that part,

04:00:20.580 --> 04:00:24.340
the marshal thing was never in the papers.

04:00:24.340 --> 04:00:28.340
But the getting caught and handcuffed in the bank,

04:00:28.340 --> 04:00:29.980
when that hit the papers,

04:00:29.980 --> 04:00:30.820
that's everywhere, bro.

04:00:30.820 --> 04:00:31.820
That's huge, you know?

04:00:31.820 --> 04:00:36.020
Suddenly Chicago Tribune's running a series of fugitives.

04:00:36.020 --> 04:00:37.700
I'm in Bloomberg Business Week.

04:00:37.700 --> 04:00:42.380
They run an article called Sharks in the Housing Pool.

04:00:42.380 --> 04:00:45.140
Then you've got a Fortune Magazine comes out with a thing

04:00:45.140 --> 04:00:46.500
because by now, guess what?

04:00:46.500 --> 04:00:47.780
Becky's been caught.

04:00:48.660 --> 04:00:49.500
Oh, Becky.

04:00:49.500 --> 04:00:50.340
Becky.

04:00:50.340 --> 04:00:51.180
Oh, Becky.

04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:52.380
Is she in Houston or whatever?

04:00:52.380 --> 04:00:54.060
In Houston, got caught.

04:00:54.060 --> 04:00:55.780
And did she?

04:00:55.780 --> 04:00:57.460
But gangster, bro.

04:00:57.460 --> 04:00:58.540
Like the way she, here's the thing.

04:00:58.540 --> 04:01:00.460
Hey, hey, there you go.

04:01:00.460 --> 04:01:01.300
No.

04:01:01.300 --> 04:01:02.420
Oh no, she told on me immediately.

04:01:02.420 --> 04:01:03.260
Oh, she did?

04:01:03.260 --> 04:01:04.140
Oh no.

04:01:04.140 --> 04:01:05.620
It's fine, she did the right thing.

04:01:05.620 --> 04:01:06.940
So here's what's funny about that.

04:01:06.940 --> 04:01:08.180
I don't know about that.

04:01:08.180 --> 04:01:09.900
She, here's what she says.

04:01:09.900 --> 04:01:12.020
Loyalty is everything in this world, my friend.

04:01:12.020 --> 04:01:13.460
Did that, you and I disagree on?

04:01:13.460 --> 04:01:14.780
I just took off.

04:01:14.780 --> 04:01:15.700
I just took off.

04:01:15.700 --> 04:01:16.540
Still.

04:01:16.540 --> 04:01:18.980
On her and left her with, with, listen,

04:01:18.980 --> 04:01:21.620
with like six or like five or $600,000

04:01:21.620 --> 04:01:23.700
is what I left her with.

04:01:23.700 --> 04:01:25.820
It's not all about money, Matthew.

04:01:25.820 --> 04:01:29.620
It's also about just like, you know, ride or die.

04:01:29.620 --> 04:01:30.540
There's a meaning to that.

04:01:30.540 --> 04:01:31.380
My God.

04:01:31.380 --> 04:01:32.220
I'm sorry.

04:01:32.220 --> 04:01:33.580
Go ahead.

04:01:33.580 --> 04:01:35.460
So she told on, she said everything.

04:01:35.460 --> 04:01:37.060
Well, here's what, when I say gangster,

04:01:37.060 --> 04:01:38.540
when she gets caught.

04:01:38.540 --> 04:01:39.380
Yeah.

04:01:40.540 --> 04:01:42.980
They come in, she's in the middle of beauty school.

04:01:42.980 --> 04:01:44.500
She's paid for beauty school.

04:01:44.500 --> 04:01:45.540
She's going through beauty school.

04:01:45.540 --> 04:01:47.260
She's going to open like a salon or something.

04:01:47.260 --> 04:01:49.380
So she's in there cutting hair in a class, you know,

04:01:49.380 --> 04:01:52.940
on a mannequin and all of a sudden like five or six

04:01:52.940 --> 04:01:56.180
secret service agents come in, guns drawn, screaming,

04:01:56.180 --> 04:01:57.620
get on the ground, get on the ground.

04:01:57.620 --> 04:01:59.380
She said, everybody dropped the ground.

04:01:59.380 --> 04:02:01.580
She said, I'm sitting there with scissors going.

04:02:02.060 --> 04:02:05.540
You know, they grab her, they handcuff her,

04:02:05.540 --> 04:02:07.220
they bring her in and the whole time.

04:02:07.220 --> 04:02:09.660
Now at that point she was Rebecca or she was,

04:02:10.700 --> 04:02:11.860
her name was Rebecca Hickey.

04:02:11.860 --> 04:02:13.300
She went by Becca.

04:02:13.300 --> 04:02:16.220
So she's Rebecca Hickey, which is, you know,

04:02:16.220 --> 04:02:18.980
she's got a Texas driver's license, the whole thing.

04:02:18.980 --> 04:02:21.620
And they're screaming at her and they, she,

04:02:21.620 --> 04:02:23.740
they put her in the car and they're driving the whole way.

04:02:23.740 --> 04:02:26.860
She goes, the guy, the secret service agent told me 45

04:02:26.860 --> 04:02:30.420
minutes, she's telling us you're losing your job, bro.

04:02:30.420 --> 04:02:31.260
You're losing.

04:02:31.260 --> 04:02:33.300
I mean, he was, he's like, I couldn't believe it.

04:02:33.300 --> 04:02:34.860
Like we've got pictures of her.

04:02:34.860 --> 04:02:35.700
We're like, this is you.

04:02:35.700 --> 04:02:37.700
She's like, that's not me.

04:02:37.700 --> 04:02:39.340
Are you insane?

04:02:39.340 --> 04:02:41.060
Look at that chubby little thing.

04:02:42.980 --> 04:02:45.540
Would not budge till they actually put her hand

04:02:45.540 --> 04:02:46.580
on the scanner.

04:02:46.580 --> 04:02:48.860
And she goes, okay, I'm, I'm Rebecca Hauk.

04:02:48.860 --> 04:02:49.700
What do you need?

04:02:50.860 --> 04:02:51.860
They're like, where's Matt Cox?

04:02:51.860 --> 04:02:55.220
She's, I have no idea that fucker left me like a year ago.

04:02:55.220 --> 04:03:00.020
So, so, but she contributed to the story,

04:03:00.020 --> 04:03:01.780
to the legend that's already growing.

04:03:01.780 --> 04:03:05.780
Oh, because she was interviewed by a fortune magazine

04:03:05.780 --> 04:03:07.540
and it was horrendous.

04:03:07.540 --> 04:03:08.940
The article is horrendous.

04:03:08.940 --> 04:03:10.540
He was abusive.

04:03:10.540 --> 04:03:14.100
He, he's a Don Juan that, that forced me to fall

04:03:14.100 --> 04:03:16.380
in love with him, commit mortgage fraud,

04:03:16.380 --> 04:03:19.300
and then took all the money and left.

04:03:19.300 --> 04:03:23.260
By the way, they found like 40 or 50 grand on her

04:03:23.260 --> 04:03:25.940
and maybe another 30 or 40 in her bank account

04:03:25.940 --> 04:03:27.180
and no other money.

04:03:28.180 --> 04:03:29.380
Hmm.

04:03:29.380 --> 04:03:30.220
Yeah.

04:03:30.220 --> 04:03:32.060
Where's the other money?

04:03:32.060 --> 04:03:35.020
So anyway, and she was, by the way, she got caught.

04:03:35.020 --> 04:03:37.780
She was in communication with her family.

04:03:39.100 --> 04:03:40.580
So she's talking to her mom.

04:03:40.580 --> 04:03:41.780
That's when she got caught ultimately.

04:03:41.780 --> 04:03:44.060
And her mother through multiple conversations,

04:03:44.060 --> 04:03:47.900
one conversation being, mom, I'm doing fine.

04:03:47.900 --> 04:03:50.140
I can't tell you where I am exactly,

04:03:50.140 --> 04:03:51.540
but I'm in Houston, Texas.

04:03:51.540 --> 04:03:52.380
I'm fine.

04:03:52.380 --> 04:03:56.580
Next one, six months later, I enrolled in beauty school.

04:03:56.980 --> 04:03:58.500
Houston, Texas beauty school.

04:03:58.500 --> 04:03:59.820
How many are there?

04:03:59.820 --> 04:04:02.260
And her mom, bipolar.

04:04:02.260 --> 04:04:04.300
I just want to see my daughter.

04:04:04.300 --> 04:04:06.380
I'm going to call the secret service.

04:04:06.380 --> 04:04:08.060
I'm doing the right thing.

04:04:08.060 --> 04:04:09.740
And honestly, she is doing the right thing.

04:04:09.740 --> 04:04:11.340
So.

04:04:11.340 --> 04:04:13.700
So you're getting more and more famous.

04:04:13.700 --> 04:04:14.540
It's bad.

04:04:14.540 --> 04:04:15.380
Nationally.

04:04:15.380 --> 04:04:16.220
Right.

04:04:16.220 --> 04:04:18.060
So I've got all these houses.

04:04:18.060 --> 04:04:20.180
You're having a threesome with Amanda and Trina.

04:04:20.180 --> 04:04:25.060
And, and what ends up happening is we end up going,

04:04:25.220 --> 04:04:27.700
and listen, Amanda and I, we've gone on,

04:04:27.700 --> 04:04:30.660
we've gone to Greece,

04:04:30.660 --> 04:04:31.500
Italy,

04:04:33.100 --> 04:04:34.780
Croatia.

04:04:34.780 --> 04:04:37.180
We're, we're, we've gone, we're going on multiple,

04:04:37.180 --> 04:04:39.340
just multiple trips.

04:04:39.340 --> 04:04:44.140
And when we'd just gotten back from like a 10 day cruise

04:04:44.140 --> 04:04:45.300
of the Greek Isles.

04:04:46.980 --> 04:04:50.660
And there's,

04:04:50.660 --> 04:04:52.900
we get home and Amanda goes online

04:04:52.980 --> 04:04:57.220
and there's a blog about Dateline

04:04:57.220 --> 04:04:59.860
about their, one of their new specials

04:04:59.860 --> 04:05:02.020
called the thief of hearts.

04:05:02.020 --> 04:05:03.180
And that's me.

04:05:03.180 --> 04:05:05.500
Apparently I'm the thief of hearts.

04:05:05.500 --> 04:05:08.860
And I'm apparently going around and I'm,

04:05:08.860 --> 04:05:11.340
and it's based on, you know, Rebecca's, you know,

04:05:11.340 --> 04:05:16.340
Becky's story that I'm wooing women to commit fraud,

04:05:16.420 --> 04:05:17.780
stealing all the money and then leaving them

04:05:17.780 --> 04:05:19.020
to hold the bag.

04:05:19.020 --> 04:05:22.420
Well, they interviewed her.

04:05:22.420 --> 04:05:24.260
They're interviewing multiple people,

04:05:24.260 --> 04:05:27.180
multiple in my, in my case.

04:05:27.180 --> 04:05:28.140
They put together this,

04:05:28.140 --> 04:05:30.580
they're putting together an episode,

04:05:30.580 --> 04:05:33.260
gonna be released in a few, in a month or so.

04:05:33.260 --> 04:05:34.660
So I'm terrified.

04:05:34.660 --> 04:05:36.780
I have, at this point I've been on the run three years

04:05:36.780 --> 04:05:38.140
and I'm like, I mean, there's lots of things

04:05:38.140 --> 04:05:39.220
I could care less about.

04:05:39.220 --> 04:05:41.500
Fortune, I don't know anybody that reads Fortune.

04:05:41.500 --> 04:05:43.980
Bloomberg, come on, I hang out with,

04:05:43.980 --> 04:05:45.980
I'm hanging out with contractors and laborers.

04:05:45.980 --> 04:05:47.780
And you know, I'm not hanging out with these guys.

04:05:47.780 --> 04:05:52.140
So, you know, local news, who cares?

04:05:52.380 --> 04:05:56.140
Even local news channels, you know, I don't care.

04:05:56.140 --> 04:06:00.940
But Dateline, there weren't 400 channels back then,

04:06:00.940 --> 04:06:03.220
you know, so Dateline comes out,

04:06:03.220 --> 04:06:04.700
even if you don't see it the first time,

04:06:04.700 --> 04:06:06.820
they're gonna rerun it in three months or six months

04:06:06.820 --> 04:06:08.300
or in five years, 10 years from now,

04:06:08.300 --> 04:06:09.860
they might rerun it again.

04:06:09.860 --> 04:06:11.220
My face is gonna be on it.

04:06:11.220 --> 04:06:13.340
So I could be perfectly fine five years from now.

04:06:13.340 --> 04:06:16.380
And one day I, the barista that I go to every,

04:06:16.380 --> 04:06:19.340
every other day, looks at Dateline and goes,

04:06:19.340 --> 04:06:21.460
oh my God, that's Mr. Johnson

04:06:21.460 --> 04:06:24.100
or that's Mr. Thomas or whatever.

04:06:24.100 --> 04:06:26.460
So the point is, is that I was like, I gotta go,

04:06:26.460 --> 04:06:28.380
I can't stay here, I gotta get out of the country.

04:06:28.380 --> 04:06:29.940
So I was gonna go to,

04:06:31.540 --> 04:06:32.820
well, we really started doing research

04:06:32.820 --> 04:06:36.340
and Amanda ended up saying Australia.

04:06:36.340 --> 04:06:38.820
Australia at the time, I don't know how it is now,

04:06:38.820 --> 04:06:41.260
but at the time, if you went to Australia

04:06:41.260 --> 04:06:46.260
with like $100,000 and a business plan,

04:06:46.580 --> 04:06:50.180
you could become a permanent resident alien.

04:06:50.180 --> 04:06:53.980
You can't vote, but you can buy property,

04:06:53.980 --> 04:06:56.900
you can open a business, but you can't get a job.

04:06:56.900 --> 04:06:59.260
And they didn't require a fingerprints.

04:06:59.260 --> 04:07:03.140
So there's no criminal background check.

04:07:03.140 --> 04:07:04.460
Now, if you wanted to be a citizen,

04:07:04.460 --> 04:07:06.500
you have to get an FBI criminal background check.

04:07:06.500 --> 04:07:08.820
Like I got, no, I'm good.

04:07:08.820 --> 04:07:11.220
So I was like, wow, I can go there and start a business

04:07:11.220 --> 04:07:14.060
and I'm gonna start show up with a couple million.

04:07:14.060 --> 04:07:16.860
So what we do is we start refinancing houses.

04:07:16.860 --> 04:07:19.260
We'll start pulling out money as quick as we can.

04:07:20.140 --> 04:07:23.380
I'm asking guys, laborers, guys that I work with,

04:07:23.380 --> 04:07:25.580
my general contractor, my real estate agent,

04:07:25.580 --> 04:07:28.140
hey man, can you cash this check for six grand?

04:07:28.140 --> 04:07:30.660
Nobody says no, everybody, yeah, no problem, no problem.

04:07:30.660 --> 04:07:32.820
Few guys like, yeah, man, if you give me 10%,

04:07:32.820 --> 04:07:34.700
yeah, I'll give you 10%.

04:07:34.700 --> 04:07:37.660
So that's happening, we're pulling out cash.

04:07:38.660 --> 04:07:43.660
One day, Amanda gives Trina a bunch of checks

04:07:48.340 --> 04:07:50.220
and asks her to cash them.

04:07:50.220 --> 04:07:54.740
That sparks a conversation that like what it was happening.

04:07:55.660 --> 04:08:00.020
She confides in, by this point, by the way,

04:08:00.020 --> 04:08:01.260
Amanda knows who I am.

04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:05.300
So by this point, she's actually came across the letter

04:08:05.300 --> 04:08:08.660
that I wrote to my parents when I left Tampa.

04:08:08.660 --> 04:08:10.340
So she's figured out who I am.

04:08:11.540 --> 04:08:14.540
She tells Trina, his name's Matt Cox,

04:08:14.540 --> 04:08:17.060
dateline's coming out, we're leaving,

04:08:17.060 --> 04:08:18.500
we gotta get a bunch of cash.

04:08:19.380 --> 04:08:21.420
And Trina goes, okay, I'll cash the checks.

04:08:21.420 --> 04:08:24.460
What she does instead is she calls the Secret Service.

04:08:24.460 --> 04:08:28.020
They watch my house for three days, I come home one day,

04:08:29.380 --> 04:08:33.180
they pull the cars up and they arrest me.

04:08:34.180 --> 04:08:36.300
So, it's a little bit longer than that,

04:08:36.300 --> 04:08:40.700
but that's just a short version of me getting arrested

04:08:40.700 --> 04:08:42.060
and I've probably skipped over a whole bunch of-

04:08:42.060 --> 04:08:44.020
It's so simple because you've gotten away

04:08:44.020 --> 04:08:46.420
with much more complex situations.

04:08:47.540 --> 04:08:49.700
It's women, man, it's women.

04:08:49.700 --> 04:08:50.540
Wow.

04:08:50.540 --> 04:08:51.380
Just joking.

04:08:51.380 --> 04:08:55.940
They also are the thing that make life worthwhile.

04:08:55.940 --> 04:08:59.740
Listen, God bless Trina, she did the right thing.

04:08:59.740 --> 04:09:00.580
Honestly, based on-

04:09:00.580 --> 04:09:02.020
There you go, back to the right thing.

04:09:02.180 --> 04:09:04.700
But I mean, based on what she saw,

04:09:05.660 --> 04:09:07.620
based on what the Secret Service told her

04:09:08.860 --> 04:09:12.300
and the articles that she's reading, I'm a bad guy.

04:09:12.300 --> 04:09:13.940
I mean, I'm a bad guy in general, right?

04:09:13.940 --> 04:09:16.500
So, I don't deserve loyalty, I don't think so.

04:09:17.860 --> 04:09:19.500
I'm ripping people off and she's thinking

04:09:19.500 --> 04:09:22.260
that her friend is in danger.

04:09:23.620 --> 04:09:27.100
The FBI is saying, I have a weapon, he's dangerous,

04:09:27.100 --> 04:09:30.340
he's got a weapon, we believe he's armed and dangerous.

04:09:30.380 --> 04:09:33.380
When I was in Florida, I had a concealed weapons permit,

04:09:33.380 --> 04:09:36.980
but I had gotten rid of both my guns

04:09:36.980 --> 04:09:38.060
when I was placed on probation.

04:09:38.060 --> 04:09:40.620
I've never had one since, I've never touched a gun since.

04:09:40.620 --> 04:09:43.340
But they used that to say, they said,

04:09:43.340 --> 04:09:44.620
oh, he had a concealed weapons permit?

04:09:44.620 --> 04:09:46.340
Okay, well then he's armed and dangerous.

04:09:46.340 --> 04:09:47.180
Like there's these little things

04:09:47.180 --> 04:09:49.260
and think they're telling her, read this article.

04:09:49.260 --> 04:09:51.380
Look, he forces girls to fall in love with them,

04:09:51.380 --> 04:09:54.420
then he just wishes he's gonna do your friend.

04:09:54.420 --> 04:09:57.180
So she negotiated, also I think she got 10,000.

04:09:57.180 --> 04:09:58.580
I think it was just embarrassing.

04:09:58.580 --> 04:10:01.060
I'm ashamed that she got $10,000.

04:10:02.180 --> 04:10:03.500
And said everything.

04:10:03.500 --> 04:10:05.340
Yeah, and told them this is where he is,

04:10:05.340 --> 04:10:06.980
his name is Joseph Carter.

04:10:10.220 --> 04:10:11.500
This is where he is, they watch it,

04:10:11.500 --> 04:10:12.940
they grab me, they arrest me.

04:10:12.940 --> 04:10:14.420
They bring me downtown.

04:10:16.180 --> 04:10:18.500
What did you feel like when you got?

04:10:18.500 --> 04:10:19.700
I didn't feel good, bro, it was bad.

04:10:19.700 --> 04:10:21.500
It was a bad day, it was a bad day.

04:10:22.420 --> 04:10:27.420
First of all, Casino Royale was coming out on Friday.

04:10:29.060 --> 04:10:34.260
It was the first Daniel Craig as James Bond.

04:10:34.260 --> 04:10:37.420
And the whole week I'd been telling Amanda,

04:10:37.420 --> 04:10:38.780
I'm gonna go see Casino Royale.

04:10:38.780 --> 04:10:40.060
She go, okay, well, on Saturday,

04:10:40.060 --> 04:10:41.020
we're gonna go to the festival.

04:10:41.020 --> 04:10:43.700
I go, that's fine, but on Friday,

04:10:43.700 --> 04:10:45.420
Casino, and she's like, right, Casino Royale.

04:10:45.420 --> 04:10:46.420
And then she's like, okay, by the way,

04:10:46.420 --> 04:10:48.020
on Thursday, I thought we could go to dinner.

04:10:48.020 --> 04:10:51.380
That's fine, but on Friday, Casino Royale.

04:10:51.380 --> 04:10:52.700
And when they put the handcuffs on me,

04:10:52.700 --> 04:10:54.700
you know what the first thing I thought of?

04:10:54.700 --> 04:10:56.580
I'm not gonna fucking sit to see Casino Royale.

04:10:56.580 --> 04:10:58.060
I'm not gonna get to see it.

04:10:58.060 --> 04:10:58.900
Not gonna see it.

04:10:58.900 --> 04:11:01.300
And I saw it about five, six years later

04:11:01.300 --> 04:11:04.100
on the institution's movie channel.

04:11:04.100 --> 04:11:05.260
You know, it was nice.

04:11:05.260 --> 04:11:08.540
It's not the same, but yeah.

04:11:08.540 --> 04:11:12.020
So they bring me to Nashville,

04:11:12.020 --> 04:11:15.500
then they transport me to all over the place.

04:11:15.500 --> 04:11:19.760
I go on Conair, they fly me to Oklahoma.

04:11:20.860 --> 04:11:24.060
They fly me to Atlanta.

04:11:24.060 --> 04:11:25.900
Then I go to Atlanta.

04:11:26.060 --> 04:11:28.660
I'm placed in the U.S. Marshal's holdover.

04:11:28.660 --> 04:11:32.200
I get assigned an attorney, go in front of the judge.

04:11:33.740 --> 04:11:37.580
Plead not guilty, meet with my attorney.

04:11:37.580 --> 04:11:38.980
You always plead not guilty, you know?

04:11:38.980 --> 04:11:39.820
Whenever he makes people say,

04:11:39.820 --> 04:11:41.500
can you believe that he pled not guilty?

04:11:41.500 --> 04:11:42.980
That's the first thing.

04:11:42.980 --> 04:11:44.340
Nobody walks in and pleads guilty.

04:11:44.340 --> 04:11:45.180
You plead not guilty

04:11:45.180 --> 04:11:46.980
while you kind of figure out what you're gonna do.

04:11:46.980 --> 04:11:48.340
So I plead not guilty.

04:11:48.340 --> 04:11:50.860
There's no bond, obviously.

04:11:50.860 --> 04:11:51.900
I've got, they caught me.

04:11:51.900 --> 04:11:54.900
When they caught me, I had four or five passports.

04:11:54.900 --> 04:11:57.300
So that's no good.

04:11:58.300 --> 04:12:02.740
They charged me with bank fraud,

04:12:02.740 --> 04:12:04.260
conspiracy, commit bank fraud,

04:12:04.260 --> 04:12:09.100
wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud,

04:12:09.100 --> 04:12:12.580
conspiracy, or what was it again?

04:12:12.580 --> 04:12:16.240
Aggravated identity theft, money laundering,

04:12:16.240 --> 04:12:18.320
use of a fraudulent passport.

04:12:19.500 --> 04:12:22.140
And there's like, there's like, you know,

04:12:22.140 --> 04:12:24.700
30 counts of this, 20 counts of this, 20.

04:12:25.500 --> 04:12:26.340
But none of that matters.

04:12:26.340 --> 04:12:27.180
Like, even if you just took the,

04:12:27.180 --> 04:12:28.900
dropped all the counts, the one count, stacked them,

04:12:28.900 --> 04:12:30.580
it's like 150 something years.

04:12:30.580 --> 04:12:31.420
Not that different.

04:12:31.420 --> 04:12:32.620
Yeah, so everything, everything they put in.

04:12:32.620 --> 04:12:33.740
And that's what they always say.

04:12:33.740 --> 04:12:35.340
You're looking at 150,000, you know,

04:12:35.340 --> 04:12:36.180
and your lawyers, they're like,

04:12:36.180 --> 04:12:37.180
this, you're not looking at that.

04:12:37.180 --> 04:12:39.100
You're looking at 54 years.

04:12:39.100 --> 04:12:39.940
What?

04:12:39.940 --> 04:12:41.260
That's no better.

04:12:41.260 --> 04:12:42.740
That's no better.

04:12:42.740 --> 04:12:47.360
So, yeah, so my lawyer comes in and sees me one day,

04:12:48.300 --> 04:12:50.220
you know, like our first meeting.

04:12:50.220 --> 04:12:53.380
And she says, you know, I'm merely done.

04:12:54.340 --> 04:12:58.700
And she says, listen, I've looked at everything.

04:12:58.700 --> 04:13:02.140
For first, they say, you're responsible for,

04:13:02.140 --> 04:13:06.940
it's like 25 or 20, or 30, 25 or $26 million in loss.

04:13:06.940 --> 04:13:08.820
And I'm like, that's, I've never, that's not true.

04:13:08.820 --> 04:13:10.220
That's not true.

04:13:10.220 --> 04:13:11.900
And I was like, you know, not even,

04:13:11.900 --> 04:13:13.780
I said, not even potential law.

04:13:13.780 --> 04:13:14.620
There's just no way.

04:13:14.620 --> 04:13:15.460
I mean, there's no way.

04:13:15.460 --> 04:13:17.660
And then they come back, she comes back and she says,

04:13:17.660 --> 04:13:22.240
well, they're saying 19 million.

04:13:22.240 --> 04:13:23.880
No, it's not possible.

04:13:23.880 --> 04:13:26.320
I didn't know.

04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:30.320
So when the FBI is saying like 40 million,

04:13:30.320 --> 04:13:34.040
they're saying 11.5 in Tampa plus 40 million

04:13:34.040 --> 04:13:35.480
for the mortgage company.

04:13:35.480 --> 04:13:39.200
So it ends up being like, plus what I stole on the run,

04:13:39.200 --> 04:13:40.800
it ends up being like 55 million,

04:13:40.800 --> 04:13:42.960
but she gets them to drop like the 40.

04:13:42.960 --> 04:13:45.080
Like that's his brokers.

04:13:45.080 --> 04:13:46.400
That's this, that's that, drop it.

04:13:46.400 --> 04:13:48.280
And they're like, he's so done.

04:13:48.280 --> 04:13:49.100
It doesn't matter.

04:13:49.100 --> 04:13:49.940
They drop that.

04:13:50.100 --> 04:13:52.420
It ends up being like 15 million.

04:13:52.420 --> 04:13:56.180
And then it's down to, what is the, oh, they said 9.5

04:13:56.180 --> 04:13:58.160
and I got it down to like 6 million.

04:13:58.160 --> 04:14:01.540
So, you know, which, you know, I'm good for.

04:14:01.540 --> 04:14:05.980
So what ends up happening is they've charged me

04:14:05.980 --> 04:14:10.980
with all these things and, and she's like, okay, you know,

04:14:11.500 --> 04:14:15.980
you're like, you can, you can plead guilty

04:14:15.980 --> 04:14:18.420
and you can go with the sentencing guidelines,

04:14:18.460 --> 04:14:21.860
which is going to be like, she's like, I mean, it depends.

04:14:21.860 --> 04:14:24.820
She said, it might be whatever, 54 years she's,

04:14:24.820 --> 04:14:27.540
but if they run them, you know, concurrent or consecutive,

04:14:27.540 --> 04:14:30.100
depending on which one they do, she said,

04:14:30.100 --> 04:14:33.820
most likely it ends up being like 30 years.

04:14:33.820 --> 04:14:36.700
You know, it's like, that's not good.

04:14:36.700 --> 04:14:37.980
That's not good.

04:14:37.980 --> 04:14:39.940
So we kind of go back and forth, back and forth

04:14:39.940 --> 04:14:41.640
and figure out, try and figure out where I'm,

04:14:41.640 --> 04:14:42.700
what I'm looking at.

04:14:44.060 --> 04:14:48.060
Now, as we go through the whole thing, we end up,

04:14:48.060 --> 04:14:51.140
she ends up with, she ends up saying, you know,

04:14:52.900 --> 04:14:55.780
she knocks off a bunch of stuff that they're saying I did,

04:14:55.780 --> 04:14:58.460
you know, enhancements.

04:14:58.460 --> 04:14:59.700
Cause you all have a base level,

04:14:59.700 --> 04:15:02.980
a base level of let's say a level eight, you know,

04:15:02.980 --> 04:15:06.900
that should be, that should be maybe a few years,

04:15:06.900 --> 04:15:09.500
but then they start adding on enhancements, you know.

04:15:10.540 --> 04:15:13.860
Did he, did what he do, was it sophisticated?

04:15:13.860 --> 04:15:16.820
Yes, okay, three levels for sophisticated means.

04:15:16.820 --> 04:15:18.600
Were there more than how many victims?

04:15:18.600 --> 04:15:19.740
Were there more than 50 victims?

04:15:19.740 --> 04:15:22.420
Yes, okay, that's six more levels.

04:15:22.420 --> 04:15:25.700
Okay, did he change the jurisdiction to evade detection?

04:15:25.700 --> 04:15:27.140
Yes, that's four more levels.

04:15:27.140 --> 04:15:29.420
Okay, did he, they start adding, boom, boom.

04:15:29.420 --> 04:15:31.660
And when you start adding up all those levels,

04:15:32.780 --> 04:15:34.060
plus your criminal history,

04:15:34.060 --> 04:15:35.220
and I have a big criminal history

04:15:35.220 --> 04:15:37.780
because I was already on federal probation

04:15:37.780 --> 04:15:40.180
and I committed a new crime on federal probation.

04:15:40.180 --> 04:15:42.460
So that was another enhancement.

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:44.180
And this, you know, this case,

04:15:44.180 --> 04:15:45.380
so I'm in like a category,

04:15:45.380 --> 04:15:47.820
I'm in like category two or three.

04:15:47.820 --> 04:15:50.740
So they come back and they're saying,

04:15:51.980 --> 04:15:55.540
I forget, it's like 20, well, they don't come back

04:15:55.540 --> 04:15:57.660
right away, but she ends up saying,

04:15:57.660 --> 04:16:00.100
you're probably looking at 14 years.

04:16:00.100 --> 04:16:02.260
Okay, that's reasonable, that's reasonable.

04:16:03.420 --> 04:16:06.760
And so she's saying, so we get the,

04:16:06.760 --> 04:16:08.400
when we get the PSI back,

04:16:08.400 --> 04:16:10.700
we eventually get what's called a pre-sentence report.

04:16:10.700 --> 04:16:12.660
They're saying 26 years.

04:16:12.660 --> 04:16:14.580
Well, they really said 32 years.

04:16:15.620 --> 04:16:19.800
And I argued and we got it down to 26 years and four months.

04:16:19.800 --> 04:16:22.060
That's what it is, it's 316 months.

04:16:22.060 --> 04:16:23.660
That's how they do it in months.

04:16:25.700 --> 04:16:28.300
Doesn't sting that much, I guess, if you say months.

04:16:30.060 --> 04:16:33.300
Yeah, so she says to me, Millie sits down with me

04:16:33.300 --> 04:16:38.260
and she says, listen, you gotta cooperate.

04:16:38.260 --> 04:16:39.860
And I was like, okay.

04:16:39.860 --> 04:16:42.780
And she said, because you're guilty,

04:16:42.780 --> 04:16:44.420
you're extremely guilty.

04:16:44.420 --> 04:16:46.960
She's like, you can't go to trial.

04:16:46.960 --> 04:16:49.260
And she said, so you need to cooperate.

04:16:49.260 --> 04:16:50.620
I was like, well, what do I get if I cooperate?

04:16:50.620 --> 04:16:52.620
She's the way it works is you cooperate

04:16:53.740 --> 04:16:56.780
and you hope for the best.

04:16:56.780 --> 04:16:57.940
And I was like, are you serious?

04:16:57.940 --> 04:16:59.420
She's, you tell them everything, you know,

04:16:59.420 --> 04:17:01.060
and you hope for the best.

04:17:01.060 --> 04:17:03.660
And she's like, the part of the problem is she said,

04:17:03.660 --> 04:17:06.140
everybody in Tampa has cooperated.

04:17:06.140 --> 04:17:08.380
Rebecca has cooperated.

04:17:08.380 --> 04:17:10.100
And everyone across the board has cooperated.

04:17:10.100 --> 04:17:12.180
There's nobody that hasn't cooperated.

04:17:12.180 --> 04:17:13.660
By the way, when you say cooperating,

04:17:13.660 --> 04:17:16.380
you mean they're an informant, they told,

04:17:16.380 --> 04:17:17.420
AKA snitched.

04:17:17.420 --> 04:17:19.820
Right, they came in, they sat down with their lawyer

04:17:19.820 --> 04:17:21.180
and they said, this is what he did.

04:17:21.180 --> 04:17:22.380
He did this, he did that.

04:17:22.380 --> 04:17:23.380
They showed him documents.

04:17:23.380 --> 04:17:25.640
Yes, yes, yes, that's my signature.

04:17:25.640 --> 04:17:27.220
I didn't know what that was.

04:17:27.220 --> 04:17:28.940
You know, everything was my fault.

04:17:28.940 --> 04:17:31.300
They didn't do anything, it was all me.

04:17:31.300 --> 04:17:34.060
So they've all cooperated and they haven't been charged.

04:17:34.060 --> 04:17:34.900
They've been indicted.

04:17:34.900 --> 04:17:37.180
They're all named as unnamed co-conspirators

04:17:37.180 --> 04:17:38.460
on my indictment.

04:17:38.460 --> 04:17:40.140
So I've got like 12 people,

04:17:40.140 --> 04:17:41.620
even there's like probably 20 people that are involved,

04:17:41.620 --> 04:17:43.660
but there's like 12 of them that are,

04:17:43.660 --> 04:17:47.940
so I've got all these names, you know, KB, DL, CY,

04:17:47.940 --> 04:17:50.180
you know, it's like, I know who that is.

04:17:50.180 --> 04:17:52.420
Like I know who DW, that's Dave Walker.

04:17:52.420 --> 04:17:54.660
I know who, you know, I know who these people are.

04:17:54.660 --> 04:17:56.780
And so there's just a list of, there's like 12 of them,

04:17:56.780 --> 04:17:57.780
you know, plus me.

04:17:59.300 --> 04:18:04.020
So, and some of them walked in and said, I'm guilty.

04:18:04.020 --> 04:18:06.100
I just want to be plead guilty.

04:18:06.740 --> 04:18:10.540
The girl, Allison, she walked in, said,

04:18:10.540 --> 04:18:15.540
I'm too, I'm tired of waiting for you to come get me.

04:18:15.740 --> 04:18:16.580
Walked in with her lawyer and said,

04:18:16.580 --> 04:18:18.620
I just want to plead guilty.

04:18:18.620 --> 04:18:21.140
And they sentenced her and she went to jail.

04:18:21.140 --> 04:18:23.780
She got like 36 months or 30 months.

04:18:27.020 --> 04:18:32.020
She called the prison, she went to the low security,

04:18:32.820 --> 04:18:35.500
it was a female prison at the time, female camp.

04:18:35.500 --> 04:18:36.940
Called the camp and asked her

04:18:36.940 --> 04:18:40.060
if she could come by for a tour before she went.

04:18:41.020 --> 04:18:42.540
And they went, excuse me?

04:18:42.540 --> 04:18:45.660
She said, well, I'm going to be there for about two years.

04:18:45.660 --> 04:18:47.860
So I'd like to come in as like a tour I can take

04:18:47.860 --> 04:18:49.340
because I'd like to know where I'm going

04:18:49.340 --> 04:18:51.860
and what it's going to be like, how I should prepare.

04:18:51.860 --> 04:18:53.100
And they just started laughing.

04:18:53.100 --> 04:18:54.620
They said, there's no tour, sweetie.

04:18:54.620 --> 04:18:56.580
We'll give you the tour when you get here.

04:18:58.580 --> 04:18:59.900
You gotta love that.

04:18:59.900 --> 04:19:02.220
Yeah, I mean, I thought I was, I didn't think,

04:19:02.220 --> 04:19:04.020
I thought I wasn't prepared.

04:19:04.980 --> 04:19:06.620
There's no tour.

04:19:06.620 --> 04:19:11.620
So Becky got 70 months, but when I got caught

04:19:12.020 --> 04:19:14.620
and when I was sentenced, they reduced it to like 30

04:19:14.620 --> 04:19:15.980
or no, 40 to 40 months.

04:19:15.980 --> 04:19:16.820
They reduced it.

04:19:16.820 --> 04:19:20.100
Because she co-operated that term.

04:19:21.180 --> 04:19:22.020
Right.

04:19:22.020 --> 04:19:23.100
Do you want to say snitch?

04:19:23.100 --> 04:19:27.340
Well, there must be, I mean, snitch is too harsh of a word,

04:19:27.340 --> 04:19:32.220
but yeah, the ratted, I mean, you're saying, I don't know.

04:19:32.220 --> 04:19:33.740
We can get there, we'll get there.

04:19:33.780 --> 04:19:36.020
All right, all right.

04:19:36.020 --> 04:19:39.900
So where did the sentencing end up?

04:19:39.900 --> 04:19:44.900
So I should say first on the cooperation subject,

04:19:47.100 --> 04:19:49.660
my lawyer wanted me to cooperate.

04:19:49.660 --> 04:19:53.420
And by this point I realized like, you don't have a choice.

04:19:53.420 --> 04:19:55.100
No, that's not true.

04:19:55.100 --> 04:19:56.620
I could have been a gangster.

04:19:58.660 --> 04:20:00.220
What does it mean to be a gangster in this case?

04:20:00.220 --> 04:20:05.220
Like a standup guy, I could have said, I'll just take it.

04:20:05.220 --> 04:20:07.900
Give me 54 years, go fuck yourself.

04:20:07.900 --> 04:20:09.620
I'm not going to snitch on nobody.

04:20:09.620 --> 04:20:13.020
And I know you look at me and you think tough guy.

04:20:13.020 --> 04:20:16.020
I'm not a tough guy at all.

04:20:16.020 --> 04:20:19.300
I'm not doing 50 some odd years.

04:20:19.300 --> 04:20:20.780
Like I'm not doing it.

04:20:20.780 --> 04:20:22.180
I don't want to do 30 years.

04:20:23.300 --> 04:20:26.780
I was hoping for, I knew it wasn't possible,

04:20:26.780 --> 04:20:29.660
but I would have satisfied for another slap on the hand.

04:20:29.660 --> 04:20:31.500
Like I got the first time.

04:20:31.500 --> 04:20:33.060
It really thought I deserved.

04:20:33.060 --> 04:20:35.100
Honestly, when my lawyer asked me,

04:20:35.100 --> 04:20:35.940
what do you really think you deserve?

04:20:35.940 --> 04:20:38.300
And I thought, I deserve 10 years.

04:20:38.300 --> 04:20:39.500
I deserve 10 years.

04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:43.700
But so she said, look, they want to talk to you.

04:20:44.740 --> 04:20:48.900
So the FBI, well, first the secret service flies in.

04:20:49.900 --> 04:20:54.340
They come in and they interview me.

04:20:54.340 --> 04:20:57.900
Who's more terrifying, FBI, secret service?

04:20:57.900 --> 04:21:02.300
The secret service was so overwhelmingly professional.

04:21:04.540 --> 04:21:07.060
The FBI, and really only,

04:21:08.180 --> 04:21:10.740
one of the FBI agents they interviewed me,

04:21:10.740 --> 04:21:12.900
I don't know how he's an agent.

04:21:12.900 --> 04:21:13.740
I don't know.

04:21:13.740 --> 04:21:16.100
He was just ineffective, incompetent.

04:21:16.100 --> 04:21:17.700
So it's a competence issue.

04:21:17.700 --> 04:21:20.420
The other one was Candice.

04:21:20.420 --> 04:21:21.340
Oh, you met her.

04:21:21.340 --> 04:21:22.540
Of course I did.

04:21:22.540 --> 04:21:23.500
Of course.

04:21:23.500 --> 04:21:28.260
She's 5'11", wearing three inch heels.

04:21:28.260 --> 04:21:33.260
She's a giant and in impeccable shape, attractive.

04:21:34.300 --> 04:21:36.460
One of the angriest human beings I've ever met.

04:21:36.460 --> 04:21:39.380
And every FBI agent that I've met since then

04:21:39.380 --> 04:21:41.420
that knows her and I mentioned,

04:21:41.420 --> 04:21:44.180
they all say, oh, what'd you think of her?

04:21:44.180 --> 04:21:45.900
And I'm like, what, why?

04:21:45.900 --> 04:21:46.980
I was like kind of aggressive.

04:21:46.980 --> 04:21:49.740
They're like, yeah, yeah, she's a bulldog.

04:21:49.740 --> 04:21:51.500
She's, I mean, all of them are like, yeah, yeah.

04:21:52.180 --> 04:21:53.100
She's something else.

04:21:53.100 --> 04:21:54.140
Like-

04:21:54.140 --> 04:21:56.460
Secret service is a little bit more like-

04:21:56.460 --> 04:21:58.340
Very personal, very, you know, it's their job.

04:21:58.340 --> 04:21:59.860
It's like, hey, this is just my job.

04:21:59.860 --> 04:22:02.700
They're polite, professional, you know, that's it.

04:22:02.700 --> 04:22:05.300
So it's just, this is just, this is my nine to five.

04:22:05.300 --> 04:22:09.260
So, but they come and they fly in

04:22:09.260 --> 04:22:13.860
and they meet with me for three, four days.

04:22:14.980 --> 04:22:19.260
One of the funny things is that when I first sat down

04:22:19.260 --> 04:22:23.580
with them, one guy's name was Dan,

04:22:23.580 --> 04:22:26.340
like Brazanskowski or something.

04:22:26.340 --> 04:22:29.820
So he sits down and he says, look, before we get started,

04:22:29.820 --> 04:22:31.380
we need to talk about something.

04:22:31.380 --> 04:22:33.940
And I said, well, he said, we know you've hidden money

04:22:33.940 --> 04:22:36.780
and we, you know, I was like, what?

04:22:36.780 --> 04:22:39.780
And he goes, you know, we know you've got money hidden.

04:22:39.780 --> 04:22:41.140
I said, I don't have any money hidden.

04:22:41.140 --> 04:22:41.980
What are you talking about?

04:22:41.980 --> 04:22:42.820
And my lawyer's like, do we need to talk?

04:22:42.820 --> 04:22:44.020
I'm like, no, no, no, I don't have nothing.

04:22:44.020 --> 04:22:44.860
I gave you everything.

04:22:44.860 --> 04:22:46.260
I gave you all the accounts.

04:22:46.260 --> 04:22:47.580
You got everything.

04:22:47.580 --> 04:22:51.300
And he's like, you're looking at an obstruction charge

04:22:51.300 --> 04:22:52.140
at this point.

04:22:52.140 --> 04:22:53.740
I was like, I don't have anything.

04:22:53.740 --> 04:22:56.420
And he says, we know you have money.

04:22:56.420 --> 04:22:58.700
We know you have money in different IDs,

04:22:58.700 --> 04:22:59.820
different identities, names.

04:22:59.820 --> 04:23:01.220
And I go, what are you talking about?

04:23:01.220 --> 04:23:04.100
And he pulls out a bank statement

04:23:04.100 --> 04:23:06.540
and he slaps it on the counter and he goes,

04:23:06.540 --> 04:23:10.980
you've got money in Southern Exchange Bank.

04:23:10.980 --> 04:23:14.100
You've got $190,000 in Southern Exchange Bank.

04:23:14.180 --> 04:23:15.980
And I look at it and I went,

04:23:18.580 --> 04:23:20.220
it was in the name Walter Holcomb.

04:23:20.220 --> 04:23:23.740
And I went, did you call the bank?

04:23:23.740 --> 04:23:25.660
He says, yeah, we called the bank.

04:23:25.660 --> 04:23:27.860
I went, okay.

04:23:27.860 --> 04:23:29.460
Did anybody call you back?

04:23:29.460 --> 04:23:31.940
And they go, he said, well, no, we've left several messages.

04:23:31.940 --> 04:23:33.900
I said, did you go to the bank website?

04:23:33.900 --> 04:23:34.860
He goes, yeah, I went to the website.

04:23:34.860 --> 04:23:36.540
I said, what'd you think?

04:23:36.540 --> 04:23:37.900
And he went, what do you mean?

04:23:37.900 --> 04:23:39.060
All right, it was just bank website.

04:23:39.060 --> 04:23:40.780
I said, yeah, but it was professional, right?

04:23:40.780 --> 04:23:42.100
It was like a professional website.

04:23:42.100 --> 04:23:44.220
And he goes, it's a bank website.

04:23:44.220 --> 04:23:46.540
I go, yeah, but it was well done.

04:23:46.540 --> 04:23:49.900
And he goes, oh God.

04:23:49.900 --> 04:23:51.980
And I go, yeah, convincing.

04:23:51.980 --> 04:23:54.620
And I went, I go, it's all an illusion.

04:23:54.620 --> 04:23:56.180
And I said, the bank doesn't exist.

04:23:56.180 --> 04:23:57.020
It's a fake bank.

04:23:57.020 --> 04:24:00.020
I made the bank, made it when I was in,

04:24:00.020 --> 04:24:03.100
not even in Tampa, I think I'd gotten to Nashville

04:24:03.100 --> 04:24:04.060
when I made it.

04:24:04.060 --> 04:24:05.300
And I was like, yeah, it's an illusion.

04:24:05.300 --> 04:24:06.460
The bank statements, he's like,

04:24:06.460 --> 04:24:07.660
they're color bank statements.

04:24:07.660 --> 04:24:09.380
I'm like, yeah, well, no shit.

04:24:09.380 --> 04:24:11.660
So, you know, there's no, I said, as a matter of fact,

04:24:11.820 --> 04:24:13.020
I said, who did you leave a,

04:24:13.020 --> 04:24:17.260
I haven't paid for the service in months.

04:24:17.260 --> 04:24:19.340
And he turned around and he called it and it went,

04:24:19.340 --> 04:24:22.420
you know, it was disconnected.

04:24:22.420 --> 04:24:24.500
And I was like, how do you not know that's a bank?

04:24:24.500 --> 04:24:27.860
Well, it turns out there was a Southern Exchange Bank

04:24:27.860 --> 04:24:30.540
and I'd used their bank routing number.

04:24:30.540 --> 04:24:33.180
And so, I mean, I always thought that was funny

04:24:33.180 --> 04:24:35.300
that they, it's like, well, I remember it really

04:24:35.300 --> 04:24:37.500
for a split second there, I was kind of like really embarrassed

04:24:37.500 --> 04:24:38.340
that they caught me.

04:24:38.340 --> 04:24:40.100
I was like, I can't believe this.

04:24:40.100 --> 04:24:41.700
You're the Secret Service.

04:24:41.700 --> 04:24:43.180
Anyway, I talked to them.

04:24:43.180 --> 04:24:45.420
I, you know, there's really,

04:24:45.420 --> 04:24:46.820
as far as the Secret Service is concerned,

04:24:46.820 --> 04:24:48.620
there's just not much I can tell them.

04:24:49.540 --> 04:24:52.540
Just, you know, like it was me,

04:24:52.540 --> 04:24:54.500
Becky's already told them everything.

04:24:54.500 --> 04:24:56.780
Amanda's already told them everything.

04:24:56.780 --> 04:24:57.940
It's not hard to track.

04:24:57.940 --> 04:25:01.940
And when they raided my house, they've got boxes and boxes.

04:25:01.940 --> 04:25:03.340
So, it's laid out.

04:25:03.340 --> 04:25:04.580
We still, it took forever.

04:25:04.580 --> 04:25:06.300
Like I still went through everything.

04:25:06.300 --> 04:25:08.460
I explained how I got the driver's licenses,

04:25:08.460 --> 04:25:12.180
how I made the bank statements,

04:25:12.180 --> 04:25:13.500
how I made the birth certificates,

04:25:13.500 --> 04:25:17.100
how I, the whole social engineering of figuring out

04:25:17.100 --> 04:25:19.620
how to, what these little loopholes are.

04:25:20.500 --> 04:25:22.540
It's like seven days total with these guys.

04:25:22.540 --> 04:25:23.380
So-

04:25:23.380 --> 04:25:24.460
You mean like questions?

04:25:24.460 --> 04:25:26.980
Yeah, it was like they questioned me for all day

04:25:26.980 --> 04:25:29.740
and then they take me back to the marshal's holdover

04:25:29.740 --> 04:25:31.420
and then the next morning I wake up

04:25:31.420 --> 04:25:33.300
and they chain me up again and bring me back.

04:25:33.300 --> 04:25:34.140
What's that like?

04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:35.900
What's that process of questioning?

04:25:35.900 --> 04:25:38.540
Like are they, I mean, you're somebody

04:25:38.540 --> 04:25:41.660
who is exceptionally good at conversation,

04:25:42.900 --> 04:25:47.180
charismatic as part of the games you played.

04:25:47.180 --> 04:25:49.020
Are they good at conversation?

04:25:50.780 --> 04:25:54.140
I mean, they're, you know, the problem is they're not there

04:25:54.140 --> 04:25:55.340
to shoot the shit.

04:25:55.340 --> 04:25:56.180
You see what I'm saying?

04:25:56.180 --> 04:25:57.820
Like they have an agenda.

04:25:57.820 --> 04:25:59.620
But they have to use their words

04:25:59.620 --> 04:26:01.460
to get information out of you.

04:26:01.460 --> 04:26:03.060
Aren't they trying to manipulate you?

04:26:03.060 --> 04:26:05.020
I'm not, I'm not holding anything back.

04:26:05.020 --> 04:26:05.860
Okay.

04:26:07.180 --> 04:26:09.540
It's not like I'm sparing Jim.

04:26:09.540 --> 04:26:11.820
You know, trust me, Jim's gotta go.

04:26:11.820 --> 04:26:13.380
I mean, you're looking at,

04:26:13.380 --> 04:26:16.140
you're at 20 some odd years with Jim can do five,

04:26:16.140 --> 04:26:19.260
Bill can do some, Tom can do six.

04:26:19.260 --> 04:26:21.980
I don't even like, I don't even like Jerry.

04:26:21.980 --> 04:26:23.700
Jerry can do 20, you know,

04:26:23.700 --> 04:26:27.140
so I'm ready to cut everybody's throat.

04:26:27.140 --> 04:26:29.180
But you're not guaranteed that you're not,

04:26:29.180 --> 04:26:30.740
you're getting anything for that.

04:26:30.740 --> 04:26:31.980
Right.

04:26:31.980 --> 04:26:34.940
And all my time I've seen one time

04:26:34.940 --> 04:26:39.300
where an inmate got a guarantee to have his sentence reduced

04:26:39.300 --> 04:26:41.980
and it was signed by the head of the FBI

04:26:41.980 --> 04:26:43.620
was Robert Mueller gave it to him

04:26:43.620 --> 04:26:45.580
to have a conversation with him.

04:26:45.580 --> 04:26:48.380
That's the only time I've ever seen that document.

04:26:48.380 --> 04:26:49.220
Okay.

04:26:49.220 --> 04:26:52.500
So a lot of days with both the secret service and the FBI.

04:26:52.500 --> 04:26:56.380
So FBI was, Candice was irritated, didn't like me.

04:26:56.380 --> 04:26:59.220
And I remember when I, she took the cuffs off.

04:26:59.220 --> 04:27:00.260
I was like rubbing my wrist.

04:27:00.260 --> 04:27:01.100
She goes, your wrist hurt?

04:27:01.100 --> 04:27:02.380
And I go, yeah.

04:27:02.380 --> 04:27:03.940
And she goes, get used to it.

04:27:03.940 --> 04:27:05.140
I mean, she was just an asshole.

04:27:05.140 --> 04:27:05.980
Yeah.

04:27:05.980 --> 04:27:06.780
Just all around.

04:27:06.780 --> 04:27:07.860
Not that she didn't have a right to be,

04:27:07.860 --> 04:27:10.580
but everybody else was professional, you know?

04:27:10.580 --> 04:27:11.420
So,

04:27:13.300 --> 04:27:14.140
Oh, Candice.

04:27:14.140 --> 04:27:18.740
So we, you know, we talked for three or four days

04:27:18.740 --> 04:27:23.260
with the FBI and, you know, they asked a ton of questions.

04:27:23.260 --> 04:27:26.060
They brought a ton of, they brought documents, you know?

04:27:26.060 --> 04:27:27.340
So it's like, hey, who signed this?

04:27:27.340 --> 04:27:29.220
You know, it's like, oh, that's not my signature.

04:27:29.220 --> 04:27:30.180
That's so and so signature.

04:27:30.180 --> 04:27:32.860
Or I signed that, I signed that, I signed that.

04:27:32.860 --> 04:27:33.700
That's so and so.

04:27:33.700 --> 04:27:34.540
Where'd this check go?

04:27:34.540 --> 04:27:35.380
Who is this?

04:27:35.380 --> 04:27:36.220
Oh, that's so and so.

04:27:36.220 --> 04:27:38.060
You know, you're looking over everything.

04:27:38.060 --> 04:27:40.180
One of the things they wanted to know about was,

04:27:40.180 --> 04:27:44.300
which I never talked about it because it seems so minor,

04:27:44.300 --> 04:27:45.940
is I bribed the politician.

04:27:45.940 --> 04:27:48.780
I got him elected because we got him elected

04:27:48.780 --> 04:27:53.780
to the city council so he could vote to get the lots.

04:27:55.500 --> 04:27:58.060
We bought like a hundred vacant lots in Ybor City.

04:27:58.060 --> 04:27:59.700
And I wanted them all, they were all single family.

04:27:59.700 --> 04:28:01.900
We wanted them zoned multi-family.

04:28:01.900 --> 04:28:05.060
And so we bribed him and got him elected.

04:28:05.060 --> 04:28:06.900
That doesn't seem minor.

04:28:06.900 --> 04:28:08.980
It's not as sexy as the rest of the stuff.

04:28:08.980 --> 04:28:10.780
That's pretty, I mean.

04:28:10.780 --> 04:28:12.780
So that's a whole nother thing.

04:28:12.780 --> 04:28:15.860
Like, I mean, you know, so what happened is

04:28:15.860 --> 04:28:19.380
when they got all of the bank accounts,

04:28:19.380 --> 04:28:22.980
they see all these checks going to Kevin White.

04:28:22.980 --> 04:28:25.900
And so they're like, why did James Red

04:28:25.900 --> 04:28:28.220
donate $500 to Kevin White?

04:28:28.300 --> 04:28:29.940
Why did Brandon Green donate?

04:28:29.940 --> 04:28:31.420
Why did Alan Duncan donate?

04:28:31.420 --> 04:28:33.460
Why did, you know, so I had explained to him,

04:28:33.460 --> 04:28:35.980
oh yeah, well he was, we wanted him to be city councilman.

04:28:35.980 --> 04:28:38.420
So we paid, you know, gave him a bunch of money

04:28:38.420 --> 04:28:40.140
so he could run the ads, so he could get elected.

04:28:40.140 --> 04:28:41.860
So he could then get all of our stuff.

04:28:41.860 --> 04:28:43.940
But because he never did, you know,

04:28:43.940 --> 04:28:46.900
I took off on the run before he was able to do that.

04:28:48.260 --> 04:28:51.740
And then he ended up getting, not long,

04:28:51.740 --> 04:28:53.620
too, too long after that, he ended up,

04:28:53.620 --> 04:28:54.820
about five, six years later,

04:28:54.860 --> 04:28:58.460
he ended up getting indicted for bribery,

04:28:58.460 --> 04:29:00.780
but not mine on somebody else's case.

04:29:00.780 --> 04:29:02.660
Can I take a small tangent here and ask,

04:29:02.660 --> 04:29:06.380
how many politicians do you think commit crimes

04:29:06.380 --> 04:29:08.580
or a little bit or a lot of criminals?

04:29:09.860 --> 04:29:12.220
I mean, I think there's some ways that are,

04:29:12.220 --> 04:29:15.620
you know, they're seemingly legal.

04:29:15.620 --> 04:29:17.500
The aforementioned gray area.

04:29:17.500 --> 04:29:18.620
Well, that's not gray.

04:29:18.620 --> 04:29:22.180
Like, this guy was, at one point,

04:29:22.220 --> 04:29:25.260
I couldn't find anybody to write $500 checks anymore.

04:29:25.260 --> 04:29:26.460
So I just gave him cash.

04:29:26.460 --> 04:29:30.660
Like, I'm just handing him $7,000, $8,000, $10,000 in cash.

04:29:30.660 --> 04:29:35.660
So, but, you know, I think most of them have legal ways

04:29:36.620 --> 04:29:41.620
to make ungodly amounts of money for, you know, influence.

04:29:43.620 --> 04:29:44.700
You know, but is it legal?

04:29:44.700 --> 04:29:46.220
No, it's their politicians, they've made it

04:29:46.220 --> 04:29:48.260
so that it's not illegal.

04:29:48.260 --> 04:29:50.980
If you really sat down and explained it to someone,

04:29:51.860 --> 04:29:54.940
you know, the average person would say,

04:29:54.940 --> 04:29:58.060
that's not right, that's, oh, no, no, that's legal.

04:29:58.060 --> 04:30:00.980
So, okay, so at the end of these few days,

04:30:03.220 --> 04:30:05.100
what was the sentencing like?

04:30:05.100 --> 04:30:08.020
Yeah, I end up, I go to sentencing,

04:30:08.020 --> 04:30:12.660
I get my PSI back and it's 32 years to life.

04:30:12.660 --> 04:30:17.660
And so we argue about it with the prosecutor

04:30:18.660 --> 04:30:23.500
just before sentencing and they get it down to 26 years,

04:30:23.500 --> 04:30:24.340
four months.

04:30:26.140 --> 04:30:30.620
And then Millie says, listen, don't worry.

04:30:30.620 --> 04:30:32.260
Cause I'm trying to backpedal at this point.

04:30:32.260 --> 04:30:34.260
I'm like, I might as well go to trial.

04:30:34.260 --> 04:30:36.900
If I lost at trial, I couldn't get more than 30.

04:30:36.900 --> 04:30:39.540
That you can't, well, more than 32 years.

04:30:39.540 --> 04:30:41.460
Cause you can't get life, 32 was the max.

04:30:41.460 --> 04:30:42.380
It's just a mistake.

04:30:42.380 --> 04:30:44.140
He said 32 years to life, you can't get life.

04:30:44.140 --> 04:30:46.060
So it was like, the most I can get is 32 years.

04:30:46.060 --> 04:30:47.020
So I was like, I'll go to trial.

04:30:47.020 --> 04:30:49.380
I might as well go to trial and see if I can get them

04:30:49.380 --> 04:30:51.340
to reduce some of these enhancements.

04:30:51.340 --> 04:30:54.980
She insists that she can get the enhancements knocked down.

04:30:54.980 --> 04:30:57.460
And if you read, they actually read the enhancements,

04:30:57.460 --> 04:30:59.940
some of the enhancements, they didn't apply to me.

04:31:00.940 --> 04:31:03.980
So she goes and you know, I believed her.

04:31:03.980 --> 04:31:06.380
And I think she made a valid argument.

04:31:06.380 --> 04:31:08.900
We get to, we go to sentencing, my mom's there,

04:31:08.900 --> 04:31:10.820
she's crying, my dad's there.

04:31:10.820 --> 04:31:13.580
He's looking at me like he's disgusted.

04:31:13.620 --> 04:31:17.940
And crowd, there's a whole bunch of reporters,

04:31:17.940 --> 04:31:19.540
like the whole place is packed.

04:31:20.580 --> 04:31:22.100
And I plead guilty.

04:31:22.100 --> 04:31:23.940
Millie gets up, my lawyer gets up

04:31:23.940 --> 04:31:26.660
and she argues these enhancements.

04:31:26.660 --> 04:31:29.180
And every single time, you know, the judge is like,

04:31:30.340 --> 04:31:33.580
I disagree, you know, overruled.

04:31:33.580 --> 04:31:38.460
And it's like, boom, five more years, you know, bam.

04:31:38.460 --> 04:31:40.220
Six more years, bam.

04:31:40.220 --> 04:31:42.300
Cause if she had won the enhancement she argued,

04:31:42.300 --> 04:31:43.660
I would have got 14 years.

04:31:44.820 --> 04:31:48.300
Now, keep in mind too, prior to this,

04:31:48.300 --> 04:31:50.300
a month or two prior to this,

04:31:50.300 --> 04:31:55.180
the US attorney had called Millie and said,

04:31:55.180 --> 04:31:58.420
look, Dateline, Dateline had already come out by the way.

04:31:58.420 --> 04:31:59.780
Remember I was worried about Dateline coming out.

04:31:59.780 --> 04:32:01.540
Well, it had come out.

04:32:01.540 --> 04:32:03.860
But they wanted to do a follow-up

04:32:03.860 --> 04:32:06.220
because it came out like a month or two

04:32:06.220 --> 04:32:07.300
after I got arrested.

04:32:07.300 --> 04:32:08.940
And they were saying, hey, we want to recut it

04:32:08.940 --> 04:32:10.740
with interviews with him.

04:32:10.740 --> 04:32:14.620
Well, Gail McKenzie wants, that's the US attorney.

04:32:14.620 --> 04:32:15.860
She wants me to do that.

04:32:17.460 --> 04:32:20.220
And she says, I'll consider that substantial assistance.

04:32:20.220 --> 04:32:23.260
Now, when you cooperate with the government,

04:32:23.260 --> 04:32:25.540
they consider it substantial assistance.

04:32:25.540 --> 04:32:26.780
That's what they call it.

04:32:26.780 --> 04:32:29.100
So I cooperate with you, it's substantial assistance.

04:32:29.100 --> 04:32:31.860
She says, if he's interviewed by Dateline,

04:32:31.860 --> 04:32:34.740
we'll consider it substantial assistance.

04:32:34.740 --> 04:32:36.900
And Millie says, you have to do it.

04:32:36.900 --> 04:32:38.340
By the way, what's the idea behind that?

04:32:38.780 --> 04:32:41.300
Like you serve as a warning for others

04:32:41.300 --> 04:32:42.140
or something like that?

04:32:42.140 --> 04:32:42.980
Yeah, exactly.

04:32:42.980 --> 04:32:45.860
It's a, you know, you become a cautionary tale,

04:32:45.860 --> 04:32:47.620
like don't let this happen to you.

04:32:47.620 --> 04:32:51.500
So I go and I'm interviewed by Dateline.

04:32:51.500 --> 04:32:53.700
I've Keith Morris or whatever his name is,

04:32:53.700 --> 04:32:57.660
you know, that guy, Mr. Cox, you know, that guy.

04:32:58.580 --> 04:33:02.740
So he comes and he interviews me, Becky's interviewed,

04:33:02.740 --> 04:33:04.420
I'm interviewed, Amanda's interviewed,

04:33:04.420 --> 04:33:07.300
like Allison is interviewed.

04:33:07.340 --> 04:33:09.980
Like everybody, the secret service agent,

04:33:09.980 --> 04:33:11.460
I think is interviewed, like everybody,

04:33:11.460 --> 04:33:12.700
prosecutors interviewed.

04:33:14.860 --> 04:33:16.740
You know, it's funny at the time I would have,

04:33:16.740 --> 04:33:20.460
I was, when I watched it, I was like, that's not true.

04:33:20.460 --> 04:33:21.620
That's not true.

04:33:21.620 --> 04:33:25.340
And that, and honestly, it's like 99% true.

04:33:25.340 --> 04:33:29.380
It's like looking back on it, you know, I'm like, you know,

04:33:29.380 --> 04:33:34.380
like my Audi TT wasn't blue, it was silver.

04:33:34.420 --> 04:33:35.980
You know, it's just stupid.

04:33:35.980 --> 04:33:38.020
But anyway, so I'm interviewed by them

04:33:38.020 --> 04:33:40.420
and they recut it and they air the video.

04:33:40.420 --> 04:33:44.180
So I, you said this was substantial assistance.

04:33:44.180 --> 04:33:45.740
And then the other thing is I was interviewed

04:33:45.740 --> 04:33:47.820
by the FBI and the secret service.

04:33:47.820 --> 04:33:52.140
Now my lawyer calls the prosecutor

04:33:52.140 --> 04:33:54.860
the night before sentencing and says, look,

04:33:54.860 --> 04:33:56.460
he was interviewed by Dateline

04:33:56.460 --> 04:33:59.860
and he was interviewed by the secret service and the FBI.

04:34:01.420 --> 04:34:04.660
And if you do that, you said you'd reduce his sentence.

04:34:04.660 --> 04:34:06.300
You'd consider it substantial assistance

04:34:06.300 --> 04:34:08.020
and you would reduce his sentence.

04:34:08.020 --> 04:34:11.300
What are you going to ask for his sentence

04:34:11.300 --> 04:34:13.220
to be tomorrow at sentencing?

04:34:13.220 --> 04:34:17.220
And she said, we did consider it substantial assistance

04:34:17.220 --> 04:34:18.580
and it's just not enough.

04:34:19.580 --> 04:34:20.420
What do you mean?

04:34:20.420 --> 04:34:21.980
Nobody was arrested.

04:34:21.980 --> 04:34:23.860
Yes, but what about Dateline?

04:34:24.860 --> 04:34:26.660
Millie, I don't know what to tell you.

04:34:26.660 --> 04:34:27.820
It just wasn't enough.

04:34:27.820 --> 04:34:29.340
We considered it.

04:34:29.340 --> 04:34:30.420
We considered it.

04:34:30.420 --> 04:34:33.180
We will consider it and they did consider it.

04:34:33.180 --> 04:34:35.660
So, yeah, that's like that.

04:34:35.660 --> 04:34:37.740
You have to really, you know,

04:34:37.740 --> 04:34:40.060
the meaning of words is so important.

04:34:40.060 --> 04:34:41.700
I'm going to use that at some point.

04:34:41.700 --> 04:34:42.540
I will consider it.

04:34:42.540 --> 04:34:43.380
I'll consider it.

04:34:43.380 --> 04:34:48.380
I considered it and still feel the same.

04:34:48.380 --> 04:34:50.980
She calls me, I'm crushed.

04:34:50.980 --> 04:34:52.180
And she's like, but look, you know,

04:34:52.180 --> 04:34:53.220
they're still investigating.

04:34:53.220 --> 04:34:54.540
They're going to make these arrests.

04:34:54.540 --> 04:34:57.580
And so when you get a sentence reduction at sentencing,

04:34:57.580 --> 04:34:59.060
it's called a 5k one.

04:35:00.060 --> 04:35:03.500
When you get a sentence reduction after sentencing,

04:35:03.500 --> 04:35:05.820
it's called a rule 35.

04:35:05.820 --> 04:35:07.420
So she said, we'll file a rule 35

04:35:07.420 --> 04:35:09.140
as soon as the arrests are made.

04:35:09.140 --> 04:35:11.220
Okay, so I go to sentencing

04:35:11.220 --> 04:35:13.020
and Millie says you're going to get 14 years.

04:35:13.020 --> 04:35:14.460
I'm going to argue these enhancements.

04:35:14.460 --> 04:35:16.580
She argues you the enhancements.

04:35:16.580 --> 04:35:18.620
She loses the enhancements.

04:35:18.620 --> 04:35:20.060
Not that she's not an amazing attorney.

04:35:20.060 --> 04:35:21.820
She's an amazing attorney.

04:35:21.820 --> 04:35:24.260
The judge wanted to hammer me.

04:35:24.260 --> 04:35:25.220
He hammered me.

04:35:26.100 --> 04:35:28.420
You know, Millie was a great attorney.

04:35:28.420 --> 04:35:30.140
She was always polite to me.

04:35:30.140 --> 04:35:33.100
And by the way, to this day, we'll answer my phone call.

04:35:33.100 --> 04:35:35.700
Most public defenders, you call them now.

04:35:35.700 --> 04:35:37.140
You call them after your sentence.

04:35:37.140 --> 04:35:38.540
They don't answer your call.

04:35:39.860 --> 04:35:40.820
Great person.

04:35:41.700 --> 04:35:42.540
Thank you, Millie.

04:35:42.540 --> 04:35:45.420
I didn't give her anything to work with.

04:35:45.420 --> 04:35:47.780
You know, it's like, I'm overwhelmingly guilty.

04:35:47.780 --> 04:35:50.180
It's like, there's no defense.

04:35:50.180 --> 04:35:53.660
So I ended up getting sentenced 26 years.

04:35:55.580 --> 04:35:56.900
That's a lot of years.

04:35:56.900 --> 04:35:59.820
I would like to tell you that they,

04:35:59.820 --> 04:36:02.420
when they gave me the time, you know,

04:36:02.420 --> 04:36:07.420
that I was stoic and I stood there and I took it in,

04:36:07.820 --> 04:36:09.940
you know, but the truth is I cried like a baby,

04:36:09.940 --> 04:36:11.060
like a small child.

04:36:11.060 --> 04:36:15.220
Like you've never seen anyone cry like this in your life.

04:36:15.220 --> 04:36:19.740
I was just, how did I get 26?

04:36:19.740 --> 04:36:21.620
What did I do to get 26 years?

04:36:21.620 --> 04:36:23.980
Like murderers, rapists.

04:36:24.020 --> 04:36:27.620
I've met guys that kidnapped guys that got 15.

04:36:30.100 --> 04:36:31.340
26.

04:36:31.340 --> 04:36:33.500
So yeah, I-

04:36:33.500 --> 04:36:34.420
Were you scared?

04:36:35.860 --> 04:36:38.540
I mean, you know, does a pope wear a funny hat?

04:36:38.540 --> 04:36:41.060
Like, of course I was scared, terrified.

04:36:42.340 --> 04:36:44.060
I mean, you know, but I kept telling myself,

04:36:44.060 --> 04:36:45.820
ah, they're going to reduce the sentence.

04:36:45.820 --> 04:36:47.540
They'll reduce it, they'll reduce it, they'll reduce it.

04:36:47.540 --> 04:36:49.500
Like, okay, okay, okay, it's going to be okay.

04:36:49.500 --> 04:36:50.620
It's going to be okay.

04:36:51.820 --> 04:36:52.660
You know, but it wasn't okay.

04:36:52.660 --> 04:36:57.660
I got moved to Coleman, the Coleman complex

04:36:59.900 --> 04:37:02.100
in Coleman, Florida, the federal correctional

04:37:02.100 --> 04:37:04.580
Coleman complex in Coleman, Florida,

04:37:04.580 --> 04:37:07.420
which is the largest complex in the nation,

04:37:07.420 --> 04:37:08.820
federal complex in the nation.

04:37:08.820 --> 04:37:12.380
There's a, there's a, at that time there was a camp,

04:37:12.380 --> 04:37:14.460
which was a female camp.

04:37:14.460 --> 04:37:19.460
There was a medium security, a low security prison for men,

04:37:19.620 --> 04:37:22.260
a medium security prison and two penitentiaries.

04:37:23.260 --> 04:37:26.500
And so I get moved to the medium.

04:37:26.500 --> 04:37:28.420
I'm moved to the medium, not because like,

04:37:28.420 --> 04:37:30.180
that's where like real criminals go, right?

04:37:30.180 --> 04:37:33.580
Like I'm a soft white boy.

04:37:33.580 --> 04:37:34.900
Like I'm no danger to anybody.

04:37:34.900 --> 04:37:37.140
Like I hurt, I hurt someone's feelings once,

04:37:37.140 --> 04:37:39.580
but other than that, I'm not a pro,

04:37:39.580 --> 04:37:40.980
I'm not going to be a problem.

04:37:40.980 --> 04:37:45.420
But if you have more than 20 years to serve,

04:37:45.420 --> 04:37:46.940
you have to go to a medium.

04:37:46.940 --> 04:37:48.980
So even though my security level said this guy

04:37:48.980 --> 04:37:53.580
should be in a camp, I had 20 years.

04:37:53.580 --> 04:37:55.460
So if you have, you can't go to a camp

04:37:55.460 --> 04:37:57.020
till you have less than 10.

04:37:57.020 --> 04:38:00.460
So as soon as I am given 26 years and 26 years,

04:38:00.460 --> 04:38:01.500
they, they knock off three,

04:38:01.500 --> 04:38:03.060
but you still have three years to get below 20.

04:38:03.060 --> 04:38:04.100
So they go to the medium.

04:38:04.100 --> 04:38:06.780
So I go to the medium and their guys getting stabbed.

04:38:06.780 --> 04:38:08.940
The very first day people are being stabbed.

04:38:10.020 --> 04:38:13.140
I get locked into, you go to my cell, meet my celly,

04:38:13.140 --> 04:38:17.260
they scream lockdown, somebody got stabbed in the rec yard.

04:38:17.260 --> 04:38:18.620
I remember I asked that my celly,

04:38:18.620 --> 04:38:20.380
which I met 20 minutes earlier.

04:38:20.380 --> 04:38:21.540
I was like, what's, you know, he's like,

04:38:21.540 --> 04:38:22.620
hey, we got to get in the cell.

04:38:22.620 --> 04:38:23.620
I was like, what's going on?

04:38:23.620 --> 04:38:24.820
He, somebody got stabbed in the yard.

04:38:24.820 --> 04:38:26.620
And I go, somebody just got killed.

04:38:26.620 --> 04:38:29.100
And he goes, nah, they just stabbed him up a little bit.

04:38:29.100 --> 04:38:31.900
And I thought, you're in a place

04:38:31.900 --> 04:38:33.860
where they say stabbed him up a little bit.

04:38:33.860 --> 04:38:35.940
Like you're not prepared for this, bro.

04:38:35.940 --> 04:38:37.820
You got to get out of here.

04:38:37.820 --> 04:38:40.460
So anyway, I go to the medium, I'm there.

04:38:40.460 --> 04:38:42.220
Like what was the first day and night?

04:38:42.220 --> 04:38:44.220
When I remember, I already had been locked up

04:38:44.220 --> 04:38:46.340
in the county and their county jails

04:38:46.380 --> 04:38:48.460
because they call them US, they're US marshal,

04:38:48.460 --> 04:38:51.020
they're holdovers, but they're really county jails.

04:38:51.020 --> 04:38:54.940
They just keep you with the federal guys.

04:38:54.940 --> 04:38:57.500
So I'm not mixed in with like hobos and, you know,

04:38:57.500 --> 04:38:58.340
people like that.

04:38:58.340 --> 04:39:00.100
Like I'm mixed in with the federal people.

04:39:00.100 --> 04:39:02.940
It's already felt like a prison.

04:39:02.940 --> 04:39:04.460
Yeah, it's a prison.

04:39:05.740 --> 04:39:07.780
I mean, it's jail, but it's a prison.

04:39:07.780 --> 04:39:09.140
And unless you'd been locked up,

04:39:09.140 --> 04:39:10.060
you don't really know the difference.

04:39:10.060 --> 04:39:12.540
So it's a jail, jails suck.

04:39:12.540 --> 04:39:13.380
Jails are much worse.

04:39:13.380 --> 04:39:15.700
The whole time I was locked up in the jails

04:39:15.700 --> 04:39:17.180
waiting to be sentenced, guys were like,

04:39:17.180 --> 04:39:19.460
I just want to get sentenced and go, go to prison, bro.

04:39:19.460 --> 04:39:22.420
And I was like, why does everybody keep saying that?

04:39:22.420 --> 04:39:24.180
Like prison's worse than this.

04:39:24.180 --> 04:39:26.820
Like I saw shank, it's horrible.

04:39:26.820 --> 04:39:29.940
And they're like, bro, prison, listen, prison,

04:39:29.940 --> 04:39:31.900
I can walk the rec yard.

04:39:31.900 --> 04:39:34.620
I could go to the movie room, watch movies out.

04:39:34.620 --> 04:39:36.980
Listen, within, right after count,

04:39:36.980 --> 04:39:39.700
for this four o'clock count, they count everybody at four.

04:39:39.700 --> 04:39:42.020
So they are like, right after count,

04:39:42.020 --> 04:39:43.060
I'm going to go to commissary,

04:39:43.060 --> 04:39:44.540
somebody's going to buy me an ice cream.

04:39:44.540 --> 04:39:45.860
I'm going to be eating an ice cream,

04:39:45.860 --> 04:39:49.140
walking on the rec yard the first day.

04:39:49.140 --> 04:39:50.220
Like, and I'm, you know,

04:39:50.220 --> 04:39:51.700
it's been months and months and months

04:39:51.700 --> 04:39:53.580
that I've been locked up in this county jail.

04:39:53.580 --> 04:39:54.860
And I'm thinking, I want to go to prison.

04:39:54.860 --> 04:39:55.700
Like, that sounds nice.

04:39:55.700 --> 04:39:57.380
I'd love, I'd like an ice cream.

04:39:57.380 --> 04:39:59.980
Yeah, but there was a stabbing in the first day.

04:39:59.980 --> 04:40:01.180
Yeah, I will, you know,

04:40:01.180 --> 04:40:02.940
everybody kept telling me I was going to go to a camp.

04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:04.020
You're going to go to a camp.

04:40:04.020 --> 04:40:05.020
You're going to go to a low.

04:40:05.020 --> 04:40:05.860
I see.

04:40:05.860 --> 04:40:07.860
You know, and honestly, I was very quickly,

04:40:07.860 --> 04:40:09.500
I was walking on the rec yard.

04:40:09.500 --> 04:40:13.140
I was, you know, so I was at the medium.

04:40:13.140 --> 04:40:16.540
I got there, you know, it's,

04:40:16.540 --> 04:40:19.660
it's a real prison with the doors, bam.

04:40:19.660 --> 04:40:21.420
And they can open the little tray thing

04:40:21.420 --> 04:40:22.540
and feed you out of the tray.

04:40:22.540 --> 04:40:25.220
And there's a stainless steel toilet and sink.

04:40:25.220 --> 04:40:26.860
And you know, they have that in the county too,

04:40:26.860 --> 04:40:28.380
but you know, it's,

04:40:28.380 --> 04:40:30.980
it's exactly what you think of prison as being.

04:40:30.980 --> 04:40:33.740
But it feels like a fundamentally different experience

04:40:33.740 --> 04:40:36.740
when it's 26 years and the door locks and.

04:40:36.740 --> 04:40:37.580
Yeah.

04:40:37.580 --> 04:40:42.180
So I, yeah, I have a celly and,

04:40:42.220 --> 04:40:43.820
but I'm also, they sent me to a prison

04:40:43.820 --> 04:40:47.300
where guys have tons of guys have 30, 40, 50 years,

04:40:47.300 --> 04:40:48.420
you know, life sentences.

04:40:48.420 --> 04:40:50.620
There's, there's gangsters there.

04:40:50.620 --> 04:40:52.620
There's, there's murderers.

04:40:52.620 --> 04:40:54.460
There's serial killers.

04:40:54.460 --> 04:40:56.860
There's, you know, really bad guys.

04:40:58.820 --> 04:41:01.820
There's, you know, there's guys that are, you know,

04:41:01.820 --> 04:41:06.020
trying to take advantage of guys.

04:41:06.020 --> 04:41:06.860
Right.

04:41:06.860 --> 04:41:07.680
You know, like sexually.

04:41:07.680 --> 04:41:09.300
Yeah.

04:41:09.300 --> 04:41:10.580
But by the time I got there,

04:41:10.580 --> 04:41:13.100
I'd heard all the, you know,

04:41:13.100 --> 04:41:15.420
how you can get yourself in trouble, you know,

04:41:15.420 --> 04:41:17.900
how you can like, don't go in somebody else's cell.

04:41:17.900 --> 04:41:19.300
You don't know the guy.

04:41:19.300 --> 04:41:20.700
You're not 100% sure.

04:41:20.700 --> 04:41:21.980
Do not go in his cell.

04:41:21.980 --> 04:41:23.700
Don't even go near his cell.

04:41:23.700 --> 04:41:27.060
Don't go into places where people can close a door behind

04:41:27.060 --> 04:41:28.980
you or they can trap you in an area.

04:41:28.980 --> 04:41:29.820
Don't, you know,

04:41:29.820 --> 04:41:33.940
there's all these things that I've been told not to do.

04:41:33.940 --> 04:41:35.340
Again, for sexual reasons.

04:41:35.340 --> 04:41:36.180
Right.

04:41:36.380 --> 04:41:40.620
I'm a small guy in prison.

04:41:40.620 --> 04:41:41.460
Yeah.

04:41:41.460 --> 04:41:42.280
You know?

04:41:42.280 --> 04:41:43.380
I'm tracked away, dude.

04:41:43.380 --> 04:41:44.580
Yeah, it's a problem.

04:41:44.580 --> 04:41:45.420
It's a problem.

04:41:45.420 --> 04:41:48.460
This, it's bad.

04:41:48.460 --> 04:41:49.660
It's all bad.

04:41:49.660 --> 04:41:53.340
Well, it's good in the outside world, but bad in prison.

04:41:53.340 --> 04:41:54.180
You know, yeah.

04:41:54.180 --> 04:41:56.300
My fear was there to make me shave my head

04:41:56.300 --> 04:42:00.020
to make sure that the mop wig fits correctly.

04:42:00.020 --> 04:42:01.940
But there's certain things that I always hate to say this,

04:42:01.940 --> 04:42:04.220
but I mean, this is the simplest way to say it,

04:42:04.220 --> 04:42:07.500
is that if you get stabbed in prison,

04:42:07.500 --> 04:42:09.260
you had it coming.

04:42:09.260 --> 04:42:10.820
You did something.

04:42:10.820 --> 04:42:12.540
Like they're not running around just stabbing people.

04:42:12.540 --> 04:42:13.540
You did something.

04:42:13.540 --> 04:42:16.780
You, and the things that get you hurt is

04:42:16.780 --> 04:42:19.020
you argue over the TV.

04:42:19.020 --> 04:42:20.620
What channel do you want to watch?

04:42:20.620 --> 04:42:24.260
You got 50, 80 guys watching one TV.

04:42:24.260 --> 04:42:25.100
Don't argue about it.

04:42:25.100 --> 04:42:27.620
Like it's not, it's not worth it.

04:42:27.620 --> 04:42:30.680
Borrowing things that, and not returning them.

04:42:30.680 --> 04:42:31.820
That's a problem.

04:42:31.820 --> 04:42:33.500
Running up debts.

04:42:33.500 --> 04:42:34.460
That's a big problem.

04:42:34.460 --> 04:42:37.900
You know, gambling, gossiping.

04:42:37.900 --> 04:42:38.900
You know, those are the problems.

04:42:38.900 --> 04:42:40.340
Those things get you hurt.

04:42:40.340 --> 04:42:41.980
Not being polite, be respectful.

04:42:41.980 --> 04:42:43.860
I'm super respectful.

04:42:43.860 --> 04:42:48.860
So I was respectful very quickly when I got to Coleman.

04:42:50.220 --> 04:42:52.300
There are continuing education courses.

04:42:52.300 --> 04:42:55.900
One of the courses is residential real estate.

04:42:57.500 --> 04:42:59.580
The guy that was running the residential real estate

04:42:59.580 --> 04:43:00.660
didn't want to do it anymore

04:43:00.660 --> 04:43:02.900
because he was doing legal work

04:43:02.900 --> 04:43:04.780
and it just was taking too much time.

04:43:04.780 --> 04:43:07.340
So he came to me and said, listen, you just got here.

04:43:07.340 --> 04:43:08.780
You got a real estate background.

04:43:08.780 --> 04:43:09.620
Like nobody else does.

04:43:09.620 --> 04:43:10.620
Can you take over this class?

04:43:10.620 --> 04:43:11.980
And I was like, I'm sure.

04:43:11.980 --> 04:43:13.140
So I looked at his curriculum.

04:43:13.140 --> 04:43:14.780
I kind of rewrote it a little bit.

04:43:14.780 --> 04:43:16.620
And I started teaching the residential real estate class.

04:43:16.620 --> 04:43:18.700
And at one point I was teaching two classes

04:43:18.700 --> 04:43:20.780
like a semester or a quarter.

04:43:21.700 --> 04:43:23.460
And these guys loved it, right?

04:43:23.460 --> 04:43:24.460
Like everybody, they all think

04:43:24.460 --> 04:43:26.220
they're going to get out and flip houses.

04:43:26.220 --> 04:43:28.140
So I started, you know, from the fundamentals

04:43:28.140 --> 04:43:29.960
I used to talk about credit, how to borrow,

04:43:29.960 --> 04:43:32.360
how hard money lenders, different types of bar,

04:43:32.360 --> 04:43:33.640
like everything.

04:43:33.640 --> 04:43:35.200
And, you know, guys are walking.

04:43:35.200 --> 04:43:37.520
It's the first time in my life, this was funny.

04:43:37.520 --> 04:43:39.280
Not that I think I was really ever in a position

04:43:39.280 --> 04:43:40.120
for this to happen.

04:43:40.120 --> 04:43:41.680
This was really odd though.

04:43:41.680 --> 04:43:43.600
Probably the second or third class,

04:43:43.600 --> 04:43:44.800
when guys are leaving

04:43:45.720 --> 04:43:47.800
and I'm having to check them off the roll,

04:43:47.800 --> 04:43:50.520
multiple guys are stopping and saying, yo bro,

04:43:50.520 --> 04:43:52.600
putting their hand out and shaking my hand and going,

04:43:52.600 --> 04:43:55.480
good class, it was a good class, bro.

04:43:55.480 --> 04:43:57.760
Then I have guys coming to me telling me,

04:43:57.760 --> 04:44:00.680
hey, what are you teaching these guys?

04:44:00.680 --> 04:44:01.520
I go, what do you mean?

04:44:01.520 --> 04:44:02.560
He goes, my cell is telling me

04:44:02.560 --> 04:44:04.200
he's going to get out and make millions.

04:44:04.200 --> 04:44:06.320
I'm taking Cox's real estate class.

04:44:06.320 --> 04:44:07.240
I'm telling you, I can do this.

04:44:07.240 --> 04:44:08.640
I'm going to be a millionaire.

04:44:08.640 --> 04:44:11.720
And it's like this flipping houses, like this is not,

04:44:11.720 --> 04:44:14.160
but the truth is if, you know, it is the

04:44:15.800 --> 04:44:19.600
flipping houses was what I basically told these guys,

04:44:19.600 --> 04:44:21.800
especially the drug dealers, right?

04:44:21.800 --> 04:44:24.000
You're a drug dealer and you were raised in the projects

04:44:24.000 --> 04:44:25.120
and you're going back to the projects.

04:44:25.120 --> 04:44:30.120
Like this is the one industry

04:44:30.440 --> 04:44:34.240
that you will thrive at because you're a hustler.

04:44:34.240 --> 04:44:35.400
You're not afraid.

04:44:35.400 --> 04:44:38.800
A 45 year old divorced white woman is not going

04:44:38.800 --> 04:44:41.840
into the hood knocking on doors to try and flip houses,

04:44:41.840 --> 04:44:42.880
but you will.

04:44:42.880 --> 04:44:44.160
And you know everybody in the neighborhood

04:44:44.160 --> 04:44:46.280
and you'll knock on those doors and you'll hustle.

04:44:46.280 --> 04:44:48.360
And you've been told no before and you don't care.

04:44:48.360 --> 04:44:49.840
You're not scared.

04:44:49.840 --> 04:44:53.440
And there's tons of money to be made in lower income areas.

04:44:53.440 --> 04:44:55.760
And so I, and then when I go through the whole thing

04:44:55.760 --> 04:44:57.720
and how you can leverage, you know,

04:44:57.720 --> 04:44:59.720
leverage your credit to borrow money,

04:44:59.720 --> 04:45:01.560
to get into the property and rent,

04:45:01.560 --> 04:45:03.560
do the renovations with very little money down.

04:45:03.560 --> 04:45:05.080
And I do the whole thing.

04:45:05.080 --> 04:45:06.240
These guys, like they loved it.

04:45:06.240 --> 04:45:09.800
So I was, and what that did for me was two things.

04:45:09.800 --> 04:45:11.360
One, if you got to the class,

04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:13.120
40 guys show up for the class and I say, look,

04:45:13.120 --> 04:45:14.520
if you don't want to go, you don't want to be here.

04:45:14.520 --> 04:45:15.840
You just want it because your,

04:45:15.840 --> 04:45:18.080
your counselor's making you get a certificate.

04:45:18.080 --> 04:45:18.920
You don't want to be here.

04:45:18.920 --> 04:45:20.040
That's fine.

04:45:20.040 --> 04:45:23.160
Bring me two coffees and like two creamers

04:45:23.160 --> 04:45:26.520
from commissary and I'll fill out all your paperwork

04:45:26.520 --> 04:45:27.960
and you'll pass.

04:45:27.960 --> 04:45:28.840
You'll get a certificate.

04:45:28.840 --> 04:45:30.960
I don't have to see you again.

04:45:30.960 --> 04:45:33.360
I have full of coffee and creamer

04:45:33.360 --> 04:45:35.760
because at least 10 or 15 didn't want to be there.

04:45:35.760 --> 04:45:37.360
The other guys seriously wanted to be there

04:45:37.360 --> 04:45:38.600
and I don't want those guys to be there anyway.

04:45:38.600 --> 04:45:40.120
They're going to be a problem.

04:45:40.120 --> 04:45:41.840
So the other guys are serious about it.

04:45:41.840 --> 04:45:43.400
And some of these guys sat through the class

04:45:43.400 --> 04:45:44.880
two, three, four times.

04:45:45.800 --> 04:45:48.240
Some of these guys got out and sent me money.

04:45:49.240 --> 04:45:53.920
So, you know, which is like a huge sign of respect,

04:45:53.920 --> 04:45:55.840
you know, by the way,

04:45:55.840 --> 04:45:57.520
because they don't owe me anything,

04:45:57.520 --> 04:45:59.680
but I did that and I taught GED

04:46:01.040 --> 04:46:04.720
because, you know, you have to do something for money.

04:46:04.720 --> 04:46:06.080
And, you know, I met some,

04:46:06.080 --> 04:46:08.400
I met a bunch of cool guys and I was hanging out

04:46:08.400 --> 04:46:09.840
and I was doing well.

04:46:09.840 --> 04:46:12.720
And after about three years,

04:46:12.720 --> 04:46:15.760
they, they transferred me

04:46:15.760 --> 04:46:19.520
to the low security prison.

04:46:20.760 --> 04:46:24.400
At this point, like the, the FBI starts showing up,

04:46:24.400 --> 04:46:25.960
asking me questions.

04:46:25.960 --> 04:46:28.960
They asked me questions about the politician I bribed,

04:46:28.960 --> 04:46:30.960
you know, asked me questions about him.

04:46:30.960 --> 04:46:32.080
Statute of limitations was up

04:46:32.080 --> 04:46:36.200
and they were trying to tie him into the bank fraud

04:46:36.200 --> 04:46:38.080
because his name was Kevin White.

04:46:38.080 --> 04:46:41.600
And one of my guy's name was Michael Kevin White.

04:46:41.600 --> 04:46:44.760
And so they were trying to tie him in, you know,

04:46:44.760 --> 04:46:46.200
did you, did he know about it?

04:46:46.200 --> 04:46:47.600
Cause if he knew about it,

04:46:47.600 --> 04:46:50.080
statute of limitations is 10 years, we could,

04:46:50.080 --> 04:46:51.120
no, he didn't know.

04:46:53.120 --> 04:46:54.560
Should have thrown him in there.

04:46:54.560 --> 04:46:56.240
But anyway, cause like a couple of years later,

04:46:56.240 --> 04:46:58.080
he gets indicted, he ends up going to jail anyway.

04:46:58.080 --> 04:47:00.160
And it could have decreased your sentence.

04:47:00.160 --> 04:47:03.560
Yeah, listen, listen, stop, stop.

04:47:05.160 --> 04:47:07.120
Oh my God.

04:47:07.120 --> 04:47:08.480
I got all my judgment out

04:47:08.480 --> 04:47:10.680
after the homeless conversation.

04:47:11.720 --> 04:47:14.080
Listen, it's only gonna get worse.

04:47:14.120 --> 04:47:16.920
I mean, I really appreciate your honesty

04:47:16.920 --> 04:47:20.840
and your insight about like, about snitching, honestly,

04:47:20.840 --> 04:47:23.400
that I have a sense that there's a,

04:47:24.760 --> 04:47:27.640
at least a desire for loyalty in the world.

04:47:28.680 --> 04:47:30.120
Wouldn't that be nice?

04:47:30.120 --> 04:47:34.880
Did you ever feel in danger and medium or low?

04:47:36.920 --> 04:47:40.640
It's funny, I had more problems at the,

04:47:40.640 --> 04:47:43.560
probably at the low than I did the medium.

04:47:43.600 --> 04:47:48.400
But at the medium, the only thing that happened was

04:47:50.000 --> 04:47:52.720
an article came out in the newspaper

04:47:52.720 --> 04:47:55.160
when I was at the medium, it came out and said,

04:47:56.600 --> 04:48:01.000
cause they're, you know, they're still investigating things.

04:48:01.000 --> 04:48:04.160
So this article comes out and I'm on the front page

04:48:04.160 --> 04:48:07.240
of the St. Petersburg Times.

04:48:07.240 --> 04:48:09.200
It was about the politician, big article.

04:48:09.200 --> 04:48:12.920
And in the article, it says they interview Millie,

04:48:12.920 --> 04:48:14.560
my lawyer, and she says,

04:48:14.560 --> 04:48:17.760
well, when Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI,

04:48:17.760 --> 04:48:19.440
one of the first things they wanted to know about

04:48:19.440 --> 04:48:22.600
was this politician.

04:48:22.600 --> 04:48:27.320
So she just said, Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI.

04:48:27.320 --> 04:48:30.120
So I immediately get taken into custody

04:48:30.120 --> 04:48:32.400
and they put me in the shoe, the hole, right,

04:48:32.400 --> 04:48:33.280
for my own protection.

04:48:33.280 --> 04:48:34.760
And I'm there for like 45 days.

04:48:34.760 --> 04:48:36.280
And then after 45 days, they're like,

04:48:36.280 --> 04:48:37.720
Cox, what do you want us to do?

04:48:37.720 --> 04:48:38.760
You want us to ship you?

04:48:38.760 --> 04:48:41.600
I was like, no, put me back on the compound.

04:48:41.600 --> 04:48:43.480
I'm like, half the guys here cooperated.

04:48:43.480 --> 04:48:45.400
And he goes, yeah, it's more than half.

04:48:45.400 --> 04:48:48.760
He said, but this is a guy from SIS,

04:48:48.760 --> 04:48:50.280
which is like their internal security.

04:48:50.280 --> 04:48:51.880
So that's when he told you that it's actually

04:48:51.880 --> 04:48:52.840
a much higher percentage.

04:48:52.840 --> 04:48:54.880
Right, he goes, but 90%,

04:48:54.880 --> 04:48:56.800
he said, but 100% of them are lying about it.

04:48:56.800 --> 04:48:58.440
He said, you just came out in the newspaper.

04:48:58.440 --> 04:48:59.480
I go, man, I'm not concerned.

04:48:59.480 --> 04:49:00.320
If you are concerned,

04:49:00.320 --> 04:49:02.600
you gotta come immediately to the lieutenant's office

04:49:02.600 --> 04:49:04.240
and tell us, we'll ship you.

04:49:04.240 --> 04:49:05.280
I said, okay.

04:49:05.280 --> 04:49:08.760
I get out there, people are giving me like the,

04:49:08.760 --> 04:49:11.440
looking at me and what's up, you know,

04:49:11.440 --> 04:49:12.920
but I don't have a lot of friends anyway.

04:49:12.920 --> 04:49:14.640
And I come there to make friends.

04:49:14.640 --> 04:49:17.840
And so at one point, this one guy comes to me,

04:49:17.840 --> 04:49:20.760
I'm walking the yard, probably two days later,

04:49:20.760 --> 04:49:23.400
after I get back on the compound, I'm walking.

04:49:23.400 --> 04:49:26.240
Guy comes to me, he has a goatee and he's got a,

04:49:26.240 --> 04:49:27.840
it comes down here and he's got a skull,

04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:30.120
like a little skull thing he had made,

04:49:30.120 --> 04:49:31.480
whittled out of wood or something.

04:49:31.480 --> 04:49:34.080
And, you know, definitely looks scary.

04:49:34.080 --> 04:49:35.960
But so I'm walking and he stopped and he goes,

04:49:35.960 --> 04:49:37.800
hey, Cox, I've never talked to these guys.

04:49:37.800 --> 04:49:39.720
I had been there for a year or so

04:49:39.760 --> 04:49:41.560
and never talked to any of these guys.

04:49:41.560 --> 04:49:45.440
They're all like bikers and, you know, Aryan brotherhood.

04:49:45.440 --> 04:49:47.720
And so, you know, I'm like, yeah, what's up?

04:49:47.720 --> 04:49:50.480
He said, Bubba, Bubba's their leader.

04:49:50.480 --> 04:49:53.240
He goes, he goes, Bubba told me to tell you

04:49:53.240 --> 04:49:54.360
not to walk the yard.

04:49:54.360 --> 04:49:55.920
He don't wanna see you out in the yard.

04:49:55.920 --> 04:49:56.960
And I went, okay.

04:49:56.960 --> 04:49:59.960
I said, well, I'm gonna walk the yard tonight.

04:49:59.960 --> 04:50:01.440
I said, and if I get the shit kicked out of me,

04:50:01.440 --> 04:50:02.280
then I get the shit kicked out of me.

04:50:02.280 --> 04:50:04.880
But did you talk back to a guy with a,

04:50:04.880 --> 04:50:06.680
with a wooden skull hanging off his beard?

04:50:06.680 --> 04:50:07.760
I did, but you know what?

04:50:07.760 --> 04:50:09.120
It was right in front of the guard shack.

04:50:09.120 --> 04:50:11.960
And so there was guards in the guard shack, you know,

04:50:11.960 --> 04:50:13.120
they're 20 feet away.

04:50:13.120 --> 04:50:14.360
Really, you weren't scared?

04:50:14.360 --> 04:50:17.480
I mean, I think I just got numb.

04:50:17.480 --> 04:50:20.600
Like I'm not stupid, but I'm all, I'm walking around.

04:50:20.600 --> 04:50:24.000
I'm, you know, I was scared from the moment I got there on,

04:50:24.000 --> 04:50:25.200
if that makes sense.

04:50:25.200 --> 04:50:26.800
So you get to a point where you're just numb

04:50:26.800 --> 04:50:27.960
and you're waiting for it,

04:50:27.960 --> 04:50:29.560
especially when I got out of the shoe.

04:50:29.560 --> 04:50:32.000
Got out of the shoe, I went straight to my cell,

04:50:32.000 --> 04:50:34.300
laid down, couple minutes later, it was locked down.

04:50:34.300 --> 04:50:35.360
They closed the doors.

04:50:35.360 --> 04:50:37.360
I wake up the next morning, I go to chow.

04:50:37.400 --> 04:50:40.880
I go to my job, like it starts all over again.

04:50:40.880 --> 04:50:44.000
So I was, I had a very packed routine.

04:50:44.000 --> 04:50:46.360
So I didn't spend there, although there's guys everywhere

04:50:46.360 --> 04:50:47.840
and I'm thinking at some point,

04:50:47.840 --> 04:50:48.960
I might just be walking around.

04:50:48.960 --> 04:50:51.840
A guy might walk up and just smash me in the head,

04:50:51.840 --> 04:50:53.280
but it didn't happen.

04:50:53.280 --> 04:50:55.120
And it's not the guys aren't getting stabbed,

04:50:55.120 --> 04:50:56.520
but they've got it coming.

04:50:56.520 --> 04:50:58.560
I didn't tell on anybody here.

04:50:58.560 --> 04:50:59.400
I didn't do anything.

04:50:59.400 --> 04:51:00.600
It's not that on other yards,

04:51:00.600 --> 04:51:04.000
I might not have gotten smashed, but I didn't get smashed.

04:51:04.000 --> 04:51:06.000
And I'd been there a while and I taught the real estate class

04:51:06.000 --> 04:51:08.840
and everybody wanted to take real estate.

04:51:08.840 --> 04:51:11.240
So I think that insulated me to a degree.

04:51:11.240 --> 04:51:15.600
I also had made a few friends there.

04:51:15.600 --> 04:51:17.920
And I think they were probably also kind of putting out

04:51:17.920 --> 04:51:20.520
the words like, bro, cut this guy a break.

04:51:20.520 --> 04:51:23.000
So I'm walking across and I tell the guy, I said, look, man,

04:51:23.000 --> 04:51:25.680
I said, you know, and I wasn't rude to him.

04:51:25.680 --> 04:51:28.320
He wasn't even rude to me, really.

04:51:28.320 --> 04:51:29.960
He said, don't walk the yard anymore.

04:51:29.960 --> 04:51:31.160
Bubba, I didn't want you to walk in the yard.

04:51:31.160 --> 04:51:32.480
I said, well, listen, I'm gonna go to chow

04:51:32.480 --> 04:51:34.560
and then I'm gonna go out there tonight and walk the yard.

04:51:34.640 --> 04:51:35.960
And if I get smashed, I get smashed.

04:51:35.960 --> 04:51:39.480
I go because I got 26 years and I cannot walk around

04:51:39.480 --> 04:51:43.480
for the next 26 years, not going on the yard.

04:51:43.480 --> 04:51:44.520
I said, so I'm gonna be there

04:51:44.520 --> 04:51:45.760
and then that happens and that happens.

04:51:45.760 --> 04:51:46.920
And he looked at me and he goes,

04:51:46.920 --> 04:51:48.440
man, I don't give a fuck what you do is.

04:51:48.440 --> 04:51:50.280
That's what Bubba told me to tell you.

04:51:50.280 --> 04:51:51.280
He said, I told you.

04:51:51.280 --> 04:51:52.760
And he goes, I don't give a shit what you do.

04:51:52.760 --> 04:51:54.200
And he walked off.

04:51:54.200 --> 04:51:58.400
I went out there that night with a buddy of mine named Zach,

04:51:58.400 --> 04:52:00.080
a guy named John Gordon,

04:52:00.080 --> 04:52:02.200
with my cousin and a couple of his buddies.

04:52:02.200 --> 04:52:04.040
We walked the track for about an hour.

04:52:04.040 --> 04:52:06.080
Bubba and a group of his guys stood there

04:52:06.080 --> 04:52:08.000
and looked at us and as we walked,

04:52:08.000 --> 04:52:11.160
probably closest we got to was 30 or 40 feet.

04:52:11.160 --> 04:52:13.800
That went on for 30 minutes and then they kind of broke up

04:52:13.800 --> 04:52:14.760
and went their separate ways.

04:52:14.760 --> 04:52:16.520
And there was a couple of times

04:52:16.520 --> 04:52:18.160
where I would go to the chow hall

04:52:19.160 --> 04:52:21.160
and I would go and I'd be sitting at a table

04:52:21.160 --> 04:52:23.840
and Bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at the table,

04:52:23.840 --> 04:52:25.360
I wanna let you guys know,

04:52:25.360 --> 04:52:26.640
he didn't even call me a snitch.

04:52:26.640 --> 04:52:30.000
He said, you're sitting with a cooperating witness.

04:52:30.000 --> 04:52:31.880
He said, that's how you wanna roll.

04:52:31.880 --> 04:52:33.200
He said, you ain't gonna be rolling with us

04:52:33.200 --> 04:52:34.640
if there's any trouble.

04:52:34.640 --> 04:52:36.280
And then they all kind of looked at me

04:52:36.280 --> 04:52:38.920
and they got their plate and they moved off.

04:52:38.920 --> 04:52:41.040
He didn't tell me to move.

04:52:41.040 --> 04:52:41.880
And he could have walked up and said,

04:52:41.880 --> 04:52:43.080
this is a snitch motherfucker.

04:52:43.080 --> 04:52:44.360
He didn't do that.

04:52:44.360 --> 04:52:45.600
Bubba was very respectful.

04:52:46.640 --> 04:52:47.920
So as respectful as he could be.

04:52:47.920 --> 04:52:49.720
Whatever you wanna say about Bubba,

04:52:49.720 --> 04:52:50.760
he was a respectful man.

04:52:50.760 --> 04:52:52.280
You ever talked to him directly?

04:52:52.280 --> 04:52:54.240
Never had a conversation with him.

04:52:54.240 --> 04:52:56.760
So that went on, but I mean, when I say that went on,

04:52:56.760 --> 04:52:59.240
I mean, literally like that's a couple of times.

04:52:59.240 --> 04:53:02.200
He said the same thing to a guy in line one time.

04:53:02.240 --> 04:53:03.280
This guy came up to me later and said,

04:53:03.280 --> 04:53:04.600
look, man, I'm sorry, man.

04:53:04.600 --> 04:53:05.600
He was standing next to me in line.

04:53:05.600 --> 04:53:06.600
Bubba said something to him.

04:53:06.600 --> 04:53:09.600
He went like 10 or 15 people back and stood in line.

04:53:10.480 --> 04:53:11.840
Later on, he came up to me and said,

04:53:11.840 --> 04:53:15.240
man, I'm sorry, bro, but you know, I said, bro.

04:53:15.240 --> 04:53:17.160
I said, look, I get it.

04:53:17.160 --> 04:53:18.800
We're not friends, don't worry about it.

04:53:18.800 --> 04:53:20.000
And here's the thing.

04:53:20.000 --> 04:53:24.120
At some point there, I got, I ended up getting,

04:53:24.120 --> 04:53:27.840
well, the FBI started showing up there at the prison

04:53:27.960 --> 04:53:32.280
questioning me about my files in Tampa.

04:53:32.280 --> 04:53:34.840
Remember those 12 guys that were indicted?

04:53:34.840 --> 04:53:37.720
They show up and they start asking me about it.

04:53:37.720 --> 04:53:39.760
And so they're still kind of working it.

04:53:39.760 --> 04:53:41.520
Well, at the same time, I ended up getting moved

04:53:41.520 --> 04:53:43.440
to the low security prison.

04:53:43.440 --> 04:53:45.120
I get to low security prison.

04:53:46.920 --> 04:53:49.200
They show up over and over again,

04:53:49.200 --> 04:53:52.440
but at some point they come to me and they say, look,

04:53:53.360 --> 04:53:55.320
we went to the US attorney.

04:53:55.320 --> 04:53:57.200
We presented everything we have.

04:53:58.200 --> 04:53:59.840
I have enough for an investor.

04:53:59.840 --> 04:54:03.200
I have enough to indict all of these guys.

04:54:03.200 --> 04:54:06.560
I think it was whittled down to maybe eight instead of 12.

04:54:06.560 --> 04:54:10.480
And they said, look, the entire economy is melting down.

04:54:12.280 --> 04:54:15.360
At this point, some of these are four or five years old.

04:54:17.800 --> 04:54:20.080
We've got banks that are melting down right now.

04:54:20.080 --> 04:54:23.440
We got 100, 200, 300 million, 500, half a billion dollar

04:54:23.440 --> 04:54:25.160
banks that we're investigating.

04:54:25.160 --> 04:54:27.040
We don't have time to deal with this.

04:54:27.920 --> 04:54:29.440
We're not going to indict those people.

04:54:29.440 --> 04:54:31.160
So they get away.

04:54:31.160 --> 04:54:34.480
The agent I was working with, her name was Leslie Nelson.

04:54:34.480 --> 04:54:36.320
Very nice person.

04:54:36.320 --> 04:54:38.280
She came, actually didn't have to do this,

04:54:38.280 --> 04:54:42.640
came to the prison to tell me this is what happened.

04:54:42.640 --> 04:54:45.840
And when she'd first come to see me, I told her, listen,

04:54:45.840 --> 04:54:50.400
I wanna do all this, but no matter what happens,

04:54:50.400 --> 04:54:54.560
I need you to write me a letter if they don't indict

04:54:54.560 --> 04:54:56.720
these people, I need you to write me a letter

04:54:56.760 --> 04:55:00.080
that I can present to the US attorney on my behalf

04:55:00.080 --> 04:55:01.720
that I did everything I could.

04:55:01.720 --> 04:55:03.080
And she goes, I'll do that.

04:55:03.080 --> 04:55:03.920
That's not gonna happen.

04:55:03.920 --> 04:55:04.920
We're gonna get the indictments and everything.

04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:05.840
I was okay.

04:55:05.840 --> 04:55:08.440
So of course, a year later, she shows up after nothing

04:55:08.440 --> 04:55:09.880
happens and they've dropped the case.

04:55:09.880 --> 04:55:11.360
She shows up and she tells me what happened

04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:12.520
and he's not gonna do it.

04:55:12.520 --> 04:55:14.040
I go, do you remember that you?

04:55:14.040 --> 04:55:15.920
She goes, I got the letter right now.

04:55:15.920 --> 04:55:16.740
Gave me the letter.

04:55:16.740 --> 04:55:18.680
She was like, that's it.

04:55:18.680 --> 04:55:20.960
Great letter, you know.

04:55:20.960 --> 04:55:22.960
It says, you know, Mr. Cox has worked, you know,

04:55:22.960 --> 04:55:25.240
blah, blah, blah, he's done this, this is great.

04:55:25.280 --> 04:55:27.320
And even said, you know, he deserves a reduction

04:55:27.320 --> 04:55:29.040
in my opinion, blah, blah, blah.

04:55:29.040 --> 04:55:33.160
So, but there's no, there's nobody, nobody was arrested.

04:55:33.160 --> 04:55:36.600
So I call my public defender, I call Millie,

04:55:36.600 --> 04:55:41.040
I explain it to her and, you know, she starts, you know,

04:55:41.040 --> 04:55:44.520
she starts crying and she's sorry and well,

04:55:44.520 --> 04:55:45.360
what are we gonna do?

04:55:45.360 --> 04:55:47.280
Well, there's nothing you can do.

04:55:47.280 --> 04:55:48.840
You're time barred.

04:55:48.840 --> 04:55:53.360
Like you have one year to file a 2255,

04:55:53.480 --> 04:55:57.240
which is to say that you're a lawyer is ineffective

04:55:57.240 --> 04:56:00.600
or that the court has made a mistake in some way.

04:56:00.600 --> 04:56:02.220
And it had been over a year.

04:56:03.120 --> 04:56:05.440
It had been years, it'd been like four years.

04:56:05.440 --> 04:56:06.680
And she's like, yeah, I mean, you're just,

04:56:06.680 --> 04:56:07.680
there's nothing you can do.

04:56:07.680 --> 04:56:12.240
And she's in tears and I kind of feel like I'm done.

04:56:12.240 --> 04:56:13.880
At that point, I'm done.

04:56:13.880 --> 04:56:16.560
And what I do is I start writing a book, right?

04:56:16.560 --> 04:56:18.200
I write a memoir, my memoir.

04:56:19.120 --> 04:56:23.640
And this is not a shameless plug for my memoir, by the way,

04:56:23.640 --> 04:56:25.720
which is amazing, just saying.

04:56:25.720 --> 04:56:30.720
But, so what happens is I actually,

04:56:30.960 --> 04:56:32.760
I actually write it, you know, I write it

04:56:32.760 --> 04:56:35.040
and then I have to rewrite it, right?

04:56:35.040 --> 04:56:37.000
Cause I don't really know what I'm doing, you know?

04:56:37.000 --> 04:56:39.160
And I'd been reading true crime and that sort of thing.

04:56:39.160 --> 04:56:41.020
And I've always liked true crime.

04:56:41.020 --> 04:56:44.320
I get a literary agent, comes to see me,

04:56:44.320 --> 04:56:45.560
tells me I have to rewrite some stuff.

04:56:45.560 --> 04:56:46.800
We rewrite it.

04:56:46.800 --> 04:56:48.360
As I'm finishing up my memoir,

04:56:48.360 --> 04:56:50.240
there's a guy that comes on the compound

04:56:50.240 --> 04:56:53.480
and his name is Efrem Devoroli.

04:56:53.480 --> 04:56:57.800
Efrem Devoroli and his business partner,

04:56:57.800 --> 04:57:02.440
a guy named David Pacows, were selling munitions,

04:57:02.440 --> 04:57:05.120
AK-47 rounds, really tons of munitions,

04:57:05.120 --> 04:57:06.880
but they got in trouble with this.

04:57:06.880 --> 04:57:10.400
And they were selling them to the US government

04:57:10.400 --> 04:57:13.400
for the Afghani security forces.

04:57:13.400 --> 04:57:15.920
And there had been an article in Rolling Stone Magazine

04:57:15.920 --> 04:57:18.440
about him and I'd read it and somebody points him out

04:57:18.440 --> 04:57:20.200
and says, hey, that's that guy.

04:57:20.200 --> 04:57:21.020
And I went up to him and said,

04:57:21.020 --> 04:57:22.520
hey bro, you just got here?

04:57:22.520 --> 04:57:23.360
He's like, yeah.

04:57:23.360 --> 04:57:25.200
I said, look, if you want to write a memoir or anything,

04:57:25.200 --> 04:57:26.260
I'm finishing my memoir.

04:57:26.260 --> 04:57:27.100
I can always help you.

04:57:27.100 --> 04:57:28.160
I can help you write an outline.

04:57:28.160 --> 04:57:29.360
You can get a professional writer,

04:57:29.360 --> 04:57:30.320
whatever else you need help.

04:57:30.320 --> 04:57:31.760
He's like, yeah, all right.

04:57:31.760 --> 04:57:34.000
Efrem Devoroli was played by Jonah Hill

04:57:34.000 --> 04:57:36.140
in the movie, War Dogs.

04:57:37.000 --> 04:57:41.200
So a few months later, he comes to me and says, you know,

04:57:41.200 --> 04:57:43.600
hey, they sold the movie rights.

04:57:43.600 --> 04:57:46.160
And I was like, oh, wow, that's great.

04:57:46.160 --> 04:57:49.560
And I'm like, and you don't want to write a memoir.

04:57:49.560 --> 04:57:50.400
And he's like, yeah, man,

04:57:50.400 --> 04:57:52.800
it was sold to the guys from the hangover movie.

04:57:52.800 --> 04:57:56.060
And I was like, so the guys from the hangover movie

04:57:56.060 --> 04:57:58.720
are going to make a movie about you.

04:57:58.720 --> 04:58:00.180
I said, you understand they're going to call it like,

04:58:00.180 --> 04:58:02.560
dude, where's my hand grenade?

04:58:02.560 --> 04:58:03.760
And you're going to be Spicoli

04:58:03.760 --> 04:58:05.600
from Fast Time at Ridgemont High.

04:58:05.600 --> 04:58:07.280
Like you're going to be a joke

04:58:07.280 --> 04:58:10.000
all because you don't want to write a memoir

04:58:10.000 --> 04:58:11.400
and get your version out there.

04:58:11.400 --> 04:58:13.000
And he was like, holy shit.

04:58:13.000 --> 04:58:14.920
So I ended up writing an outline for him.

04:58:14.920 --> 04:58:16.800
We worked together and then he asked that,

04:58:16.800 --> 04:58:17.640
can I read your book?

04:58:17.640 --> 04:58:18.480
And I was like, sure.

04:58:18.480 --> 04:58:20.560
And I give it to him and he reads it and he comes back

04:58:20.560 --> 04:58:21.400
and he said, bro, he says,

04:58:21.400 --> 04:58:24.140
this is the best thing I've ever read in my life.

04:58:24.140 --> 04:58:26.320
And to be honest, I later found out

04:58:26.320 --> 04:58:27.960
he'd read about three books in his entire life,

04:58:27.960 --> 04:58:30.520
but still was very, it was very nice.

04:58:30.520 --> 04:58:32.000
Still the other two.

04:58:32.000 --> 04:58:34.360
So he asked me if I'll write his book.

04:58:34.360 --> 04:58:37.000
I write his book, we work out a deal.

04:58:37.000 --> 04:58:41.720
And we do that and I'm saying all this

04:58:41.720 --> 04:58:44.920
because I basically settle in, I'm done.

04:58:44.920 --> 04:58:46.360
I'm going to do 26 years.

04:58:46.360 --> 04:58:48.520
By the way, just in a small tangent,

04:58:48.520 --> 04:58:52.560
how did you know you'd be good at writing?

04:58:52.560 --> 04:58:54.400
I'd kind of written a manuscript

04:58:54.400 --> 04:58:56.880
prior to even taking off on the run.

04:58:56.880 --> 04:58:59.840
I used to listen to John Grisham books.

04:58:59.840 --> 04:59:01.540
You know, I'd listen to them in the car.

04:59:01.540 --> 04:59:03.040
Like I liked John Grisham books

04:59:03.040 --> 04:59:04.540
and I'd actually written a manuscript

04:59:04.540 --> 04:59:06.720
about a mortgage broker.

04:59:06.720 --> 04:59:07.840
You know, he writes about lawyers

04:59:07.840 --> 04:59:09.480
and it's like, lawyer being a lawyer is not exciting.

04:59:09.480 --> 04:59:11.360
If you can make that sound exciting,

04:59:11.400 --> 04:59:13.240
I can make being a mortgage broker.

04:59:13.240 --> 04:59:16.760
And I wrote a book, you know, put it in my desk

04:59:17.760 --> 04:59:21.200
and you know, the FBI found it and they'd, you know,

04:59:21.200 --> 04:59:23.240
said, oh, it's a blueprint to the fraud

04:59:23.240 --> 04:59:24.200
that he's going to commit.

04:59:24.200 --> 04:59:25.480
It wasn't, stop.

04:59:25.480 --> 04:59:28.440
It's as much, that character was as much me

04:59:28.440 --> 04:59:31.200
as John Grisham's characters are him.

04:59:31.200 --> 04:59:33.200
But it's still kind of interesting that

04:59:33.200 --> 04:59:35.480
it is John Grisham didn't.

04:59:35.480 --> 04:59:38.400
Right, I mean, you know, if John Grisham

04:59:38.400 --> 04:59:40.360
did something similar to what one of the.

04:59:40.360 --> 04:59:43.520
Yeah, I saw a quote somewhere

04:59:43.520 --> 04:59:48.520
that the criminal is a true artist

04:59:49.120 --> 04:59:52.600
and the detective is merely a critic, something like that.

04:59:53.760 --> 04:59:54.880
Does that resonate with you?

04:59:54.880 --> 04:59:55.840
I'll have to look that up.

04:59:55.840 --> 04:59:58.280
Okay, so you already knew you could write.

04:59:58.280 --> 04:59:59.440
Well, I knew I liked it, but yeah,

04:59:59.440 --> 05:00:00.960
I think I got better and better at it.

05:00:00.960 --> 05:00:02.040
I mean, you know, as you're writing

05:00:02.040 --> 05:00:03.800
and they had creative writing classes,

05:00:03.800 --> 05:00:05.960
you know, in prison at the Lowe, you know,

05:00:05.960 --> 05:00:10.440
the Lowe was a much different breed of animal.

05:00:10.440 --> 05:00:12.320
You know, like it, you know, it was,

05:00:12.320 --> 05:00:13.920
you could very easily get hurt.

05:00:13.920 --> 05:00:15.440
You could get hurt either place,

05:00:15.440 --> 05:00:19.040
but there were guys that have life sentences

05:00:19.040 --> 05:00:21.040
that had been working out for 20 years

05:00:21.040 --> 05:00:24.120
and were just super angry, you know, at the medium.

05:00:24.120 --> 05:00:25.560
And if you got hurt at the medium,

05:00:25.560 --> 05:00:28.520
it was probably really go bad.

05:00:28.520 --> 05:00:30.520
As opposed to you get hurt at the Lowe,

05:00:30.520 --> 05:00:34.560
it's more like a fist fight in high school.

05:00:34.560 --> 05:00:37.080
So with knives.

05:00:37.080 --> 05:00:42.080
So anyway, so I'm there, I'm writing, I'm doing that.

05:00:42.120 --> 05:00:46.400
And there was a guy on the compound

05:00:46.400 --> 05:00:48.120
that came on the compound about that same time.

05:00:48.120 --> 05:00:49.920
His name was Frank Amadeo.

05:00:49.920 --> 05:00:54.640
Frank Amadeo is a rapid cycling bipolar

05:00:54.640 --> 05:00:56.800
with features of schizophrenia.

05:00:56.800 --> 05:01:00.720
Rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia.

05:01:00.720 --> 05:01:03.560
So it's just constant, right?

05:01:03.560 --> 05:01:06.720
And so there are moments in his manic state

05:01:06.720 --> 05:01:11.720
where he, his reoccurring psychosis, I guess,

05:01:11.920 --> 05:01:15.640
is that he believes, and since he was in his early teens,

05:01:15.640 --> 05:01:18.720
has believed that he is preordained by God

05:01:18.720 --> 05:01:20.200
to be emperor of the world.

05:01:21.280 --> 05:01:23.960
He's a lawyer, disbarred,

05:01:23.960 --> 05:01:26.760
stole close to $200 million from the federal government.

05:01:26.760 --> 05:01:29.840
They gave him 22 years and they sent him to Coleman.

05:01:30.800 --> 05:01:33.880
But it doesn't, this is the part I love.

05:01:33.880 --> 05:01:36.280
The delusions don't affect his legal work.

05:01:37.680 --> 05:01:40.640
This doesn't say a ton for legal community, but-

05:01:40.640 --> 05:01:42.480
How do you know he's delusional?

05:01:42.480 --> 05:01:43.640
I'm just asking questions.

05:01:43.640 --> 05:01:45.120
Yeah, he's, trust me.

05:01:45.120 --> 05:01:46.840
I mean, it's not me.

05:01:46.840 --> 05:01:50.600
It's like the transcripts, the lawyers, the doctors,

05:01:50.600 --> 05:01:54.200
the, you know, yeah, there's a ton of, a ton.

05:01:54.200 --> 05:01:57.200
And then if you saw him in action, you'd be like, oh wow.

05:01:57.360 --> 05:02:00.120
You know, he'd be completely normal.

05:02:00.120 --> 05:02:02.760
He would be having a completely normal conversation.

05:02:03.800 --> 05:02:07.480
And somebody would say something and he'd go,

05:02:07.480 --> 05:02:08.600
that makes me so angry.

05:02:10.600 --> 05:02:12.160
I can't, I'm not gonna let them do that.

05:02:12.160 --> 05:02:16.560
When my legions march on Washington,

05:02:16.560 --> 05:02:18.800
we are going to burn the constitution

05:02:18.800 --> 05:02:21.840
and the president will kneel at my feet.

05:02:24.160 --> 05:02:25.000
And he goes,

05:02:28.200 --> 05:02:30.000
I'm gonna need your transcripts.

05:02:30.000 --> 05:02:32.160
I'm gonna need a 2255 form.

05:02:32.160 --> 05:02:33.240
We're gonna file up.

05:02:33.240 --> 05:02:35.080
And it would just, and everybody would sit there

05:02:35.080 --> 05:02:37.320
and be like, okay, Frank, I'll get this and I'll get-

05:02:37.320 --> 05:02:38.160
It was insane.

05:02:38.160 --> 05:02:39.000
It was the most insane.

05:02:39.000 --> 05:02:41.920
He was basically running a medium-sized law firm

05:02:41.920 --> 05:02:43.400
from inside of the prison.

05:02:43.400 --> 05:02:45.000
He was training people.

05:02:45.000 --> 05:02:50.000
He taught the legal research class

05:02:51.120 --> 05:02:53.640
and was training people on how to do legal research

05:02:53.640 --> 05:02:56.640
in prison, how to put together motions,

05:02:57.600 --> 05:03:01.120
how to fight their cases, how to do the research,

05:03:01.120 --> 05:03:02.840
how to type them up, everything.

05:03:02.840 --> 05:03:06.840
He's teaching a law, it's like a law school, right?

05:03:06.840 --> 05:03:09.040
Like he's teaching these guys, he-

05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:11.120
Listen, they made such a mistake locking this guy up.

05:03:11.120 --> 05:03:12.320
So he's a great lawyer.

05:03:12.320 --> 05:03:14.160
Listen, it's gonna get worse.

05:03:14.160 --> 05:03:15.960
It's gonna get worse because here's what happens

05:03:15.960 --> 05:03:18.400
is at this point, I don't talk to him

05:03:18.400 --> 05:03:20.040
for probably a year or so

05:03:20.040 --> 05:03:22.520
because everybody's saying he's crazy, you know?

05:03:22.520 --> 05:03:24.720
And for like a year he gets there,

05:03:24.720 --> 05:03:26.320
he's drooling out of the side of his mouth.

05:03:26.320 --> 05:03:27.880
They got him on a ton of medication.

05:03:27.880 --> 05:03:29.760
It takes him about a year to get them

05:03:29.760 --> 05:03:31.440
to take him off the medication.

05:03:31.440 --> 05:03:33.800
So he gets them to take him off the medication.

05:03:33.800 --> 05:03:36.120
And then he starts kind of stabilizing his mood

05:03:36.120 --> 05:03:37.400
by drinking Pepsi.

05:03:38.960 --> 05:03:39.800
I know.

05:03:39.800 --> 05:03:40.640
Bro, it's crazy.

05:03:40.640 --> 05:03:41.480
I know it's crazy.

05:03:41.480 --> 05:03:43.480
I see you looking at me like this guy's delusional.

05:03:43.480 --> 05:03:44.320
I know.

05:03:44.320 --> 05:03:45.720
It works, whatever works.

05:03:45.720 --> 05:03:49.320
So at some point, one of my buddies comes to me

05:03:49.320 --> 05:03:52.160
and says, look, you gotta go talk to Frank.

05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:53.000
Well, here's the other thing.

05:03:53.000 --> 05:03:54.160
Over the course of a year or two

05:03:54.240 --> 05:03:56.480
that he starts doing legal work for guys,

05:03:56.480 --> 05:03:58.800
he starts just taking on guys' cases.

05:03:58.800 --> 05:03:59.640
I'll do the motion.

05:03:59.640 --> 05:04:00.600
I'll do your legal work.

05:04:00.600 --> 05:04:01.480
I'll do this.

05:04:01.480 --> 05:04:02.920
Keeps him busy.

05:04:02.920 --> 05:04:06.040
But suddenly you start hearing people get released.

05:04:08.120 --> 05:04:10.240
Jimmy just got 10 years knocked off his sentence.

05:04:10.240 --> 05:04:13.120
He's going to halfway house next month.

05:04:13.120 --> 05:04:15.960
Tom got an immediate release.

05:04:15.960 --> 05:04:19.280
Frank's walking people up to R&D, shaking their hands.

05:04:19.280 --> 05:04:21.600
Guys are walking up to him in tears, crying.

05:04:22.320 --> 05:04:25.000
And so, you know, crazy or not,

05:04:26.640 --> 05:04:27.680
what choice do I have?

05:04:27.680 --> 05:04:31.880
I called three different lawyers on the street

05:04:31.880 --> 05:04:33.520
and said, this is what happened.

05:04:33.520 --> 05:04:35.160
What can I do?

05:04:35.160 --> 05:04:36.000
What can I do?

05:04:37.120 --> 05:04:38.760
They told me to do this and this and this.

05:04:38.760 --> 05:04:39.600
And I worked with them.

05:04:39.600 --> 05:04:41.160
And then they decided not to proceed.

05:04:41.160 --> 05:04:42.240
And what can I do?

05:04:42.240 --> 05:04:44.120
And they said, you're hit, bro.

05:04:44.120 --> 05:04:45.160
There's nothing you can do.

05:04:45.160 --> 05:04:48.400
You cannot, in the 11th circuit,

05:04:48.440 --> 05:04:52.800
you cannot force them to file a reduction on your behalf.

05:04:52.800 --> 05:04:53.840
You cannot do it.

05:04:53.840 --> 05:04:54.680
It's impossible.

05:04:54.680 --> 05:04:55.520
You're hit.

05:04:55.520 --> 05:04:56.360
You're done.

05:04:56.360 --> 05:04:57.200
It's over.

05:04:57.200 --> 05:04:59.040
I'd love to take your money, Mr. Cox,

05:04:59.040 --> 05:04:59.880
but it's not going to happen.

05:04:59.880 --> 05:05:01.760
I can't, I'm just going to take your money.

05:05:01.760 --> 05:05:02.760
You're going to lose.

05:05:02.760 --> 05:05:03.640
Three different lawyers.

05:05:03.640 --> 05:05:07.640
I talked to TI's lawyer, told me,

05:05:07.640 --> 05:05:08.720
bro, it's not going to happen.

05:05:08.720 --> 05:05:09.920
It's over.

05:05:09.920 --> 05:05:14.040
So my buddy says, go talk to Frank.

05:05:14.040 --> 05:05:15.960
I said, well, why wouldn't I?

05:05:15.960 --> 05:05:16.840
I got nothing else to lose.

05:05:16.840 --> 05:05:17.960
So I go talk to Frank.

05:05:18.040 --> 05:05:19.680
He actually has a little manic moment.

05:05:19.680 --> 05:05:21.400
That little thing that I just showed you,

05:05:21.400 --> 05:05:24.200
that's exactly what he said the first time I talked to him.

05:05:24.200 --> 05:05:25.160
Based on your case.

05:05:25.160 --> 05:05:26.000
Yes.

05:05:26.000 --> 05:05:27.040
I won't let this happen.

05:05:27.040 --> 05:05:28.120
He's like, I'm going to need your transcripts.

05:05:28.120 --> 05:05:28.960
I'm going to need you to get this.

05:05:28.960 --> 05:05:29.880
I need to see your indictment.

05:05:29.880 --> 05:05:31.400
I'm going to need your percentage report.

05:05:31.400 --> 05:05:33.080
I'm going to need, it was like, okay.

05:05:33.080 --> 05:05:34.880
And I turned to my buddy, he's like, bro, I know,

05:05:34.880 --> 05:05:35.840
I know what you're thinking.

05:05:35.840 --> 05:05:36.680
It's fine.

05:05:36.680 --> 05:05:37.640
I'm fucking crazy.

05:05:37.640 --> 05:05:39.280
And he's like, I understand.

05:05:39.280 --> 05:05:41.960
Let just, what choice do you have?

05:05:41.960 --> 05:05:43.600
I was like, fuck.

05:05:43.600 --> 05:05:48.240
So Frank files a 2255 motion on my behalf,

05:05:48.240 --> 05:05:51.960
stating that I'm not time barred,

05:05:51.960 --> 05:05:54.440
that Millie was,

05:05:55.920 --> 05:05:57.360
we file it against Millie,

05:05:57.360 --> 05:06:00.880
stating that she was ineffective, right?

05:06:00.880 --> 05:06:03.160
That she didn't understand the law.

05:06:03.160 --> 05:06:04.400
She had me plead to something

05:06:04.400 --> 05:06:06.600
because she thought I could get a reduction

05:06:06.600 --> 05:06:10.000
simply for doing Dateline.

05:06:10.000 --> 05:06:11.400
Oh, by the way, when I was in the medium,

05:06:11.400 --> 05:06:13.560
the government came to me and asked me to be interviewed

05:06:13.560 --> 05:06:15.280
by American Greed.

05:06:15.280 --> 05:06:16.120
I do that.

05:06:16.120 --> 05:06:16.960
I'm interviewed.

05:06:16.960 --> 05:06:17.800
They get me on the phone.

05:06:17.800 --> 05:06:19.160
They talk to me, everything.

05:06:19.160 --> 05:06:21.160
The prosecutor wants me to do it.

05:06:21.160 --> 05:06:22.120
She's re-interviewed.

05:06:22.120 --> 05:06:23.480
Everybody's re-interviewed.

05:06:23.480 --> 05:06:24.680
It airs.

05:06:24.680 --> 05:06:26.920
Millie goes to the government and says,

05:06:26.920 --> 05:06:27.800
look, reduce the sentence.

05:06:27.800 --> 05:06:29.440
They go, no, Millie, it's not enough.

05:06:29.440 --> 05:06:30.280
Then they come to me

05:06:30.280 --> 05:06:34.000
and they ask me to write an ethics and fraud course.

05:06:34.000 --> 05:06:35.400
I write an ethics and fraud course.

05:06:35.400 --> 05:06:36.360
The guy I write the course with,

05:06:36.360 --> 05:06:38.640
he flies up to Atlanta.

05:06:38.640 --> 05:06:39.960
He talks with, I think he drove up,

05:06:39.960 --> 05:06:41.320
but he goes up to Atlanta.

05:06:41.320 --> 05:06:43.480
He talks with a US attorney, talks to Millie.

05:06:44.400 --> 05:06:47.640
She insists, if he does this, I will reduce his sentence.

05:06:47.640 --> 05:06:49.280
I will definitely consider this.

05:06:50.160 --> 05:06:51.480
Definitely consider.

05:06:51.480 --> 05:06:52.800
Yeah, definitely consider.

05:06:52.800 --> 05:06:53.840
And then we do it.

05:06:53.840 --> 05:06:55.800
It's being used all over the nation.

05:06:57.760 --> 05:06:58.600
Not enough.

05:06:58.600 --> 05:06:59.440
Considered it.

05:06:59.440 --> 05:07:02.560
So that's where, at this point, I go to Frank.

05:07:02.560 --> 05:07:04.200
I tell Frank what's happening.

05:07:04.200 --> 05:07:05.440
Frank says, yeah, this is,

05:07:05.440 --> 05:07:07.960
he says every time they asked you to do something,

05:07:07.960 --> 05:07:09.600
it reset the time bar.

05:07:09.600 --> 05:07:11.920
You have a year from that time to file a 2255.

05:07:12.000 --> 05:07:14.640
He insists that that was a viable argument.

05:07:14.640 --> 05:07:16.120
Nobody else does.

05:07:16.120 --> 05:07:17.840
But he said, I'm not gonna let them do this.

05:07:17.840 --> 05:07:18.800
I'm gonna take care of this.

05:07:18.800 --> 05:07:20.520
I'm gonna get your sentence reduced.

05:07:20.520 --> 05:07:21.360
Okay.

05:07:23.040 --> 05:07:23.880
Emperor.

05:07:24.760 --> 05:07:26.320
Okay, Emperor.

05:07:26.320 --> 05:07:29.880
So he was a character.

05:07:29.880 --> 05:07:32.920
Anyway, so he files a 2255.

05:07:33.840 --> 05:07:35.000
The government comes back.

05:07:35.000 --> 05:07:37.200
They say, he's time barred.

05:07:37.200 --> 05:07:38.160
Frank comes back.

05:07:39.280 --> 05:07:40.640
They answer his motion.

05:07:40.640 --> 05:07:42.840
He files a retort.

05:07:42.840 --> 05:07:45.440
They file, you know, it just goes back and forth.

05:07:45.440 --> 05:07:48.080
This goes back and forth for six months to a year.

05:07:48.080 --> 05:07:51.480
And at some point, I go to mail call

05:07:51.480 --> 05:07:54.440
and they call my name and they hand me this thing

05:07:54.440 --> 05:07:56.520
and I open it up and it says,

05:07:56.520 --> 05:07:59.640
the government's filed a motion for a stay

05:07:59.640 --> 05:08:03.920
so that they want the court to appoint me a lawyer

05:08:05.640 --> 05:08:09.960
and to discuss filing a rule 35,

05:08:10.000 --> 05:08:11.960
reducing my sentence.

05:08:11.960 --> 05:08:14.360
And I, you know, I'm like, I read it

05:08:14.360 --> 05:08:15.520
but I couldn't even understand.

05:08:15.520 --> 05:08:16.360
Like, we don't understand.

05:08:16.360 --> 05:08:18.120
So, I mean, I rushed to go find Frank.

05:08:18.120 --> 05:08:20.120
I showed it to Frank and he says,

05:08:20.120 --> 05:08:21.480
he says, yeah, they're staying it.

05:08:21.480 --> 05:08:22.600
They're gonna send you a lawyer

05:08:22.600 --> 05:08:24.040
and you're gonna negotiate

05:08:25.120 --> 05:08:27.360
for how much they're gonna reduce your sentence.

05:08:27.360 --> 05:08:28.680
He says, perfect.

05:08:28.680 --> 05:08:31.000
So they fly this woman down.

05:08:31.000 --> 05:08:32.400
Her name was Esther Panitch.

05:08:33.640 --> 05:08:37.040
She flies down, comes to the visitation room.

05:08:37.040 --> 05:08:38.400
They bring me there, the lawyer's room,

05:08:38.400 --> 05:08:39.520
whatever they call it.

05:08:39.760 --> 05:08:42.000
And so we're sitting there and I remember we're talking

05:08:42.000 --> 05:08:45.480
and she says, listen, your motion, your 2255

05:08:45.480 --> 05:08:46.960
is written well but honestly,

05:08:46.960 --> 05:08:49.080
you don't have much of a prayer

05:08:49.080 --> 05:08:52.480
and they're offering you a one level reduction

05:08:53.440 --> 05:08:54.800
which is 30 months.

05:08:55.640 --> 05:09:00.280
And I went, oh, that's not enough.

05:09:00.280 --> 05:09:03.320
And she said, well, I don't know what to tell you.

05:09:03.320 --> 05:09:06.960
She said, they're willing to bring you back.

05:09:06.960 --> 05:09:10.920
And I was like, well, you know,

05:09:10.920 --> 05:09:13.480
I mean, I don't know, I gotta talk to Frank.

05:09:13.480 --> 05:09:15.080
Frank said I deserve this many levels

05:09:15.080 --> 05:09:16.280
and we're going back and forth.

05:09:16.280 --> 05:09:17.120
She says, who's Frank?

05:09:17.120 --> 05:09:18.680
And I go, Frank's the guy that's doing all my legal work.

05:09:18.680 --> 05:09:20.000
She goes, he didn't write all this?

05:09:20.000 --> 05:09:21.480
And I was like, no, who wrote it?

05:09:21.480 --> 05:09:23.720
And I explained it to her and she's like, he's an inmate?

05:09:23.720 --> 05:09:24.560
And I was like, yeah.

05:09:24.560 --> 05:09:25.600
And then she says, why is he here?

05:09:25.600 --> 05:09:27.640
And I tell her, well, cause she stole a bunch of money

05:09:27.640 --> 05:09:28.480
from the federal government

05:09:28.480 --> 05:09:29.640
cause he's trying to take over the world.

05:09:29.640 --> 05:09:31.040
So I tell her that whole thing.

05:09:31.040 --> 05:09:36.040
And she's like, you're letting a mentally incompetent

05:09:37.480 --> 05:09:40.080
you know, person do your legal work.

05:09:40.080 --> 05:09:40.920
And I was like, yeah,

05:09:40.920 --> 05:09:43.720
because all the competent attorneys wouldn't do it.

05:09:43.720 --> 05:09:45.320
They said, I didn't have a prayer.

05:09:45.320 --> 05:09:47.600
Your people said I didn't have a prayer.

05:09:47.600 --> 05:09:49.160
And I said, Frank said he was gonna,

05:09:49.160 --> 05:09:50.240
he could get this done.

05:09:50.240 --> 05:09:54.480
And she's like, well, I mean, you know, you don't like,

05:09:54.480 --> 05:09:56.320
I don't even know why they're offering you one level.

05:09:56.320 --> 05:09:58.480
I was like, well, Frank said, you know,

05:09:58.480 --> 05:09:59.680
and I'm like, Frank this, Frank that.

05:09:59.680 --> 05:10:01.520
And so she ended up saying, she's like,

05:10:01.520 --> 05:10:04.720
you're taking advice from a legally incompetent person.

05:10:04.720 --> 05:10:05.560
I said, yeah.

05:10:06.560 --> 05:10:08.080
And she said, you know, you really don't have a prayer.

05:10:08.080 --> 05:10:09.560
I said, then why are you here?

05:10:10.480 --> 05:10:14.200
I said, if they could crush me so easily, why are you here?

05:10:15.440 --> 05:10:17.280
I said, they're giving me one level.

05:10:17.280 --> 05:10:18.120
Let me talk to Frank.

05:10:18.120 --> 05:10:19.120
I'll let you know what we're gonna do.

05:10:19.120 --> 05:10:20.640
So I leave.

05:10:20.640 --> 05:10:21.880
I call her a couple of days later.

05:10:21.880 --> 05:10:23.040
I tell her, and I talked to Frank.

05:10:23.040 --> 05:10:27.040
Frank said, go back, go back and argue for more.

05:10:27.040 --> 05:10:28.680
He said, I think the judge is gonna give you more.

05:10:28.680 --> 05:10:31.040
He's gonna give you at least, you know, between whatever.

05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:33.880
He said like six or seven levels or something.

05:10:33.920 --> 05:10:37.120
So I get, I get moved all the way back to Atlanta.

05:10:38.280 --> 05:10:40.640
The FBI agent comes to talk on my behalf.

05:10:40.640 --> 05:10:43.000
The guy that like multiple people show up

05:10:43.000 --> 05:10:44.600
to talk on my behalf.

05:10:44.600 --> 05:10:49.520
They say, you know, Millie, who I filed the 2255 against.

05:10:49.520 --> 05:10:52.600
So I'm basically saying, you're ineffective.

05:10:52.600 --> 05:10:55.320
You're incompetent, you know, but she knows the game.

05:10:55.320 --> 05:10:56.600
She's like, I get it.

05:10:56.600 --> 05:11:00.720
She gets on the stand and testifies for me.

05:11:01.720 --> 05:11:05.720
So the judge goes, eh, you know, listen,

05:11:05.720 --> 05:11:07.520
I think we were asking for like nine levels

05:11:07.520 --> 05:11:09.320
or something outrageous.

05:11:09.320 --> 05:11:11.520
Prosecutor starts arguing for one level.

05:11:12.760 --> 05:11:16.520
And he said, listen, one level is not nearly enough

05:11:16.520 --> 05:11:18.280
for what Mr. Cox has done.

05:11:18.280 --> 05:11:20.400
He said, Mr. Cox, I know you're arguing

05:11:20.400 --> 05:11:22.920
for nine levels off your sentence.

05:11:22.920 --> 05:11:24.920
He goes, that was never gonna happen.

05:11:24.920 --> 05:11:27.960
It was like, it felt like I got slapped.

05:11:27.960 --> 05:11:30.240
And he said, so I'm gonna go with six levels.

05:11:31.040 --> 05:11:31.880
No, no, I'm sorry.

05:11:31.880 --> 05:11:32.720
He said three levels.

05:11:32.720 --> 05:11:33.680
I'm gonna go with three levels.

05:11:33.680 --> 05:11:37.240
He goes, which is seven years, which he said,

05:11:37.240 --> 05:11:41.960
for somebody who has no arrest associated with his case,

05:11:41.960 --> 05:11:43.360
he said, I think it's pretty good.

05:11:43.360 --> 05:11:45.600
And that's the judgment and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:11:45.600 --> 05:11:48.720
And he hammered, puts the gavel down and walks off.

05:11:48.720 --> 05:11:50.560
That's it, it's over, I got seven years.

05:11:50.560 --> 05:11:51.880
And I was hoping for more.

05:11:51.880 --> 05:11:54.200
So I get moved back to Coleman.

05:11:54.200 --> 05:11:57.240
I get moved back to Coleman and I go up to Frank.

05:11:57.240 --> 05:11:59.200
And I said, Frank, I got seven years off.

05:11:59.200 --> 05:12:01.200
And he's like, I know, I know.

05:12:01.200 --> 05:12:04.360
I said, I don't mean to sound unappreciative.

05:12:04.360 --> 05:12:07.800
I said, I was hoping for more.

05:12:07.800 --> 05:12:08.960
He goes, I was too.

05:12:08.960 --> 05:12:11.120
He said, it looks like we're gonna have to eat

05:12:11.120 --> 05:12:14.120
this elephant one spoonful at a time.

05:12:14.120 --> 05:12:16.880
And he goes, something will come out.

05:12:16.880 --> 05:12:18.440
Something's gonna happen.

05:12:19.480 --> 05:12:21.760
He said, keep your ears open.

05:12:21.760 --> 05:12:23.440
Something will happen.

05:12:23.440 --> 05:12:24.880
And I said, okay.

05:12:24.880 --> 05:12:26.880
And you know, honestly, by that point,

05:12:26.880 --> 05:12:29.680
I'd done, you know, I'd done eight years

05:12:29.680 --> 05:12:31.320
and I remember like if I got a year off

05:12:31.320 --> 05:12:33.080
for the drug program and good time

05:12:33.080 --> 05:12:35.120
and this and I had about eight or eight years left

05:12:35.120 --> 05:12:37.000
to go or nine years left.

05:12:37.000 --> 05:12:38.560
And I was like, you know, I can do that.

05:12:38.560 --> 05:12:39.960
I'll write.

05:12:39.960 --> 05:12:41.320
You know, I'd been writing.

05:12:43.320 --> 05:12:48.080
By that point, I'd actually written a story.

05:12:49.200 --> 05:12:52.880
Like I got a book deal for Devereaux Lee, you know?

05:12:53.600 --> 05:12:58.600
And I ended up writing a synopsis of a guy's story

05:13:01.840 --> 05:13:03.600
and I got him in Rolling Stone magazine.

05:13:03.600 --> 05:13:04.800
And I got a book deal for that.

05:13:04.800 --> 05:13:05.920
Like I got an advance.

05:13:05.920 --> 05:13:08.520
It's like 3,500 bucks for being in prison,

05:13:08.520 --> 05:13:10.320
a prisoner to get a $3,500 advance.

05:13:10.320 --> 05:13:12.360
Like I'm a millionaire.

05:13:12.360 --> 05:13:13.400
There's a lot of money.

05:13:13.400 --> 05:13:17.560
So, and then we optioned the film rights.

05:13:17.560 --> 05:13:21.920
Basically the synopsis that I wrote for this reporter,

05:13:21.920 --> 05:13:23.680
journalist for Rolling Stone,

05:13:23.680 --> 05:13:26.000
he goes to Rolling Stone with my,

05:13:26.000 --> 05:13:28.720
with what I wrote and gives it to them and they okay it.

05:13:28.720 --> 05:13:29.680
They say, yeah, this is great.

05:13:29.680 --> 05:13:31.640
We want you to write an article based on this.

05:13:31.640 --> 05:13:33.080
Okay, he writes the article.

05:13:33.080 --> 05:13:38.080
He tells me that the article will be from him,

05:13:39.080 --> 05:13:42.120
his name, Guy Lawson, Douglas Dodd,

05:13:42.120 --> 05:13:44.560
which is the name of the kid I wrote the memoir about

05:13:44.560 --> 05:13:45.920
and Matthew Cox.

05:13:47.360 --> 05:13:48.960
Couple of weeks before it's going,

05:13:48.960 --> 05:13:51.680
the article is going to be published.

05:13:52.560 --> 05:13:55.960
He tells me Rolling Stone doesn't want my name

05:13:55.960 --> 05:13:58.280
on the article because I'm in federal prison

05:13:58.280 --> 05:14:00.480
and it doesn't look good.

05:14:00.480 --> 05:14:01.480
But don't worry.

05:14:01.480 --> 05:14:05.720
He's going to put my name in the article

05:14:05.720 --> 05:14:07.040
and that's just as good.

05:14:07.040 --> 05:14:09.160
And I argue it's not just as good.

05:14:09.160 --> 05:14:10.120
It's not.

05:14:10.120 --> 05:14:11.160
I'm like, I would be,

05:14:11.160 --> 05:14:13.640
I would be a writer for Rolling Stone magazine.

05:14:13.640 --> 05:14:15.040
Like you understand I'm trying to,

05:14:15.040 --> 05:14:16.520
I'm trying to come up with something here

05:14:16.520 --> 05:14:20.760
that I can rebuild my life as a true crime writer.

05:14:20.800 --> 05:14:21.840
That's no good.

05:14:23.480 --> 05:14:25.120
What the, and that wasn't so bad.

05:14:25.120 --> 05:14:25.960
That wasn't the worst.

05:14:25.960 --> 05:14:30.960
The worst of it was 90% of the article that he published

05:14:31.560 --> 05:14:35.440
was taken directly from what I sent him.

05:14:35.440 --> 05:14:38.640
Like, I mean, sick to my stomach, bro.

05:14:38.640 --> 05:14:40.280
Just sick over it.

05:14:40.280 --> 05:14:44.640
So, but they option, they option the life rights for that.

05:14:44.640 --> 05:14:46.440
And I got a piece of that.

05:14:46.440 --> 05:14:48.120
So there's like $7,000.

05:14:48.120 --> 05:14:48.960
I get a check for that.

05:14:48.960 --> 05:14:49.800
So I'm thrilled.

05:14:49.800 --> 05:14:51.640
I can keep writing because you have to understand

05:14:51.640 --> 05:14:54.280
writing on the computer there, they charge you.

05:14:54.280 --> 05:14:55.120
So I start writing.

05:14:55.120 --> 05:14:56.760
Oh, they charge you for phone calls, writing,

05:14:56.760 --> 05:14:59.040
comma, every single thing costs money.

05:14:59.040 --> 05:15:01.480
So I start writing all these guys' stories.

05:15:01.480 --> 05:15:02.800
I start writing books.

05:15:04.880 --> 05:15:07.680
I just come back from, went back to Atlanta,

05:15:07.680 --> 05:15:10.680
got sent, seven years knocked off my sentence,

05:15:10.680 --> 05:15:14.280
come back and I'm walking around the compound.

05:15:15.280 --> 05:15:18.600
Now there was a guy that was there named Ron Wilson.

05:15:18.600 --> 05:15:22.200
Ron Wilson ran, if you look in the newspaper,

05:15:22.200 --> 05:15:25.080
it says it's like a $100 million Ponzi scheme,

05:15:25.080 --> 05:15:27.320
but really it was $57 million.

05:15:27.320 --> 05:15:29.600
So he had lost 57 million.

05:15:29.600 --> 05:15:32.400
So it says 100, they always exaggerate

05:15:32.400 --> 05:15:34.400
because 57 is not enough.

05:15:34.400 --> 05:15:38.520
Ron ended up getting 19 and a half years.

05:15:38.520 --> 05:15:39.960
Ron was an old con man.

05:15:41.680 --> 05:15:45.400
Early 60s, 62, 61, I don't know.

05:15:45.400 --> 05:15:48.320
And Ron, and I liked Ron.

05:15:51.440 --> 05:15:54.800
So we're walking around the compound and he's like,

05:15:54.800 --> 05:15:55.640
so what are you gonna do?

05:15:55.640 --> 05:15:57.840
I mean, like eight or nine more years to go.

05:15:57.840 --> 05:15:59.800
And I was like, eh, you know, I'm gonna keep writing.

05:15:59.800 --> 05:16:00.920
And when I get out of here,

05:16:00.920 --> 05:16:02.600
maybe I'll have a huge body of work

05:16:02.600 --> 05:16:04.160
and maybe I'll be able to sell it,

05:16:04.160 --> 05:16:05.920
or maybe I'll be able to option some more stuff.

05:16:05.920 --> 05:16:07.440
And if I could get together with Rolling Stone

05:16:07.440 --> 05:16:09.120
or get some of these magazines,

05:16:09.120 --> 05:16:10.240
I could start writing for them

05:16:10.240 --> 05:16:11.200
and I could option those,

05:16:11.200 --> 05:16:13.440
maybe I could walk out of here or something.

05:16:13.440 --> 05:16:15.560
So, right, right, right.

05:16:15.560 --> 05:16:18.840
So Ron was, who'd only been locked up like a year or so,

05:16:18.840 --> 05:16:22.800
he was cooperating with the Secret Service in his case

05:16:22.800 --> 05:16:25.240
against some of his co-defendants.

05:16:25.240 --> 05:16:27.880
So he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating.

05:16:27.880 --> 05:16:30.560
He's actually thinking he might get brought back

05:16:30.560 --> 05:16:32.440
to have to testify at a trial.

05:16:34.280 --> 05:16:36.520
We're talking and we're walking.

05:16:36.520 --> 05:16:40.600
And he keeps saying, you know, even if they charge

05:16:40.600 --> 05:16:42.440
those guys and even if this happens,

05:16:42.440 --> 05:16:43.600
they're not gonna reduce my sentence.

05:16:43.600 --> 05:16:45.720
They're not gonna cut my sentence.

05:16:45.720 --> 05:16:46.560
And you know, first of all,

05:16:46.560 --> 05:16:48.520
well, probably because you stole a bunch of money

05:16:48.520 --> 05:16:50.800
from pension funds and churches.

05:16:50.800 --> 05:16:53.800
That didn't help your case, but I don't say that.

05:16:53.800 --> 05:16:56.360
So I say, oh, they have to, bro.

05:16:56.360 --> 05:16:58.520
They'll have to, you know, if you cooperate,

05:16:58.520 --> 05:16:59.520
they're gonna have to, and if they don't,

05:16:59.520 --> 05:17:02.800
we'll have Frank file a 2255.

05:17:02.800 --> 05:17:06.120
And he's like, ah, that crazy mother.

05:17:06.120 --> 05:17:08.680
So he says, okay, he's like, yeah, yeah,

05:17:08.680 --> 05:17:09.920
you don't understand, you don't understand.

05:17:09.920 --> 05:17:11.280
So this goes on for months.

05:17:12.280 --> 05:17:14.800
And I'm like, what is the problem?

05:17:14.800 --> 05:17:15.640
And he says, you know,

05:17:15.640 --> 05:17:19.480
they think I hid Ponzi scheme money, you know?

05:17:19.480 --> 05:17:23.000
And he'd actually dug up like five or $6 million

05:17:23.000 --> 05:17:25.040
in Ponzi scheme proceeds that he dug.

05:17:25.040 --> 05:17:28.120
He buried in these-

05:17:28.120 --> 05:17:28.960
Oh, literally.

05:17:28.960 --> 05:17:33.960
Literally buried in aluminum ammunition canisters.

05:17:33.960 --> 05:17:35.240
Super interesting guy.

05:17:35.240 --> 05:17:38.760
So he actually went and dug them up and gave them to him.

05:17:38.760 --> 05:17:40.080
And I'm like, well, you gave them all the money.

05:17:40.320 --> 05:17:42.200
You didn't hide anything, relax, it's not a big deal.

05:17:42.200 --> 05:17:44.400
They're not gonna find anything, so don't worry about it.

05:17:44.400 --> 05:17:46.800
And so he mentions it a couple of weeks later,

05:17:46.800 --> 05:17:47.640
a couple of weeks later.

05:17:47.640 --> 05:17:50.720
And then one day I go, bro, why do you keep bringing this up?

05:17:50.720 --> 05:17:53.520
Like, what are you concerned about?

05:17:53.520 --> 05:17:54.360
It's not gonna happen.

05:17:54.360 --> 05:17:59.360
And he said, can I trust you?

05:17:59.800 --> 05:18:01.760
And I went, probably not.

05:18:01.760 --> 05:18:06.760
And he goes, I did hide some money.

05:18:06.840 --> 05:18:08.600
I was like, okay.

05:18:08.680 --> 05:18:11.280
I said, did you bury it in a can somewhere?

05:18:11.280 --> 05:18:16.280
And he's like, no, I gave my wife like 150,000 in cash.

05:18:17.200 --> 05:18:19.760
I said, okay, well, she's not gonna say anything.

05:18:19.760 --> 05:18:21.600
She's using, he said, no, you don't understand.

05:18:21.600 --> 05:18:24.520
Since then, she found out I was having an affair

05:18:26.360 --> 05:18:28.560
and we're gonna get a divorce and she hates me.

05:18:28.560 --> 05:18:30.840
And I think she'll turn that money in

05:18:30.840 --> 05:18:33.200
just to make sure that I don't get a reduction.

05:18:34.280 --> 05:18:35.840
Because if you lie to the FBI,

05:18:35.840 --> 05:18:37.400
they're not gonna, it doesn't matter what you've done

05:18:37.400 --> 05:18:39.320
for them, they won't give you anything.

05:18:39.320 --> 05:18:40.640
And so he's played, I mean, I'm sorry,

05:18:40.640 --> 05:18:42.360
it's secret service or anybody.

05:18:42.360 --> 05:18:45.760
He has clearly lied to the secret service at this point.

05:18:45.760 --> 05:18:48.480
If she goes and says, this is what he gave me.

05:18:48.480 --> 05:18:51.120
So he's like, I was like, oh, wow.

05:18:51.120 --> 05:18:51.960
And he's like, and I gave him,

05:18:51.960 --> 05:18:54.360
my brother's holding him maybe 30,000 for me.

05:18:56.000 --> 05:19:01.000
And at that moment I was like, wow, like this poor guy.

05:19:03.080 --> 05:19:04.360
No, that's not what I thought at all.

05:19:04.360 --> 05:19:06.000
What I thought was, is that enough

05:19:06.000 --> 05:19:07.840
to get me a sentence reduction?

05:19:08.760 --> 05:19:09.920
You son of a bitch.

05:19:09.920 --> 05:19:13.720
And I went and I sat there and you know what I thought?

05:19:13.720 --> 05:19:16.680
I thought, I thought, no, I thought that's not enough.

05:19:16.680 --> 05:19:17.960
That's not enough, it's nothing.

05:19:17.960 --> 05:19:19.720
That's not even $200,000.

05:19:19.720 --> 05:19:21.800
Like, and they didn't wanna give me a reduction.

05:19:21.800 --> 05:19:25.900
My prosecutor was pissed that I got seven years off.

05:19:25.900 --> 05:19:27.880
She wanted me to get 30 months.

05:19:27.880 --> 05:19:29.200
She's not gonna give me anything.

05:19:29.200 --> 05:19:31.280
It's up to her, she's not gonna do it.

05:19:31.280 --> 05:19:35.200
So I go, I lay down, I go to bed.

05:19:35.200 --> 05:19:38.640
Like a month later, I'm on the phone with my lawyer

05:19:38.640 --> 05:19:41.760
cause I had written, remember I wrote a man,

05:19:41.760 --> 05:19:43.480
I had a manuscript for my book

05:19:43.480 --> 05:19:44.960
and I wanted to put some of the stuff

05:19:44.960 --> 05:19:48.060
that was said in my sentencing in the book.

05:19:49.120 --> 05:19:52.800
So I was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts

05:19:52.800 --> 05:19:53.640
and she hadn't done it.

05:19:53.640 --> 05:19:55.040
So I called her and I said, listen,

05:19:55.040 --> 05:19:56.840
you said you were gonna, she's like, oh God, man,

05:19:56.840 --> 05:19:59.240
I'm so sorry, I'm so busy, I'll do it, I'll do it.

05:19:59.240 --> 05:20:01.080
And then she went, this is Esther.

05:20:01.080 --> 05:20:03.440
She goes, so what else is going on in there?

05:20:03.720 --> 05:20:05.200
And this, she never wanted to talk to me.

05:20:05.200 --> 05:20:07.480
Like she didn't, you know, when they were paying her,

05:20:07.480 --> 05:20:09.040
she didn't want to talk to me.

05:20:09.040 --> 05:20:10.520
And I was like, what do you mean?

05:20:10.520 --> 05:20:12.360
Nothing, I just need my transcripts.

05:20:12.360 --> 05:20:14.040
And she's like, nothing's happening.

05:20:14.040 --> 05:20:14.880
There's nothing you want to talk about?

05:20:14.880 --> 05:20:18.680
And I was like, you know what?

05:20:19.740 --> 05:20:20.580
You know what?

05:20:21.520 --> 05:20:22.840
There's something weird happened.

05:20:22.840 --> 05:20:24.640
Listen to this.

05:20:24.640 --> 05:20:26.800
And I told her about Ron Wilson.

05:20:26.800 --> 05:20:28.640
And she goes, hold on.

05:20:28.640 --> 05:20:29.760
And she looks them up on the computer and says,

05:20:29.760 --> 05:20:31.480
oh wow, this is a bad guy.

05:20:31.480 --> 05:20:32.600
This is a bad guy.

05:20:34.200 --> 05:20:36.160
And he told you, then you know where it is?

05:20:36.160 --> 05:20:37.000
Absolutely.

05:20:37.000 --> 05:20:38.640
And I can tell you exactly.

05:20:38.640 --> 05:20:40.120
And she goes, okay, okay, okay.

05:20:40.120 --> 05:20:41.400
She goes, let me look into this.

05:20:41.400 --> 05:20:42.240
I go, okay.

05:20:42.240 --> 05:20:45.640
So a week later, a CO comes to me and goes, hey Cox.

05:20:45.640 --> 05:20:46.480
And I go, what's up?

05:20:46.480 --> 05:20:47.600
He goes, listen, at the next move.

05:20:47.600 --> 05:20:49.560
Cause you know, they have controlled moves.

05:20:49.560 --> 05:20:51.480
All the doors are locked and they open them up

05:20:51.480 --> 05:20:55.080
for 10 minutes so you can run to the chow hall

05:20:55.080 --> 05:20:57.080
or you can run to the, you can't run though.

05:20:57.080 --> 05:20:58.280
There's no running on the compound,

05:20:58.280 --> 05:20:59.720
but you can walk fast.

05:20:59.720 --> 05:21:03.920
Yes, to the rec yard or the library, whatever.

05:21:03.920 --> 05:21:07.880
He says at the next move, go to SIS, you know?

05:21:07.880 --> 05:21:09.640
So I go to SIS on the next move,

05:21:09.640 --> 05:21:11.720
but I was used to going there by the way,

05:21:11.720 --> 05:21:13.480
because I was constantly ordering

05:21:13.480 --> 05:21:15.000
freedom of information acts.

05:21:15.000 --> 05:21:17.640
And they would, so I'd order you're an inmate

05:21:17.640 --> 05:21:19.160
and I'd order, I'm writing a story for you

05:21:19.160 --> 05:21:20.880
and I'd order it and they'd send it to me.

05:21:20.880 --> 05:21:22.120
And then they would catch it and they'd be like,

05:21:22.120 --> 05:21:26.640
why are you getting Lex's information?

05:21:26.640 --> 05:21:27.760
So they'd call me down there and I go,

05:21:27.760 --> 05:21:29.440
no, I ordered it for him.

05:21:29.440 --> 05:21:30.600
I'm writing a story.

05:21:30.600 --> 05:21:31.960
And I'd already been in Rolling Stone

05:21:31.960 --> 05:21:33.320
and everything like, what's the story?

05:21:33.320 --> 05:21:34.240
And I tell them the story.

05:21:34.240 --> 05:21:35.920
They got some pretty good story here.

05:21:35.920 --> 05:21:38.920
And so I go down there, but this is different.

05:21:38.920 --> 05:21:40.080
This, the guy answers the door

05:21:40.080 --> 05:21:41.400
and his guy, they call him Bulldog.

05:21:41.400 --> 05:21:42.720
He was a real asshole.

05:21:42.720 --> 05:21:45.200
It was Lieutenant SIS and he's like,

05:21:45.200 --> 05:21:47.400
come in here, get in here, Cox, sit down.

05:21:47.400 --> 05:21:48.640
And he dials the phone and he goes,

05:21:48.640 --> 05:21:49.480
here, you gotta talk to this guy.

05:21:49.480 --> 05:21:50.640
And I'm like, what?

05:21:50.640 --> 05:21:52.000
I pick up the phone, I'm like, hello?

05:21:52.000 --> 05:21:54.000
And the guy goes, hey, this is agent Griffin

05:21:54.000 --> 05:21:55.200
with the secret service.

05:21:55.200 --> 05:21:56.800
I understand you know where Ron Wilson

05:21:57.760 --> 05:21:59.600
has hidden Ponzi scheme money.

05:21:59.600 --> 05:22:02.200
I want something in writing.

05:22:02.200 --> 05:22:05.240
I want, you know, so I start doing that and they go, okay.

05:22:05.240 --> 05:22:07.040
I get his email address

05:22:07.040 --> 05:22:09.560
and we start emailing each other back and forth.

05:22:09.560 --> 05:22:14.560
And he ends up getting a letter from the US attorney

05:22:15.560 --> 05:22:19.680
in South Carolina that says they will consider

05:22:19.680 --> 05:22:22.760
it substantial assistance if they make arrests

05:22:22.760 --> 05:22:25.800
or recover a substantial amount of money.

05:22:26.680 --> 05:22:29.040
That's the best I'm gonna get is consider.

05:22:29.040 --> 05:22:31.280
So I start talking to this guy

05:22:31.280 --> 05:22:34.040
and he starts asking me questions about Ron Wilson.

05:22:34.040 --> 05:22:36.520
Like, hey, ask him this, ask him this.

05:22:36.520 --> 05:22:37.800
So I'm like, bro, I gotta kind of work

05:22:37.800 --> 05:22:38.800
that into a conversation.

05:22:38.800 --> 05:22:40.080
That's an odd thing to ask.

05:22:40.080 --> 05:22:42.280
So this goes on for six months.

05:22:42.280 --> 05:22:45.160
So I'm asking questions and I'm typing up little reports

05:22:45.160 --> 05:22:47.920
and I'm a prison snitch now.

05:22:47.920 --> 05:22:51.440
So I'm not just like cooperating, I'm now in a prison.

05:22:51.440 --> 05:22:54.320
So I've moved down.

05:22:54.320 --> 05:22:55.640
I've moved down actually

05:22:55.640 --> 05:22:58.280
from being just a cooperating witness or-

05:22:58.280 --> 05:22:59.560
Because you're in prison?

05:22:59.560 --> 05:23:01.400
Is that what makes you a prison snitch?

05:23:01.400 --> 05:23:06.000
You can't even really say, no, you could say prison rat.

05:23:06.000 --> 05:23:06.840
You could say prison rat.

05:23:06.840 --> 05:23:08.720
I think prison snitch.

05:23:08.720 --> 05:23:11.200
I think that's probably the closer to the term

05:23:11.200 --> 05:23:12.360
that most guys would use.

05:23:12.360 --> 05:23:14.400
What's the difference between a snitch and a rat in prison?

05:23:14.400 --> 05:23:15.720
I'm not sure.

05:23:15.720 --> 05:23:17.120
It rolls off the tongue better.

05:23:17.120 --> 05:23:19.760
Prison rat doesn't sound as good as prison snitch.

05:23:19.760 --> 05:23:21.040
I don't know.

05:23:21.040 --> 05:23:22.960
I don't spend a lot of time thinking about this.

05:23:23.000 --> 05:23:28.000
So what happens is I'm asking Wilson questions periodically

05:23:30.520 --> 05:23:33.520
and at some point they contact me

05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:37.480
and they say, listen, Wilson's about to get some bad news.

05:23:38.680 --> 05:23:39.520
And I go, okay.

05:23:41.440 --> 05:23:42.960
And they go, he's, you know,

05:23:42.960 --> 05:23:45.160
like I want to tell you what it is.

05:23:45.160 --> 05:23:46.400
Let us know what happens.

05:23:46.400 --> 05:23:48.200
It's like two days go by and one day,

05:23:48.200 --> 05:23:52.880
Wilson comes up to me one day and says, cocks, cocks.

05:23:53.720 --> 05:23:54.560
And I'm like, oh shit.

05:23:54.560 --> 05:23:55.400
I'm like, hey, what's up?

05:23:55.400 --> 05:23:56.240
You know?

05:23:56.240 --> 05:23:57.640
And he's like, oh my God, you're not gonna believe this.

05:23:57.640 --> 05:23:59.240
I got indicted.

05:23:59.240 --> 05:24:00.760
I was like, what?

05:24:00.760 --> 05:24:01.720
What happened?

05:24:03.040 --> 05:24:04.160
No.

05:24:04.160 --> 05:24:05.400
Yeah.

05:24:05.400 --> 05:24:09.160
My wife, they questioned my wife and my brother

05:24:09.160 --> 05:24:11.280
and my brother, my wife walked in.

05:24:11.280 --> 05:24:12.720
First she said, I don't have nothing.

05:24:12.720 --> 05:24:14.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:24:14.280 --> 05:24:15.640
The next day the brother walks in

05:24:15.640 --> 05:24:19.640
and gives them $150,000 in cash.

05:24:20.600 --> 05:24:25.680
And so the next day the wife comes back

05:24:25.680 --> 05:24:30.680
and gives them $250,000 in cash and a bunch of silver,

05:24:30.760 --> 05:24:33.600
like gold bullion and silver, you know,

05:24:33.600 --> 05:24:37.360
because his Ponzi scheme was based off of silver.

05:24:38.440 --> 05:24:40.520
You know, he was gonna invest in silver for you.

05:24:40.520 --> 05:24:43.600
So half a million dollars.

05:24:43.600 --> 05:24:44.440
They turn over half a million.

05:24:44.440 --> 05:24:45.560
I'm like, half a million dollars?

05:24:45.560 --> 05:24:47.360
I thought she was like a hundred thousand or something.

05:24:47.360 --> 05:24:48.720
And he was, he's like, I know,

05:24:48.880 --> 05:24:49.960
I didn't know I could trust you.

05:24:49.960 --> 05:24:53.480
I'm like, Ron, what are you doing?

05:24:53.480 --> 05:24:54.840
I thought we were.

05:24:54.840 --> 05:24:58.000
So he, so I'll tell you something.

05:24:58.000 --> 05:25:00.240
Just for the icing on the cake, by the way,

05:25:00.240 --> 05:25:01.080
the icing on the cake.

05:25:01.080 --> 05:25:02.560
Let me explain one more thing.

05:25:04.080 --> 05:25:06.840
There's, so if you're gonna,

05:25:06.840 --> 05:25:09.440
if somebody cooperates with the federal government,

05:25:09.440 --> 05:25:11.320
let's say I get arrested and they go,

05:25:11.320 --> 05:25:12.160
you wanna help yourself?

05:25:12.160 --> 05:25:13.720
And you go, yeah, okay.

05:25:13.720 --> 05:25:16.880
Look, Jimmy is a, he lives next to me

05:25:16.880 --> 05:25:19.360
and he's running a meth house, you know, a meth lab, whatever.

05:25:19.360 --> 05:25:22.280
And they go and they raid Jimmy and he gets arrested.

05:25:22.280 --> 05:25:23.720
You're gonna get something off for that.

05:25:23.720 --> 05:25:25.720
Not a lot, but you're gonna get something.

05:25:26.680 --> 05:25:29.560
Now, and they could just say,

05:25:29.560 --> 05:25:31.240
we were gonna bust him anyway.

05:25:31.240 --> 05:25:33.200
We were already onto him, right?

05:25:33.200 --> 05:25:36.360
Now the next level would be, you wear a wire.

05:25:38.280 --> 05:25:41.240
So I wore a wire and I was in danger.

05:25:41.240 --> 05:25:43.120
Now keep in mind, I'm asking this guy questions

05:25:43.120 --> 05:25:44.520
inside federal prison.

05:25:44.520 --> 05:25:46.000
I'm in danger.

05:25:46.000 --> 05:25:48.840
So whatever, that's like the next level.

05:25:48.840 --> 05:25:51.320
You're active, you're taking an active participate,

05:25:51.320 --> 05:25:55.280
participation in the investigation.

05:25:55.280 --> 05:25:56.760
And the third level would be,

05:25:56.760 --> 05:26:00.640
you actually get on the stand and you cooperate

05:26:00.640 --> 05:26:02.840
and you testify.

05:26:02.840 --> 05:26:04.960
There's no better cooperation than that.

05:26:05.960 --> 05:26:09.680
So when Wilson says to me,

05:26:12.080 --> 05:26:13.680
they're gonna move me back to South Carolina.

05:26:13.680 --> 05:26:15.120
They've indicted me.

05:26:15.160 --> 05:26:16.640
They charged me.

05:26:16.640 --> 05:26:17.520
What do you think I should do?

05:26:17.520 --> 05:26:19.520
And I go, I think you should go to trial.

05:26:20.840 --> 05:26:24.280
Because I know they'll have to call me as a witness.

05:26:24.280 --> 05:26:25.720
Just to let you know,

05:26:25.720 --> 05:26:28.120
because I don't want you to,

05:26:28.120 --> 05:26:31.760
I don't wanna walk out of here and have you feeling like,

05:26:31.760 --> 05:26:34.920
hey, there's some good to this guy.

05:26:34.920 --> 05:26:39.280
No, so I'm ready to cut Wilson like a fish.

05:26:39.280 --> 05:26:40.120
So.

05:26:40.120 --> 05:26:41.520
But you are putting yourself in danger

05:26:41.520 --> 05:26:42.680
if you get on a stand, right?

05:26:42.680 --> 05:26:43.720
I'm already in danger.

05:26:43.720 --> 05:26:45.400
If people there heard what I was doing,

05:26:45.400 --> 05:26:46.560
I probably would have been in.

05:26:46.560 --> 05:26:50.160
Does that increase the chance of them hearing or no?

05:26:50.160 --> 05:26:52.920
It does, but it also increases my ability

05:26:52.920 --> 05:26:55.480
to get more off my sentence.

05:26:55.480 --> 05:26:58.200
So what happens is a couple of days later,

05:26:58.200 --> 05:26:59.880
he's on what's called the pack out, right?

05:26:59.880 --> 05:27:02.080
They're gonna move him, maybe a week later.

05:27:02.080 --> 05:27:04.120
So they come and get him, they move him.

05:27:04.120 --> 05:27:08.600
He gets back there to South Carolina and he pleads guilty.

05:27:08.600 --> 05:27:11.920
He, they sentence him, he gets six months added on.

05:27:11.920 --> 05:27:14.240
So now I'm from 19 and a half to 20 years.

05:27:15.520 --> 05:27:20.120
And by the way, when COVID hit, he was released.

05:27:20.120 --> 05:27:22.320
So he only ended up doing like six years

05:27:22.320 --> 05:27:26.240
on a 20 year sentence because he was older.

05:27:26.240 --> 05:27:29.600
He's by that point, he's 66, 67 years old.

05:27:29.600 --> 05:27:30.440
You know, he's an old,

05:27:30.440 --> 05:27:32.560
anybody older than 55 was endangered,

05:27:32.560 --> 05:27:33.880
especially in the prison.

05:27:33.880 --> 05:27:36.400
So they had a COVID thing where they were releasing

05:27:36.400 --> 05:27:38.080
these guys and sending them home on ankle monitors.

05:27:38.080 --> 05:27:41.080
Like he's an old man, he's not, he's not gonna hurt.

05:27:41.400 --> 05:27:42.400
He's not a danger.

05:27:43.240 --> 05:27:44.320
So they sent him home.

05:27:44.320 --> 05:27:46.880
So he ended up doing, so he didn't even serve the six months.

05:27:46.880 --> 05:27:48.840
He didn't even serve the original sentence.

05:27:48.840 --> 05:27:50.600
Whatever, not that I care.

05:27:50.600 --> 05:27:53.600
So I'm just saying, it makes you feel like poor Ron.

05:27:53.600 --> 05:27:54.440
It's okay.

05:27:54.440 --> 05:27:58.560
So his wife got like a hundred years, a hundred,

05:27:58.560 --> 05:28:00.160
she got like a hundred hours

05:28:00.160 --> 05:28:02.800
of community service or something or 60 hours.

05:28:02.800 --> 05:28:05.120
And I think his brother got six months papers.

05:28:05.120 --> 05:28:08.080
They got charged with obstruction of justice, you know,

05:28:08.080 --> 05:28:09.800
and they didn't, neither one of them, you know,

05:28:09.800 --> 05:28:14.040
just like six months probation and community service,

05:28:14.040 --> 05:28:15.360
nothing.

05:28:15.360 --> 05:28:19.720
So when I turn around, I'm waiting for my reduction,

05:28:19.720 --> 05:28:22.000
waiting, waiting.

05:28:22.000 --> 05:28:24.640
After about 90 days, after this guy gets sentenced,

05:28:24.640 --> 05:28:26.120
maybe six months, I send a letter.

05:28:26.120 --> 05:28:28.440
Hey, what's going on to the prosecuting,

05:28:28.440 --> 05:28:32.200
to my prosecutor there, the prosecutor of both districts,

05:28:32.200 --> 05:28:33.720
no response.

05:28:33.720 --> 05:28:35.360
Then I go to Frank, I explained to Frank

05:28:35.360 --> 05:28:37.960
and Frank has known what's going on the whole time.

05:28:37.960 --> 05:28:40.480
And Frank goes, okay, I'm gonna file a 2255.

05:28:40.480 --> 05:28:42.880
So we file a 2255.

05:28:42.880 --> 05:28:45.760
Government comes back and the first thing they say is,

05:28:45.760 --> 05:28:49.000
your honor, we don't know about any cooperation.

05:28:49.000 --> 05:28:51.640
We've never heard about any cooperation.

05:28:51.640 --> 05:28:54.720
So of course, then we submit the letter that we have.

05:28:56.840 --> 05:28:59.160
The judge comes back and the judge ends up saying,

05:28:59.160 --> 05:29:01.400
it's a little complicated, but he ends up saying,

05:29:01.400 --> 05:29:04.520
look, I don't have jurisdiction to hear this

05:29:04.520 --> 05:29:09.200
because you may be time barred,

05:29:11.200 --> 05:29:15.240
but I'm gonna let the appeals court hear it.

05:29:16.160 --> 05:29:19.000
Now, typically you have to get what's called

05:29:19.000 --> 05:29:21.840
like a right of certification to appeal.

05:29:21.840 --> 05:29:23.960
You have to make sure that you actually have a case.

05:29:23.960 --> 05:29:25.600
He says, I'm waiving the cert

05:29:26.760 --> 05:29:31.000
and I'm waiving the $500 fee to file with them.

05:29:31.160 --> 05:29:34.800
He basically expedites it for me,

05:29:35.760 --> 05:29:38.560
which is a subtle way of telling the prosecutor,

05:29:38.560 --> 05:29:41.960
I think he's got something and I'm sending it up there.

05:29:41.960 --> 05:29:43.560
And the way he writes his motion,

05:29:43.560 --> 05:29:44.720
it's basically saying,

05:29:44.720 --> 05:29:48.720
I don't have the jurisdiction to hear it, to do anything,

05:29:48.720 --> 05:29:52.640
but they do, they need to do it and I'm paving the way.

05:29:52.640 --> 05:29:53.720
You don't have to pay any money

05:29:53.720 --> 05:29:55.640
and you don't need that cert.

05:29:55.640 --> 05:29:58.280
So the prosecution immediately comes back.

05:29:58.280 --> 05:30:01.040
They file a one level reduction

05:30:03.640 --> 05:30:06.240
and we immediately, Frank files something saying,

05:30:06.240 --> 05:30:09.520
hey, stop, we don't want the reduction.

05:30:09.520 --> 05:30:10.360
We don't want the one level.

05:30:10.360 --> 05:30:11.960
We wanna come back to court.

05:30:11.960 --> 05:30:14.000
Please don't rule on it.

05:30:14.000 --> 05:30:16.960
So the judge says, okay, I'm freezing everything.

05:30:16.960 --> 05:30:18.800
I'm putting a stay on everything.

05:30:18.800 --> 05:30:20.320
I'm gonna give this guy a lawyer

05:30:22.680 --> 05:30:25.280
to try and figure out what you're gonna do.

05:30:25.280 --> 05:30:30.280
They fly down a lawyer, Leanne Weber.

05:30:31.800 --> 05:30:35.440
So she comes and she comes and sees me and she says,

05:30:35.440 --> 05:30:38.240
listen, I see that you wanna go back

05:30:38.240 --> 05:30:40.440
and fight this and this, but honestly,

05:30:40.440 --> 05:30:43.600
I don't think you're gonna get anything more than one level.

05:30:43.600 --> 05:30:45.600
I talked to the prosecution.

05:30:45.600 --> 05:30:47.240
They said they'll give you,

05:30:47.240 --> 05:30:49.920
well, she said, I can work on trying to get you two levels,

05:30:49.920 --> 05:30:51.640
but you don't have much of a prayer.

05:30:51.640 --> 05:30:53.240
You're gonna get crushed.

05:30:53.280 --> 05:30:57.200
And I said, well, then why are you here?

05:30:57.200 --> 05:31:00.080
If they can crush me so easy, why don't they do it?

05:31:00.080 --> 05:31:01.480
Why would they pay you like,

05:31:01.480 --> 05:31:03.440
they pay them like 12 grand or something

05:31:03.440 --> 05:31:08.280
just to fly down and all your expenses to negotiate for me.

05:31:08.280 --> 05:31:09.200
Why not crush me?

05:31:10.800 --> 05:31:12.280
And she's like, I don't know.

05:31:12.280 --> 05:31:14.560
I said, well, Frank said four levels.

05:31:14.560 --> 05:31:15.440
And she's like, who's Frank?

05:31:15.440 --> 05:31:16.560
I go, Frank's the guy that wrote all this.

05:31:16.560 --> 05:31:18.240
And she's like, oh, is he an attorney?

05:31:18.240 --> 05:31:19.320
And I go, is he in here?

05:31:19.320 --> 05:31:20.680
I'm like, yeah, he's in here.

05:31:20.680 --> 05:31:21.680
She's like, why is he in here?

05:31:21.680 --> 05:31:24.800
And I tell her, you've taken over the world.

05:31:24.800 --> 05:31:29.040
And she says, that's the strangest thing

05:31:29.040 --> 05:31:31.200
I've ever heard in my entire life.

05:31:31.200 --> 05:31:32.560
And I said, I understand.

05:31:32.560 --> 05:31:33.760
But Frank said, and she's like,

05:31:33.760 --> 05:31:38.320
you're listening to an incompetent, absolutely.

05:31:38.320 --> 05:31:42.800
And Frank said, we want four levels.

05:31:42.800 --> 05:31:45.440
He said for me, tell you, we want four levels.

05:31:45.440 --> 05:31:46.280
She was okay.

05:31:46.280 --> 05:31:47.840
She leaves.

05:31:47.840 --> 05:31:48.880
She goes to the US attorney.

05:31:48.880 --> 05:31:50.920
We argue two levels.

05:31:50.920 --> 05:31:52.160
They come back and say two levels.

05:31:52.160 --> 05:31:53.560
No, we go back and forth.

05:31:53.560 --> 05:31:56.200
We start filing motions saying, we want to go back.

05:31:56.200 --> 05:31:57.360
We want a hearing.

05:31:57.360 --> 05:31:59.280
We want to bring back all the FBI agents,

05:31:59.280 --> 05:32:00.560
the Secret Service agents.

05:32:00.560 --> 05:32:01.640
And she's like, what, do you want to turn this

05:32:01.640 --> 05:32:02.480
into a circus?

05:32:02.480 --> 05:32:03.320
Exactly, what do I want to do?

05:32:03.320 --> 05:32:04.520
I'm gonna turn it into the biggest circus

05:32:04.520 --> 05:32:06.160
because I've already got one level.

05:32:07.360 --> 05:32:08.600
They come back and one day she says,

05:32:08.600 --> 05:32:12.000
listen, three levels is the best you're gonna get.

05:32:13.320 --> 05:32:16.280
She said, so I guess you'll be moved back here.

05:32:16.280 --> 05:32:17.120
We'll go to the hearing.

05:32:17.120 --> 05:32:19.240
I said, no, no, no, I'll take three levels.

05:32:19.240 --> 05:32:20.080
And she says, what are you talking?

05:32:20.080 --> 05:32:21.400
She said, you said four levels.

05:32:21.400 --> 05:32:23.320
You said, Frank wouldn't let you take anything less than four.

05:32:23.320 --> 05:32:26.200
I said, no, Frank said to tell you four.

05:32:26.200 --> 05:32:27.320
I was happy with three.

05:32:27.320 --> 05:32:28.600
I wanted you to argue for four.

05:32:28.600 --> 05:32:29.800
I'm good with three.

05:32:29.800 --> 05:32:31.960
I'm out of here in like a year.

05:32:31.960 --> 05:32:34.600
So, and I don't want to be moved back.

05:32:34.600 --> 05:32:35.720
I don't want to have to get on that bus.

05:32:35.720 --> 05:32:37.160
Do you know what it's like to be moved?

05:32:37.160 --> 05:32:38.000
It's horrible.

05:32:38.000 --> 05:32:39.720
So I said, I just want the three levels.

05:32:39.720 --> 05:32:42.440
So then we argue about the wording for about two,

05:32:42.440 --> 05:32:43.760
three months and then they file it.

05:32:43.760 --> 05:32:45.920
And then I get five years knocked off my sentence

05:32:45.920 --> 05:32:48.520
because three levels at the level I was at now

05:32:48.520 --> 05:32:49.360
isn't seven years.

05:32:49.360 --> 05:32:51.160
At every level, you get a little less time.

05:32:51.160 --> 05:32:52.400
So I get five years off.

05:32:52.400 --> 05:32:55.320
So now I've got 12 years knocked off my sentence.

05:32:55.320 --> 05:33:00.320
At this point, I may have a year and a half to go.

05:33:02.080 --> 05:33:03.520
And you know, that's doable.

05:33:04.800 --> 05:33:08.440
So I was super, super happy.

05:33:11.160 --> 05:33:13.040
And I'm going to tell you something.

05:33:15.600 --> 05:33:16.680
And I'm sorry, bro.

05:33:17.040 --> 05:33:20.120
But every time I think about it

05:33:20.120 --> 05:33:23.160
and I just feel like I have to say it,

05:33:25.320 --> 05:33:29.840
like I'm frank, I'm insane,

05:33:31.720 --> 05:33:36.720
but I can, like, I didn't have a prayer without that guy.

05:33:37.880 --> 05:33:40.960
And as crazy as he is and much of a pain in the ass

05:33:40.960 --> 05:33:41.800
as he was,

05:33:42.800 --> 05:33:47.240
like I could never repay him, bro.

05:33:47.240 --> 05:33:50.640
Like, like I'm not, I shouldn't be here.

05:33:51.640 --> 05:33:53.400
I'm supposed to be in prison right now.

05:33:53.400 --> 05:33:58.400
My out date was 30, was 2030 without that guy.

05:33:59.800 --> 05:34:01.360
Where does he know?

05:34:01.360 --> 05:34:03.080
He got himself out.

05:34:03.080 --> 05:34:04.120
He didn't do all that time.

05:34:04.120 --> 05:34:05.120
He got himself out.

05:34:05.120 --> 05:34:06.080
I don't even know how he did it.

05:34:06.080 --> 05:34:08.760
They even threw him back in prison again for six months

05:34:08.760 --> 05:34:10.800
and he got himself out again.

05:34:10.800 --> 05:34:11.640
He's insane.

05:34:11.640 --> 05:34:12.480
He's incredible.

05:34:12.480 --> 05:34:14.000
He's insane, but he's incredible.

05:34:14.000 --> 05:34:15.080
Is he really that insane?

05:34:15.080 --> 05:34:16.960
He's in Orlando.

05:34:16.960 --> 05:34:19.320
Is he, I mean, he seems like,

05:34:19.320 --> 05:34:21.480
he seems like a good lawyer and a good man.

05:34:22.520 --> 05:34:25.000
He's great.

05:34:25.000 --> 05:34:26.320
He's great.

05:34:26.320 --> 05:34:28.560
I mean, there's no doubt in my mind

05:34:28.560 --> 05:34:31.040
I would be in prison right now if it wasn't for him.

05:34:31.040 --> 05:34:32.360
And he's done this for others?

05:34:32.360 --> 05:34:33.400
Walk people right out.

05:34:33.400 --> 05:34:35.920
10 years off, five years off, nine years off, 10 years.

05:34:35.920 --> 05:34:40.480
I mean, it's, I didn't pay and I didn't pay for one thing.

05:34:40.480 --> 05:34:42.920
I didn't pay for my stamps.

05:34:42.920 --> 05:34:44.080
He paid for everything.

05:34:45.320 --> 05:34:48.320
Sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe

05:34:48.320 --> 05:34:49.920
it's possible and he does.

05:34:49.920 --> 05:34:50.880
It's interesting.

05:34:50.880 --> 05:34:53.440
Well, I think he's, he was willing to,

05:34:53.440 --> 05:34:57.480
he's willing to badger them into doing, you know,

05:34:57.480 --> 05:35:00.080
what they should have done to begin with.

05:35:00.080 --> 05:35:03.000
I actually wrote a book about it, which he loved.

05:35:03.000 --> 05:35:03.840
About him.

05:35:03.840 --> 05:35:05.400
About him and his story.

05:35:05.400 --> 05:35:08.680
It's so over the top what happened with him.

05:35:09.600 --> 05:35:11.920
I mean, a little, I tried to take over the Congo.

05:35:11.920 --> 05:35:14.440
I mean, there's a documentary about it.

05:35:14.440 --> 05:35:16.920
There's, it's called Nine Days in the Congo.

05:35:16.920 --> 05:35:17.960
It's an insane story.

05:35:17.960 --> 05:35:20.040
I'm, this is one of those stories that's just like,

05:35:20.040 --> 05:35:21.280
how is this not a movie?

05:35:21.280 --> 05:35:22.120
It's not a movie yet?

05:35:22.120 --> 05:35:23.240
No, I don't.

05:35:23.240 --> 05:35:28.240
I've pitched it several times and it would be great.

05:35:28.600 --> 05:35:32.080
But, so I wrote a synopsis and I turned that into a book.

05:35:32.080 --> 05:35:33.080
What's the name of the book?

05:35:33.080 --> 05:35:34.440
Oh, It's Insanity.

05:35:34.440 --> 05:35:35.280
It's Insanity.

05:35:35.280 --> 05:35:36.240
Yeah.

05:35:36.240 --> 05:35:37.960
But about it, like a year and a half later,

05:35:37.960 --> 05:35:39.360
like I ended up getting out of prison

05:35:39.360 --> 05:35:40.760
and I went to the halfway house.

05:35:40.760 --> 05:35:42.080
What'd that feel like?

05:35:42.080 --> 05:35:43.040
Freedom.

05:35:43.040 --> 05:35:47.840
What was, oh, this is bad, bro.

05:35:47.840 --> 05:35:49.080
This is bad.

05:35:49.080 --> 05:35:53.800
I remember when I was leaving the prison.

05:35:53.800 --> 05:35:57.000
So, you know, I met some great guys in prison,

05:35:57.000 --> 05:35:59.200
which is a weird thing to say.

05:35:59.200 --> 05:36:04.200
But I've met better, I met better people in prison

05:36:04.240 --> 05:36:08.000
than I'd ever met outside prison at that low.

05:36:11.120 --> 05:36:14.960
I mean, because it was the first time I actually had friends,

05:36:14.960 --> 05:36:17.400
you know, like I really had someone

05:36:17.400 --> 05:36:18.560
that wanted to hang out with me,

05:36:18.560 --> 05:36:21.680
just like I didn't have anything to offer them.

05:36:21.680 --> 05:36:22.680
I can't make you any money.

05:36:22.680 --> 05:36:24.760
I can't do anything for you.

05:36:24.760 --> 05:36:26.920
We just hanging out because we like to laugh

05:36:26.920 --> 05:36:28.160
or we're gonna have things in common

05:36:28.160 --> 05:36:29.720
or we're fascinated by each other

05:36:29.720 --> 05:36:32.360
or we just have good time and fun.

05:36:32.360 --> 05:36:36.040
So when I was leaving, I remember my mom showed up

05:36:36.040 --> 05:36:38.800
and my brother showed up and they picked me up

05:36:38.800 --> 05:36:40.320
and we were driving off.

05:36:41.400 --> 05:36:44.080
And I remember looking back at the prison

05:36:44.080 --> 05:36:47.960
and my brother said, Paul, I'll bet you're glad to see that,

05:36:47.960 --> 05:36:50.920
you know, to leave that behind you.

05:36:50.920 --> 05:36:53.280
And I started crying.

05:36:53.280 --> 05:36:56.240
It's like nobody talked, I was so uncomfortable.

05:36:56.240 --> 05:36:57.800
It was just, I started crying.

05:36:57.880 --> 05:37:02.440
And it wasn't because I was like, oh, it's over.

05:37:02.440 --> 05:37:05.160
It was because it was like survivor's guilt, you know,

05:37:05.160 --> 05:37:08.640
like I was leaving all of my friends

05:37:08.640 --> 05:37:12.240
and I felt so bad that I was leaving them.

05:37:15.400 --> 05:37:20.400
But I went to the halfway house and I had,

05:37:22.320 --> 05:37:23.880
I had four,

05:37:23.880 --> 05:37:28.880
I had, so when I was getting out,

05:37:29.920 --> 05:37:34.200
I remember joking that I had exhausted my TrueLinks account,

05:37:34.200 --> 05:37:37.160
my inmate account, I'd exhausted it.

05:37:37.160 --> 05:37:39.120
I had nothing, I had like 18 cents.

05:37:39.120 --> 05:37:40.920
I couldn't even figure out how to spend it.

05:37:40.920 --> 05:37:43.680
And they give you a debit card when you leave.

05:37:45.120 --> 05:37:47.080
And I said, like, and they charge you every time

05:37:47.080 --> 05:37:49.200
you use the card.

05:37:49.200 --> 05:37:51.440
Like I don't even have enough to spend the 18 cents,

05:37:51.440 --> 05:37:53.560
you know, it's cause it just charges like $3.

05:37:53.560 --> 05:37:55.080
So I was like, I was like, yeah, yeah.

05:37:55.080 --> 05:37:55.920
I was like, I wonder if they're still

05:37:55.920 --> 05:37:56.920
giving me my debit card.

05:37:56.920 --> 05:37:58.240
And I'm laughing, everybody's like,

05:37:58.240 --> 05:37:59.080
what are you gonna eat?

05:37:59.080 --> 05:38:00.360
What are you this, what are that?

05:38:00.360 --> 05:38:04.760
And my one buddy looked at me, he was like,

05:38:05.640 --> 05:38:08.000
you can't go to the halfway house with nothing, bro.

05:38:08.000 --> 05:38:09.520
And I was like, no, it's cool.

05:38:09.520 --> 05:38:10.400
I said, no, it's cool.

05:38:10.400 --> 05:38:11.240
You know, I said, no, it's cool.

05:38:11.240 --> 05:38:13.880
I said, I wanna start at the bottom.

05:38:13.880 --> 05:38:15.400
I've got that coming.

05:38:15.400 --> 05:38:18.120
I got working at McDonald's coming.

05:38:18.120 --> 05:38:19.960
So I'm gonna work at McDonald's.

05:38:19.960 --> 05:38:21.640
I don't give a fuck.

05:38:21.640 --> 05:38:25.520
And he was like, well, I think you're gonna need

05:38:25.520 --> 05:38:26.360
to buy clothes.

05:38:26.360 --> 05:38:27.360
I think that's enough.

05:38:27.360 --> 05:38:31.600
I said, it's at the goodwill.

05:38:31.600 --> 05:38:33.400
They'll give you a bunch of crap

05:38:33.400 --> 05:38:35.320
if you don't have anything, if you're indigent.

05:38:35.320 --> 05:38:36.880
And I said, I'm indigent.

05:38:36.880 --> 05:38:41.440
And a couple of days before I'm leaving,

05:38:41.440 --> 05:38:43.360
$400 ends up on my account.

05:38:44.840 --> 05:38:46.400
And I was like, what the fuck?

05:38:47.360 --> 05:38:49.520
And it was from a buddy of mine.

05:38:49.560 --> 05:38:52.640
And I go to him, my buddy, Tommy.

05:38:52.640 --> 05:38:56.040
And I was like, Tommy, did you put $400 on my account?

05:38:57.080 --> 05:38:59.640
And he said, I can't let you go for nothing, bro.

05:39:00.600 --> 05:39:05.600
So I get to the halfway house and I go to Walmart

05:39:05.640 --> 05:39:09.840
and I buy $300 worth of clothes at Walmart.

05:39:09.840 --> 05:39:12.040
I've never been in a Walmart.

05:39:12.040 --> 05:39:13.920
I go to Super Walmart, they're huge.

05:39:13.920 --> 05:39:16.040
And I go there and I buy a bunch of clothes

05:39:16.040 --> 05:39:18.000
and I buy about 300 bucks worth of clothes.

05:39:18.000 --> 05:39:19.520
And I still have some of the blue jeans.

05:39:19.520 --> 05:39:22.320
To this day, I still wear some of the blue jeans.

05:39:22.320 --> 05:39:26.200
And I stayed in the halfway house

05:39:26.200 --> 05:39:31.200
and I called the buddy of mine named Trion, Trion Calta.

05:39:32.520 --> 05:39:35.640
And he owns a gym and I grew up with him.

05:39:35.640 --> 05:39:37.840
His whole family, they owned a bunch of gyms.

05:39:37.840 --> 05:39:41.600
And I called him and I said, hey man, I'm in the halfway house.

05:39:41.600 --> 05:39:44.120
And he was like, hey, what's going on?

05:39:44.120 --> 05:39:45.600
He said, can I do anything for you?

05:39:45.760 --> 05:39:48.640
And I was like, I mean, I need a job.

05:39:48.640 --> 05:39:49.800
I didn't think he was gonna give me a job.

05:39:49.800 --> 05:39:50.800
He was, bro, you're hired.

05:39:50.800 --> 05:39:52.120
I'll give you a job.

05:39:52.120 --> 05:39:54.240
He said, I can't, minimum wage?

05:39:54.240 --> 05:39:55.520
I said, that's fine.

05:39:55.520 --> 05:39:56.520
If I can stay out of here,

05:39:56.520 --> 05:39:58.480
I usually work like 80 hours a week.

05:39:58.480 --> 05:40:00.080
I was like, if I can just stay out of here 80 hours

05:40:00.080 --> 05:40:03.560
and you pay me minimum wage, he goes, oh hell yeah, perfect.

05:40:03.560 --> 05:40:06.360
So I'm at the gym and I got free reign.

05:40:06.360 --> 05:40:09.240
So I'm playing on my computer, goofing off all day.

05:40:09.240 --> 05:40:11.360
And my buddy Pete, who's still locked up,

05:40:11.360 --> 05:40:13.360
he's texting me and calling me and he's like,

05:40:13.360 --> 05:40:15.880
not texting me, he's emailing me

05:40:15.880 --> 05:40:16.960
through the core link system.

05:40:16.960 --> 05:40:19.800
And he calls me periodically.

05:40:19.800 --> 05:40:21.440
He's like, have you started a website?

05:40:21.440 --> 05:40:23.120
Cause one of the things I was gonna do when I got out

05:40:23.120 --> 05:40:24.320
was I was gonna start a website

05:40:24.320 --> 05:40:26.440
with all these stories that I'd written.

05:40:26.440 --> 05:40:28.600
And I was like, no, Pete, I don't, I can't.

05:40:28.600 --> 05:40:30.760
Like, I don't have a computer.

05:40:30.760 --> 05:40:32.760
He's like, well, how much is a computer?

05:40:32.760 --> 05:40:35.560
I was like, I don't know, they're like 300 bucks.

05:40:35.560 --> 05:40:38.200
I was like, I said, I could probably get a used Apple,

05:40:38.200 --> 05:40:40.840
like MacBook, like a five-year-old MacBook or something.

05:40:40.840 --> 05:40:44.400
I don't know, for like $350, whatever.

05:40:44.400 --> 05:40:45.720
And I said, but he was like,

05:40:45.720 --> 05:40:46.960
okay, so that's all you need 300 bucks.

05:40:46.960 --> 05:40:47.800
I go, no, no, no, no, no.

05:40:47.800 --> 05:40:48.880
I said, it's not 300 bucks, bro.

05:40:48.880 --> 05:40:50.040
It's 300 bucks.

05:40:50.040 --> 05:40:52.680
Plus it's getting a WordPress website,

05:40:52.680 --> 05:40:53.960
which I said costs money.

05:40:53.960 --> 05:40:56.400
Plus it's hiring somebody to help me figure it out

05:40:56.400 --> 05:41:00.040
because I don't, I'm inept.

05:41:01.200 --> 05:41:03.560
I don't know how anything works.

05:41:03.560 --> 05:41:04.760
So he, okay.

05:41:04.760 --> 05:41:06.440
And I said, plus I need this, plus I need this.

05:41:06.440 --> 05:41:07.880
I need a bunch of stuff.

05:41:08.400 --> 05:41:09.440
I need $600 for this.

05:41:09.440 --> 05:41:10.960
I need 300 for this.

05:41:10.960 --> 05:41:11.800
I need 500 for this.

05:41:11.800 --> 05:41:14.760
I need a thousand dollars for this.

05:41:14.760 --> 05:41:15.760
And he goes, okay.

05:41:15.760 --> 05:41:16.880
He said, I'm gonna get, I'll get you.

05:41:16.880 --> 05:41:17.720
Okay, I got it.

05:41:17.720 --> 05:41:18.560
So he reads off a list.

05:41:18.560 --> 05:41:19.880
He goes, I got you.

05:41:19.880 --> 05:41:21.720
Pete doesn't have any money.

05:41:21.720 --> 05:41:22.960
And I go, how are you gonna give me any money?

05:41:22.960 --> 05:41:27.960
He goes, every day I walk across the compound.

05:41:27.960 --> 05:41:31.840
Some people stop me and say, how's Cox doing?

05:41:31.840 --> 05:41:33.400
And I say, oh, he's okay.

05:41:33.400 --> 05:41:35.360
And they say, does he need anything?

05:41:35.520 --> 05:41:37.400
Does he need anything?

05:41:37.400 --> 05:41:39.560
And I say, no, no, he's good.

05:41:39.560 --> 05:41:41.640
He said, I'm gonna start telling these fuckers, yeah.

05:41:41.640 --> 05:41:42.920
Yeah, he needs something.

05:41:42.920 --> 05:41:44.080
You wanna do something for him?

05:41:44.080 --> 05:41:45.080
Here's what he needs.

05:41:47.520 --> 05:41:52.120
I ended up getting two laptops sent to me.

05:41:53.280 --> 05:41:57.920
I got the computer program, Final Cut Pro.

05:41:58.800 --> 05:42:03.480
I had guys in prison cutting me checks

05:42:03.480 --> 05:42:05.480
so that I could build a website

05:42:05.480 --> 05:42:08.280
and put all these stories on the website.

05:42:08.280 --> 05:42:09.320
So I start putting the website,

05:42:09.320 --> 05:42:10.640
and I don't know what I'm doing, man.

05:42:10.640 --> 05:42:13.440
I mean, I put them on the website slowly.

05:42:13.440 --> 05:42:14.400
It takes forever.

05:42:15.800 --> 05:42:17.000
Putting pictures up.

05:42:17.000 --> 05:42:21.560
I'm trying to figure out how Photoshop works,

05:42:21.560 --> 05:42:23.000
how all this stuff.

05:42:24.120 --> 05:42:26.240
The whole time I was, I wanted to start,

05:42:26.240 --> 05:42:27.200
cause everybody, the last one,

05:42:27.200 --> 05:42:28.040
I was just getting out of prison.

05:42:28.040 --> 05:42:29.000
Everybody kept telling me like,

05:42:29.000 --> 05:42:30.240
bro, you gotta start a podcast.

05:42:30.240 --> 05:42:32.480
You gotta start a true crime podcast.

05:42:32.480 --> 05:42:34.320
And I don't know what a podcast is.

05:42:34.320 --> 05:42:37.560
The term podcast came into existence in 2009

05:42:37.560 --> 05:42:39.600
when I'd been locked up three years.

05:42:39.600 --> 05:42:41.640
I'd never been on YouTube.

05:42:41.640 --> 05:42:42.960
So by the time I get out,

05:42:44.160 --> 05:42:46.080
the last year or two,

05:42:46.080 --> 05:42:47.920
guys are coming up to me giving me magazines

05:42:47.920 --> 05:42:49.760
like this is what a podcast, you need to read.

05:42:49.760 --> 05:42:51.880
Look, true crime's huge.

05:42:51.880 --> 05:42:53.600
And you have to think, guys are asking me

05:42:53.600 --> 05:42:56.160
every couple of days, Cox, you got any stories?

05:42:56.160 --> 05:42:59.080
And I'm like, yeah, did you read Cash and Coke?

05:42:59.080 --> 05:43:02.200
And they're like, is that the one where the guys

05:43:02.200 --> 05:43:03.440
are robbing the drug dealer?

05:43:03.440 --> 05:43:05.160
Yeah, I don't know, I read that one.

05:43:05.160 --> 05:43:06.000
Did you read this one?

05:43:06.000 --> 05:43:06.840
No, no, no, I haven't read that.

05:43:06.840 --> 05:43:07.680
That's the one with the guy.

05:43:07.680 --> 05:43:08.600
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:43:08.600 --> 05:43:10.520
So I'm giving these little stories

05:43:10.520 --> 05:43:12.120
and then they'd come back and give them to me.

05:43:12.120 --> 05:43:14.880
You know, you don't have anything in there, right?

05:43:14.880 --> 05:43:17.400
So this is guys that would never read

05:43:17.400 --> 05:43:19.200
in their life or reading.

05:43:19.200 --> 05:43:22.840
And I'm writing about the guy in B2,

05:43:22.840 --> 05:43:25.040
the guy in C1.

05:43:25.040 --> 05:43:28.840
So I put up the whole thing and they're,

05:43:28.840 --> 05:43:29.920
well, anyway, they're all telling me,

05:43:29.920 --> 05:43:31.680
do a true crime podcast, true crime podcast.

05:43:31.680 --> 05:43:32.640
I don't really know what that is,

05:43:32.640 --> 05:43:35.280
but by now I'm starting to listen to them on YouTube,

05:43:35.280 --> 05:43:38.800
you know, a serial and a cold case files,

05:43:38.800 --> 05:43:40.560
you know, that kind of stuff.

05:43:40.560 --> 05:43:41.880
And I think that's what I wanna do.

05:43:41.880 --> 05:43:45.320
Well, my buddy Trion says there's a guy named Danny Jones

05:43:46.200 --> 05:43:48.320
that runs a podcast called Concrete

05:43:48.320 --> 05:43:50.040
and it's in St. Petersburg

05:43:50.040 --> 05:43:51.960
and he lives a couple of miles from me.

05:43:51.960 --> 05:43:53.960
I see him all the time.

05:43:53.960 --> 05:43:55.960
And I went, okay.

05:43:55.960 --> 05:43:57.800
And he said, you should email him.

05:43:57.800 --> 05:44:00.080
He's got a guy on there all the time that does real estate.

05:44:00.080 --> 05:44:01.320
And I go, I just got out of prison

05:44:01.320 --> 05:44:03.920
for bank fraud related to real estate.

05:44:03.920 --> 05:44:05.880
He doesn't wanna interview me.

05:44:05.880 --> 05:44:07.960
He goes, well, you could, maybe he does.

05:44:07.960 --> 05:44:10.400
Maybe you could ask him about starting a podcast.

05:44:12.080 --> 05:44:12.920
Okay.

05:44:12.920 --> 05:44:14.760
So I sent him an email.

05:44:14.760 --> 05:44:17.080
I remember Danny called me and he said,

05:44:17.080 --> 05:44:17.920
hey, is this Matt Cost?

05:44:17.920 --> 05:44:19.160
I was like, yeah, this is Matt.

05:44:19.160 --> 05:44:20.040
He's like, I got your email.

05:44:20.040 --> 05:44:20.880
This is Danny Jones.

05:44:20.880 --> 05:44:21.840
And I was like, okay.

05:44:23.040 --> 05:44:26.040
And he says, he says, yeah, I got your email, bro.

05:44:26.040 --> 05:44:27.760
He was like, this is a good fucking email.

05:44:27.760 --> 05:44:29.440
And I was like, what?

05:44:29.440 --> 05:44:31.080
He goes, I get a lot of emails, bro.

05:44:31.080 --> 05:44:32.920
He said, that is a good one.

05:44:32.920 --> 05:44:33.760
He said, that was really good.

05:44:33.760 --> 05:44:35.760
Like, I mean, that was well-written.

05:44:35.760 --> 05:44:38.720
He's like, I immediately knew I had to talk to you.

05:44:38.720 --> 05:44:39.920
And I said, oh, okay.

05:44:39.920 --> 05:44:42.320
I said, cause you know, I start off with,

05:44:42.320 --> 05:44:44.320
I think I started off with, hey, my name is Matt Cox

05:44:44.320 --> 05:44:45.800
and I'm a con man.

05:44:45.800 --> 05:44:48.240
I was recently released from federal prison.

05:44:48.240 --> 05:44:50.920
And so he was like, oh yeah, I mean, who says that?

05:44:50.920 --> 05:44:54.120
So anyway, he said, well, what's going on?

05:44:54.120 --> 05:44:55.680
I said, well, and I tell him what's going on.

05:44:55.680 --> 05:44:57.120
I wanna start a podcast, blah, blah, blah.

05:44:57.400 --> 05:45:00.000
And you know, Danny, he listens to me for 30 minutes

05:45:00.000 --> 05:45:02.000
to an hour and I've heard this and this and he's like,

05:45:02.000 --> 05:45:04.720
yeah, well, he's, you know, YouTube's not really like that.

05:45:04.720 --> 05:45:06.120
And that's not really how we do it.

05:45:06.120 --> 05:45:07.560
And you know, I don't know that you're,

05:45:07.560 --> 05:45:09.200
you're gonna have to get a production company

05:45:09.200 --> 05:45:10.040
and blah, blah, blah.

05:45:10.040 --> 05:45:11.680
He goes, but you know what?

05:45:11.680 --> 05:45:13.400
What you really need to do is to see if people

05:45:13.400 --> 05:45:15.560
are even interested in you or your story

05:45:15.560 --> 05:45:19.120
or you're able to talk, you should come on my show.

05:45:19.120 --> 05:45:22.120
You know, shameless, trying to get some content.

05:45:22.120 --> 05:45:24.560
Well, I mean, so as I told you offline,

05:45:24.560 --> 05:45:26.720
Danny and concrete podcast is really good.

05:45:26.720 --> 05:45:28.280
So people should definitely listen to it.

05:45:28.280 --> 05:45:29.120
Yeah.

05:45:29.120 --> 05:45:32.080
I mean, it turns out people do like listening to you.

05:45:32.080 --> 05:45:32.920
Turns out.

05:45:32.920 --> 05:45:35.520
I mean, you're good at telling stories.

05:45:35.520 --> 05:45:37.920
Well, anyway, by the time I got it,

05:45:37.920 --> 05:45:39.040
I couldn't do Danny's podcast.

05:45:39.040 --> 05:45:39.880
I was like, I can't do it, bro.

05:45:39.880 --> 05:45:40.720
I'm in the halfway house.

05:45:40.720 --> 05:45:43.680
So maybe I get out of the halfway house

05:45:43.680 --> 05:45:44.960
and a couple months go by,

05:45:44.960 --> 05:45:47.480
just maybe two months, three months go by.

05:45:47.480 --> 05:45:49.240
And one day I get a phone call from Danny.

05:45:49.240 --> 05:45:50.680
He's like, bro, you're out of the halfway house, right?

05:45:50.680 --> 05:45:52.280
And I was like, cause I told him I got out in July.

05:45:52.280 --> 05:45:53.840
It was like October, November.

05:45:53.840 --> 05:45:54.920
I'm like, right?

05:45:54.920 --> 05:45:57.200
He's like, listen, I had a guest fall through.

05:45:57.200 --> 05:45:59.000
I got nobody.

05:45:59.000 --> 05:45:59.960
I need you to come on.

05:45:59.960 --> 05:46:02.200
I answered all your questions.

05:46:02.200 --> 05:46:05.480
You know, I'd call them five, six times, you know?

05:46:05.480 --> 05:46:08.000
I asked you said, and I was like, ah.

05:46:08.960 --> 05:46:11.560
I was like, oh, fuck it, I'll do it.

05:46:11.560 --> 05:46:14.040
That video got like a 2 million views.

05:46:14.040 --> 05:46:16.880
Then I did Patrick bet David flew me out.

05:46:16.880 --> 05:46:19.480
Then I did soft white underbelly.

05:46:19.480 --> 05:46:22.080
You know, then I did Vlad, then I did all like people started

05:46:22.080 --> 05:46:22.920
and I'm sorry.

05:46:22.920 --> 05:46:24.840
And then, you know, it just blew up.

05:46:25.760 --> 05:46:27.320
And then people started asking me to come and, you know,

05:46:27.320 --> 05:46:30.400
talk for no reason, which was crazy.

05:46:30.400 --> 05:46:31.360
But you were saying, I'm sorry.

05:46:31.360 --> 05:46:33.640
Is your dad still with us?

05:46:33.640 --> 05:46:37.280
No, he died when I was in prison.

05:46:38.720 --> 05:46:39.840
He came to see me.

05:46:41.040 --> 05:46:43.200
Yeah, he came to see me two or three times.

05:46:43.200 --> 05:46:46.480
When is the first time he found out

05:46:46.480 --> 05:46:48.920
that you were doing fraud?

05:46:48.920 --> 05:46:50.840
The first time I got in trouble.

05:46:50.840 --> 05:46:51.680
When you got the probation?

05:46:51.680 --> 05:46:56.320
Because I had, you know, I had to kind of explain

05:46:57.960 --> 05:47:01.360
that, you know, like something's happening.

05:47:01.360 --> 05:47:03.600
I didn't want him to hear from anybody else.

05:47:03.600 --> 05:47:07.080
So you talked to him directly about it?

05:47:08.720 --> 05:47:09.760
Super disappointed.

05:47:11.000 --> 05:47:14.880
Did he ever tell you he loves you after that?

05:47:14.880 --> 05:47:19.680
So after I got the 26 years and the government decided

05:47:19.720 --> 05:47:21.640
that they weren't going to indict anybody.

05:47:22.920 --> 05:47:24.720
And I really was like, wow, this is it.

05:47:24.720 --> 05:47:25.560
Like you're done.

05:47:25.560 --> 05:47:28.360
He came to see me, but just by himself.

05:47:28.360 --> 05:47:32.440
And I remember he, I remember when he came to see me,

05:47:34.560 --> 05:47:36.960
I, you know, he was by, it was by himself.

05:47:36.960 --> 05:47:38.360
Like he never came by himself.

05:47:38.360 --> 05:47:42.560
So I remember thinking, my mom, something happened to my mom.

05:47:42.560 --> 05:47:44.440
And as soon as I walked in, you know, he walked in,

05:47:44.440 --> 05:47:45.280
I go, what happened?

05:47:45.280 --> 05:47:46.120
I go, where's mom?

05:47:46.120 --> 05:47:48.000
And he goes, oh, she's fine, she's fine.

05:47:48.000 --> 05:47:49.800
And he sat down with me and he said,

05:47:51.240 --> 05:47:53.480
and I, he said, how are you doing?

05:47:53.480 --> 05:47:55.720
I was like, I'm good.

05:47:55.720 --> 05:47:59.520
And he was just like, you know, he was getting sick.

05:47:59.520 --> 05:48:00.480
He was getting older.

05:48:01.400 --> 05:48:04.360
So, you know, we talked for a little bit

05:48:04.360 --> 05:48:05.760
just about the situation.

05:48:05.760 --> 05:48:06.600
And I was like, yeah.

05:48:06.600 --> 05:48:07.440
And he's like, well, what are you going to do?

05:48:07.440 --> 05:48:09.080
And I was like, you know, there's nothing I can do.

05:48:09.080 --> 05:48:11.320
Like everybody, I've called multiple attorneys.

05:48:11.320 --> 05:48:12.440
I've talked to people.

05:48:12.440 --> 05:48:14.160
There's nothing I can do.

05:48:14.160 --> 05:48:17.040
And he was like, you know,

05:48:17.040 --> 05:48:19.040
you're going to figure it out.

05:48:19.040 --> 05:48:20.040
You know, he was,

05:48:22.960 --> 05:48:27.480
he said, you're clever and you're smart

05:48:27.480 --> 05:48:32.240
and you're going to, you're not going to do all of that time.

05:48:32.240 --> 05:48:34.560
And I was like, I'm done.

05:48:35.520 --> 05:48:36.880
It's over.

05:48:38.040 --> 05:48:40.840
I'm going to get out of here when I'm 60,

05:48:40.840 --> 05:48:42.520
if I behave myself.

05:48:42.520 --> 05:48:45.800
And if I don't, I'll be 64.

05:48:48.320 --> 05:48:50.520
And he was like, that's not going to happen.

05:48:51.760 --> 05:48:52.600
And,

05:48:56.960 --> 05:49:01.960
so he said, I think that was the first time he,

05:49:03.480 --> 05:49:05.160
you know, I knew he was proud of me

05:49:05.160 --> 05:49:08.680
when I was making money, but he never said it.

05:49:08.680 --> 05:49:11.360
You know, you got the look like he was like impressed,

05:49:12.280 --> 05:49:13.760
but we were sitting there.

05:49:15.000 --> 05:49:17.240
And he said, I remember he said,

05:49:17.240 --> 05:49:20.160
cause it's the only time I can ever remember him saying

05:49:20.160 --> 05:49:21.200
he was proud of me.

05:49:22.320 --> 05:49:26.400
And I remember he said, you're going to figure this out.

05:49:26.400 --> 05:49:30.040
He said, I'm not proud of where you ended up,

05:49:31.200 --> 05:49:34.640
but you've done amazing things.

05:49:34.640 --> 05:49:36.680
You know, I wish you'd use your talents

05:49:36.680 --> 05:49:38.360
for something different,

05:49:38.360 --> 05:49:41.520
but you've done things that I could have never done.

05:49:41.520 --> 05:49:46.200
And you've led an amazing, adventurous life.

05:49:46.200 --> 05:49:47.360
And I'm proud of you.

05:49:50.240 --> 05:49:51.680
And that, you know.

05:49:51.680 --> 05:49:53.080
I wish he could see you now.

05:49:55.600 --> 05:49:59.160
My mom, I know my mom saw me.

05:49:59.160 --> 05:50:02.360
My mom's funny because my mom came to see me.

05:50:02.360 --> 05:50:03.480
My mom's a gangster.

05:50:04.440 --> 05:50:08.440
My mom came to see me every two weeks for 13 years.

05:50:08.440 --> 05:50:12.720
She missed about a month and a half when she had a stroke

05:50:13.680 --> 05:50:15.640
and ended up in a wheelchair.

05:50:15.640 --> 05:50:17.520
And then she came in the wheelchair

05:50:17.520 --> 05:50:19.720
and she would make my brother bring her.

05:50:20.560 --> 05:50:21.880
My brother and sister would be like,

05:50:21.880 --> 05:50:23.160
mom, are you sure you want to go?

05:50:23.160 --> 05:50:26.080
Like, you know, it's so hard to,

05:50:26.080 --> 05:50:28.160
it's such a long drive and you get so tired.

05:50:28.160 --> 05:50:29.560
Well, I'll sleep in the car.

05:50:30.720 --> 05:50:31.880
I know, but you know,

05:50:32.440 --> 05:50:34.160
I know, but you know,

05:50:34.160 --> 05:50:35.320
then we have to wait in that,

05:50:35.320 --> 05:50:38.640
that library, that the, you know, in that,

05:50:38.640 --> 05:50:41.000
the waiting area, you know, forever.

05:50:41.000 --> 05:50:41.840
And it takes forever.

05:50:41.840 --> 05:50:43.840
Well, I'm in the wheelchair, so I'm fine.

05:50:44.840 --> 05:50:48.040
Well, I know, but it's such a pain to get in and out

05:50:48.040 --> 05:50:48.880
and then in and out.

05:50:48.880 --> 05:50:49.720
And she was like, she was,

05:50:49.720 --> 05:50:51.840
I'm going to see my son and you're taking me.

05:50:51.840 --> 05:50:56.040
I mean, she, yeah.

05:50:56.040 --> 05:51:00.520
So I, so she, yeah, she was, she was something else.

05:51:01.240 --> 05:51:04.640
And I always say, you know,

05:51:06.520 --> 05:51:08.120
like if I had to say,

05:51:12.400 --> 05:51:15.000
you know, I don't think about all the things I did

05:51:15.000 --> 05:51:15.840
to get out.

05:51:15.840 --> 05:51:17.280
Like, I know, you know, there's all these guys that are,

05:51:17.280 --> 05:51:19.760
you know, like, you know, oh, I wouldn't have done that.

05:51:19.760 --> 05:51:22.000
I would have been a standup guy and I'd have been,

05:51:22.000 --> 05:51:24.360
well, good for fucking you, bro.

05:51:24.360 --> 05:51:25.880
I wanted to get out.

05:51:25.880 --> 05:51:27.200
I wanted out.

05:51:27.240 --> 05:51:32.240
And the icing on the cake of me getting out

05:51:33.440 --> 05:51:37.520
and I would have cut every motherfucker's head

05:51:37.520 --> 05:51:39.160
in that prison off.

05:51:42.040 --> 05:51:46.760
I was able to get out just in time

05:51:46.760 --> 05:51:51.760
to spend the last year and a half

05:51:52.280 --> 05:51:54.160
of my mother's life with her.

05:51:55.160 --> 05:51:58.600
I saw her two or three times a week,

05:51:58.600 --> 05:52:00.200
took her to dinner once a week,

05:52:02.760 --> 05:52:06.640
was able to go on walks with her in her wheelchair.

05:52:06.640 --> 05:52:08.360
I was sitting right next to her

05:52:08.360 --> 05:52:10.560
when she had her final stroke.

05:52:11.840 --> 05:52:16.840
I held her hand when she took her last breath.

05:52:16.840 --> 05:52:18.920
When she took her last breath.

05:52:21.840 --> 05:52:26.760
So if I have to be called a snitch the rest of my life,

05:52:26.760 --> 05:52:28.440
I don't give a fuck.

05:52:30.080 --> 05:52:33.800
Like, I may not deserve more, but she deserved more.

05:52:35.720 --> 05:52:36.960
Do you regret?

05:52:38.800 --> 05:52:41.000
So if you just look back, would you do it,

05:52:41.000 --> 05:52:43.880
would you do any part of your life different?

05:52:43.880 --> 05:52:46.320
Oh, I'd scrap all this, yeah.

05:52:47.160 --> 05:52:49.640
Yeah, I'd scrap all this to be,

05:52:49.640 --> 05:52:51.600
you always hear these guys say,

05:52:51.600 --> 05:52:55.080
I wouldn't change it because it made me the man I am today.

05:52:55.080 --> 05:53:00.080
The man I am today is a fucking 54 year old scumbag,

05:53:01.160 --> 05:53:05.160
multiple felons, starting my life over, broke,

05:53:07.920 --> 05:53:11.680
living off of scraps, trying to make YouTube work.

05:53:12.520 --> 05:53:17.520
Like, you know, I've got, you know, two dead parents,

05:53:19.120 --> 05:53:23.480
I'm divorced, I have a son that doesn't talk to me.

05:53:23.480 --> 05:53:27.840
I have a son that doesn't talk to me for good reason.

05:53:27.840 --> 05:53:32.840
Not because of a misunderstanding, because he understands.

05:53:34.280 --> 05:53:36.680
Like, he's, you can't even argue with him,

05:53:36.680 --> 05:53:37.920
he's got a powerful argument.

05:53:37.920 --> 05:53:39.480
Like, I don't wanna be a part of this guy's life,

05:53:39.480 --> 05:53:40.680
he's a scumbag.

05:53:40.720 --> 05:53:42.640
He stole money, he went on the run,

05:53:42.640 --> 05:53:47.000
he abandoned me when I was, you know, three years old.

05:53:47.000 --> 05:53:49.320
I don't want anything to do with him.

05:53:49.320 --> 05:53:53.680
Like, I get it, like I, you know,

05:53:53.680 --> 05:53:56.320
and I tried to, I've tried to do all the right things,

05:53:56.320 --> 05:53:58.880
you know, I wrote the letters, I drew him pictures,

05:53:58.880 --> 05:54:00.480
I've tried to call and it's not happening.

05:54:00.480 --> 05:54:04.800
Like, I would do anything to go back

05:54:04.800 --> 05:54:09.040
and just be that regular middle-class guy

05:54:09.040 --> 05:54:14.040
with the two kids and the wife working a regular job.

05:54:14.480 --> 05:54:19.040
You know, I, like, that's a good life.

05:54:19.040 --> 05:54:20.800
You know, those are, that's a good person.

05:54:20.800 --> 05:54:25.800
And, you know, I just made one arrogant decision

05:54:27.600 --> 05:54:30.960
after another, after another, until it snowballed

05:54:30.960 --> 05:54:32.880
and I couldn't take it back.

05:54:32.880 --> 05:54:35.160
And then I did everything I could.

05:54:35.200 --> 05:54:40.200
And if I wasn't the calculating,

05:54:41.440 --> 05:54:46.440
backstabbing, scumbag motherfucker that I can be,

05:54:46.760 --> 05:54:48.920
I'd be in prison right now.

05:54:48.920 --> 05:54:52.760
Sorry, you know, so yeah, yeah.

05:54:52.760 --> 05:54:55.040
I would much rather be a CPA right now.

05:54:55.920 --> 05:54:57.720
I would much rather, you know,

05:54:57.720 --> 05:54:59.720
should have stuck with being an insurance adjuster

05:54:59.720 --> 05:55:02.080
or something, I mean, you know.

05:55:02.080 --> 05:55:04.720
I never should have whited that 30-day lady out.

05:55:04.720 --> 05:55:06.800
Never, it was a mistake.

05:55:06.800 --> 05:55:07.960
That was your first mistake.

05:55:07.960 --> 05:55:09.800
That was a huge mistake.

05:55:09.800 --> 05:55:11.640
You think your son will forgive you?

05:55:11.640 --> 05:55:12.480
No.

05:55:13.760 --> 05:55:18.160
Unfortunately, according to my ex-wife

05:55:20.280 --> 05:55:21.640
and my sister and everybody,

05:55:21.640 --> 05:55:24.040
that he is a part of their lives.

05:55:24.040 --> 05:55:25.600
You know, and I've seen him, you know,

05:55:25.600 --> 05:55:28.680
my mother's funeral, I saw him, you know.

05:55:28.680 --> 05:55:31.360
I've seen him at several functions, you look across

05:55:31.360 --> 05:55:34.480
and he looks right through me.

05:55:39.320 --> 05:55:43.920
I think that he's, everybody says he's just like you.

05:55:43.920 --> 05:55:44.760
He's just like you.

05:55:44.760 --> 05:55:46.720
And everybody says I'm just like my dad.

05:55:47.920 --> 05:55:51.000
I've never smoked a cigarette.

05:55:51.000 --> 05:55:54.920
I've never drank alcohol, not a drop,

05:55:54.920 --> 05:55:59.920
never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic

05:55:59.920 --> 05:56:03.840
and my dad smoked two packs a day

05:56:03.840 --> 05:56:07.200
and everything in our house reeked of nicotine

05:56:07.200 --> 05:56:08.600
and I've never smoked.

05:56:08.600 --> 05:56:10.160
And my dad was a pill head.

05:56:10.160 --> 05:56:12.800
He was always on some kind of prescription medication.

05:56:12.800 --> 05:56:16.400
He was, you know, and I didn't wanna be that person.

05:56:16.400 --> 05:56:20.440
And like one day I drew a line in the sand

05:56:20.440 --> 05:56:21.440
and I wouldn't do it.

05:56:22.680 --> 05:56:25.200
And I think he's drawn a line in the sand

05:56:25.200 --> 05:56:27.800
and he's decided, you know,

05:56:27.800 --> 05:56:29.520
this is the hill I'm gonna die on

05:56:30.080 --> 05:56:31.240
and I'm not gonna back off it.

05:56:31.240 --> 05:56:34.920
And the thing is my ex-wife tells him this,

05:56:34.920 --> 05:56:35.880
he's a good person.

05:56:35.880 --> 05:56:38.480
You should be in his life.

05:56:38.480 --> 05:56:42.120
His father, cause he was adopted when I was in prison,

05:56:42.120 --> 05:56:43.600
they adopted him.

05:56:43.600 --> 05:56:47.040
Nick is his, you know, his dad.

05:56:47.040 --> 05:56:49.320
Nick has told him, Nick came to see me

05:56:49.320 --> 05:56:50.720
when I was in prison.

05:56:50.720 --> 05:56:51.920
You know, Nick has told him like,

05:56:51.920 --> 05:56:54.720
hey, this is a mistake.

05:56:54.720 --> 05:56:55.800
You're making a mistake.

05:56:55.800 --> 05:56:58.400
Nick, everybody that knows me, knows him.

05:56:58.440 --> 05:57:00.560
And he said, he has said no.

05:57:00.560 --> 05:57:02.960
So I fully believe it's no.

05:57:02.960 --> 05:57:04.560
I mean, I hope it's not.

05:57:04.560 --> 05:57:06.000
Well, I hope he forgives you.

05:57:06.000 --> 05:57:08.680
I think there's a lot of good in you

05:57:08.680 --> 05:57:10.760
despite you calling yourself a scumbag

05:57:10.760 --> 05:57:12.240
over and over in this podcast.

05:57:12.240 --> 05:57:13.360
I keep bothering you.

05:57:13.360 --> 05:57:14.720
You mentioned that earlier.

05:57:16.720 --> 05:57:19.160
What advice would you give to young people

05:57:19.160 --> 05:57:21.760
given that you've lived quite a non-standard life?

05:57:22.680 --> 05:57:23.840
What advice would you give them

05:57:23.840 --> 05:57:25.880
how to live a life they can be proud of?

05:57:26.840 --> 05:57:31.840
I mean, it's, I'm in a position

05:57:31.840 --> 05:57:33.120
that anybody would listen to me.

05:57:33.120 --> 05:57:36.320
But I, cause to me, and I don't have any advice

05:57:36.320 --> 05:57:38.760
that I don't think a father would give you.

05:57:38.760 --> 05:57:42.280
And it's like, work hard, be appreciative.

05:57:42.280 --> 05:57:43.840
I mean, things are so good out here.

05:57:43.840 --> 05:57:45.840
I hear people complain all the time.

05:57:45.840 --> 05:57:47.840
And I think a huge part of just being happy

05:57:47.840 --> 05:57:48.800
is being appreciative.

05:57:48.800 --> 05:57:50.600
Like I didn't appreciate anything.

05:57:50.600 --> 05:57:52.240
When I had, this is so cliche,

05:57:52.240 --> 05:57:54.400
but when I had all the money in the world,

05:57:54.920 --> 05:57:57.160
I was miserable.

05:57:58.160 --> 05:58:00.240
But when I got out with nothing,

05:58:00.240 --> 05:58:04.840
I was happier in prison with nothing

05:58:04.840 --> 05:58:09.200
than I was with two or $3 million prior to prison.

05:58:09.200 --> 05:58:11.240
And driving, dating a chick

05:58:11.240 --> 05:58:13.200
I was never should have been dating.

05:58:13.200 --> 05:58:16.520
Driving a sports car, vacationing all over the world.

05:58:16.520 --> 05:58:17.440
Miserable.

05:58:19.400 --> 05:58:21.520
I'm crying driving away from prison

05:58:21.520 --> 05:58:23.280
because I already missed my friends.

05:58:24.520 --> 05:58:26.960
You could have never told me that was gonna happen.

05:58:26.960 --> 05:58:30.240
Turns out money in fact does not buy happiness.

05:58:30.240 --> 05:58:32.720
No, and I know, and it is such a cliche, right?

05:58:32.720 --> 05:58:34.600
But it's so true.

05:58:34.600 --> 05:58:37.600
Crying, driving away from prison, yeah.

05:58:37.600 --> 05:58:38.440
You know what?

05:58:39.600 --> 05:58:43.240
I met my wife in the halfway house.

05:58:44.920 --> 05:58:47.560
So she had just gotten out of prison.

05:58:47.560 --> 05:58:48.760
She was in the halfway house with me.

05:58:48.760 --> 05:58:52.000
She just did five years for like a meth conspiracy.

05:58:52.000 --> 05:58:55.120
I never would have met her if I hadn't gone to prison.

05:58:55.120 --> 05:58:58.360
And now your date night is hunting alligators together.

05:58:58.360 --> 05:59:01.880
Yeah, that was like a month or so ago.

05:59:01.880 --> 05:59:03.280
This is Florida folks.

05:59:05.400 --> 05:59:07.800
This is what bad-ass people do in Florida.

05:59:07.800 --> 05:59:11.960
My wife is a former, she used to,

05:59:11.960 --> 05:59:14.360
so she was an MP in the military.

05:59:14.360 --> 05:59:17.640
She was, she did, she hunted,

05:59:17.640 --> 05:59:22.640
she ran a hog hunting tour guide service for six years.

05:59:24.560 --> 05:59:26.840
Went to prison for five years, got out,

05:59:26.840 --> 05:59:29.760
and then now she's a marine mechanic.

05:59:30.960 --> 05:59:33.600
And yeah, our date night, the other night was,

05:59:33.600 --> 05:59:34.760
we went in the middle of the night,

05:59:34.760 --> 05:59:36.840
went to Lake Okeechobee and went hog,

05:59:36.840 --> 05:59:38.360
I went to alligator hunting.

05:59:38.360 --> 05:59:41.400
Yeah, and if I may say so, she's quite beautiful.

05:59:41.400 --> 05:59:43.560
Thank you, and I did nice.

05:59:44.720 --> 05:59:46.360
She didn't wanna date me in the halfway house too.

05:59:46.360 --> 05:59:48.080
I kept saying, I feel like you're sweet on me.

05:59:48.080 --> 05:59:50.360
She's like, I'm not, I'm not.

05:59:50.360 --> 05:59:52.480
I make fun of guys like you, you're a city boy.

05:59:52.480 --> 05:59:54.400
I'm like, I don't know, I feel like.

05:59:54.400 --> 05:59:55.920
Well, you wore her down.

05:59:55.920 --> 05:59:58.520
I guess that's just right, exactly what I did.

05:59:58.520 --> 06:00:00.880
Yeah, it's that charisma.

06:00:00.880 --> 06:00:02.080
It always works.

06:00:02.080 --> 06:00:04.280
Well, Matt, thank you for being so honest.

06:00:04.280 --> 06:00:05.960
Thank you for being who you are.

06:00:05.960 --> 06:00:07.720
I do think there's a lot of good in you,

06:00:07.720 --> 06:00:08.920
and thank you for telling your story

06:00:08.920 --> 06:00:11.320
and the story of others who have,

06:00:14.200 --> 06:00:15.960
who've made mistakes in their life.

06:00:16.520 --> 06:00:17.480
Thank you for talking today.

06:00:17.480 --> 06:00:19.480
I appreciate you having me on.

06:00:19.480 --> 06:00:21.600
That was a really short conversation.

06:00:23.680 --> 06:00:25.120

from Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather.

06:00:36.960 --> 06:00:40.600
