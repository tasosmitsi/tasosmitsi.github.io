00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
remember George Washington, you know how he died? Well,

00:02.600 --> 00:04.640
meaning physicians bled him to death.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.800
And this was the most important patient in the country,

00:08.320 --> 00:10.840
maybe in the history of the country. And it's,

00:10.880 --> 00:13.240
and we bled him to death trying to help him.

00:13.640 --> 00:18.400
So when you're actually inflating the money supply at 7%,

00:18.440 --> 00:22.200
but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy,

00:22.840 --> 00:27.280
you're literally bleeding the free market to death.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.200
But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he thought that

00:32.200 --> 00:36.160
they were going to do him good. And the majority of,

00:36.240 --> 00:39.840
of the society, most companies, most,

00:39.840 --> 00:44.400
most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,

00:44.440 --> 00:49.000
they go along with this because they think that someone has their best

00:49.040 --> 00:53.960
interests at mind. And the people that are bleeding them to death believe they,

00:54.040 --> 00:57.400
they believe that prescription because their mental models are just so

00:57.400 --> 00:58.240
defective.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.560
The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.360
one of the most prominent and brilliant Bitcoin proponents in the world.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.400
He is the CEO of MicroStrategy, founder of Saylor Academy,

01:11.760 --> 01:13.360
graduate of MIT.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.200
And Michael was one of the most fascinating and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten

01:18.200 --> 01:19.680
a chance to explore ideas with.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.320
He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives of human civilization and

01:24.320 --> 01:29.320
human history and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.280
markets, governments, and financial systems.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.720
This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it,

01:35.960 --> 01:40.120
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends,

01:40.480 --> 01:42.240
here's Michael Saylor.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.520
Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.640
When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems,

01:50.680 --> 01:55.680
let's say five to 10 centuries from now look back at earth on this early 21st

01:57.000 --> 01:57.840
century,

01:58.160 --> 02:03.160
how much do you think they would say we understood about money and economics or

02:03.840 --> 02:07.200
even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.680
consciousness, all the big interesting questions?

02:12.200 --> 02:15.800
I think they would probably give us a

02:17.840 --> 02:21.320
B minus on engineering, on all the engineering things.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.240
The hard sciences, a passing grade, like we're, we're doing okay.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.280
We're working our way through rockets and jets and electric cars and

02:30.960 --> 02:36.000
electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the

02:36.000 --> 02:38.680
like. And, and you know, if you,

02:38.880 --> 02:43.920
if you look at the walls that grace the great court at

02:43.920 --> 02:46.920
MIT, it's full of all the great thinkers and,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.200
and they're all pretty admirable. You know,

02:49.960 --> 02:54.480
if you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madam Curie or

02:54.960 --> 02:58.800
Einstein, you know, you would respect them.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.920
I would say they'd give us like a, a D minus on economics,

03:04.840 --> 03:07.920
like, you know, an F plus or a D minus.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.040
You see, I have an optimistic vision. First of all,

03:10.080 --> 03:13.760
optimistic vision of engineering because everybody you've listed,

03:14.440 --> 03:15.280
not everybody,

03:15.280 --> 03:19.800
most people you've listed is just over the past couple of centuries and maybe

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200
stretches a little farther back,

03:21.200 --> 03:25.280
but mostly all the cool stuff we've done in engineering is the past couple of

03:25.280 --> 03:26.120
centuries.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.640
I mean, Archimedes, you know, had his virtues. You know,

03:31.640 --> 03:35.640
I studied the history of science at MIT and I also studied aerospace engineering

03:35.920 --> 03:39.800
and, and so I clearly have a bias in favor of science.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.600
And if I look at the past 10,000 years and I consider all of the

03:44.640 --> 03:49.120
philosophy and the politics and their impact on the human condition,

03:49.880 --> 03:53.520
I think it's a wash for every politician that came up with a good idea.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.640
Another politician came up with a bad idea, right?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.400
And it's not clear to me that, you know,

03:59.400 --> 04:02.640
most of the political and philosophical, you know,

04:03.080 --> 04:04.600
contributions to the,

04:04.680 --> 04:08.600
to the human race and the human conditions have advanced so much. I mean,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.640
we're still taking, you know,

04:10.680 --> 04:15.600
taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and Plato and Seneca

04:15.640 --> 04:19.760
and the like. And, and on the other hand, you know,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.640
if you think about what has made the human condition better,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.480
fire, water,

04:28.360 --> 04:32.640
harnessing of wind energy, like try to row across an ocean,

04:33.120 --> 04:34.360
right? Not easy.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.280
And for people who are just listening or watching,

04:37.600 --> 04:42.200
there's a beautiful, sexy ship from 16th and 17th century.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.160
This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century

04:46.600 --> 04:47.560
sailing ship,

04:47.560 --> 04:52.440
which is of the type that the Dutch East India's company used to sail the

04:52.440 --> 04:55.960
world and trade. So that was made, you know,

04:56.160 --> 04:59.440
the original is made sometime in the 1600s.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.560
And then this model is made in the 19th century by individuals.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.640
Both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.160
And just imagine just like rock is flying out to space,

05:10.160 --> 05:13.560
how much hope this filled people with exploring the unknown,

05:13.920 --> 05:15.080
going into the mystery,

05:17.080 --> 05:21.000
both the entrepreneurs and the business people and the engineers and just

05:21.000 --> 05:24.480
humans, what's out there, what's out there to be discovered.

05:24.840 --> 05:29.600
The metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon,

05:29.600 --> 05:33.680
risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.480
In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.800
During the Revolutionary War, you know,

05:43.800 --> 05:47.920
while our founding fathers were fighting to establish, you know, life,

05:47.920 --> 05:50.440
liberty, pursuit of happiness, the constitution,

05:50.880 --> 05:53.800
average life expectancy of like 32,

05:54.360 --> 05:56.160
so between 32 and 36.

05:56.600 --> 06:01.000
So all the sound and the fury doesn't make you live past 32,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.160
but what does, right?

06:02.440 --> 06:06.560
Antibiotics, conquest of infectious diseases.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.400
If we understand the science of, of infectious disease,

06:11.040 --> 06:16.040
sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.840
And that happened fast, right?

06:18.840 --> 06:23.360
That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.920
And I think if you look, look at the human condition,

06:29.160 --> 06:32.120
you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually

06:32.120 --> 06:35.200
keep track of your Watts output when you're on that. Yeah.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.960
It's like 200 is a lot. Okay. 200 is a lot.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.480
So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy that a human,

06:45.520 --> 06:49.320
a trained athlete can deliver in a day.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.160
And probably not 1% of the people in the,

06:53.200 --> 06:56.160
in the world could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.640
And the commercial value of a kilowatt hour,

06:59.040 --> 07:04.040
the retail value is 11 cents today and the wholesale value is 2 cents.

07:05.560 --> 07:10.560
And so you have to look at the contribution of politicians and

07:11.160 --> 07:14.800
philosophers and economists to the human condition.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.680
And it's, it's like at best to wash one way or the other.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.160
And then if you look at the contribution of John D Rockefeller,

07:22.880 --> 07:26.440
when he delivered you a barrel of oil and the, you know,

07:26.440 --> 07:31.320
the energy and oil liquid energy or the contribution of Tesla,

07:32.440 --> 07:35.400
you know, as we delivered electricity, you know,

07:36.200 --> 07:40.880
and what's the impact on the human condition? If I have electric power,

07:41.240 --> 07:45.640
if I have chemical power, if I have wind energy, if I,

07:45.640 --> 07:48.880
if I can actually set up a reservoir, create a dam,

07:48.920 --> 07:53.920
spin a turbine and generate energy from a hydraulic source,

07:53.920 --> 07:56.200
that's extraordinary. Right. And,

07:56.320 --> 07:59.520
and so our ability to cross the ocean,

08:00.240 --> 08:04.120
our ability to grow food, our ability to live, it's,

08:04.120 --> 08:08.160
it's technology that gets the human race from, you know,

08:08.160 --> 08:13.160
a brutal life where life expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.400
You gave a D minus to the economists.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.840
So are they too like the politicians to watch?

08:21.880 --> 08:26.880
In terms of there's good ideas and bad ideas and in that tiny Delta between

08:26.880 --> 08:31.880
good and bad is how you squeak past the F plus onto the D minus territory.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.880
I think most economic ideas are bad ideas, like, you know,

08:37.880 --> 08:42.880
like, take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem,

08:42.880 --> 08:47.880
like, like design the shape of the hull of that ship or you want to design the

08:47.880 --> 08:52.880
airfoil, a wing, or if you want to design an engine or a,

08:52.880 --> 08:55.880
a nozzle in a rocket ship,

08:56.880 --> 08:58.880
you wouldn't do it with simple arithmetic.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
You wouldn't do it with a scalar. There's not a single number, right?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.880
It's vector, it's vector math, you know,

09:04.880 --> 09:09.880
computational fluid dynamics is in dimensional higher level math,

09:09.880 --> 09:11.880
you know, complicated stuff.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
So when you, when you,

09:14.880 --> 09:18.880
when an economist says the inflation rate is 2%, that's a scalar.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.880
And when an economist says,

09:21.880 --> 09:25.880
it's not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is

09:25.880 --> 09:29.880
very low. Monetary velocity is low. That's another scalar.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.880
Okay. So the truth of the matter is

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
inflation is not a scalar.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.880
Inflation is an in dimensional vector.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
Money velocity is not a scalar.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.880
The saying, what's the velocity of money?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.880
Oh, it's slow or it's fast.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.880
It ignores the question of what medium is the money moving through?

09:52.880 --> 09:56.880
And the same way that, you know, what's the speed of sound?

09:57.880 --> 09:59.880
Okay. Well, what is sound, right?

10:00.880 --> 10:04.880
Sound, you know, sound is a, is a compression wave.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.880
It's energy moving through a medium.

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
But the speed is different.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.880
So for example,

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
the speed of sound through air is different than the speed of sound through

10:12.880 --> 10:15.880
water and, and a sound was faster through water.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.880
It moves faster through a solid and it moves faster through a stiffer solid.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
So there isn't one.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.880
What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world

10:25.880 --> 10:27.880
down to a model? Is it too simple?

10:28.880 --> 10:31.880
Or is it just even the first principles of constructing the model is wrong?

10:31.880 --> 10:36.880
I think that the fundamental problem is if you see the world as a scalar,

10:36.880 --> 10:40.880
you simply pick the one number, which is,

10:40.880 --> 10:42.880
which supports whatever you want to do.

10:43.880 --> 10:48.880
And you ignore the universe of other consequences from your behavior.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.880
In general, I don't know if you've heard of,

10:53.880 --> 10:55.880
like Eric Watson has been talking about,

10:55.880 --> 10:56.880
this with gauge theory.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.880
So different, different kinds of approaches from the physics world,

11:00.880 --> 11:06.880
from the mathematical world to extend past this scalar view of economics.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.880
So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.880
Do you find that way of exploring economics interesting?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.880
So outside of cryptocurrency,

11:15.880 --> 11:17.880
outside of the extra technologies and so on,

11:17.880 --> 11:19.880
just analysis of how things work,

11:20.880 --> 11:21.880
how things work,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.880
cryptocurrency outside of the extra technologies and so on,

11:23.880 --> 11:26.880
just analysis of how economics works.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
Do you find that interesting?

11:29.880 --> 11:30.880
Yeah.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.880
I think that if we're going to want to really make any scientific progress in

11:34.880 --> 11:37.880
economics, we'll have to apply much,

11:37.880 --> 11:41.880
much more computationally intensive and richer forms of mathematics.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
So simulation perhaps, or?

11:44.880 --> 11:48.880
Yeah. You know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.880
You know, they taught it at the Sloan School.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.880
It was developed by Jay Forrester,

11:52.880 --> 11:58.880
who was an extraordinary computer scientist.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.880
And when we created models of economic behavior,

12:03.880 --> 12:07.880
they were all multi-dimensional nonlinear models.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.880
So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world,

12:12.880 --> 12:14.880
you have to start with the concept of feedback.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.880
If I double the price of something,

12:17.880 --> 12:22.880
demand will fall and attempts to create supply will increase.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.880
And there will be a delay before the capacity increases.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.880
There'll be an instant demand change,

12:29.880 --> 12:33.880
and there'll be rippling effects throughout every other segment of the economy

12:33.880 --> 12:36.880
downstream and upstream of such a thing.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.880
So it's kind of common sense, but most economics,

12:39.880 --> 12:42.880
most classical economics is always, you know,

12:42.880 --> 12:45.880
taught with linear models, you know,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.880
fairly simplistic linear models.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.880
And oftentimes even I'm really shocked today

12:51.880 --> 12:55.880
that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics

12:55.880 --> 12:59.880
has been captured by scalar arithmetic.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.880
For example, if you read, you know,

13:03.880 --> 13:06.880
read any article in New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, right,

13:06.880 --> 13:07.880
they just refer to it.

13:07.880 --> 13:13.880
There's an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation rate is X.

13:13.880 --> 13:18.880
And if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation,

13:18.880 --> 13:25.880
generally they're all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.880
And then they try to extrapolate from that and you just get nowhere with it.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.880
So at the very least,

13:33.880 --> 13:37.880
we should be considering inflation and other economics concept

13:37.880 --> 13:39.880
as a nonlinear dynamical system.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.880
So nonlinearity and also just embracing the full complexity

13:43.880 --> 13:46.880
of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation,

13:46.880 --> 13:49.880
maybe some have some interesting models around that.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.880
Wouldn't it be refreshing if somebody for once published a table

13:53.880 --> 13:56.880
of the change in price of every product, every service,

13:56.880 --> 14:00.880
and every asset in every place over time?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
You said table.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.880
Some of that also is the task of visualization,

14:04.880 --> 14:09.880
how to extract from this complex set of numbers patterns

14:09.880 --> 14:14.880
that somehow indicate something fundamental about what's happening.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.880
So summarization of data is still important,

14:18.880 --> 14:21.880
perhaps summarization not down to a single scale of value,

14:21.880 --> 14:24.880
but looking at that whole sea of numbers,

14:24.880 --> 14:29.880
you have to find patterns.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.880
Like what is inflation in a particular sector?

14:31.880 --> 14:36.880
Maybe change over time, maybe different geographical regions,

14:36.880 --> 14:38.880
things of that nature.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.880
I don't know even what that task is.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.880
You could look at machine learning.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.880
You can look at AI with that perspective,

14:46.880 --> 14:51.880
which is how do you represent what's happening efficiently,

14:51.880 --> 14:53.880
as efficiently as possible.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.880
That's never going to be a single number,

14:55.880 --> 14:58.880
but it might be a compressed model that captures something beautiful,

14:58.880 --> 15:01.880
something fundamental about what's happening.

15:01.880 --> 15:08.880
It's an opportunity for sure.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.880
If we take, for example, during the pandemic,

15:12.880 --> 15:19.880
the response of the political apparatus was to lower interest rates to zero

15:19.880 --> 15:23.880
and to start buying assets, in essence printing money.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.880
And the defense was there is no inflation.

15:27.880 --> 15:32.880
But of course you had one part of the economy where it was locked down,

15:32.880 --> 15:35.880
so it was illegal to buy anything.

15:35.880 --> 15:40.880
It was either illegal or it was impractical.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.880
So it would be impossible for demand to manifest,

15:43.880 --> 15:45.880
so of course there is no inflation.

15:45.880 --> 15:50.880
On the other hand, there was instantaneous immediate inflation

15:50.880 --> 15:52.880
in another part of the economy.

15:52.880 --> 15:57.880
For example, you lower the interest rates to zero.

15:57.880 --> 16:03.880
At one point we saw the swap rate on a 30-year note go to 72 basis points.

16:03.880 --> 16:08.880
That means that the value of a long-dated bond immediately inflates.

16:08.880 --> 16:16.880
So the bond market had hyperinflation within minutes of these financial decisions.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.880
The asset market had hyperinflation.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.880
We had what you call a K-shape recovery,

16:22.880 --> 16:25.880
what we affectionately call a K-shape recovery.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
Main Street shut down.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.880
Wall Street recovered all within six weeks.

16:29.880 --> 16:35.880
The inflation was in the assets, like in the stocks, in the bonds.

16:35.880 --> 16:40.880
If you look today, you see that a typical house,

16:40.880 --> 16:45.880
according to the K. Schiller index today, is up 19.2% year over year.

16:45.880 --> 16:51.880
So if you're a first-time home buyer, the inflation rate is 19%.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.880
The formal CPI announced a 7.9%.

16:56.880 --> 17:02.880
You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want

17:02.880 --> 17:08.880
by constructing a weighted basket of products or services or assets

17:08.880 --> 17:10.880
that yield you the answer.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.880
I think that the fundamental failing of economists is,

17:15.880 --> 17:22.880
first of all, they don't really have a term for asset inflation.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.880
What's asset hyperinflation?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.880
You mentioned bond market swap rate,

17:28.880 --> 17:33.880
and asset is where the majority of the hyperinflation happened.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.880
What's inflation? What's hyperinflation? What's an asset?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.880
What's an asset market?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.880
I'm going to ask so many dumb questions here.

17:40.880 --> 17:45.880
In the conventional economic world, you would treat inflation

17:45.880 --> 17:51.880
as the rate of increase in price of a market basket of consumer products,

17:51.880 --> 17:55.880
defined by a government agency.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.880
So they have traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying.

18:00.880 --> 18:08.880
The government selects toilet paper, food, toaster, refrigerated electronics,

18:08.880 --> 18:13.880
all that kind of stuff, and it's a representative basket of goods

18:13.880 --> 18:19.880
that lead to a content existence on this earth for a regular consumer.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.880
They define a synthetic metric.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.880
I'm going to say you should have a 1,000-square-foot apartment,

18:26.880 --> 18:32.880
and you should have a used car, and you should eat three hamburgers a week.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.880
Now 10 years go by, and the apartment costs more.

18:36.880 --> 18:41.880
I could adjust the market basket via hedonic adjustments.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.880
I could decide that it used to be in 1970 you needed 1,000 square feet,

18:45.880 --> 18:49.880
but in the year 2020 you only need 700 square feet,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.880
because we've miniaturized televisions,

18:52.880 --> 18:55.880
and we've got more efficient electric appliances,

18:55.880 --> 18:59.880
and because things have collapsed into the iPhone, you just don't need as much space.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.880
So now it may be that the apartment costs 50% more,

19:03.880 --> 19:06.880
but after the hedonic adjustment there is no inflation,

19:06.880 --> 19:10.880
because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have.

19:10.880 --> 19:16.880
So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.880
Pretty much.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.880
I guess my criticism of economists is,

19:21.880 --> 19:27.880
rather than embracing inflation based upon its fundamental idea,

19:27.880 --> 19:32.880
which is the rate at which the price of things go up,

19:32.880 --> 19:38.880
they've been captured by mainstream conventional thinking

19:38.880 --> 19:43.880
to immediately equate inflation to the government-issued CPI,

19:43.880 --> 19:47.880
or government-issued PCE, or government-issued PPI measure,

19:47.880 --> 19:50.880
which was never the rate at which things go up,

19:50.880 --> 19:56.880
it's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and services

19:56.880 --> 19:59.880
the government wishes to track go up.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.880
Now the problem with that is two big things.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.880
One thing is the government gets to create the market basket,

20:07.880 --> 20:12.880
and so they keep changing what's in the basket over time.

20:12.880 --> 20:17.880
If I said three years ago you should go see ten concerts a year

20:17.880 --> 20:20.880
and the concert tickets now cost $200 each,

20:20.880 --> 20:23.880
now it's $2,000 a year to go see concerts,

20:23.880 --> 20:26.880
now I'm in charge of calculating inflation,

20:26.880 --> 20:32.880
so I redefine your entertainment quota for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts,

20:32.880 --> 20:35.880
and now they don't cost $2,000, they cost nothing,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.880
and there is no inflation, but you don't get your concerts.

20:38.880 --> 20:46.880
So the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket,

20:46.880 --> 20:49.880
but in my opinion that's not the biggest problem.

20:49.880 --> 20:59.880
The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren't products or services.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.880
Assets can't be inflated.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.880
What's an asset?

21:02.880 --> 21:15.880
A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond, a Bitcoin is an asset, or a Picasso painting.

21:15.880 --> 21:22.880
Not a consumable good, not an Apple that you can eat.

21:22.880 --> 21:29.880
Right. If I throw away an asset, then I'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it.

21:29.880 --> 21:34.880
So what happens if I change the policy such that, let's take the classic example,

21:34.880 --> 21:40.880
a million dollar bond at a 5% interest rate gives you $50,000 a year in risk-free income.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.880
You might retire on $50,000 a year in a low-cost jurisdiction.

21:45.880 --> 21:52.880
So the cost of Social Security or early retirement is $1 million when the interest rate is 5%.

21:52.880 --> 21:58.880
During the crisis of March of 2020, the interest rate on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.880
So now the cost of that bond is $10 million.

22:03.880 --> 22:08.880
The cost of Social Security went from $1 million to $10 million.

22:08.880 --> 22:15.880
So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money, and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after

22:15.880 --> 22:22.880
on a $50,000 salary, live in on a beach in Mexico, wherever you wanted to go, you had hyperinflation.

22:22.880 --> 22:29.880
The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of some amount of time.

22:29.880 --> 22:34.880
In fact, in that case, that was over the course of about 12 years.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.880
As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up.

22:38.880 --> 22:49.880
But the conventional view is, oh, that's not a problem because it's good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond.

22:49.880 --> 22:55.880
Or what's the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19%?

22:55.880 --> 23:02.880
It's an awful problem for a 22-year-old that's starting their first job that's saving money to buy a house.

23:02.880 --> 23:08.880
But it would be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say,

23:08.880 --> 23:15.880
well, housing asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation, and now the economy's got more wealth.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.880
And so that's viewed as a benefit.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.880
So what's being missed here?

23:23.880 --> 23:33.880
Like the suffering of the average person or the struggle, the suffering, the pain of the average person.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.880
Like metrics that captured that within the economic system.

23:37.880 --> 23:57.880
One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation as CPI understates the human misery that's inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies by the political class.

23:57.880 --> 24:02.880
And so it's a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the property class.

24:02.880 --> 24:10.880
It's a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed or the controlled market.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.880
It's a massive shift of power from the people to the government.

24:14.880 --> 24:24.880
And maybe one more illustrative point here, Alexis, is what do you think the inflation rate's been for the past 100 years?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.880
Are we talking about the scaler again?

24:27.880 --> 24:32.880
If you took a survey of everybody on the street and you asked them, what do they think inflation was?

24:32.880 --> 24:34.880
What is it?

24:34.880 --> 24:39.880
You remember when Jerome Powell said, our target's 2%, but we're not there.

24:39.880 --> 24:48.880
If you go around the corner, I have posted the deed to this house, sold in 1930.

24:48.880 --> 24:54.880
And the number on that deed is $100,000, 1930.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.880
And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z Estimate.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.880
Is it higher than that?

24:59.880 --> 25:02.880
$30,500,000.

25:02.880 --> 25:09.880
So that's 92 years, 1930 or 2022.

25:09.880 --> 25:16.880
And in 92 years, we've had 305X increase in price of the house.

25:16.880 --> 25:28.880
Now, if you actually calculate, you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate was approximately 6.5% a year, every year, for 92 years.

25:28.880 --> 25:40.880
And there's nobody, nobody in government, no conventional economist that would ever admit to an inflation rate of 7% a year in the US dollar over the last century.

25:40.880 --> 25:51.880
Now, if you dig deeper, I mean, one guy that's done a great job working on this is Seifedean Amos, who wrote the book, The Bitcoin Standard.

25:51.880 --> 26:01.880
And he notes that on average, it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about 7% a year, all the way up to the year 2020.

26:02.880 --> 26:11.880
If you look at the S&P index, which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks, it returned about 10%.

26:11.880 --> 26:18.880
If you talk to 10% a year for 100 years, the money supply is expanding at 7% a hundred years.

26:18.880 --> 26:29.880
If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you ask the question, how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year?

26:29.880 --> 26:39.880
Generally about 2% to 3%, like the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a 2.5%, 3% improvement a year.

26:39.880 --> 26:43.880
As measured by GDP. Are you okay with that?

26:43.880 --> 26:51.880
I'm not sure I'd go that far yet, but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff,

26:51.880 --> 26:56.880
And if you ask the question, how much more efficiently will we do this stuff next year than this year?

26:56.880 --> 27:03.880
Or what's the value of all of our innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months?

27:03.880 --> 27:08.880
You'd be hard pressed to say we get 2% better.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.880
Typical investor thinks they're 10% better every year.

27:12.880 --> 27:24.880
So if you look at what's going on, really when you're holding a million dollars of stocks and you're getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply.

27:24.880 --> 27:28.880
You're getting a 2 or 3% gain under best circumstances.

27:28.880 --> 27:38.880
And another way to say that is if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year, the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10%.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.880
It probably should be.

27:41.880 --> 27:46.880
Now that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions.

27:46.880 --> 27:53.880
Like if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands at 7 to 10% a year,

27:53.880 --> 28:02.880
And I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest, is that fair?

28:02.880 --> 28:06.880
And who suffered so that I could do that?

28:06.880 --> 28:14.880
Because in an environment where you're just inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant,

28:14.880 --> 28:22.880
it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply.

28:22.880 --> 28:28.880
And the difference in asset appreciation is going to be a function of the scarce desirable quality of the assets.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.880
And to what extent can I make more of them?

28:31.880 --> 28:36.880
And to what extent are they truly limited in supply?

28:36.880 --> 28:40.880
Yeah, so we'll get to a lot of the words you said there.

28:40.880 --> 28:48.880
The scarcity and so connected to how limited they are and the value of those assets.

28:48.880 --> 28:55.880
But you also said, so the expansion of the money supply, which is put another way, is printing money.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.880
And so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply?

28:59.880 --> 29:04.880
Just to put some terms on the table so we understand them.

29:04.880 --> 29:12.880
You nonchalantly say it's always on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding every year by 7%.

29:12.880 --> 29:16.880
That's a bad thing? That's universally a bad thing.

29:16.880 --> 29:22.880
It's awful. I guess to be precise, it's the currency.

29:23.880 --> 29:29.880
Money, I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.880
And the economic energy has to find its way into a medium.

29:33.880 --> 29:38.880
So if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange has to find its way into currency.

29:38.880 --> 29:43.880
But the money can also flow into property like a house or gold.

29:43.880 --> 29:49.880
If the money flows into property, it'll probably hold its value much better.

29:49.880 --> 29:58.880
If the money flows into currency, if you had put $100,000 in this house, you would have 305 X return over 92 years.

29:58.880 --> 30:03.880
But if you had put the money $100,000 in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement,

30:03.880 --> 30:10.880
you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth over the same time period.

30:11.880 --> 30:21.880
So the expansion of the currency creates a massive inefficiency in the society, what I'll call an adiabatic lapse.

30:21.880 --> 30:27.880
What we're doing is we're bleeding the civilization to death.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.880
What's the adiabatic, what's that word?

30:30.880 --> 30:32.880
Adiabatic lapse.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.880
Adiabatic.

30:33.880 --> 30:40.880
Right. In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with the phrase assume an adiabatic system.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.880
And what that means is a closed system.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.880
Okay.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.880
So I've got a container.

30:46.880 --> 30:51.880
And in that container, no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.880
So it's a closed system.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.880
So you got the closed system lapse.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.880
Okay.

30:58.880 --> 30:59.880
Okay, I'm going to use a...

30:59.880 --> 31:01.880
There's a leak in the ship.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.880
I'm going to use a physical metaphor for you because you're the jujitsu, right?

31:05.880 --> 31:08.880
Like you got 10 pints of blood in your body.

31:08.880 --> 31:14.880
And so before your next workout, I'm going to take one pint from you.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.880
Now you're going to go exercise, but you've lost 10% of your blood.

31:19.880 --> 31:20.880
Okay.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.880
You're not going to perform as well.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.880
It takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets.

31:26.880 --> 31:30.880
So what if I tell you every month you got to show up and I'm going to bleed you?

31:30.880 --> 31:31.880
Yeah.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
Okay.

31:32.880 --> 31:39.880
So if I'm draining the energy, I'm draining the blood from your body you can't perform.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.880
Adiabatic lapse is when you go up in altitude.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.880
Every thousand feet, you lose three degrees.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.880
You go 50,000 feet, you're 150 degrees colder than sea level.

31:49.880 --> 31:56.880
That's why you look at your instruments and instead of 80 degrees, you're minus 70 degrees.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.880
Why is the temperature falling?

31:58.880 --> 32:01.880
Temperature's falling because it's not a closed system.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
It's an open system.

32:02.880 --> 32:06.880
As the air expands, the density falls, right?

32:06.880 --> 32:16.880
The energy per cubic whatever, you know, falls and therefore the temperature falls, right?

32:16.880 --> 32:18.880
The heat's falling out of the solution.

32:18.880 --> 32:25.880
So when you're inflating, let's say you're inflating the currency supplied by 6%,

32:25.880 --> 32:34.880
you're sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is using to function.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.880
So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency, that's a nice way for the economy to function.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.880
It's the most kind of, it's being inefficient when you expand the money supply,

32:44.880 --> 32:50.880
but it's the liquid, I'm trying to find the right kind of adjective here.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.880
It's how you do transactions at a scale of billions.

32:54.880 --> 33:00.880
Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy around and you could use the dollar

33:00.880 --> 33:03.880
or you could use the peso or you could use the bolivar.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.880
Selling houses and buying houses is much more inefficient.

33:07.880 --> 33:13.880
Or like you can't transact between billions of people with houses.

33:13.880 --> 33:14.880
Yeah.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.880
Properties don't make such good mediums of exchange.

33:17.880 --> 33:27.880
They make better stores of value and they have utility value if it's a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn, right?

33:27.880 --> 33:33.880
Can I zoom out just for, can we zoom out, keep zooming out until we reach the origin of human civilization?

33:33.880 --> 33:41.880
But on the way, ask, you gave economists a D-, I'm not even going to ask you what you give to governments.

33:42.880 --> 33:51.880
Do you think their failure, economists and government failure is malevolence or incompetence?

33:51.880 --> 34:02.880
I think policymakers are well intentioned, but generally all government policy is inflationary and all government, it's inflammatory and inflationary.

34:02.880 --> 34:12.880
So what I mean by that is, when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy,

34:12.880 --> 34:23.880
if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy, a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy,

34:23.880 --> 34:38.880
every one of these medical policy, every one of these policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational actor from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way.

34:38.880 --> 34:43.880
So when you layer them on top of each other, they all have to be paid for.

34:43.880 --> 34:48.880
If you want to shut down the entire economy for a year, you have to pay for it, right?

34:48.880 --> 34:51.880
If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it, right?

34:51.880 --> 34:55.880
If you don't want to use oil or natural gas, you have to pay for it.

34:55.880 --> 35:02.880
If you don't want to manufacture semiconductors in China and you want to manufacture them in the US, you got to pay for it.

35:02.880 --> 35:17.880
If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of employees and then I unionize the employees, then not only am I, I idle the factory in the Far East, it goes to 50% capacity.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.880
So whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on.

35:21.880 --> 35:28.880
And then I drive up the cost of labor for every other manufacturer in the US because I competing against them, right?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.880
I'm changing that condition.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.880
So everything gets less efficient.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.880
Everything gets more expensive.

35:34.880 --> 35:41.880
And of course, the government couldn't really pay for its policies and its wars with taxes.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.880
We didn't pay for World War I with tax.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.880
We didn't pay for World War II with tax.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.880
We didn't pay for Vietnam with tax.

35:47.880 --> 35:53.880
In fact, when you trace this, what you realize is the government never pays for all of its policies with taxes.

35:53.880 --> 36:04.880
Because it's too painful to ask to raise the taxes to truly transparently pay for the things you're doing with taxes, with taxpayer money because they feel the pain.

36:04.880 --> 36:08.880
Either that's one interpretation or it's just too transparent.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.880
If people understood the true cost of war.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.880
They wouldn't want to go to war.

36:14.880 --> 36:31.880
If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets, you know, and 90% of everything you will be ever will be taken from you, you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy and you might not vote for that politician.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.880
But you're still saying incompetence, not malevolence.

36:34.880 --> 36:41.880
So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy of incompetence is kind of how you look at it.

36:41.880 --> 36:46.880
I think a lack of humility.

36:46.880 --> 36:50.880
If people had more humility than they would realize.

36:50.880 --> 36:56.880
Humility about how little they know, how little they understand about the function of complex systems.

36:56.880 --> 37:03.880
There's a phrase from Quinn Eastwood's movie Unforgiven where he says a man's got to know his limitations.

37:03.880 --> 37:17.880
I think that a lot of people overestimate what they can accomplish and experience in life causes you to reevaluate that.

37:17.880 --> 37:27.880
So, I mean, I've done a lot of things in my life and generally my mistakes were always my good ideas that I enthusiastically pursued.

37:27.880 --> 37:35.880
To the detriment of my great ideas that required 150% of my attention to prosper.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.880
So I think people pursue too many good ideas.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.880
You know, they all sound good, but there's just a limit to what you can accomplish.

37:44.880 --> 37:52.880
And everybody underestimates the challenges of implementing an idea.

37:52.880 --> 37:57.880
Right. And they always overestimate the benefits of the pursuit of that.

37:57.880 --> 38:04.880
And so I think it's an overconfidence that causes an over exuberance in pursuit of policies.

38:04.880 --> 38:12.880
And as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.880
You know, I could say the money supply, but let's say the currency supply.

38:16.880 --> 38:26.880
You can triple the number of pesos in the economy, but it doesn't triple the amount of manufacturing capacity in the set economy.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.880
And it doesn't triple the amount of assets in the economy, it just triples the pesos.

38:30.880 --> 38:41.880
So as you increase the currency supply, then the price of all those scarce desirable things will tend to go up rapidly.

38:41.880 --> 38:52.880
And the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations and the individual actors and trading partners will collapse.

38:52.880 --> 39:02.880
If we take a tangent on a tangent and we will return soon to the big human civilization question.

39:02.880 --> 39:12.880
So if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can't afford, what's the best form of government?

39:12.880 --> 39:22.880
Anarchism, libertarianism, so there's not even armies, there's no borders, that's anarchism.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.880
The least.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.880
The smallest possible.

39:26.880 --> 39:31.880
The best government would be the least and the debate will be over that.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.880
When you think about the stuff, do you think about, okay, government is the way it is.

39:35.880 --> 39:40.880
I, as a person that can generate great ideas, how do I operate in this world?

39:40.880 --> 39:42.880
Or do you also think about the big picture?

39:42.880 --> 39:50.880
If we start a new civilization somewhere on Mars, do you think about what's the ultimate form of government?

39:50.880 --> 39:58.880
What's at least a promising thing to try?

39:58.880 --> 40:05.880
You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.

40:05.880 --> 40:06.880
What does that mean?

40:06.880 --> 40:13.880
And the significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference.

40:13.880 --> 40:29.880
And if I look at the civilization, I would say half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective.

40:29.880 --> 40:34.880
Half. 50%. I don't know, it's worth $500 trillion worth of problems.

40:34.880 --> 40:48.880
Like money, money represents all the economic energy in the civilization and it kind of equates to all the products, all the services and all the assets that we have and we're ever going to have.

40:48.880 --> 41:04.880
So that's half. The other half of the problems in the civilization are medical and military and political and philosophical and natural.

41:04.880 --> 41:21.880
And I think that there are a lot of different solutions to all those problems and they're all honorable professions and they all merit a lifetime of consideration for the specialists in all those areas.

41:21.880 --> 41:32.880
I think that what I could offer it's constructive is inflation is completely misunderstood.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.880
It's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be.

41:36.880 --> 41:43.880
We need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further the human condition.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.880
All government policy is inflationary.

41:47.880 --> 41:54.880
And another pernicious myth is inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.880
A famous quote by Milton Fridman, I believe.

41:57.880 --> 42:02.880
It's a monetary phenomena. That is, inflation comes from expanding the currency supply.

42:02.880 --> 42:07.880
It's a nice phrase and it's oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation.

42:07.880 --> 42:13.880
But again, it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is.

42:14.880 --> 42:22.880
If I had a currency which was completely non-inflationary, if I never printed another dollar,

42:22.880 --> 42:28.880
and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the earth, we'd still have inflation.

42:28.880 --> 42:42.880
And we'd have inflation as long as we have government that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in themselves inflationary and generally they all are.

42:42.880 --> 42:50.880
So in general, inflationary is the big characteristic of human nature that governments,

42:50.880 --> 42:55.880
collection of groups that have power over others and allocate other people's resources,

42:55.880 --> 43:06.880
will try to intentionally or not hide the costs of those allocations, like in some tricky ways, whatever the options that are available.

43:06.880 --> 43:11.880
You know, hiding the cost is like the tertiary thing.

43:11.880 --> 43:17.880
The primary goal is the government will attempt to do good, right?

43:17.880 --> 43:20.880
That's the primary problem?

43:20.880 --> 43:31.880
They will attempt to do good and they will do good imperfectly and they will create oftentimes as much damage, more damage than the good they do.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
Most government policy will be iatrogenic.

43:34.880 --> 43:39.880
It will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it, but it is what it is.

43:39.880 --> 43:48.880
The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it by expanding the currency supply

43:48.880 --> 43:58.880
without realizing that they're actually paying for it in a suboptimal fashion.

43:58.880 --> 44:01.880
They'll collapse their own currencies while they attempt to do good.

44:01.880 --> 44:08.880
The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure how badly they're collapsing the currency.

44:08.880 --> 44:14.880
So, for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and look at the numbers printed by the Fed,

44:14.880 --> 44:20.880
they'll say, oh, it looks like the dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power over 100 years.

44:20.880 --> 44:26.880
Okay, they sort of fess up to those problem, but they make it 95% loss over 100 years.

44:26.880 --> 44:32.880
What they don't do is realize it's a 99.7% loss over 80 years.

44:32.880 --> 44:44.880
So they will mismeasure just the horrific extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy and the domestic policy,

44:44.880 --> 44:52.880
which they overestimate their budget and their means to accomplish their ends.

44:52.880 --> 45:02.880
They underestimate the cost and they're oblivious to the horrific damage that they do to the civilization

45:02.880 --> 45:08.880
because the mental models that they use that are conventionally taught are wrong.

45:08.880 --> 45:16.880
The mental model that it's okay, we can print all this money because the velocity of the money is low,

45:16.880 --> 45:24.880
because money velocity is a scalar and inflation is the scalar and we don't see 2% inflation yet

45:24.880 --> 45:28.880
and the money velocity is low and so it's okay if we print trillions of dollars.

45:28.880 --> 45:32.880
Well, the money velocity was immediate.

45:32.880 --> 45:44.880
The velocity of money through the crypto economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity of money through the consumer economy.

45:44.880 --> 45:51.880
I think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him, he said it takes two months for a credit card transaction to settle.

45:51.880 --> 45:58.880
So you want to spend a million dollars in the consumer economy, you can move it six times a year.

45:58.880 --> 46:03.880
You put a million dollars into gold, gold will sit in a vault for a decade.

46:03.880 --> 46:07.880
So the velocity of money through gold is 0.1.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.880
You put the money in the stock market and you can trade it once a week.

46:10.880 --> 46:14.880
The settlement is T plus two, maybe you get to two to one leverage.

46:14.880 --> 46:19.880
You might get to a money velocity of 100 a year in the stock market.

46:19.880 --> 46:24.880
You put your money into the crypto economy and these people are settling every four hours.

46:24.880 --> 46:29.880
And if you're offshore, they're trading with 20x leverage.

46:29.880 --> 46:36.880
So if you settle every day and you trade the 20x leverage, you just went to 7,000.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.880
So the velocity of the money varies.

46:41.880 --> 46:47.880
I think the politicians, they don't really understand inflation and they don't understand economics.

46:47.880 --> 46:52.880
But you can't blame them because the economists don't understand economics.

46:52.880 --> 46:59.880
Because if they did, they would be creating multivariate computer simulations

46:59.880 --> 47:05.880
where they actually put in the price of every piece of housing in every city in the world.

47:05.880 --> 47:11.880
The full array of foods and the full array of products and the full array of assets.

47:11.880 --> 47:16.880
And then on a monthly basis, they would publish all those results.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.880
And that's a high bandwidth requirement.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.880
And I think that people don't really want to embrace it.

47:24.880 --> 47:32.880
And also the most pernicious thing, there's that phrase, you can't tell people what to think,

47:32.880 --> 47:34.880
but you can tell them what to think about.

47:34.880 --> 47:41.880
The most pernicious thing is I get you to misunderstand the phenomena

47:41.880 --> 47:49.880
so that even when it's happening to you, you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing and you think it's a good thing.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.880
So if housing prices are going up 20% year over year,

47:53.880 --> 47:57.880
and I say this is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners,

47:57.880 --> 48:01.880
then I have misrepresented a phenomena.

48:01.880 --> 48:05.880
Inflation is 20%, not 7%.

48:05.880 --> 48:10.880
And then I have misrepresented it as being a positive rather than a negative.

48:10.880 --> 48:16.880
And people will stare at it and you could even show them their house on fire

48:16.880 --> 48:22.880
and they would perceive it as being great because it's warming them up and they're going to save on their heat costs.

48:22.880 --> 48:28.880
It does seem that the cruder the model, whether it's economics, whether it's psychology,

48:28.880 --> 48:32.880
the easier it is to weave whatever the heck narrative you want,

48:32.880 --> 48:40.880
and not in a malicious way, but just like it's some kind of emergent phenomena,

48:40.880 --> 48:42.880
this narrative thing that we tell ourselves.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.880
So you can tell any kind of story about inflation.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.880
Inflation is good, inflation is bad.

48:47.880 --> 48:51.880
The cruder the model, the easier it is to tell a narrative about it.

48:52.880 --> 48:55.880
So if you take an engineering approach,

48:55.880 --> 49:05.880
I feel like it becomes more and more difficult to run away from a true deep understanding of the dynamics of the system.

49:05.880 --> 49:10.880
I mean, honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street and you asked them to define inflation,

49:10.880 --> 49:20.880
how many would say it's a vector tracking the change in price of every product service asset in the world over time?

49:20.880 --> 49:22.880
Not many.

49:22.880 --> 49:30.880
Now, if you went to them and you said, do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.880
The majority would probably say, well, here it's good.

49:33.880 --> 49:38.880
The majority of economists would say 2% inflation a year is good.

49:38.880 --> 49:42.880
And of course, look at the ship next to us.

49:42.880 --> 49:51.880
What if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its volume every something, right?

49:51.880 --> 49:53.880
The ship is rotting 2% a year.

49:53.880 --> 49:56.880
That means the useful life of the ship is 50 years.

49:56.880 --> 49:57.880
Now, ironically, that's true.

49:57.880 --> 50:04.880
Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to 100 year life, 100 would be long, 50 years, not unlikely.

50:04.880 --> 50:09.880
So when we built ships out of wood, they had a useful life of about 50 years.

50:09.880 --> 50:12.880
And then they sunk, they rotted.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.880
There's nothing good about it, right?

50:14.880 --> 50:20.880
You build a ship out of steel, you know, and it's zero as opposed to 2% degradation.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.880
And how much better is 0% versus 2%?

50:24.880 --> 50:31.880
Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, you know, it's half life of 35 years.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.880
2% is a half life of 35 years.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.880
That's basically the half life of money and gold.

50:36.880 --> 50:43.880
If I store your life force in gold, under perfect circumstances, you have a useful life of 35 years.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.880
0% is a useful life of forever.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.880
So 0% is immortal.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.880
2% is 35 years average life expectancy.

50:54.880 --> 51:04.880
So the idea that you would think the life expectancy of the currency and the civilization should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion.

51:04.880 --> 51:11.880
But the tragic notion is it was, you know, seven into 70 or 10 years.

51:11.880 --> 51:20.880
The money has had a half life of 10 years, except for the fact that in weak societies and in Argentina or the like,

51:20.880 --> 51:25.880
the half life of the money is three to four years in Venezuela, one year.

51:25.880 --> 51:36.880
So the United States dollar and the United States economic system was the most successful economic system in the last 100 years in the world.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.880
We won every war. We were the world superpower.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.880
Our currency lost 99.7% of its value.

51:42.880 --> 51:48.880
And that means horrifically, every other currency lost everything.

51:48.880 --> 51:56.880
In essence, the other ones were 99.9, except for most that were 100% because they all completely failed.

51:56.880 --> 52:08.880
And, you know, you've got a mainstream economic community that thinks that inflation is a number and 2% is desirable.

52:08.880 --> 52:14.880
It's kind of like, you know, remember George Washington?

52:14.880 --> 52:17.880
You know how he died?

52:17.880 --> 52:22.880
Well-meaning physicians bled him to death.

52:22.880 --> 52:28.880
OK, the last thing in the world you would want to do to a sick person is bleed them.

52:28.880 --> 52:36.880
Right. In the modern world, I think we understand that that oxygen is carried by the blood cells and and, you know,

52:37.880 --> 52:46.880
And if, you know, there's that phrase, right, a triage phrase, what's the first thing you do in an injury?

52:46.880 --> 52:49.880
Stop the bleeding. Single first thing, right?

52:49.880 --> 52:57.880
You show up after any accident, I look at you, stop the bleeding because you're going to be dead in a matter of minutes if you bleed out.

52:57.880 --> 53:04.880
So it strikes me as being ironic that orthodox conventional wisdom was bleed the patient to death.

53:04.880 --> 53:10.880
And this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.880
And we bled him to death trying to help him.

53:13.880 --> 53:22.880
So when you're actually inflating the money supply at 7%, but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy,

53:22.880 --> 53:27.880
you're literally bleeding the free market to death.

53:27.880 --> 53:33.880
But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he thought that they were going to do him good.

53:33.880 --> 53:42.880
And the majority of of the society, most companies, most most conventional thinkers, you know,

53:42.880 --> 53:49.880
the working class, they go along with this because they think that someone has their best interests at mind.

53:49.880 --> 53:57.880
And the people that are bleeding them to death believe they believe that prescription because their mental models are just so defective.

53:57.880 --> 54:10.880
And then an understanding of energy and engineering and and and the economics that are at play is is crippled by the mental models.

54:10.880 --> 54:15.880
But that's both the bug in the future of human civilization that ideas take hold.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.880
They unite us. We believe in them.

54:19.880 --> 54:28.880
And we make a lot of cool stuff happen by as an average sort of just the fact of the matter.

54:28.880 --> 54:35.880
A lot of people believe the same thing. They get together and they get some shit done because they believe that thing.

54:35.880 --> 54:39.880
And then some ideas can be really bad and really destructive.

54:39.880 --> 54:44.880
But on average, the ideas seem to be progressing in a direction of good.

54:44.880 --> 54:50.880
Let me just step back. What the hell are we doing here as humans on this earth?

54:50.880 --> 54:53.880
How do you think of humans? How special are humans?

54:53.880 --> 54:58.880
How did human civilization originate on this earth?

54:58.880 --> 55:02.880
And what is this human project that we're all taking on?

55:02.880 --> 55:07.880
You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.880
I always thought you can get the demons out in that way.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.880
But that was a recent invention.

55:14.880 --> 55:19.880
So what's this thing we're doing here?

55:19.880 --> 55:29.880
I think what distinguishes human beings from all the other creatures on the earth is is our ability to engineer.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.880
We're engineers, right?

55:31.880 --> 55:37.880
To solve problems or just build incredible, cool things.

55:37.880 --> 55:45.880
Engineering, harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it.

55:45.880 --> 55:53.880
From the point that we actually started to play with fire, that was a big leap forward.

55:53.880 --> 56:00.880
Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another step forward.

56:00.880 --> 56:04.880
Every city built on water. Why water?

56:04.880 --> 56:07.880
Well, water is bringing energy.

56:07.880 --> 56:18.880
If you actually put a turbine on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you've literally harnessed gravitational energy.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.880
But water is also bringing you food.

56:21.880 --> 56:26.880
It's also giving you a cheap form of getting rid of your waste.

56:26.880 --> 56:29.880
It's also giving you free transportation.

56:29.880 --> 56:33.880
You want to move one ton blocks around. You want to move them in water.

56:33.880 --> 56:41.880
So I think the human story is really the story of engineering a better world.

56:41.880 --> 56:53.880
And the rise in the human condition is determined by those groups of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy.

56:54.880 --> 57:03.880
If you look at the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and water and created a trading network.

57:03.880 --> 57:08.880
The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of engineering.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.880
I mean, the aqueducts are a great example.

57:11.880 --> 57:21.880
If you go to any big city, you travel through cities in the Med, you find that the carrying capacity of the city or the island is 5,000 people without running water.

57:21.880 --> 57:26.880
And then if you can find a way to bring water to it, it increases by a factor of 10.

57:26.880 --> 57:40.880
And so human flourishing is really only possible through that channeling of energy that eventually takes the form of air power.

57:40.880 --> 57:45.880
I mean, look at the intricacy of those sails.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.880
I mean, just the model is intricate.

57:48.880 --> 57:58.880
Now think about all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put on that ship and how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them.

57:58.880 --> 58:13.880
There's thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details, all to increase the efficiency of this, the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship as it sails through water.

58:13.880 --> 58:16.880
And we should also note there's a bunch of cannons on the side.

58:16.880 --> 58:22.880
Another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives.

58:22.880 --> 58:25.880
To achieve what end? That's another discussion, exactly.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.880
Suppose we're trying to get off the planet, right?

58:28.880 --> 58:32.880
Well, there's a selection mechanism going on. So natural selection.

58:32.880 --> 58:40.880
However evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on Earth was the predator prey dynamic.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.880
That you want to be the bigger fish.

58:43.880 --> 58:49.880
That violence seems to serve a useful purpose if you look at Earth as a whole.

58:49.880 --> 58:54.880
We as humans now like to think of violence as really a bad thing.

58:54.880 --> 59:00.880
It seems to be one of the amazing things about humans is we're ultimately tend towards cooperation.

59:00.880 --> 59:07.880
We like peace. If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm.

59:08.880 --> 59:16.880
But just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering and destruction and so on.

59:16.880 --> 59:24.880
And they have a kind of like resetting the pallet effect.

59:24.880 --> 59:32.880
It's one that's full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it's like a way to start over.

59:33.880 --> 59:37.880
We're quite the apex predator on the planet.

59:37.880 --> 59:46.880
I googled something the other day, you know, what's the most common form of mammal life on Earth?

59:46.880 --> 59:48.880
By number of organisms?

59:48.880 --> 59:49.880
By count.

59:49.880 --> 59:54.880
And the answer that came back was human beings. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, right?

59:54.880 --> 01:00:01.880
Apparently, if we're just looking at mammals, the answer was human beings are the most common, which was very interesting to me.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.880
I almost didn't believe it, but I was trying to think, you know, eight billion or so human beings.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.880
There's no other mammal that's got more than eight billion.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:18.880
If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland and you look up on this hill and this castle up on the hill, you know, and you talk to people.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:27.880
And the story is, oh, yeah, well, that was a British castle before it was a Scottish castle, before it was a Pict castle, before it was a Roman castle,

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:37.880
before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle, before, you know, then they found 13 prehistoric castles buried one under the other under the other.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:47.880
And you get to you get to the conclusion that 100,000 years ago, somebody showed up and grabbed the high point, the apex of the city,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:55.880
and they built a stronghold there and they flourished and their family flourished and their tribe flourished until someone came along and knocked them off the hill.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:07.880
And it's been a nonstop, never ending fight by the aggressive, most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
All for the hill.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.880
For that one hill, going back since time immemorial.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:23.880
And, you know, you scratch your head and you think it seems like it's like just this never ending wheel.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:32.880
But doesn't that lead if you just all kinds of metrics that seems to improve the quality of our cannons and ships as a result?

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.880
Like it seems that war, just like your laser eyes, focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:47.880
It is that. And it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.880
And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.880
Like, like, who's the most powerful or the, you know, or the most powerful side one?

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.880
But they don't think about it. And they think about power energy delivered in a period of time.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:13.880
And then you think. A guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist and somewhere the bow and arrow is more powerful than the person with the spear.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:20.880
And then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful than without and steel is more powerful than bronze.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:29.880
And if you look at the Romans, you know, they persevered, you know, with artillery and they could stand off from 800 meters and blast you to smithereens.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.880
Right. You know, you study the history of the Balearic slingers, right.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.880
And, you know, you think we invented bullets, but they invented bullets to put in slings thousands of years ago.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.880
They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head. Right.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:03:01.880
And so there was never a time when when humanity wasn't vying to come up with an asymmetric form of projecting their own power via technology.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:09.880
An absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.880
They're facing the same direction, working in the same direction to leverage energy.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.880
The most organized society wins. Yeah.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:26.880
When the Romans were were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization in Europe.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.880
And as long as they stayed organized, they they dominated.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.880
And at some point they over expanded and got disorganized and they collapsed.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:45.880
And I guess you could say that the struggle of the human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies, one after the other.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:52.880
It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right, gets penalized.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.880
You get penalized, you reject artillery, you get penalized, you reject atomic power, you get penalized.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.880
If you reject digital power, cyber power, you get penalized.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:19.880
And and the underlying control of the property keeps shifting hands from, you know, one institution or one government to another based upon how rationally they're able to channel that energy and how well organized or coordinated they are.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:29.880
Well, that's a really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments that they once they get a few good and companies, once they get a few good ideas, they seem to stick with them.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:37.880
They reject new ideas. It's almost whether that's emergent or however that evolved.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:45.880
It seems to have a really interesting effect because when you're young, you fight for the new ideas, you push them through.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.880
Then a few of us humans find success that we get complacent.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.880
We take over the world using that new idea.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:06.880
And then the new young person with a better new idea challenges you and you as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old and lose because of it.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880
And that's how empires collapse.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.880
And it's just both at the individual level that happens when two academics fighting about ideas or something like that.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:21.880
And at the at the human civilization level, governments, they hold on to the ideas of old.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.880
It's fascinating.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:37.880
An ever persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift and the paradigms shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives or the paradigm shifts when there's a war.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:48.880
And everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping on their head or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is as a rude awakening.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.880
And if they totally disagree, their society collapses and they're replaced by that new thing.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:03.880
A lot of the engineering you talked about had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:11.880
What about this whole digital thing that's happening, been happening over the past century?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880
Is that still engineering in your mind?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.880
You're starting to operate in these bits of information.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880
I think there's two big ideas.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.880
The first wave of ideas were digital information.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:30.880
And that was the Internet way been running since 1990 or so for 30 years.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.880
And the second wave is digital energy.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:46.880
So if I look at digital information, this idea that we want to digitally transform a book, I'm going to dematerialize every book in this room into bits.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.880
And then I'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.880
And I'm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:14.880
If I can dematerialize music, books, education, entertainment, maps, that is an incredibly exothermic transaction.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.880
It's a crystallization. When we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization, we give off massive amounts of energy.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.880
If you look at what Carnegie did, the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time, and he gave away his entire fortune.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:34.880
And now we can give a better library to every six-year-old for nothing.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.880
And so what's the value of giving a million books to eight billion people?

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.880
That's the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:56.880
When we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car, you get in the car, and the car drives you where you want to go with the map.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:03.880
And how much better is that than a Rand McNally Atlas right here? It's like a million times better.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:14.880
So the first wave of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things, which are non-conservative.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:28.880
I could take Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, played for by the best orchestra in Germany, and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at less than the cost of the one performance.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:38.880
So I deliver culture and education and erudition and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.880
And the consequences of the human race are first order, generally good, right?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.880
The world is a better place. It drives growth.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:54.880
And you create these trillion dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft, right?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.880
That is the first wave. The second wave.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:06.880
Do you mind? I'm sorry to interrupt, but that first wave, it feels like the impact that's positive.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.880
You said the first order impact is generally positive.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.880
It feels like it's positive in a way that nothing else in history has been positive.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:31.880
And then we may not actually truly be able to understand the orders and magnitude of increase in productivity in just progress and human civilization until we look back centuries from now.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.880
It just feels or maybe I'm like just like just looking at the impact of Wikipedia, right?

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:46.880
The giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge and then perhaps wisdom to billions of people.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:53.880
If you can just linger on that for a second, what's your sense of the impact of that?

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:02.880
You know, I would say if you're a technologist philosopher.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:16.880
The impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition than a non technology that is almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things a conventional way.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.880
So let's take an example.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:30.880
I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy, and the Saylor Academy gives away free education, free college education to anybody on earth that wants it.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.880
And we've had more than a million students.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:40.880
And if you go and you take the physics class, the lectures were by the same physics lecturer that taught me physics at MIT.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:51.880
Except when I was at MIT, the cost of the first four weeks of MIT would have drained my family's life collective life savings for the first last hundred years.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.880
Yeah, like a hundred years worth of my father, my grandfather, my great grandfather.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.880
They saved every penny they had after a hundred years.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.880
They could have paid for one week or two weeks of MIT.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.880
That's how fiendishly expensive and inefficient it was.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.880
So I went on scholarship.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.880
I was lucky to have a scholarship.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:18.880
But on the other hand, I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall and I was like right up in the rafters.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:27.880
It's an awful experience on these like uncomfortable wooden benches and you can barely see the blackboard and you got to be there synchronously.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:35.880
And the stuff we upload, you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad or watch it on your computer and rewind it multiple times.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.880
Sit in a comfortable chair and you can do it from anywhere on earth and it's absolutely free.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.880
So I think about this and I think you want to improve the human condition.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.880
You need people with postgraduate level education.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880
You need PhDs.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:59.880
And I know this sounds kind of elitist, but you want to cure cancer and you want to go to the stars, fusion drive.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.880
We need new propulsion, right?

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:15.880
We need extraordinary breakthroughs in every area of basic science, you know, be it biology or propulsion or material science or computer science.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880
You're not doing that with an undergraduate degree.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.880
You're certainly not doing it with a high school education.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.880
But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.880
There's like 10 million PhDs in the world.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.880
If you go do that, if you check it out, there's 8 billion people in the world.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.880
How many people could get a PhD or would want to?

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.880
Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion, 500 million.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.880
Let's just say 500 million to a billion.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:48.880
How do you go from 10 million to a billion highly educated people, all of them specializing in?

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.880
And I don't have to tell you how many different fields of human endeavor there are.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.880
I mean, your life is interviewing these experts and there's so many, right?

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.880
You know, it's it's amazing.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.880
So how do I give a multimillion dollar education to a billion people?

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880
And there's two choices.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.880
You can either endow a scholarship, in which case you pay seventy five thousand dollars a year.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880
OK, seventy five thousand.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.880
Let's pay a million dollars and a million dollars a person.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.880
I can do it that way.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.880
And you're never even if you had a trillion dollars,

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.880
if you had 10 trillion dollars to throw at the problem,

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:35.880
and we've just thrown 10 trillion dollars at certain problems, you don't solve the problem.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.880
Right. If I if I put 10 trillion dollars on the table and I said, educate everybody, give them all a PhD,

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.880
you still wouldn't solve the problem.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:50.880
Harvard University can't educate 18,000 people simultaneously or 87,000 or 800,000 or 8 million.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.880
So you have to dematerialize the professor and dematerialize the experience.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.880
So you put it all as streaming on demand computer generated education

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.880
and you create simulations where you need to create simulations and you upload it.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:18.880
It's like the human condition is being held back by five hundred thousand well-meaning average algebra teachers.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.880
I love them. I mean, please don't take offense if you're an algebra teacher.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:30.880
But instead of five hundred thousand algebra teachers going through the same motion over and over again,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.880
what you need is is like one or five or ten really good algebra teachers.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.880
And they need to do it a billion times a day or a billion times a year for free.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.880
And if we do that, there's no reason why you can't give infinite education,

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.880
certainly in science, technology, engineering and math.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.880
Infinite education to everybody with no constraint.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.880
And I think the same is true with just about every other thing.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.880
If you want to bring joy to the world, you need digital music.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.880
If you want to bring enlightenment to the world, you need digital education.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.880
If you want to bring anything of consequence in the world, you've got to digitally transform it.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.880
And then you've got to manufacture it something like a hundred times more efficiently as a start,

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:32.880
but a million times more efficiently is probably optimal.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.880
That's hopeful. Maybe you have a chance.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.880
If you look at all of these space endeavors and everything,

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880
we're thinking about getting to Mars, getting off the planet, getting to other worlds.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.880
Number one thing you've got to do is you've got to make a fundamental breakthrough in an engine.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.880
People dreamed about flying for thousands of years, but until the internal combustion engine,

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:04.880
you didn't have enough, you know, enough energy, enough power in a light enough package in order to solve the problem.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:15.880
And the human race has all sorts of those fundamental engines and materials and techniques that we need to master.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:26.880
And each one of them is a lifetime of experimentation of someone capable of making a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.880
There are certain problems like education that could be solved through this process of dematerialization.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:39.880
And by the way, to give props to the five hundred K algebra teachers, when I look at YouTube, for example,

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:46.880
one possible approach is each one of those five hundred thousand teachers probably had days and moments of brilliance.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:55.880
And if they had the ability to contribute to in the natural selection process, like the market of education where the best ones rise up,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.880
that's that's a really interesting way, which is like the best the best day of your life,

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:13.880
the best lesson you've ever taught could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.880
So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.880
Now, traveling across planets, you still can't solve that problem with the dematerialization.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:32.880
What you could solve potentially is dematerializing the human brain where you can transfer transfer.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.880
Like, you don't need to have astronauts on the ship.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.880
You can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain touching on those points.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.880
You'd love for the five hundred thousand algebra teachers to become five hundred thousand math specialists.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:53.880
And maybe they clump into fifty thousand specialties as teams and they all pursue fifty thousand new problems.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.880
And they put their algebra teaching on autopilot.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:05.880
That's the same. That's the same as when I give you eleven cents worth of electricity and you don't have to row, you know,

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.880
row a boat eight hours a day before you can eat.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.880
It would be a lot better, you know,

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:17.880
that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your day and then you could start thinking about other things.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.880
Right. With regard to technology, you know,

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:31.880
one thing that I learned studying technology when you look at S curves is until you start the S curve,

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:40.880
you don't know whether you're a hundred years from viability, a thousand years from viability or a few months from viability.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.880
So it's not fun. That's so fun.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.880
The early part of the S curve is so fun because you don't know.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:57.880
In nineteen hundred, you could have got any number of learned academics to give you ten thousand reasons why humans will never fly.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.880
Right. And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.880
And by 1969, we're walking on the moon.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.880
So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.880
But for the hundred years and 200 years before, they were just back and forth and nobody was close.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.880
And that's the happy part.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:29.880
The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever to flying 25,000 miles an hour in sixty six years.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.880
The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical engineering at MIT in the 80s.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.880
And in the 80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft. We had Boeing 737s.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:48.880
We had the space shuttle. And you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact aircraft.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:55.880
The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30 percent more.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:01.880
We slammed into a brick wall around 69 to 75.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:11.880
Like, in fact, you know, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, these are all engineered in the 70s, some in the 60s.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:22.880
The actual the fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 was the same shape as a G4 is the same shape as a G3 is the same shape as a G2.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.880
And that's because they were afraid to change the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:39.880
And when they finally decided to change the shape, it was like a 10 billion dollar exercise with modern supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:45.880
Why was this so hard? What was what is what is that wall made of that you slammed into?

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.880
The right question is, so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree spend his career in software?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:21:00.880
Like, why is it that I never a day in my life, with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work, I never got paid to be an aeronautical engineer.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.880
And I worked in software engineering my entire career.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.880
Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical engineering in some way.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:15.880
Maybe like maybe you hit fundamental walls in certain until you have to return to it centuries later.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Or no, the National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man, Andrew Mellon.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.880
And you know how he made his money? Aluminum.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:33.880
OK, and and so and you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum?

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
Nothing, right?

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.880
So it's a materials, so it's a materials problem.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.880
OK, so 1900, we we made massive advances in metallurgy, right?

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.880
I mean, that was that was US steel that was iron to steel aluminum.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.880
Massive fortunes were created because this is a massive technical advance.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.880
And then we also had the internal combustion engine.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:02.880
And, you know, the story of Ford and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.880
So you have no jet engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.880
You have no aviation.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:15.880
But even if you had those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel, no chance.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880
You had to have aluminum.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.880
So there's like two pretty basic technologies.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.880
And once you have those two technologies, stuff happens very fast.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:33.880
So tell me the the last big advance in like jet engines.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.880
There hasn't been one like there has the last big advance in rocket engines.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880
Hasn't been one.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:50.880
The big advances in spaceship design from what I can see are in the control systems, the gyros and the ability to land right in a stable fashion.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880
That's pretty amazing.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:05.880
Also in the case, according to Elon and so on, the manufacture of the more efficient and less expensive manufacturer of rockets.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:12.880
So like it's a production, whatever that you call that discipline of at scale manufacture, at scale productions, the factory work.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.880
But it's not 10x.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.880
I mean, maybe it's 10x over a period of a few decades.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:25.880
When we figure out how to operate a spaceship, you know, on the water in your water bottle for a year.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.880
Right now, then you've got a breakthrough.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.880
So the bottom line is propulsion, propellant, propulsion technology, propellants and the materials technology.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.880
They were critical to getting on that aviation S curve.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:49.880
And then we slammed into a wall in the 70s and the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulf Stream.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.880
These things were the space shuttle.

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.880
They were all pretty much reflective of that.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.880
And then we kind of then we stopped.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.880
And at that point, you have to switch to a new S curve.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.880
So the next equivalent to the internal combustion engine was the CPU.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.880
And the next aluminum equivalent was silicon.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.880
So when we actually started developing CPUs, the transistor gave way to CPUs.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:20.880
And if you look at the power, the bandwidth that we had on computers and Moore's law,

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:30.880
what if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled every three years in the last 40 years where we'd be right now?

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:41.880
So I think that if you're a business person, if you're looking for a commercially viable application of your mind,

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.880
then you have to find that S curve.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.880
And ideally, you have to find it in the first five, six, ten years.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.880
But people always miss this.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.880
Let's take Google Glass, right?

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.880
Google Glass was an idea in 2013.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.880
The year is 2022.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.880
And people were quite sure this was going to be a big thing.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.880
And it could have been at the beginning of the S curve.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.880
But fundamentally, we didn't really have an effective mechanism.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880
I mean, people getting vertigo.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.880
But you didn't know that at the beginning of the S curve, right?

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.880
I mean, maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality, but you don't know that.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.880
You don't have those.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880
You're looking through the fog.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880
You don't know.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:36.880
So the point is we're year zero in 2013, and we're still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:44.880
And when somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo, right,

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:52.880
without any disorientation that managed to have the stability and the bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world,

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.880
you'll be in year one.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:03.880
And from that point, you'll have a 70-year or some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880
And then it'll slow down.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.880
And this is the story of a lot of things, right?

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.880
I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business in the 1860s.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:24.880
And the oil business, as we understood it, became fairly mature by the 1920s to 30s.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.880
And then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like 70 years later.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.880
And then it burst forward.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:40.880
So the interesting story about Moore's Law, though, is that you get this constant burst of S curves on top of S curves on top of S curve.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:48.880
It's like the moment you start slowing down or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another innovation, another innovation.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.880
So Moore's Law doesn't seem to happen in every technological advancement.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.880
It seems like you only get a couple of S curves and then you're done for a bit.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:06.880
So I wonder what the pressures there are that resulted in such success over several decades and still going.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.880
Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S curve kicks off.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.880
And you could be 20 years early or 100 years early.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.880
Leonardo da Vinci, you know, they were Michelangelo.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.880
They were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.880
So humility says you're not quite sure when it's when you really hit that commercial viability.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.880
And it also dictates you don't know when it ends.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.880
Like, when will the party stop?

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.880
When will Moore's Law stop?

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.880
And we'll get to the point where they're exponentially diminishing returns on Silicon performance.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:56.880
And when you just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet engines, you know, and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10 percent better.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.880
But while you're in the middle of it, then you know you can do things.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:11.880
So the reason that the digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms, the bandwidth of and the performance of the components.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:24.880
And I say the components are the radio protocols, mobile protocols, the the batteries, the CPUs and the displays.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880
Right. Those those four components are pretty critical.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.880
They're all they're all critical in the creation of an iPhone.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:41.880
I wrote about it in the book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution because they have advanced and continued to advance.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.880
They created a very fertile environment for all these digital transformations.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.880
And the digital transformations themselves.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.880
Right. They they call for creativity in their own.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.880
Right. Like, like, I think the interesting thing about let's take digital maps.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.880
When you when you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:15.880
Right. It becomes a map because I can put it on a display like an iPad or I can put it in a car like a Tesla.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.880
But if you really want to figure it out, you can't think like an engineer.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.880
You need to think like a fantasy writer.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880
Like, this is where it's useful.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:42.880
If you studied if you read played Dungeons and Dragons and you read Lord of the Rings and you you study all the fantasy literature because because when I dematerialize the map first, I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Right. That's a simple physical transform.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:52.880
But then I start to put telemetry into the map and I keep track of the traffic rates on the roads.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.880
And I tell you whether you'll be in a traffic jam if you drive that way.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.880
And I tell you which way to drive.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.880
And then I start to get feedback on where you're going.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.880
And I tell you the restaurants close and people don't like it anyway.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.880
And then I put an AI on top of it and I have a drive your car for you.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:17.880
And eventually, the implication of digital transformation of maps is I get in a self-driving car and I say, take me someplace cool where I can eat.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.880
And and how did you get to that last step?

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.880
Right. It wasn't simple engineering.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:32.880
There's a bit of fantasy and they're a bit of magic design, art, whatever the heck you call it.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.880
It's whatever. Yeah.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.880
Yeah. Fantasy injects magic into the engineering process.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.880
Like imagination.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:45.880
They precedes great revolutions in engineering.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:50.880
It's like imagining a world like of what you can do with the display.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.880
How will the interaction be?

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.880
That's where Google Glass actually came in.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.880
Augmented reality, virtual reality.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.880
People are playing in the space of sci-fi imagination.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880
They called them own shot.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880
They tried.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.880
It didn't work, but to their credit, they stopped trying.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.880
And then there's new people.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880
They keep dreaming.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.880
Dreamers all around us.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.880
I love those dreamers and most of them fail and suffer because of it.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:17.880
But some of them win Nobel prizes or become billionaires.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:33.880
Well, what I would say is if half the civilization dropped what they were doing tomorrow and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri,

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:45.880
it might not be the best use of our resources because it's kind of like if half of Athens in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.880
If you went back and you said, what advice would you give them?

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:56.880
You would say, you know, it's not going to work till you get to aluminum and you're not going to get to aluminum till you work out the steel and certain other things.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.880
And you're not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some metallurgy.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.880
There's a dude Newton that won't come along for quite a while and he's going to give you the calculus to do it.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880
And until then, it's hopeless.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:15.880
So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct or to focus on sales or something.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:26.880
So if I look at this today, I say there's massive, profound civilization advances to be made through digital transformation of information.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.880
And you can see them like that.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.880
This is the story of today.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880
This is not the story of today, right?

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.880
It's 10 years old, what we've been seeing.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:45.880
We're living through different manifestations of that story today, too, though, like social media that the effects of that is very interesting because ideas spread.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.880
Even you talk about velocity of money, the velocity of ideas keeps increasing.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.880
Yeah. So like Wikipedia is a passive store.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880
It's a store of knowledge.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:02.880
Twitter is like a it's like a water hose or something.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.880
It's like spraying you with knowledge whether you want it or not.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:09.880
It's like social media is just like this explosion of ideas.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:16.880
And then we pick them up and then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.880
So sometimes there's more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take hold.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880
So we get to learn about ourselves.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.880
We get to learn about the technology that can decelerate the propaganda, for example, all that kind of stuff.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.880
But like the reality is we're living.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:36.880
I feel like we're living through a singularity in the digital information space.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:42.880
And we are not we don't have a great understanding of exactly how it's transforming our lives.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:54.880
This is where money is useful as a as a metaphor for significance, because if money is the is the economic energy of the civilization,

01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:04.880
then something that's extraordinarily lucrative that's going to generate a monetary or a wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:16.880
And ultimately, if we had ten times as much of everything, we'd have a lot more free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical endeavors.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.880
So let's take Twitter.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.880
Twitter is something that could be ten times more valuable than it is.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.880
Twitter's Twitter could be made ten times better.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.880
Oh, by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.880
Your Twitter account is awesome.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.880
Thank you.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.880
It could be made ten times better.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:41.880
Yeah, Twitter can be made ten times better if we take if we take YouTube or take education.

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.880
We could generate a billion PhDs.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:51.880
And and the question is, do you need any profound breakthrough in materials or technology to do that?

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.880
It's not really right.

01:34:53.880 --> 01:35:00.880
So if you want to, you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, all these things better.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:18.880
The the United States government, if they took one percent of the money they spend on the Department of Education and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to people that actually met those requirements,

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:25.880
they could provide one hundred X as much education for one one hundredth of the cost and they could do it with no new technology.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.880
That's a marketing and political challenge.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:35.880
So I don't think every objective is equally practical.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:55.880
And I think the benefit of being an engineer or or thinking about practical achievements is when the government pursues an impractical objective or when anybody, an entrepreneur, not so bad with an entrepreneur because they don't have that much money to waste.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:02.880
When a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions of dollars and achieve nothing.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:19.880
Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if the or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives, then I think you can have profound impact on the human civilization.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:39.880
And if I if I look at the world we're in today, I think that there are there are multi trillion, 10, 20, 50 trillion dollars worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be obtained.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:55.880
But there's hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm that not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don't even know what digital energy is.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.880
Most of them reject the concept. They're not looking for it.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.880
They're not expecting to find it. It's inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.880
But in fact, it's completely practical right under our nose.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:17.880
It's staring at us and it could make the entire civilization work dramatically better in every every respect.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:33.880
So you mentioned in the digital world, digital information is one digital energy is two and the possible impact on the world and the set of opportunities available in the digital energy space.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.880
Is much greater. So how do you think about digital energy? What is it?

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.880
So I'll start with Tesla. He had a very famous quote.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:50.880
He said, if you want to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.880
And it gets you thinking about what is the universe? And of course, the universe is just all energy.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.880
And then what is matter? Matter is low frequency energy.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:08.880
And what are we? You know, we're vibrating for, you know, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:17.880
I can turn a tree into light. I can turn light back into a tree if I consider the entire universe.

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.880
And it's very important because we don't really think this way.

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:24.880
Let's take the New York disco model.

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:33.880
If I walk into a nightclub and there's loud music blaring in New York City, what's really going on there?

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.880
Right. If you blast out fifteen, fourteen billion years ago, the universe is formed.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:44.880
OK, that's a low frequency thing. The universe formed a billion years ago.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.880
The continents are 400 million years old.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:54.880
The shift that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.880
But the Hudson River is only twenty thousand years.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.880
There's a building that's probably fifty years old.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:07.880
There's a company operating that disco or that club, which is five to ten years old.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:12.880
There's a person, a customer walking in there for an experience for a few hours.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.880
There's music that's oscillating at some kilohertz.

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:25.880
And then there's light and you and you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, right?

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.880
All layered, all moving through different medium.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:35.880
And the and how you perceive the world is a question of at what frequency do you want to perceive the world?

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:50.880
And I think that once you start to think that way, you're catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like and why would I want it?

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.880
And what is it? So why don't we just start right there?

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.880
What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.880
Bitcoin is a crypto asset.

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.880
It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:17.880
Can we just linger on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value.

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.880
What is a digital asset? What is monetary?

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.880
Why use those terms versus the words of money and currency?

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.880
Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms?

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.880
I'd call it a crypto asset network.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:40.880
The goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy in cyberspace.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.880
One that I could that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light.

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.880
Right. It's the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit.

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.880
How do I actually launch something into orbit?

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.880
How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction free?

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.880
And the solution is a decentralized proof of work network.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:16.880
Satoshi's solution was I'm going to establish protocol running on a distributed set of computers

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:25.880
that will maintain a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by 100 million Satoshis.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:35.880
Now, the innovation is to create that in a ethical, durable fashion.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:44.880
Right. The ethical innovation is I want it to be property and not a security.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.880
A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber and a bar of gold.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.880
And a Bitcoin are all property.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.880
And that means they're all commonly occurring elements in the world.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.880
You could call them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading.

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.880
And I'll tell you why in a second.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:14.880
But they're all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:23.880
If you have a barrel of oil and you're in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the US,

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:26.880
you have a barrel of oil.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:34.880
Right. And it doesn't matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your bill.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:41.880
They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:47.880
Right. And so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.880
Right. I use the word ethical and sorry to interrupt occasionally.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.880
Why ethical assigned to property?

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:07.880
Because if it's a security, a security would be an example of a share of a stock or a crypto token controlled by a small team.

01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:18.880
And and in the event that something is a security because some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:30.880
character supply, then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.880
So I give you maybe practical example.

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.880
I'm the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech.

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.880
My speech, I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and have chicken,

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:48.880
a chicken in the backyard and their own horse and an automobile.

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.880
That's ethical.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:56.880
I give the same speech and I say, I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock.

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.880
Sell their house or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock.

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.880
Is that ethical?

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
Not really.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:11.880
At that point, you've entered into a conflict of interest because what you're doing is you're promoting an asset

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:18.880
which is substantially controlled by a small group of people, the board of directors or the CEO of the company.

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:27.880
So how would you feel if the president of the United States said, I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock?

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.880
Especially if you worked at Google, but you worked anywhere, you'd be like, why isn't he saying buy mine?

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:40.880
A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape or form.

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:49.880
And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from this ancient idea, thou shalt not lie, cheat or steal.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:59.880
So if I'm going to sell you securities or I'm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:08.880
or anybody else, if I create my own yo-yo coin or Mikey coin and then there's a million of them

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.880
and I tell you that I think that it's a really good thing and Mikey coin will go up forever,

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:21.880
and everybody buys Mikey coin and then I give 10 million to you and don't tell the public, I've cheated them.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.880
Maybe if I have Mikey coin and I think there's only 2 million Mikey coin and I swear to you there's only 2 million

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:35.880
and then I get married and I have three kids and my third kid is in the hospital and my kid's going to die

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:42.880
and I have this ethical reason to print 500,000 more Mikey coin or else people are going to die and everybody tells me it's fine.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:49.880
You know, I've still abused the investor, right? It's an ethical challenge.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:46:00.880
If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you're a public figure

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:07.880
you can't endorse a security, you can't endorse something that would cause you to have a conflict of interest.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.880
So if you're a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an influencer

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:22.880
and you want to promote or promulgate or support something using any public influence or funds or resources you may have

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:28.880
it needs to be property. It can't be security. So it goes beyond that, right?

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.880
I mean, like what the Chinese want to support an American company, right?

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:40.880
As soon as you look at what's in the best interest of the human race, the civilization

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:49.880
you realize that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:56.880
which is fair and the way you get to a common property is through an open permissionless protocol.

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.880
If it's not open, right? If it's proprietary and I know what the code says and you don't know what the code says

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:11.880
that makes it a security. If it's permissioned, if you're not allowed on my network

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:17.880
or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:29.880
So when I talk about property, I mean, the challenge here is how do I create something that's equivalent to a barrel of oil

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:41.880
in cyberspace and that means it has to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument, open permissionless, not censorable, right?

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:49.880
If I could do that, then I could deliver you 10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:57.880
and you would take settlement of them and you would know that you have possession of that property

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.880
irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company or anybody else in the world.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:13.880
That's a really critical characteristic and it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.880
Bitcoin isn't just a crypto-asset network. It's easy to create a crypto-asset network.

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:30.880
It's very hard to create an ethical crypto-asset network because you have to create one without any government

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.880
or corporation or investor exercising into influence to make it successful.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:49.880
Open, permissionless, non-censorable. So basically no way for you without explicitly saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:59.880
So it's a kind of you have full control. Even with a barrel of oil, what's the difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin?

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:09.880
Because you kind of mentioned that both are property. You mentioned Russia and China and so on.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:16.880
Is it the ability of the government to confiscate? In the end, governments can probably confiscate no matter what the asset is,

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.880
but you want to lessen the effort involved.

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:26.880
A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical property, liquid property, and Bitcoin is a digital property.

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:31.880
But it's easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.880
It's easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace. Much easier.

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:49.880
So that's not universally true. Some things in the digital space are actually easier to confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information, right?

01:49:49.880 --> 01:50:01.880
I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property that the human race possesses or has yet invented to confiscate.

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:05.880
And that's by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your private keys.

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.880
So if you've got your 12 seed phrases in your head, then that would be the highest form of property, right?

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.880
Because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:26.880
It doesn't mean I couldn't extract it from you under duress, but it means that it's harder than every other thing you might own.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:38.880
In fact, it's exponentially harder. If you consider every other thing you might own, a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights,

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:47.880
intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable, they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:56.880
So digital property in the form of a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race.

01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:59.880
In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point.

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:08.880
I might say to you, Lex, I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure, most durable crypto asset network in the world is going to go up forever.

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:14.880
And there's nothing better in the world. I might be right. I might be wrong.

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:20.880
But the point is, because it's property, it's ethical for me to say that.

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:28.880
If I were to turn around and say, you know, Lex, I think the same about micro strategy stock, MSTR, that's a security.

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:42.880
OK, if I'm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability because because I could go to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of micro strategy stock.

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:50.880
Whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the knowledge that I can't change it.

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:58.880
If if I knew that I could make it forty two million instead of twenty one million and I had the button back here.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:04.880
Yeah. Right. Then then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility.

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.880
Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin and it might not.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:14.880
You might go buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not better because you bought Bitcoin.

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:24.880
Right. But it wouldn't be my ethical liability any more than if I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.880
I think you should be a farmer. I think a chicken in every pot.

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.880
You should get a horse. I think you'd be better.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:41.880
I mean, these are all they're all opinions expressed about property, which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:53.880
But in a legal sense, if we read the law, if we understand securities law and I would say, you know, most people in the crypto industry, you know, they don't they didn't take companies public.

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.880
And so they're not really focused on the securities law. They don't even know the securities law.

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:13.880
If you focus on the securities law, that would say you just can't legally sell this stuff to the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by a regulator.

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:18.880
So so there's a fairly bright line there with regard to securities.

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:35.880
But when you get to the when you get to the secondary issue, it's how do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures can't can't embrace it or endorse it?

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:51.880
You see, so you're not going to build a better world based upon Twitter stock, if that's your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter stock is never going to be a non sovereign bearer instrument in Russia, right?

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.880
Or in China, right? It's not legal in China, right?

01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:12.880
It's not a global permission less open thing. It will never be trusted by the rest of the world. And legally, it's impractical. But, you know, would you really want to put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there's a board of directors and a CEO that could just get up and like take half of it tomorrow?

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:27.880
The answer is no. So if you want to if you want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a digital property. And I'm using property here.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.880
Open permissionless legal sense.

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.880
Okay.

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:38.880
But I would also go to the next step and say, property is low frequency money.

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:48.880
So if you if I give you a million dollars, and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it.

01:54:48.880 --> 01:55:07.880
Right. And the house is low frequency money, you converted the the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house. Maybe and after a decade, you might convert it back into energy, you might sell the house for currency. And it'll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.880
The frequency means what here? How quickly it changes state?

01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:36.880
How quickly does something vibrate? So if if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink, and then you turn around and you buy another right, we're vibrating on a frequency of every few hours, right? The energy is changing hands. But it's not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours, right?

01:55:36.880 --> 01:56:03.880
The frequency of of a of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every five years, it's much lower frequency transaction. And so when you think about what's going on here, you have extremely low frequency things, which we'll call property, then you have mid frequency things, I'm going to call them money or currency.

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:18.880
And then you have high frequency. That's energy. And that's why I use the illustration of you got the building, you got the light, and you got the sound and they're all just energy moving at different frequencies.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:42.880
Now, Bitcoin is magical. And it's it is truly the innovation. It's like a singularity, because it represents the first time in the history of human race, that we managed to create a digital property properly understood. It's, it's easy to create something digital, right?

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:52.880
Every coupon and every skin on Fortnite and Roblox and and Apple TV credits and all these things. They're all digital something, but they're securities, right?

01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:12.880
Right? Shares of stock or securities whenever anybody transfers when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you're transferring an essence of security or an IOU. And so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in in the internet domain or in cyberspace.

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:26.880
That's a critical thing. And anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that. But what they can't do what 99% of them fail to do is be property. They're securities.

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:50.880
Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore a little further. For example, what about when you like Coinbase or something like that, when there's an exchange that you buy Bitcoin is in, you start to move away from this kind of some of the some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this

01:57:50.880 --> 01:58:13.880
which is this non sensible and permissionless and open. So in order to achieve the convenience, the effectiveness of the the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove the aspects of property. So I mean, maybe you can comment on that.

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:38.880
Let me give you a good model for that. If you think about the layer one of Bitcoin, the layer one is is the property settlement layer. And we're we're going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day 100 million transactions a year is the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from point A to point B with the massive security.

01:58:39.880 --> 01:59:05.880
The role of the layer one is is two things. One thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security, I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on layer one. That the second important feature of the layer one is I need the money to last forever. Right?

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:33.880
I need the money indestructible, immortal. So, so the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo, the big trick is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140. And, and that's, that's what we want to solve with layer one. And and the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist. What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it been there? Like, millions of years.

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:51.880
It's been there. And how fast do you want it to move? You don't. In fact, the single thing that's most important is that it not deflect. If it deflects a foot in 100 years, it's too much. If it deflects an inch in 100 years, you might not want that.

01:59:52.880 --> 02:00:15.880
So the layer one of Bitcoin is a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it? You put a trillion, 10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion. How much weight on the bedrock in Manhattan, right? Think about 100 story buildings. So that the real key there is the foundational asset needs to be there at all.

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:35.880
So the fact that you can create 100 trillion dollar layer one that would stand for 100 years, that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time. And the fact that it's ethical, right? It's ethical and it's common property, global permissionless, extremely unlikely that would happen.

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:53.880
People tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after and they've all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful. But for the most part, that's an extraordinary thing.

02:00:53.880 --> 02:01:21.880
Just really quickly pause just to define some terms. If people don't know, layer one is that Michael's referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally defined, which is the blockchain. There's a consensus mechanism of proof of work, a low number of transactions, but you can move a very large amount of money.

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:32.880
The reason he's using the term layer one is now that there's a lot of ideas of layer two technologies built on top of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:53.880
I don't know what terminology you want to use, but basically be able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer, to transfer money, to use it as currency, just to define some terms.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:02:14.880
Yeah, so the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy, and we don't want it to move fast. What we want is immortality, immortal, incorruptible, indestructible.

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:33.880
That's what you want, integrity from the layer one. Now there's layer two and layer three, and layer two I would define as an open, permissionless, non-custodial protocol that uses the underlying layer one token as its gas fee.

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:39.880
So what's custodial mean, and how does the different markets like, is Lightning Network?

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:56.880
So Lightning Network would be an example of a layer two, non-custodial. So the Lightning Network will sit on top of layer one, it'll sit on top of Bitcoin, and what you want to do is solve the problem of it's well and fine.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:15.880
I don't want to move a billion dollars every day. What I want to move is $5 a billion times a day. So if I want to move $5 a billion times a day, I don't really need to put the entire trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move $5.

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:26.880
All I really need to do is put $100,000 in a channel or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do 10 million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk.

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:38.880
And of course, it's kind of simple. If I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million, I can probably move the stuff a million times faster.

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:52.880
And that's how Lightning works. It's non-custodial because there's no corporation or custodian or counterparty you're trusting. There's the risk of moving through the channel.

02:03:52.880 --> 02:04:07.880
But Lightning is an example of how I go from 350,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer two, you could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies.

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:15.880
Now, that's not the end-all be-all because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won't be the only one.

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:22.880
There's an open market competition of other permissionless open source protocols to do this work.

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:36.880
And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property, deemed to be non-security, you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin.

02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:42.880
There's a debate about are there any and what are they? And we can leave that for a later time.

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:48.880
But why do you think of them as layer two as opposed to contending for layer one?

02:04:48.880 --> 02:05:01.880
Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token, then they are a layer one. If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee, then it becomes a layer two.

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:10.880
Bitcoin itself incentivizes its own transactions with its own token, and that's what makes it layer one.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:13.880
Okay, what's layer three then?

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:25.880
Layer three is a custodial layer. So if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free, you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App.

02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:33.880
So this is a very straightforward thing. I mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands of layer threes.

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:42.880
There may be dozens of layer twos. I mean, lightning is a one, but it's not the only one. Anybody can invent something, right?

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:49.880
And we can have this debate about custodial, non-custodial.

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:56.880
Don't you think there's a monopolization possibilities at layer three?

02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:14.880
So, you know, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase. What if they start to dominate and basically everybody's using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to memorize the private key in your brain?

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.880
I mean, or like a cold storage of layer one technology.

02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:27.880
The idealists fear the layer threes because they think, and especially they detest, they would detest it a bit.

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:36.880
There's almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to. A layer four would be I've got Bitcoin on an application, but I can't withdraw it.

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:41.880
So I've got an application that's backed by Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin is sealed.

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:47.880
It's a proprietary example. And I'll give you an example of that. That would be like Grayscale.

02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:56.880
If I own a share of GBTC and so I own a security, actually, you know, you could own MSTR.

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:05.880
If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits of Bitcoin, but you don't have the ability to withdraw.

02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:11.880
The asset to get out of the security market at layer four. Am I understanding this correctly?

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.880
I don't know if I would say I don't.

02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:27.880
Not all securities are layer four, but but anything that's a proprietary product based upon what with Bitcoin embedded in it where you can't withdraw the Bitcoin is another application of Bitcoin.

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:42.880
So if if you think about different ways you can use this, you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions, or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two lightning.

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:47.880
And the purist would say we stay there, get your Bitcoin off the exchange.

02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:54.880
But you could also go to the layer three when cash app supported Bitcoin, they made it very easy to buy it.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.880
And then they gave you the ability to withdraw when PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.880
They wouldn't let you withdraw it. And there was a big community uproar.

02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:08.880
And people want they want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the bitcoins.

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:13.880
You can take it to your own private wallet and get it off the exchange.

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:24.880
I think the answer to the question of, well, is corruption possible is corruption is possible in all human institutions and all governments everywhere.

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:35.880
The difference between digital property and physical property is when you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, you can't move the building.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:49.880
And when you own a share of a security that's like a US traded security and you wish to move to some other country, you can't take the security with you either.

02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:54.880
And when you own a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:05.880
So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange.

02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:14.880
And if you if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of stock with Fidelity and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity,

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:25.880
if you own some some, you know, mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things can be removed from the custodian.

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:30.880
But the Bitcoin you can take off the exchange, you can remove from the custodian.

02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.880
So it's still possible there's a deterrent.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:39.880
There's a deterrent that's an anti-corrupting element.

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.880
And the phrase is an armed society is a polite society, right?

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:53.880
Because you have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness.

02:09:53.880 --> 02:10:03.880
And at the point where you disagree with their policies, you can within an hour move your assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.880
And you don't have that option with most other forms of property.

02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:12.880
Maybe you don't have as much optionality with any other form of property on earth.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:21.880
And so what what makes digital property distinct is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody.

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:30.880
Now, coming back to this digital energy issue, the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes.

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.880
It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer twos.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.880
It moves in minutes on the layer one.

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:45.880
And I don't think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one,

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:56.880
because it's impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and immortality if you try to build that much speed and that functionality and performance.

02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:04.880
In fact, if you come back to the New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building and a company.

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:07.880
That's what makes the economy right.

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:16.880
If I said to you, you're going to build a building, but you can only have one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very fragile, very brittle.

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.880
What company 100 years ago is still relevant today?

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.880
You want all three layers because they all oscillate at different frequencies.

02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:32.880
And there's a tendency to think, well, it's got to be this L1 or that L1, not really.

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:40.880
And sometimes people think, well, I don't really want any L3, but companies, it's not an even war.

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.880
Companies are better than crypto asset networks at certain things.

02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:54.880
If you want complexity, you want to implement complexity or you want to implement compliance or customer service.

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.880
Companies do these things well.

02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:05.880
We know you couldn't decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.880
The performance wouldn't be there and the subtlety wouldn't be there.

02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:19.880
And you can't really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance because they will become illegal in the political jurisdiction of their end.

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.880
So unless you're a crypto anarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states,

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:31.880
which is just not very practical, not anytime soon.

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:44.880
Once you allow that nation states will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins.

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:52.880
For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:57.880
There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:03.880
And they don't get the same market share, but they might give you some other advantage.

02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:12.880
There are certain layer threes, like Jack Dorsey's Cash App, where they just incorporated Lightning, an implementation of it.

02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:15.880
Into Cash App.

02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:23.880
So that makes it advantageous versus an application that doesn't incorporate Lightning.

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:35.880
If you think about the big picture, the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones served by 100 million companies doing billions of transactions an hour.

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:44.880
And the companies are settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time.

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:54.880
And then the companies are trading with the consumers in proprietary layers, like layer three.

02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:04.880
And then on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with Lightning layer two because you don't want to pay $5 to move $50.

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:09.880
You want to pay a 20th of a penny to move $50.

02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:15.880
And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy.

02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:18.880
And Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency?

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:27.880
If you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years, I couldn't find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria.

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:32.880
Like, no amount of money. Give me $10 billion.

02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:37.880
I couldn't do it because you get shut down at the banking level.

02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:41.880
You can't link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US.

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:47.880
You get shut down at this credit card level because they don't have the credit card, so they won't clear.

02:14:47.880 --> 02:15:03.880
You would get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because you wouldn't be able to implement a system that interfaced with somebody else's system if it's not in the right political jurisdiction.

02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:15.880
On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would trade in this Lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody's permission.

02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:26.880
So you're talking about something that's like a million times cheaper, less friction and faster to do it if you want to get money to move.

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.880
What do you think that looks like? So now there's a war going on in Ukraine.

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:42.880
There's other wars, Yemen going out throughout the world in this most difficult of states that a nation can be in, which is at war.

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:49.880
Civil war or war with other nations? What's the role of Bitcoin in this context?

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:56.880
Bitcoin is a universal trust protocol, a universal energy protocol, if you will.

02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:03.880
English is one. What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications.

02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:08.880
For example, the Russian payment app is not going to work in Ukraine.

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:11.880
The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia.

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:17.880
US payment apps won't work either of those places, as far as I know.

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.880
In Argentina, their payment app may not work in certain parts of Africa.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:40.880
So what you have is different local economies where people spin up their own applications compliant with their own local laws or in war zones, not compliant, but just spinning up.

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:43.880
So how do you build something that's not compliant?

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:52.880
What is the revolutionary act here when you don't agree with the government or what you want to free yourself from the constraints?

02:16:52.880 --> 02:17:05.880
So here's the thing. When a nation is really at war, especially if it's an authoritarian regime, it's going to try to control the population, like lock everything down, the spread of information.

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:17.880
How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build another app, essentially, that allows the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government?

02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.880
So basically break the law.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:27.880
Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break other constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English.

02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:32.880
For example, it's not illegal to speak English or even if it is, right, doesn't matter.

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:41.880
But English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network.

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:43.880
So Bitcoin is a language.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:52.880
So you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak lightning and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can.

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:58.880
But the problem is it's still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now during war.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:06.880
And there was a sense to me that the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:10.880
There's millions of refugees that are moving all around.

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:17.880
It's very difficult to move money around in that space to help people.

02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.880
I think we're very early. Like we're very embryonic here.

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:27.880
Who's we, sorry? We as a human civilization or we operating in the cryptocurrency space?

02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:35.880
I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic and the human race's adoption of it is embryonic.

02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.880
We're like one, two percent down that adoption curve.

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:47.880
If you take lightning, for example, the first real commercial applications of lightning are just in the last 12 months.

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.880
So we're like year one.

02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:53.880
We might be approaching year two of commercial lightning adoption.

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.880
And if you look at lightning adoption, lightning is not built into Coinbase.

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.880
It's not built into Binance. It's not built into FTX.

02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:08.880
You know, Cash App just implemented the first implementation, but not all the features are built into it.

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.880
There's a few dozen, a dozen lightning wallets circulating out there.

02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:30.880
So I think that, you know, we're probably going to be 36 months of software development at the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has has a Bitcoin wallet or crypto wallet in it of sorts.

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:36.880
That's a big deal. If Apple embraced lightning, that's a big deal.

02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:39.880
So the adoption is the thing.

02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:50.880
Like in a war zone adoption, the people who struggle the most in war are people who weren't doing that great before the war started.

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.880
They don't have the technological sophistication.

02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:56.880
The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way.

02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:00.880
It's just regular people who are just struggling to make day by day living.

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:09.880
And so if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the digital space.

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:15.880
What if from a psycho, if you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second.

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:21.880
So he's one of the early adopters or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption in this layer three.

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:32.880
So inside cash app, what do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner, as somebody playing in the space?

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.880
Like what, why did he do it?

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:40.880
And what does that mean for others at the scale that might be doing the same?

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:45.880
So incorporating lightning networking, incorporating Bitcoin into their products.

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.880
I think he's been pretty clear about this.

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:58.880
He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:11.880
If you want to give an incorruptible bank to eight billion people on the planet.

02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:21.880
That's the same as asking the question, how do you give a full education through Ph.D. to eight billion people on the planet?

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:28.880
And the answer is a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone.

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:34.880
And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace is run by incorruptible software and it's for everybody on earth.

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.880
So I think when Jack looks at it, he's very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa.

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.880
You look at Africans, right?

02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:44.880
Like you're going to give them banks, you're not going to put a bank branch on every corner.

02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.880
That's an obscene waste of energy.

02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:49.880
You're not going to run copper wires across the continent.

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.880
That's an obscene waste of energy.

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.880
You're not going to give them gold.

02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:02.880
And, you know, so so how are you going to provide people with a decent life?

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:09.880
But the metaphor I think is relevant here, the biological metaphor Lex is type one diabetic.

02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:15.880
If you're type one diabetic, you can't form fat and if you can't form fat, then you can't store excess energy.

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:20.880
So that means that I mean, fat is the ultimate organic battery.

02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:24.880
And if you've got 30 pounds of it, you can go 60 days without eating.

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:33.880
But if you can't generate insulin, you can't form fat cells and you can't form fat cells and store energy, then you can eat yourself to death.

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:35.880
I mean, you will eat and you will die.

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.880
You'll starve to death.

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:42.880
So the lack of property rights is like being a type one diabetic.

02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:49.880
And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world, they don't have property rights.

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:54.880
They don't have effective bank and they don't and their currency is broken.

02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:04.880
Like, what are the what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of a of an organic battery or an economic battery to civilization?

02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:09.880
It would be I have a currency which holds its value and I can store it in a bank.

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:15.880
So a risk, a risk free currency derivative.

02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:18.880
I pay you your money.

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:20.880
You take your life savings.

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:21.880
You put it in a bank.

02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:23.880
You save up for your retirement.

02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:24.880
You live happily ever after.

02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:26.880
That's the American dream.

02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:27.880
Right.

02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:29.880
That's the idyllic situation.

02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:32.880
The real situation is there are no banks.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:34.880
You can't get a bank account.

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:44.880
So I give you your pay in currency and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin or I give it to whatever cause I want or I use it to buy weapons.

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:48.880
And then you find a loaf of bread cost triple next month is what it costs.

02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:51.880
And your life savings is worthless.

02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.880
And so in that environment, everybody's ripped back to Stone Age barter.

02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:02.880
And the problem with that even Stone Age barter is you're going to carry your life savings on your back.

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.880
And what happens when the guy with a machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings?

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:14.880
So so I think from Jack's point of view, he thinks that life is this is maybe too strong.

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:15.880
But these are my words.

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.880
Life is hopeless for a lot of people.

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:21.880
And Bitcoin is hope.

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:34.880
Because because it gives everyone an engineered monetary asset that's a bearer instrument and it gives them a bank on their mobile phone.

02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:42.880
And they they don't have to trust their government or another counterparty.

02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:45.880
With their life force.

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:52.880
So there's a secondary thing I think he's interested in, which is the first thing is the human rights issue.

02:24:52.880 --> 02:25:01.880
And the second thing would be the friction to trade cross borders is so great.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:06.880
Right. Like, you know, you like A.I.

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:09.880
So I'll give you a beautiful notion.

02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:20.880
Maybe one day there'll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is self-sufficient and rich.

02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:23.880
Like that we would have sovereignty.

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:28.880
Can a robot own money or property?

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:30.880
How about kind of Tesla car?

02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:35.880
Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and maintain itself forever?

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:46.880
Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job?

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:50.880
Right. You know, we have a word for that in the real world is institution.

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:53.880
Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford.

02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.880
There are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity.

02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:03.880
But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program?

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:12.880
And with with something like digital property with Bitcoin and lightning, you could do it.

02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:21.880
And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards, you couldn't write.

02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:28.880
You could never. So so you can create things that are beautiful and lasting.

02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:30.880
And what's the difference in speed?

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:40.880
Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world at the speed of light friction free in 24 hours writing a Python script,

02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:51.880
or I can spend a hundred billion dollars to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes them six months of application.

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:56.880
The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference.

02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:06.880
Right. And the metaphors are literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit or vacuum sealing something.

02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.880
Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go up and come down and burn up?

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:19.880
Right. And I think Jack is interested in, you know, putting freedom in orbit.

02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:23.880
Putting freedom in orbit.

02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:28.880
And he said it many times. He said this is that the Internet needs a native currency.

02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:36.880
Yeah. Right. And and no political construct or security can be a native currency.

02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:41.880
You need a property and you need a property that can be moved a million times a second.

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:46.880
Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or 100 kilohertz?

02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:54.880
And the answer is only if it's a pure digital construct, permissionless and open.

02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:01.880
And so I think he that he's enthusiastic as the technologist and he's enthusiastic as the humanitarian.

02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:05.880
And what he's doing is support both those areas.

02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:08.880
He's supporting the Bitcoin and the lightning protocol by building them into his products.

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:19.880
But he's also building the applications which you need at the cash app level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality and compliance necessary.

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.880
And they're related.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:26.880
And I should also say he's just a fascinating person.

02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:31.880
I for a random reason that I couldn't even explain if I tried.

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:37.880
I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the middle of nowhere.

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.880
There was no explanation. He just appeared as a fascinating human.

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:48.880
His relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.

02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:55.880
I don't know what his path looks like, but it's interesting that people like that exist.

02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:02.880
And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO,

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:14.880
because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what you're calling digital energy to see how social networks,

02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:18.880
something I'm really interested in and passionate about could be transformed.

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:22.880
Let me ask you just for educational purposes.

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:30.880
What's the can you please explain to me what Web 3 and the beef between Jack and Mark Andreessen is exactly?

02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:35.880
Did you see what happened? Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it's Shakespeare.

02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:41.880
But can you please explain to me why why there is any any drama over this topic?

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:50.880
First of all, Web 3 is a term that's used to refer to, you know, the part of the economy that's that's token finance.

02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:59.880
So if I'm launching an application and my idea is to is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community.

02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:09.880
So as to finance the application and build support for it, I think that I think that that's the most common interpretation of Web 3.

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:13.880
There are other interpretations, too. And so I'm just going to refer to that one.

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:22.880
And I think the beef in a nutshell, not articulated, but I'll articulate it is whether or not you should focus all your energy

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:32.880
creating applications on top of an ethical digital property like Bitcoin or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it,

02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:39.880
which generally would be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community.

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:42.880
So I'm going to put on my Bitcoin hat here. Yeah. Right.

02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:46.880
All the tokens that are if it's driven by a venture capitalist was security.

02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:50.880
If there's a CEO and a CTO, it's a security.

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:54.880
All these projects, they're companies, foundations or companies.

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:59.880
Right. If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn't make it not a security.

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:07.880
They're all, in essence, collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token.

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:14.880
And if if there's a pre mine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation or any kind of

02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:24.880
any kind of protocol where there is a group of engineers that have influence over it,

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:32.880
then to a securities lawyer or to most Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that's steeped in securities law,

02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:35.880
you're looking to say, well, that passes the Howey test.

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:38.880
It's it looks like a security.

02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:44.880
It should be sold to the public pursuant to, you know, disclosures and regulations.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:48.880
And you're just ducking the IPO process.

02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:52.880
Right. And so now we get back to the ethical issue.

02:31:53.880 --> 02:32:01.880
The ethical issue is if you're trading it as a commodity and representing it as a commodity while truthfully,

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:06.880
it's a security, you know, then it's a violation of ethics rules and it's probably illegal.

02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:09.880
Well, you're you keep leaning on this. Let me push back on that part.

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:18.880
Maybe you can educate me. But you keep leaning on this line of securities law as if it with all due respect to lawyers,

02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:23.880
as if that line somehow defines what it what is and isn't ethical.

02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.880
I think there's a lot of correlation, as you've discussed.

02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:30.880
But I'd like to leave the line aside.

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:37.880
If the law calls something as a security, it doesn't mean in my eyes that it is unethical.

02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:43.880
I mean, there could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time.

02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:49.880
But I take your bigger point that if there's a CEO, there's a project lead that's fundamentally well,

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:53.880
that to you is fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin.

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:57.880
It's not that creating securities is unethical. I created security.

02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:01.880
I took a company public. Right. That's not the unethical part.

02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:05.880
It's completely ethical to create securities. You know, block is a security.

02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:11.880
All companies are securities. The unethical part is to represent it as property when it's a security.

02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:15.880
And and to promote it or trade it as such.

02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:26.880
This whole promotion, that's also a technical thing, because you're like what counts and not as promotion is a legal thing.

02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:31.880
And you get in trouble for all these things. But that that's the game that lawyers play.

02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:35.880
There's an ethical thing here, which is like, what's the right to promote a not?

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:43.880
You know, to me, propaganda is unethical, but it's usually not illegal.

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:47.880
If you roll the clock back 20 years, right?

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:54.880
All the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock, you know, selling Swampland in Florida.

02:33:54.880 --> 02:34:04.880
And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years and I create my own company and I represent it as the same thing and I don't make the disclosures.

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:09.880
Right. You're you're just one step removed from the boiler room scheme.

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:12.880
And that's what's distasteful about it.

02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:17.880
There are ways to sell securities to the public, but there are but there are expectations.

02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:22.880
Maybe we could forget about whether the security laws are ethical or not.

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.880
Right. I will leave that alone.

02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.880
We'll just start with the biblical definition of ethics.

02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:30.880
Don't lie, cheat or steal.

02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:36.880
So if I'm going to sell something to you, I need to fully disclose what I'm selling to you.

02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:41.880
Right. And and that that's a matter of great debate right now.

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:45.880
And so I think that that's part of the debate.

02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:52.880
But the other part of the debate is whether or not we need more than one token.

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:57.880
Like we need at least one.

02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:04.880
Right. We need we need at least one digital property because zero means there is no digital economy.

02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:11.880
Yes. And by the way, you know, the conventional view of maximalist is they think there's only one and everything else isn't.

02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:13.880
That's not the point I'm going to make.

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:20.880
I would say we know there is as there is at least one digital property and that is Bitcoin.

02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:35.880
If you can create a truly decentralized, non-custodial, you know, bearer instrument that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed,

02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:40.880
then you might create another or multiple and there may be others out there.

02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:49.880
But I think that the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community,

02:35:49.880 --> 02:36:01.880
and I share this with Jack, is we could create a hundred trillion dollars of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin as a foundation.

02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:13.880
And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and and create competitive things is a massive waste of time.

02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:18.880
And it's diversion of human human creativity.

02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:22.880
It's like we have an ethical good thing.

02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:27.880
And now we're going to try to create a third or a fourth one.

02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:28.880
Why?

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:31.880
Let's talk about it. So first of all, I'm with you.

02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:36.880
But let me ask you this interesting question, because we talked about properties and securities.

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:38.880
Let's talk about conflict of interest.

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:41.880
You said you could advertise public.

02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:43.880
You have a popular Twitter account.

02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:47.880
It's it's hilarious and insightful.

02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:51.880
You do promote Bitcoin in a sense.

02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.880
I don't know if you would say that.

02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:59.880
But do you think there's a conflict of interest in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin?

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.880
Is it the same as you promoting the farming?

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:06.880
I would say, no, there's an interest.

02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:18.880
I think that I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent that you don't control it.

02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:28.880
I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest is when you're promoting a proprietary product or proprietary security.

02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:31.880
A security in general is a proprietary asset.

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.880
So, for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin.

02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:42.880
You won't ever see me making a statement that say microstrategy stock will go up forever.

02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:50.880
I'm not promoting a security MSTR because at the end of the day, MSTR is a security.

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:51.880
It is proprietary.

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:53.880
I have proprietary interest in it.

02:37:53.880 --> 02:38:00.880
I have a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction.

02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:01.880
The control is the problem.

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.880
The control is the problem because you have interest in both.

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:18.880
You can very if Bitcoin is as successful as we're talking about, you are very possibly can become the richest human on Earth given how much you own in Bitcoin, right?

02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:20.880
The wealthiest, not the richest.

02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:21.880
I don't know what those words mean.

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:24.880
I would benefit economically.

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:25.880
You would benefit economically.

02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:26.880
That's true.

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:38.880
So the reason that's not conflict of interest is because the word property that Bitcoin is an idea and Bitcoin is open.

02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:39.880
It's because I don't own it.

02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:41.880
I don't control it.

02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:50.880
In essence, the ethical line here is could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not?

02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:51.880
Or can anyone?

02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.880
It's not just you.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:54.880
Can anyone?

02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:56.880
Because can you promote somebody else's?

02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.880
Yes, I guess you can.

02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.880
Like, can you promote Apple?

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:16.880
It's like you could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote family values or promote, you know, a carnivore diet or promote the Iron Man, right?

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:22.880
You're not going to get wealthier if you promote camping because you can't own a steak.

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:25.880
I mean, you own a lot of Bitcoin.

02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:26.880
What is that?

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:27.880
What is that?

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:30.880
Don't you own the steak in the idea?

02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:31.880
Yeah, I would.

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.880
I would grant you that.

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:40.880
But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line that you just you don't have.

02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:42.880
All you are is you're a fan of the idea.

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:45.880
You believe in the idea and the power of the idea.

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.880
Yeah, I think you can't take that idea away from others.

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:53.880
Let's come back to let me give you some maybe easier examples.

02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:56.880
If you were the head of the Marine Corps.

02:39:56.880 --> 02:39:57.880
Right.

02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:14.880
And and someone came to you and said, I created Marine Coin and and the twist on Marine Coin is is I want you to tell every Marine that they'll get an extra Marine Coin, you know, when they when they get their next stripe.

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.880
And then I'm going to give you, you know, I'm going to let you buy Marine Coin now.

02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:24.880
And then after you buy Marine Coin, I want you to like promote it to them.

02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:25.880
Right.

02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:39.880
At some point, if if you start to have a disproportional influence on it or if you're in a conversation with people with disproportionate influence becomes conflict of interest, and it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think.

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:44.880
If the head of the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security.

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:54.880
Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he's kind of wacky, like maybe like that's kind of a waste of time and distraction.

02:40:54.880 --> 02:41:07.880
So but but but to the extent that canoeing is not a security, not a problem unless you, you know, ultimately the issue of decentralization is really a critical.

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:09.880
So not having a head.

02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:10.880
One.

02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.880
So is it something can Bitcoin be replicated?

02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:21.880
So the all the things that you're saying that make it a property, can that be replicated?

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:25.880
I think it's possible to create other crypto properties.

02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:34.880
Does it does the having a head like of a project, a thing that limits its ability to be a property?

02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.880
If you if you try to replicate a project, is that the fundamental flaw?

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.880
I look I think the real fundamental issue is you just never want it to change.

02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:57.880
Like like if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years.

02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:06.880
So I think Satoshi said it at one point, he said the nature of the software is such that by version point one, its genetic code was set.

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:17.880
If if there was any development team that's continually changing it, you know, on a routine basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization.

02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:23.880
Because now now there's the issue of who's influencing the changes.

02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:29.880
So what you really want is is a very, very simple idea, right?

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:35.880
The simplest idea, I'm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy.

02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:43.880
And when someone proposes big functional upgrades, you almost don't you don't really want that development to go on the base layer.

02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:52.880
You want that development to go on the layer threes because now cash app has a proprietary set of functionality and it's a security.

02:42:52.880 --> 02:43:06.880
And if you're going to promote the use of this thing, you're not going to you're not going to promote the layer three security because that's an edge to a given entity and you're trusting the counterparty.

02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:12.880
You're going to promote the layer one or most the layer two.

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:24.880
OK, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin and sorry to romanticize certain notions, but Satoshi Nakamoto that the founders anonymous.

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:36.880
Maybe you can speak to whether that's useful, but also I just like the psychology of that to imagine that there's a human being that was able to create something special and walk away.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:39.880
So first, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.880
I'm certain I'm not.

02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:48.880
Actually, I think the providence is really important.

02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:56.880
And if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous or sort of anonymous is important.

02:43:56.880 --> 02:43:59.880
I think the founder disappearing is also important.

02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:04.880
I think that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important.

02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:09.880
I think the lack of an initial coin offering is also important.

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:13.880
I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important.

02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:20.880
I think the fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important.

02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:28.880
And I think that the simplicity of the protocol is very important.

02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:32.880
And I think that the outcome of the block size wars is very important.

02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:38.880
And all of those things add up to common property.

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:44.880
They're all indicia, indicators of a digital property as opposed to security.

02:44:44.880 --> 02:45:01.880
If there was a Satoshi sitting around sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin, I don't think it would cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property.

02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:07.880
And if I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network, I would do the opposite of all those things.

02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.880
I would launch one myself. I would sell 25% or 50% of the general public.

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:19.880
I would keep some of the initial, I would pre mine some stuff or early mine it, you know, and I would keep an influence on it.

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:27.880
Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property.

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:37.880
And so I see the entire story is Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race and disappearing.

02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:41.880
Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be?

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:45.880
I don't care to speculate.

02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:47.880
But do you think it was one person?

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:51.880
It was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others.

02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.880
I mean, it might have been a group of people that were working together, but certainly there's a Satoshi.

02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:01.880
I mean, it's just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful.

02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:07.880
Or do you think a lot of his accent, like the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size,

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:13.880
all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property.

02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.880
Do you think that's an accident or it was deeply thought through?

02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:21.880
Like how does this is almost like a history of science question.

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:24.880
They tried 40 of them, right?

02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:29.880
I mean, I think there's a history of attempting to create something like this, and it was tried many, many times.

02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:31.880
And they failed for different reasons.

02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:38.880
And I think that it's like Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked.

02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.880
And that's how I see this. This is the first one that sparked.

02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:46.880
And it sets a roadmap for us.

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:51.880
And I think if you're looking for any one word to characterize, it's fair.

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:57.880
The whole point of the network is it's a fair launch, a fair distribution.

02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:03.880
Like, yeah, I have Bitcoin, but I bought it.

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:10.880
In fact, you know, at this point, we've paid four billion dollars of you real cash to buy it.

02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:21.880
If I was sitting on the same position and I had it for free, then there's always this question of did I, you know, or I bought it for a nickel a coin or a penny a coin.

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:23.880
The question is, was it fair?

02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:26.880
And that's a very hard question to answer.

02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:31.880
Right. Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly?

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:36.880
And if you roll the clock back, you know, you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime.

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:40.880
But that was when it was a million times more likely to fail.

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:43.880
Right. When the risk was greater, the cost was lower.

02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:49.880
And then over time, the risk became lower and the cost became greater.

02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:58.880
And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace absent any powerful interested actor.

02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:05.880
Right. It's almost like if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years, tweaking things in the background,

02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:10.880
there'd still be that question. But what we've got is really a beautiful thing.

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:24.880
We've got a we've got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an ideology spreading virally in the world that that has seasoned in a fair,

02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:30.880
ethical fashion. Sometimes it's a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility.

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:35.880
Right. And there's been a lot of a lot of sound and fury along the way.

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:42.880
How do you psychoanalyze? How do you deal from a financial, from a human perspective with the volatility?

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:49.880
You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great. Where's the risk today? What's your sense?

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:56.880
You know, we're 13 years into this entire activity. I think the risk has never been lower.

02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:04.880
If you look at all the risks, right, the risk, the risks in the early years are is the engineering protocol proper,

02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:11.880
like one megabyte block size, 10 minute clock frequency cryptography is first.

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:18.880
Will it be hacked or will it crash 730,000 blocks and it hasn't crashed?

02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:21.880
Will it be hacked? Hasn't been hacked. But, you know, it's a Lindy thing, right?

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:27.880
You wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked. But on the other hand, with a billion dollars,

02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:30.880
it's not as interesting a target as it is with a hundred billion.

02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:35.880
And when it gets to be worth a trillion, then it's a bigger target.

02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:42.880
So the risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized.

02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:46.880
I think the second question is, will it be banned? You couldn't know.

02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:50.880
It literally could have been banned many times early on.

02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.880
In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on that subject. I thought it would be banned.

02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.880
I made a very famous tweet. I thought it was going to be banned.

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:05.880
In 2014, the IRS designated it as property and gave it property tax treatment.

02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:14.880
OK, so they could have given it a tax treatment where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year.

02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:17.880
And it probably would have crushed it to death, right?

02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:24.880
So it could have been in any number of places banned by a government.

02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:27.880
But in fact, it was legitimized as property.

02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:30.880
And then the question is, would it be hacked or would it be copied?

02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:34.880
Will it be something better than that? And it was copied 15,000 times.

02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:36.880
And you know the story of all those.

02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:41.880
And they either diverged to be something totally different and not comparable

02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:51.880
or someone trying to copy a non-sovereign bearer instrument store of value found that their networks crashed to be one percent of what Bitcoin is.

02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:58.880
So now we're sitting at a point where all those risks are out of the way.

02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:05.880
I would say that year one of institutional adoption is it started August 2020.

02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:08.880
That's when MicroStrategy bought 250 million dollars worth of Bitcoin.

02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:10.880
And we put that on the wire.

02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:15.880
We were the first publicly traded company to actually buy Bitcoin.

02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:19.880
I don't think you could have found a five million dollar purchase from a public company before we did that.

02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:22.880
So that was kind of like a gun going off.

02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:29.880
And then in the next 12 months, Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin.

02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:32.880
And I'd say now we're in year two of institutional adoption.

02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:38.880
And there are about 24, should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this quarter.

02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:54.880
So you're looking at 36 publicly traded companies and you've got 50, at least in the range of 50 billion dollars on the balance of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly traded companies

02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:00.880
and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin exposed companies.

02:52:01.880 --> 02:52:10.880
So I would say the asset, decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental.

02:52:10.880 --> 02:52:16.880
Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs to institutions and is becoming institutionalized.

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:22.880
So maybe decade one, you go from zero to a trillion and decade two, you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion.

02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:27.880
What about governments, government adoption, institutional adoption?

02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:37.880
Are governments important in this, maybe making it some governments incorporating it into as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff?

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:42.880
Is that important? And if it is, when will it happen?

02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:50.880
It's not essential for the success of the asset class, but I think it's it's inevitable in various degrees over time.

02:52:50.880 --> 02:53:07.880
But the most likely thing to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional investors of Bitcoin as a digital gold, where they're just swapping out gold for digital gold and thinking of it like that.

02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:12.880
And the government entities most likely to be involved with that would be sovereign wealth funds.

02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:28.880
If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding big tech stock equities, the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners, if you can hold big tech, then holding digital gold would be not far removed from that.

02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:32.880
That's a non-controversial adoption.

02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:38.880
I think there are there are opportunities for governments that are much more profound, right?

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:49.880
If a government started to adopt Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve asset, that's much bigger than just an asset investment.

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:52.880
That's a hundred X bigger.

02:53:52.880 --> 02:54:05.880
And you could imagine that's like a trillion dollar opportunity, like any government that wanted to adopt it as a Treasury Reserve asset would probably generate trillions of dollars, a trillion or more of value.

02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:15.880
And then, you know, the thing that people think about is, well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin or any other export commodity?

02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:21.880
I think there's like one point eight trillion dollars or more of export commodities in the world.

02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:23.880
And right now they're all priced in dollars.

02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:27.880
I think that this is a colorful thing, but not really that relevant.

02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:30.880
You could sell all that stuff in dollars.

02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:40.880
The relevant decision that any institution makes, whether they're a nonprofit, a university, a corporation or a government, is what's your Treasury Reserve asset?

02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:56.880
And if your Treasury Reserve asset is the peso, and if the peso is losing 20 percent or 30 percent of its value a year, then, you know, your your balance sheet is collapsing within five years.

02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:06.880
And if the Treasury Reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and U.S. Treasuries, then you're getting your seven.

02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:12.880
Right now it's probably 15 percent or more monetary inflation.

02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:14.880
We're running double the historic average.

02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.880
You could argue triple, somewhere between double and triple, depending upon what your metric is.

02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:22.880
So, you know, do I think it'll happen?

02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.880
I think that they're conservative, but they have to be shocked.

02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:27.880
And I think there is a shock.

02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:31.880
The late Russian sanctions are a big shock.

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:44.880
When the West sees 300 billion dollars worth of Russian gold and currency derivatives, I think, you know, you got the famous quote by Putin that, you know, we have to rethink our Treasury strategies.

02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:47.880
And that pushes everybody toward a commodity strategy.

02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:50.880
What commodities do I want to hold?

02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:52.880
I think that's got a lot of people thinking.

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:54.880
I think it's got the Chinese thinking.

02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:56.880
Everybody wants to be the reserve currency, right?

02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:06.880
So if I buy 50 billion dollars worth of dollars every year, then I buy 500 billion over a decade.

02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:17.880
And I probably pay 250 billion dollars of inflation cost on the backs of my citizens in a decade.

02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:21.880
So inflation could be one of the sources of shock.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:28.880
And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it will be a bang or a whimper.

02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:31.880
Like, what is the nature of the shock or the transition?

02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:41.880
I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic for digital assets in general and for Bitcoin in particular.

02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:52.880
The Canadian trucker crisis, I think, educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their property rights and their banks.

02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:58.880
I think the Ukraine War was a second shock.

02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:03.880
But I think that the Russian sanctions was a third shock.

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:04.880
Yeah.

02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:13.880
And I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is a fourth shock and then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock.

02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:16.880
So I think it's a perfect storm.

02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:20.880
And if you put all these events together, what do they signify?

02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:30.880
They signify the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this is, I'm not sure if I can trust my property.

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.880
I don't know if I have property rights.

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:34.880
I don't know if I can trust the bank.

02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:42.880
And if I'm politically at odds with with the leader of my own country, I'm going to lose my property.

02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:49.880
And if I'm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I'm still going to lose my property.

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.880
And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.

02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:14.880
And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world, such that your logical response would be, I'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency.

02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:17.880
Like I'll convert my peso and lira to the dollar.

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:22.880
I'm going to convert my weak property to strong property.

02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:30.880
I'm going to sell my building downtown Moscow, and I'd rather own a building in New York City.

02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:39.880
I'd rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina or whatever.

02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:42.880
So I'm going to sell my weak properties to buy strong properties.

02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:46.880
I'm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets.

02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:50.880
I'd rather own a digital building than own a physical building.

02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:55.880
Because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow, who can I rent that to?

02:58:55.880 --> 02:59:00.880
But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world.

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:06.880
Anybody with money and the maintenance cost is almost nothing, and I can hold it for 100 years.

02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:08.880
OK, so it's indestructible building.

02:59:08.880 --> 02:59:17.880
And then finally, I want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty to self custody assets.

02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:28.880
And this is not just Ukraine, but this is like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America.

02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:33.880
You don't really want to be sitting with $10 million in a bank in Istanbul.

02:59:33.880 --> 02:59:41.880
The bank's going to freeze your money, convert it to lira, devalue the lira, and then feed it back to you over 17 years.

02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:45.880
So self custody assets would be layer one Bitcoin?

02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:47.880
Self custody assets.

02:59:47.880 --> 03:00:01.880
It's like if I got my own hardware wallet and I've either got your highest form of self custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin in your own self custody.

03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:09.880
And the other the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto dollars like Tether, like some stable coin?

03:00:09.880 --> 03:00:21.880
Like, I'd rather if you had a choice, would you rather have your money in a bank in a war zone in dollars or have your money in a stable coin on your mobile phone in dollars?

03:00:21.880 --> 03:00:22.880
Right.

03:00:22.880 --> 03:00:26.880
I mean, you take the latter risk rather than the former war zone.

03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:27.880
Definitely.

03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:29.880
And you can see that happening.

03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:35.880
Like we've gone from five billion in stable coins to 200 billion in the last 24 months.

03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:43.880
So I do think there's massive demand for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset.

03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:48.880
And there's and everybody in the world would say, yeah, I want that.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:51.880
Well, unless you're just an extreme patriot.

03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:53.880
But most people in the world would say I want that.

03:00:53.880 --> 03:01:03.880
And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be able to carry my property in the palm of my hand so I have self custody of it.

03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:07.880
So Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster.

03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:11.880
What do you think is the high point is going to hit?

03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:12.880
I think it will go up forever.

03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:13.880
Right.

03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:19.880
I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to it's going to climb in a serpentine fashion.

03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:25.880
It's going to advance and come back and it's going to keep it's going to keep climbing.

03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:30.880
I think that the volatility attracts all the capital into the marketplace.

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:35.880
And so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial universe.

03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:41.880
It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders.

03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:43.880
And that attracts capital.

03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:48.880
We're talking about the difference between five percent return and five hundred percent return.

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.880
So the fast money is attracted by the volatility.

03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:57.880
The volatility has been decreasing year by year by year.

03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.880
I think that that it's stabilizing.

03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:05.880
I don't think we'll see as much volatility in the future as we have in the past.

03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:17.880
I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, you know, the market cap goes to between 10 and 20 trillion.

03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:22.880
But gold is remember gold is is defective property.

03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:23.880
Gold is dead money.

03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:27.880
You have a billion dollars of gold that sits in a vault for a decade.

03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:29.880
It's very hard to mortgage the gold.

03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:31.880
It's also very hard to rent the gold.

03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:32.880
You can't loan the gold.

03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:35.880
No one's going to create a business with your gold.

03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:38.880
So gold doesn't generate much of a yield.

03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:42.880
So for that reason, most people wouldn't store a billion dollars for a decade in gold.

03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:46.880
They would buy a billion dollars of commercial real estate property.

03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:53.880
And the reason why is because I can rent it and generate a yield on it that's in excess of the maintenance costs.

03:02:53.880 --> 03:03:02.880
So if you consider digital property, that's 100 to 200 trillion dollar addressable market.

03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:07.880
So I would think it, you know, it goes from 10 trillion to 100 trillion as people start to think of it as digital property.

03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:11.880
What does that mean in terms of price per coin?

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:14.880
At five hundred thousand, right?

03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:18.880
That's a 10 trillion dollar asset at five million.

03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:20.880
That's a hundred trillion dollar asset.

03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:22.880
So I think it crosses a million.

03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:23.880
It can go even higher.

03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:25.880
Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever.

03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:28.880
I mean, there's no reason we're going to go to 10 million a coin, right?

03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:31.880
Because digital property isn't the highest form, right?

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:34.880
Gold was that low frequency money.

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:37.880
Property is a mid frequency money.

03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:44.880
But when I start to when I start to program it faster, it starts to look like digital energy.

03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:49.880
And then it doesn't just replace property.

03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:52.880
Then you're starting to replace bonds.

03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:54.880
It's 100 trillion in bonds.

03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:58.880
There's 50 to 100 trillion in other currency derivatives.

03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:02.880
And then and then and these are all conventional use cases, right?

03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:13.880
I think that there's three hundred fifty trillion to five hundred trillion dollars worth of currency currency derivatives in the world.

03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:27.880
And that and when I say that, I mean things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows, any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt, any any currency itself, any derivatives to those things.

03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:40.880
They're all derivatives and they're all defective and they're all defective because of this persistent seven to 14 percent lapse inflate, which we call inflation or monetary expansion.

03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:44.880
Can we switch something to talk about the energy side of it?

03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:47.880
Like the innovative piece.

03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:53.880
Let's just start with this idea that I've got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms.

03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:59.880
When it becomes a dematerialized hotel, I love that word so much, by the way, dematerialized.

03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:01.880
We're crossing the fountain below here.

03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:04.880
Imagine the fountain blow is dematerialized.

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:12.880
The problem with a physical hotel is I got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of sound and physics laws and Newton's laws.

03:05:12.880 --> 03:05:15.880
And I can rent it to people in Miami Beach.

03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:22.880
But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris, London and New York every night.

03:05:22.880 --> 03:05:24.880
And I can run it with robots.

03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:29.880
And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room hour and I can rent it by the room minute.

03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:39.880
And so I start to chop my hotel up into one hundred thousand room hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world.

03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:49.880
And you can see all of a sudden the yield, the rent and the income of the property is dramatically increased.

03:05:49.880 --> 03:05:53.880
I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls.

03:05:53.880 --> 03:05:57.880
I get on Moore's law and I'm operating in cyberspace.

03:05:57.880 --> 03:05:59.880
So I got rid of Newton's laws.

03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:02.880
I got rid of all the friction and all the all those problems.

03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:06.880
I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace.

03:06:06.880 --> 03:06:09.880
I created a global property.

03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:12.880
I started monetizing at different frequencies.

03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:17.880
And, of course, now I can mortgage it to anybody in the world.

03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:23.880
Right. I mean, you're not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish building from someone in South Africa.

03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:28.880
You have to have to find someone that's local to the culture you're in.

03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:35.880
So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it's not just a little bit better.

03:06:35.880 --> 03:06:41.880
It's a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision.

03:06:41.880 --> 03:06:47.880
It's the beauty of DeFi flash loans, money moving at high velocity.

03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:54.880
At some point, if the hotel is dematerialized,

03:06:54.880 --> 03:07:01.880
then what's the difference between renting a hotel room and loaning a block of stock?

03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:04.880
I'm just finding the highest best use of the thing.

03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:13.880
It feels like the magic really emerges, though, when you build a lot, a market of layer two and layer three technologies on top of that.

03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:20.880
It's like maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but for all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas,

03:07:20.880 --> 03:07:30.880
it's always touching humans at some point and, you know, consumers or humans, business owners and so on.

03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:40.880
So you have to create interface. You have to create services that make all of that super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds of things.

03:07:40.880 --> 03:07:42.880
So you have to build in a whole economy on top of that.

03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:46.880
Yeah, and I happen to think that won't be done by the crypto industry at all.

03:07:46.880 --> 03:07:50.880
I think that'll be done by centralized applications.

03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:56.880
I think it'll be, you know, the citadels of the world, the high speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers.

03:07:56.880 --> 03:08:09.880
I think it'll be Binance, FTX and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield and will give you the loan and the best terms,

03:08:09.880 --> 03:08:12.880
because ultimately you have to jump these compliance hoops.

03:08:12.880 --> 03:08:20.880
It comes like BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in a compliant way with the United States jurisdiction.

03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:32.880
So ultimately those applications to use that digital property and either either generate a loan, give you a loan on it or give you yield on it are going to come from companies.

03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:40.880
But the difference, the fundamental difference is it could be companies anywhere in the world.

03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:49.880
So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering, right, then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore.

03:08:49.880 --> 03:09:00.880
I can't send 10 city blocks of L.A. to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore.

03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:05.880
So you've got a truly global market that's functioning in this asset.

03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:07.880
And is there a second order asset?

03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:15.880
For example, maybe you're an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore will generate 27 percent yield in the Bitcoin.

03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:19.880
But legally, you can't send the money to them or the Bitcoin to them.

03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:31.880
It doesn't matter because the fact that that exists means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York and then they will put on the trade in Singapore.

03:09:31.880 --> 03:09:42.880
And that will create a demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin, which will result in an effective tax free yield for the person in the US that's not even in the jurisdiction.

03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:48.880
So there's nothing that's going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in L.A.

03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:58.880
But there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of property in cyberspace if there's only one digital Manhattan.

03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:04.880
And so there's there's a dynamic there which is profound because it's global.

03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:06.880
But now let's go to the next extreme.

03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:18.880
I'm still giving you a fairly conventional idea, which is let's just loan the money fast on a global network and let's just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace.

03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:23.880
But let's move to maybe a more innovative idea.

03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:31.880
The first generation of Internet, you know, brought a lot of productivity, but there's also just a lot of flaws in it.

03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:34.880
For example, Twitter is full of garbage.

03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:36.880
Instagram DMS are full of garbage.

03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:39.880
Your Twitter DMS are full of garbage.

03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:41.880
YouTube is full of scams.

03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:46.880
Every 15 minutes, there's a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube.

03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:50.880
My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage.

03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:52.880
Millions of spam messages.

03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:56.880
I'm running four different email filters.

03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:02.880
My company spends million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other security things.

03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:08.880
There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace all the time.

03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:09.880
It's extreme.

03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:11.880
And we're all beset with hostility, right?

03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:14.880
You've been a victim of it on Twitter.

03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:19.880
You know, you go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face.

03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:26.880
And then if you look, you find out that the account was created like three days ago and it's not even a real person.

03:11:26.880 --> 03:11:32.880
So, you know, we're beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage.

03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:34.880
And why?

03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:39.880
And the answer is because the first generation of Internet was digital information and there's no energy.

03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:43.880
There's no conservation of energy in cyberspace.

03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:47.880
The thing that makes the universe work is conservation of energy.

03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:53.880
Like, if I went to a hotel room, I'd have to post a credit card.

03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:58.880
And then if I smash the place up, there'd be economic consequences.

03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:01.880
Maybe there'd be criminal consequences.

03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:04.880
There might be reputational consequences.

03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:06.880
You know, a lamp might fall on me.

03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:10.880
But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room.

03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:18.880
Now, imagine I could actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute,

03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:24.880
not post a credit card, and smash them all up anonymously.

03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:30.880
The thing that makes the universe work is friction, speed of sound, speed of light,

03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:34.880
and the fact that ultimately it's conservative.

03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:38.880
You're either energy or you're matter, but once you've used the energy, it's gone.

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:44.880
And you can't do infinite everything that's missing in cyberspace right now.

03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:54.880
And if you look at the look at all of the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products,

03:12:54.880 --> 03:13:04.880
most of them, ninety nine percent of them, could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace.

03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:09.880
And that's what you can do with high speed digital property, high speed Bitcoin.

03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:15.880
And by high speed, I mean not twenty transactions a day, I mean twenty thousand transactions a day.

03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:17.880
So how do you do that?

03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:28.880
Well, I let everybody on Twitter post a thousand or ten thousand Satoshis via lightning wallet, a lightning badge.

03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:30.880
Give me an orange check.

03:13:30.880 --> 03:13:38.880
If you put up twenty bucks once in your life, you could give three hundred million people an orange check.

03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:41.880
Right now, you don't have a blue check, Lex.

03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:44.880
You're a famous person. I don't know why you don't have a blue check.

03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:46.880
Have you ever applied for a blue check?

03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:47.880
No.

03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:50.880
There are three hundred sixty thousand people on Twitter with a blue check.

03:13:50.880 --> 03:13:53.880
There are three hundred million people on Twitter.

03:13:53.880 --> 03:14:01.880
So the conventional way to verify accounts is elitist, archaic.

03:14:01.880 --> 03:14:03.880
How does it work? How did you get a blue check?

03:14:03.880 --> 03:14:13.880
You got to apply and wait six months and you have to post like three articles in the public mainstream media that illustrates you're a person of interest.

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:14.880
Interesting.

03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:19.880
Generally, they would grant them to CEOs of public companies.

03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:25.880
The whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are.

03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:27.880
But the question is, why isn't everybody verified?

03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:30.880
And there's a couple of threads on that.

03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:32.880
One is some people don't want to be doxed.

03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:34.880
They want to be anonymous.

03:14:34.880 --> 03:14:38.880
But there are even anonymous people that should be verified.

03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:48.880
Because otherwise you're subjecting their entire following to phishing attacks and scams and hostility.

03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:50.880
But the other...

03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:51.880
What's the orange verification?

03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:56.880
So this idea, can you actually elaborate a little bit more if you put up twenty bucks?

03:14:56.880 --> 03:15:01.880
I think everybody on Twitter ought to be able to get an orange check if they could come up with like ten dollars.

03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:04.880
And what is the power of that orange check?

03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:07.880
What does that verify exactly?

03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:12.880
You basically post a security deposit for your safe passage through cyberspace.

03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:21.880
So the way it would work is if you've got ten dollars once in your life, you can basically show that you're credit worthy.

03:15:21.880 --> 03:15:26.880
And that's your pledge to me that you're going to act responsibly.

03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:30.880
So you put the ten or the twenty dollars into the lightning wallet.

03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:32.880
You get an orange check.

03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:37.880
Then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say the only people that could DM me are orange checks.

03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:40.880
The only people that can post online tweets are orange checks.

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:48.880
So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers, you know, comment, you lock out all the unverified.

03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:53.880
And that means people that don't want to post ten dollar security deposit can't comment.

03:15:53.880 --> 03:16:00.880
Once you've done those two things, then you're in position to monetize malice.

03:16:00.880 --> 03:16:03.880
Right. Monetize motion or malice for that matter.

03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:14.880
But let's just say for the sake of argument, you post something and ninety seven hundred bots spin up, you know, and pitch their whatever scam.

03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:19.880
Right now you sit and you go report, report, report, report, report, report.

03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:22.880
And if you spend an hour, you get through half of them.

03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:24.880
You waste an hour of your life.

03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:28.880
They just spin up another ninety seven gazillion because they've got a Python script spinning it up.

03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:30.880
So it's hopeless.

03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:38.880
But on the other hand, if you report them and they really are a bot, it's Twitter's got a method to actually delete the account.

03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:40.880
They know that they're bots.

03:16:40.880 --> 03:16:42.880
The problem is not they don't know how to delete the account.

03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:45.880
The problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account.

03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:53.880
So if there are consequences, Twitter could give they could just seize the ten dollars or seize the twenty dollars because it's a bot.

03:16:53.880 --> 03:16:59.880
It's a malicious criminal act or whatever is a violation of platform rules.

03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:06.880
You end up seizing ten thousand dollars, give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the Twitter platform.

03:17:06.880 --> 03:17:08.880
And it's a really powerful idea.

03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:10.880
It's a really powerful idea, but that that's tying it.

03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:15.880
That's adding friction akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world.

03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:17.880
You're tying. You have consequences.

03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:21.880
You have real consequences, putting conservation of energy conservation of energy.

03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:22.880
There's no friction.

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:24.880
There's no nothing on this earth.

03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:28.880
Right. I mean, you can't walk across the room without friction.

03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:31.880
Right. So friction is not bad.

03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:32.880
Right.

03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:37.880
Un unnecessary friction is bad.

03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:41.880
So in this particular case, you're introducing conservation of energy.

03:17:41.880 --> 03:17:47.880
And in essence, you're introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace.

03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:59.880
And that means if you do want to spend up ten million fakes, fake less Freedman's, right, it's going to cost you one hundred million dollars to spend up ten million fake Lexus.

03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:01.880
But the thing is, you could do that with the dollar.

03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:09.880
But your case, you're saying that it's more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin.

03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:12.880
Yeah. Well, let's follow up on that idea a bit more.

03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:20.880
If you did do it with the dollar, then the question is, how does six billion people deposit the dollars?

03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:24.880
Because what you're doing is could you do it with a credit card?

03:18:24.880 --> 03:18:27.880
Like, how do you send dollars?

03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:30.880
You have to dock yourself like it's not easy.

03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:35.880
So you're talking about inputting a credit card transaction, doxing yourself.

03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:40.880
And now you've just eliminated the two billion people that don't have credit cards or don't have banks.

03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:43.880
You've also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous.

03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:54.880
But you've also got this other problem, which is credit credit cards are expensive transactions, low frequency, slow settlement.

03:18:54.880 --> 03:19:01.880
So do you really want to pay two and a half percent every time you actually show a twenty dollar deposit?

03:19:01.880 --> 03:19:07.880
And maybe you could do a kludgy version of this for a subset of people.

03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:13.880
It's like it's 10 percent as good if you did it with conventional payment rails.

03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:27.880
But what you can't do is the next idea, which is I want the orange badge to be used to give me safe passage through cyberspace, tripping across every platform.

03:19:27.880 --> 03:19:33.880
So when I how do I solve the denial of service attacks against a website?

03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:39.880
I publish a website, you hit it with a million requests.

03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:41.880
OK, now how do I deal with that?

03:19:41.880 --> 03:19:45.880
Well, I can lock you out and I can make it a zero trust website.

03:19:45.880 --> 03:19:50.880
And then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trust, trusted credential.

03:19:50.880 --> 03:19:53.880
But that's that's a pretty draconian thing.

03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:57.880
Or I could put it behind a lightning wall.

03:19:57.880 --> 03:20:03.880
A lightning wall would be, you know, I just challenge you, Lex, you want to browse my website.

03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:06.880
You have to show me your hundred thousand satoshis.

03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:09.880
Do you have a hundred thousand satoshis?

03:20:09.880 --> 03:20:14.880
Click. OK, now you click away a hundred times or a thousand times.

03:20:14.880 --> 03:20:22.880
And after a thousand times, you know, well, now, Lex, you're getting offensive over to take a satoshi from you or 10 satoshis, a microtransaction.

03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:27.880
You want to hit me a million times. I'm taking all your satoshis and locking you out.

03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:33.880
What you want to do is you want to go through 200 websites a day.

03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:42.880
And what you want every time you cross a domain, you need to be able to, in a split second, prove that you've got some asset.

03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:47.880
And now when you cross back, when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back.

03:20:47.880 --> 03:20:59.880
So how do I, in a friction free fashion, browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for safe passage and then get it back?

03:20:59.880 --> 03:21:03.880
You couldn't afford to pay a credit card fee each time.

03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:12.880
When you think about two and a half percent as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money 40 times and it's gone.

03:21:12.880 --> 03:21:14.880
Yeah, it's gone. Yeah.

03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:22.880
So you can't do this kind of hopping around through the Internet with this kind of verification that grounds you to physical reality.

03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:26.880
It's a really, really interesting idea. Why haven't that hasn't that been done?

03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:29.880
I think you need two things.

03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:35.880
You need an idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin that's a bearer instrument for final settlement.

03:21:35.880 --> 03:21:45.880
And then you need a high speed transaction network like Lightning, where the transaction cost might be a twentieth of a penny or less.

03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:54.880
And if you roll the clock back 24 months, I don't think you had the Lightning network in a stable point.

03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:59.880
It's really just the past 12 months. It's an idea you could think about this year.

03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:08.880
And I think you need to you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary speculative asset.

03:22:08.880 --> 03:22:12.880
So I really think we're just the beginning, the embryonic stage.

03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:18.880
I have to ask Michael Saylor, you said before there's no second best to Bitcoin.

03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:20.880
What would be the second best?

03:22:21.880 --> 03:22:30.880
Traditionally, there's Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano with proof of stake, Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains.

03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:35.880
Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme.

03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:38.880
Privacy with Monero. I just can keep going.

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:47.880
There's, of course, after the block size wars, the different offshoots of Bitcoin.

03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:53.880
I think if you if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you've got crypto property.

03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:55.880
Bitcoin is the king of that.

03:22:55.880 --> 03:23:06.880
You know, and other Bitcoin forks that wanted to be a bearer instrument store of value would be a property, a Bitcoin cash or Litecoin, something like that.

03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:09.880
Then you've got crypto currencies.

03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:23.880
I don't think I don't think Bitcoin is a currency because a currency I define in nation states since a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction without incurring a taxable obligation.

03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:29.880
So that means has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable yen, a stable coin.

03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:33.880
So I think you've got crypto currencies, Tether, Circle, most famous.

03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:44.880
Then you've got crypto platforms, you know, and Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms, the platform upon which, you know, with smart contract functionality, et cetera.

03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:46.880
And then I think you've got just crypto securities.

03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:50.880
It's just like my favorite whatever meme coin.

03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:52.880
And I love it because I love it.

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:56.880
And it's attached to my game or my company or my persona or my whatever.

03:23:56.880 --> 03:24:01.880
I think if you if you, you know, push me and said, well, what's the second best?

03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:03.880
I would say the world wants two things.

03:24:03.880 --> 03:24:09.880
It wants crypto property as a savings account and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account.

03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:16.880
And that means that the that the most popular thing really is going to be a stable coin dollar.

03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:19.880
Right. And there's a maybe a fight right now.

03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:29.880
Right. But a stable dollar, because I feel like the market opportunity, it's not clear that there'll be one that will win.

03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:36.880
The class of stable dollars is probably a one to ten trillion dollar market easily.

03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:43.880
I think that in a crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and Binance Smart Chain and and the like.

03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:47.880
Are there certain characteristics of any of them that kind of stand out to you?

03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:52.880
Do you don't you think the competition is based on a set of features?

03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:59.880
Also, so the set of features that the cryptocurrency provides, but also the community that it provides,

03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:05.880
the community matters and sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption, both across the developers and the investors.

03:25:05.880 --> 03:25:11.880
If I'm looking at them, I mean, the first question is, is what's the regulatory risk?

03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:14.880
How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security?

03:25:14.880 --> 03:25:18.880
And the second is, is what's the competitive risk?

03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:20.880
And the third is what's the speed in the performance?

03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:27.880
And, you know, all those things, you know, lead to the question of what's the security risk?

03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:32.880
How likely is it to crash and burn and and how stable or unstable is it?

03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:35.880
And then there's the mark, you know, the marketing risk.

03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:40.880
I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and and communities behind them.

03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:47.880
I think that the the big cloud looming over the crypto industry

03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:53.880
is regulatory treatment of crypto currencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms.

03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:57.880
And I think that won't be determined until the end of the first Biden administration.

03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:01.880
For example, there are people that would like only U.S.

03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:05.880
U.S. FDIC insured banks to issue crypto currencies.

03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:11.880
They want JP Morgan to issue a crypto dollar backed one to one.

03:26:11.880 --> 03:26:17.880
But then in the U.S. right now, we have Circle and we have other companies that are licensed entities

03:26:17.880 --> 03:26:22.880
that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but they're not FDIC insured banks.

03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:27.880
There's also a debate in Congress about whether state chartered banks should be able to issue these things.

03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:34.880
And then we have Tether and and others that are outside of the U.S. jurisdiction.

03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:36.880
They're probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents.

03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:39.880
They're backed by stuff. And we don't know what stuff.

03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:46.880
And then finally, you have, you know, UST and die, which are algorithmic stable coins, right,

03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:51.880
that are even more innovative further outside the compliance framework.

03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:56.880
So if you ask who's going to win, the question is really, I don't know,

03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:02.880
will the market decide or will the regulators decide if the regulators get out of the way in the market?

03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:05.880
Well, then it's an interesting discussion.

03:27:05.880 --> 03:27:10.880
And then I think that all bets are off if if the regulators get more heavy handed with this.

03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:17.880
And I think you could have the same discussion with crypto properties like like the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges.

03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:20.880
The SEC would like to regulate the crypto exchanges.

03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:22.880
They'd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges.

03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:28.880
That means they may regulate the crypto platforms and at what rate and in what fashion.

03:27:28.880 --> 03:27:36.880
And so I think that I could give you an opinion if if it was limited to competition and the current regulatory regime.

03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:47.880
But I think that the regulations are so fast moving and it's so uncertain that it's it.

03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:54.880
You can't make a decision without considering the potential actions of the regulators.

03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:57.880
I hope the regulators get out of the way.

03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:08.880
Can you still man the case that Dogecoin is, I guess, the second best cryptocurrency if you don't consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but instead a crypto property?

03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:12.880
I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency.

03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:19.880
So unless your crypto asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value, the dollar is not a currency.

03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:22.880
It's a property or it's an asset.

03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:32.880
So then can you still man the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then because Bitcoin is not even in that list.

03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:35.880
The debate is going to be whether it's property or security.

03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:38.880
And there's a debate whether it's decentralized enough.

03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:41.880
So let's assume it was decentralized.

03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:49.880
Well, it's it's increasing at not quite five, what, five percent a year inflation rate, but it's it's not five percent exponentially.

03:28:49.880 --> 03:28:53.880
It's like a plus five million five percent something.

03:28:53.880 --> 03:28:55.880
Captain is less.

03:28:55.880 --> 03:28:59.880
I forget the exact number, but it's an inflationary property.

03:28:59.880 --> 03:29:09.880
It's got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar and it's got a much lower inflation rate than than many other fiat currencies.

03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:11.880
So I think you could say that.

03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:24.880
But don't you see the power of meme, the power of ideas, the power of fun or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community?

03:29:24.880 --> 03:29:26.880
I do. But there are meme stocks.

03:29:26.880 --> 03:29:33.880
It doesn't absolve you of your ethical and securities liabilities if you're you know, if you're promoting it.

03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:38.880
So like like I don't have a problem with like people buying a stock.

03:29:38.880 --> 03:29:42.880
It's just the way I divide the world is right.

03:29:42.880 --> 03:29:48.880
There's investment, there's saving and there's speculation and there's trading.

03:29:48.880 --> 03:29:52.880
So Bitcoin is an asset for saving.

03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:59.880
If you want to save money for a hundred years, you don't really want to take on execution risk or the like.

03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:06.880
So you're just buying something to hold forever for you to actually endorse something as a property.

03:30:06.880 --> 03:30:10.880
Like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next hundred years?

03:30:10.880 --> 03:30:16.880
I say, well, some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin.

03:30:16.880 --> 03:30:19.880
Right. You can run your company. Right.

03:30:19.880 --> 03:30:23.880
But running your company is an investment. So the savings are properties.

03:30:23.880 --> 03:30:28.880
If you said, what should I invest in? I'd say, well, here's a list of good companies, private companies.

03:30:28.880 --> 03:30:33.880
You can start your own company. That's an investment. Right.

03:30:33.880 --> 03:30:38.880
If you said, what should I trade? Well, trading is like a proprietary thing.

03:30:38.880 --> 03:30:43.880
I don't have any special insight into that. If you're a good trader, you know you are.

03:30:43.880 --> 03:30:50.880
If you said to me, what should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks and meme coins.

03:30:50.880 --> 03:30:53.880
And it kind of sits up there.

03:30:53.880 --> 03:30:59.880
It sits right in the same space with what horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on?

03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:03.880
And should you bet on black six times in a row and double down each time?

03:31:03.880 --> 03:31:11.880
I mean, it's fun. But at the end of the day, it's a speculation. Right.

03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:17.880
You can't build a civilization on speculation on it. It's not an institutional asset.

03:31:17.880 --> 03:31:22.880
And in fact, where I'd leave it, right, is Bitcoin is clearly digital privacy,

03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:28.880
which makes it an institutional grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure,

03:31:28.880 --> 03:31:31.880
a public investor or anybody that's risk adverse.

03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:38.880
I think that the other the top 100 other cryptos are like venture capital investments.

03:31:38.880 --> 03:31:43.880
And if you're a VC and if you're a qualified technical investor and you have a pool of capital

03:31:43.880 --> 03:31:48.880
and you can take that kind of risk, then you can parse through that and form opinions.

03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:56.880
It's just orders of magnitude more risky because of competition, because of ambition and because of regulation.

03:31:56.880 --> 03:32:02.880
And if you take the meme coins, it's like, you know, when some rapper comes out with a meme coin,

03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:06.880
it's like maybe it'll peak when I hear about it. Right.

03:32:06.880 --> 03:32:13.880
I mean, SHIB was created as the coin such that it had so many zeros after the decimal point

03:32:13.880 --> 03:32:19.880
that when you looked at it on the exchanges, it always showed zero, zero, zero, zero.

03:32:19.880 --> 03:32:25.880
And it wasn't until like six months after it got popular that they started expanding the display.

03:32:25.880 --> 03:32:28.880
So you could see whether the price had changed. That's speculation.

03:32:28.880 --> 03:32:35.880
You you've been maybe you can correct me, but you've been critical of Elon Musk in the past in the crypto space.

03:32:35.880 --> 03:32:40.880
Where do you stand on Elon's effect on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general these days?

03:32:40.880 --> 03:32:48.880
I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough for the human race that will cure half the problems in the world

03:32:48.880 --> 03:32:53.880
and generate hundreds of trillions of dollars of economic value to the civilization.

03:32:54.880 --> 03:33:02.880
And I believe that it's in an early stage where many people don't understand it and they're afraid of it.

03:33:02.880 --> 03:33:07.880
And there's FUD and there's uncertainty, there's doubt and there's fear.

03:33:07.880 --> 03:33:09.880
And it's a very noisy crypto world.

03:33:09.880 --> 03:33:15.880
And there's 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance.

03:33:15.880 --> 03:33:21.880
And I think most of the FUD is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs.

03:33:21.880 --> 03:33:28.880
So the environmental FUD and the other types of uncertainty that's around Bitcoin generally,

03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:31.880
they're not coming from legitimate environmentalists.

03:33:31.880 --> 03:33:34.880
They don't come from legitimate critics.

03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:44.880
They actually are guerrilla marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs

03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:47.880
because they have an interest in doing so.

03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:52.880
So if I look at the constructive path forward,

03:33:52.880 --> 03:34:01.880
first, I think it'd be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build applications on top of it.

03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:04.880
You don't need to fix it.

03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:06.880
There's nothing wrong with it, right?

03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:12.880
Like when you put it on a layer two and a layer three, it moves a billion times a second at the speed of light.

03:34:12.880 --> 03:34:18.880
So every beautiful, cool DeFi application, every crypto application,

03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:25.880
everything you could imagine you might want to do, you can do with a legitimate company

03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:35.880
and a legitimate website or mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or lightning if you want to.

03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:41.880
So I think that to the extent that people do that, that's going to be better for the world.

03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:48.880
If you consider what holds people back, I think it's just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is.

03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:52.880
So I'm a big fan of just educating people.

03:34:52.880 --> 03:34:58.880
If you're not going to commercialize it, then just educate people on what it is.

03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:05.880
So for example, Bitcoin is the most efficient use of energy in the world by far.

03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:09.880
Most people don't necessarily perceive that or realize that.

03:35:09.880 --> 03:35:13.880
But if you were to take any metric, energy intensity,

03:35:13.880 --> 03:35:21.880
you put like $2 billion worth of electricity in the network every year and it's worth $850 billion.

03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:27.880
There is no industry in the real world that is that energy efficient.

03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:31.880
Not only that energy efficient, it's also the most sustainable industry.

03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:33.880
We do surveys.

03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:37.880
58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable.

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:40.880
So there's a very good story.

03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:47.880
In fact, every other industry, planes, trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine, everything else,

03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:51.880
it's less clean, less efficient.

03:35:51.880 --> 03:35:53.880
So the basic debate was...

03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:55.880
I wouldn't say there is a debate.

03:35:55.880 --> 03:35:59.880
I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community had any issue with Elon,

03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:09.880
it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled in a couple of his tweets,

03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:12.880
which I think just is very distracting.

03:36:12.880 --> 03:36:13.880
Well, that was one of them.

03:36:13.880 --> 03:36:17.880
But I think it's like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally the crypto community,

03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:28.880
what you call the crypto entrepreneurs, are also using it for investment, for speculation.

03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:36.880
And therefore get very passionate about people's celebrities, including you, like famous people,

03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:47.880
saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto thing you can buy in Coinbase.

03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:53.880
And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk, that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not,

03:36:53.880 --> 03:36:59.880
and then promoting Dogecoin, then not, and this kind of...

03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:04.880
There's so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic.

03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:07.880
And I think that's where a lot of the...

03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:10.880
Look, I don't have a criticism of Elon Musk.

03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:13.880
He's free to do whatever he wishes to do.

03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:20.880
In fact, Elon Musk is the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world.

03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:24.880
I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit.

03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:28.880
It tends to be very, very self-critical.

03:37:28.880 --> 03:37:33.880
And instead of saying, well, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin

03:37:33.880 --> 03:37:39.880
than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money.

03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:42.880
They focus upon...

03:37:42.880 --> 03:37:45.880
Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just...

03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:48.880
I mean, I think he's free to do what he wants to do.

03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:51.880
And I think he's done a lot of good for Bitcoin

03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:55.880
in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it.

03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:59.880
And I think that sent a very powerful message.

03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:01.880
Do you have advice for young people?

03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:04.880
So you've had a heck of a life.

03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:10.880
You've done quite a lot of things before MIT, but starting with MIT.

03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:14.880
Is there advice you have for young people in high school and college?

03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:20.880
How to have a career they can be proud of,

03:38:20.880 --> 03:38:23.880
how to have a life they can be proud of?

03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:30.880
I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children.

03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:33.880
He had twins when they enter adulthood.

03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:36.880
He said, give me your advice for them in a letter.

03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:41.880
I'm going to give it to them when they turn 21 or something.

03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:45.880
I was at a party, and then he handed me this sheet of paper.

03:38:45.880 --> 03:38:47.880
I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right now.

03:38:47.880 --> 03:38:49.880
So I sat down, I started writing, and I figured,

03:38:49.880 --> 03:38:53.880
what would you want to tell someone at age 21?

03:38:53.880 --> 03:38:54.880
You wrote it down.

03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:55.880
So I wrote it down.

03:38:55.880 --> 03:38:58.880
Then I tweeted it, and it's sitting on Twitter, but I tell you what I said.

03:38:58.880 --> 03:39:01.880
I said, my advice if you're entering adulthood,

03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:10.880
focus your energy, guard your time, train your mind,

03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:18.880
train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends,

03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:24.880
curate your environment, keep your promises,

03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:30.880
stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world.

03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:31.880
That was the 10.

03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:32.880
Upgrade the world.

03:39:32.880 --> 03:39:35.880
That's an interesting choice of words.

03:39:35.880 --> 03:39:37.880
Upgrade the world.

03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:39.880
Upgrade the world.

03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:40.880
It's like an engineer's credit.

03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:41.880
Focus your energy.

03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:48.880
Yeah, it's a very engineering-themed, keep your promises, too.

03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:50.880
That's an interesting one.

03:39:50.880 --> 03:39:56.880
I think most people suffer because they don't focus.

03:39:56.880 --> 03:40:01.880
I think the big risk in this world is there's too much of everything.

03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:05.880
You can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week,

03:40:05.880 --> 03:40:08.880
and you'll never get through all the chess videos.

03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:14.880
There's too much of every possible thing, too much of every good thing.

03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:21.880
Figuring out what you want to do, and then everything will suck up your time.

03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:24.880
There's 100 streaming channels to binge watch on.

03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:29.880
You've got to guard your time, and then train your body, train your mind,

03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:35.880
and control who's around you, control what surrounds you.

03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:41.880
Ultimately, in a world where there's too much of everything, then...

03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:43.880
It's like those laser eyes.

03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:44.880
It's like those laser eyes.

03:40:44.880 --> 03:40:50.880
You have to focus on just a few of those things.

03:40:50.880 --> 03:40:51.880
Yeah.

03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:55.880
I got 1,000 opinions we could talk about, and I could pursue 1,000 things,

03:40:55.880 --> 03:40:57.880
but I don't expect to be successful.

03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:04.880
And I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more valid

03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:07.880
than the leader of thought in that area.

03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:12.880
So how about if I just focus upon one thing

03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:16.880
and then deliver the best I can in the one thing?

03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:19.880
That's the laser eye message.

03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:21.880
The rest get you distracted.

03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:22.880
How do you achieve that?

03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:23.880
How do you achieve that?

03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:29.880
Do you find yourself, given where you are in life, having to say no a lot?

03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:33.880
Or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything around you?

03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:36.880
So how do you achieve that focus?

03:41:36.880 --> 03:41:39.880
I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.

03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:42.880
So everything about you just radiates that.

03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:43.880
People know.

03:41:43.880 --> 03:41:47.880
If they know what you're focused on, then you won't get

03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:50.880
so many other things coming your way.

03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:58.880
If you dally or if you flirt with 27 different things,

03:41:58.880 --> 03:42:03.880
then you're going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right?

03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:08.880
You mentioned getting a PhD and giving your roots at MIT.

03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:14.880
Do you think there's all kinds of journeys you can take to educate yourself?

03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:19.880
Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?

03:42:19.880 --> 03:42:22.880
Or is there other paths through life that...

03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:24.880
Is it worth it if you have to pay for it?

03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:26.880
Is it worth it if you have to spend the time on it?

03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:30.880
The time and the money is a big cost.

03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:32.880
I think...

03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:34.880
Time probably the bigger one, right?

03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:39.880
It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists.

03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:46.880
It wants you to be an expert and to focus on one area.

03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.880
It's punishing generalist jack of all trades,

03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:54.880
especially people that are generalists in the physical realm.

03:42:54.880 --> 03:42:57.880
Because if you're a specialist in the digital realm, you might very well...

03:42:57.880 --> 03:43:02.880
You're the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter

03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:04.880
and you show them how to tie knots.

03:43:04.880 --> 03:43:09.880
Or you're the banjo player with 1.8 million followers

03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:13.880
and whenever he types banjo, it's you, right?

03:43:13.880 --> 03:43:18.880
And so the world wants people that do something well

03:43:18.880 --> 03:43:25.880
and then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them.

03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:27.880
And so that argues in favor of focus.

03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:32.880
Now, I mean, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education

03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:34.880
that they're capable of or have made.

03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:39.880
I guess to get a PhD, technically, you have to have done a dissertation

03:43:40.880 --> 03:43:45.880
where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge, right?

03:43:45.880 --> 03:43:48.880
And if you haven't done that, technically, you have a master's degree,

03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:50.880
but you're not a doctor.

03:43:50.880 --> 03:43:55.880
So if you're interested in any of the academic disciplines

03:43:55.880 --> 03:43:58.880
that a PhD would be granted for,

03:43:58.880 --> 03:44:01.880
then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit.

03:44:01.880 --> 03:44:05.880
But there are many people that are specialists...

03:44:05.880 --> 03:44:07.880
You know the agimator?

03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:10.880
The agimator on YouTube.

03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:13.880
He's the world's greatest chess commentator.

03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:18.880
And I've watched his career and he's got progressively better and he's really good.

03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:20.880
He's going to love hearing this.

03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:23.880
Yeah, if the agimator ever hears this, I'm a big fan of the agimator.

03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:25.880
I have to cut myself off, right?

03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:30.880
Because otherwise you'll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend.

03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:36.880
But the point really is YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something.

03:44:36.880 --> 03:44:39.880
And they rise to the top of their profession.

03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:44.880
And Twitter is too, and the internet is.

03:44:44.880 --> 03:44:51.880
So I would advocate that you figure out what you're passionate about

03:44:51.880 --> 03:44:56.880
and what you're good at, and you do focus on it.

03:44:56.880 --> 03:45:01.880
Especially if the thing that you're doing can be automated.

03:45:02.880 --> 03:45:08.880
The problem is, back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment,

03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:11.880
the problem is if it is possible to be automated,

03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:15.880
then over time someone's probably going to automate it.

03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:22.880
And that squeezes the state space of everybody else.

03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:27.880
Like after the lockdowns, it used to be there were all these local bands

03:45:27.880 --> 03:45:31.880
that played in bars and everybody went to the bar to see the local band.

03:45:31.880 --> 03:45:36.880
And then during the lockdown, you would have like these six super groups

03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:40.880
and they would all get 500,000 or a million followers.

03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:47.880
And all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all.

03:45:47.880 --> 03:45:51.880
Well, the interesting thing is one of those 500,000 algebra teachers

03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:54.880
is likely to be part of the automation.

03:45:54.880 --> 03:46:02.880
It's an opportunity for you to think, where's my field, my discipline evolving into?

03:46:02.880 --> 03:46:06.880
I talked to a bunch of librarians, just happened to be friends with librarians.

03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:10.880
And libraries will probably be evolving.

03:46:10.880 --> 03:46:17.880
And it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.

03:46:17.880 --> 03:46:20.880
If you're going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays,

03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:23.880
I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play.

03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:26.880
I want you to be the Shakespeare dude, because once I...

03:46:26.880 --> 03:46:29.880
Just like Lex, you're like...

03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:31.880
I don't know what kind of...

03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:35.880
You're the deep thinking podcaster, right?

03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:42.880
You're the podcaster that goes after the deep intellectual conversations.

03:46:42.880 --> 03:46:49.880
And once I get comfortable with you and I like you, then I start binge watching Lex.

03:46:49.880 --> 03:46:54.880
But if you changed your format through 16 different formats

03:46:54.880 --> 03:46:58.880
so that you could compete with 16 different other personalities on YouTube,

03:46:58.880 --> 03:47:02.880
you probably wouldn't beat any of them, right?

03:47:02.880 --> 03:47:04.880
You would probably just kind of sink into the...

03:47:04.880 --> 03:47:06.880
You're the number two or number three guy.

03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:09.880
You're not the number one guy in the format.

03:47:09.880 --> 03:47:13.880
And I think that the algorithm, right?

03:47:13.880 --> 03:47:16.880
The Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithm,

03:47:16.880 --> 03:47:21.880
really reward the person that's focused on message, consistent.

03:47:21.880 --> 03:47:26.880
The world wants somebody they can trust that's consistent and reliable.

03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:30.880
And they kind of want to know what they're getting into because...

03:47:30.880 --> 03:47:33.880
And this is taken for granted maybe,

03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:39.880
but there's 10 million people vying for every hour of your time.

03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:45.880
And so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all is a huge privilege, right?

03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:49.880
And you should be thanking them and you should respect their time.

03:47:49.880 --> 03:47:52.880
It's interesting. Everything you said is very interesting.

03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:56.880
But of course, from my perspective and probably from your perspective,

03:47:56.880 --> 03:47:59.880
my actual life has nothing to do with...

03:47:59.880 --> 03:48:01.880
It's just being focused on stuff.

03:48:01.880 --> 03:48:07.880
And in my case, it's like focus on doing the thing I really enjoy doing

03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:10.880
and being myself and not caring about anything else.

03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:14.880
Like I don't care about views or likes or attention.

03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:17.880
And just maintaining that focus is the way,

03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:20.880
from an individual perspective, you live that life.

03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:23.880
But yeah, it does seem that there's...

03:48:23.880 --> 03:48:27.880
The world and technology is rewarding the specialization

03:48:27.880 --> 03:48:32.880
and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations.

03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:34.880
And that lifts all boats actually,

03:48:34.880 --> 03:48:37.880
because the specializations get better and better and better

03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:41.880
at teaching people to do specific things and they educate themselves.

03:48:41.880 --> 03:48:44.880
It's just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable

03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:46.880
and more and more empowered.

03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:51.880
The reward for authenticity more than offsets the specificity

03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:53.880
with which you pursue your mission.

03:48:53.880 --> 03:48:55.880
That's true.

03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:58.880
Another way to say it is nobody wants to read advertising.

03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:03.880
If you were to spend $100 million advertising your thing,

03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:06.880
I probably wouldn't want to watch it.

03:49:06.880 --> 03:49:08.880
That's so fascinating.

03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:10.880
We see the death of that.

03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:15.880
And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences

03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:19.880
and the authentic specialists or the authentic artists

03:49:19.880 --> 03:49:23.880
are gaining their audience.

03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:25.880
And that's a beautiful thing.

03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:29.880
Speaking of deep thinking, you're just a human.

03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:31.880
Your life ends.

03:49:31.880 --> 03:49:36.880
You've accumulated so much wisdom, so much money.

03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:37.880
But the ride ends.

03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:39.880
Do you think about that?

03:49:39.880 --> 03:49:42.880
Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:45.880
Are you afraid of it?

03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:50.880
When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation

03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:54.880
and the foundation's mission is to make education free for everybody forever.

03:49:54.880 --> 03:50:04.880
And if I'm able to contribute to the creation of a more perfect monetary system,

03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:07.880
then maybe that foundation will go on forever.

03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:09.880
The idea.

03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:11.880
The foundation of the idea.

03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:15.880
Each of the foundations.

03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:18.880
It's not clear we're on the S-curve of immortal life yet.

03:50:18.880 --> 03:50:20.880
That's a biological question.

03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:24.880
And you ask that on some of your other interviews a lot.

03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:31.880
I think that we are on the threshold of immortal life for ideas

03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:37.880
or immortal life for certain institutions or computer programs.

03:50:37.880 --> 03:50:44.880
So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected endowment.

03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:48.880
And then the question really is, what are your ideas?

03:50:48.880 --> 03:50:50.880
What do you want to leave behind?

03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:53.880
And so if it's a park, then you endow the park.

03:50:53.880 --> 03:50:56.880
If it's free education, you endow that.

03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:01.880
But if it's some other ethical idea, right?

03:51:01.880 --> 03:51:07.880
Does it make you sad that there's something that you've endowed,

03:51:07.880 --> 03:51:16.880
some very powerful idea of digital energy that you help put into the world?

03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:24.880
And your mind, your conscious mind, will no longer be there to experience it.

03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:26.880
It's just gone forever.

03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:31.880
I'd rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is

03:51:31.880 --> 03:51:35.880
you should do your part during some phase of the journey,

03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:38.880
and then you should get out of the way.

03:51:38.880 --> 03:51:43.880
I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect

03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:47.880
in a very famous speech one day, which is,

03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:52.880
death is a natural part of life and it makes way for the next generation.

03:51:52.880 --> 03:51:57.880
And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right?

03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:00.880
You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way.

03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:09.880
And I think when that breaks down, bad things happen.

03:52:09.880 --> 03:52:14.880
I think nature cleanses itself. There's a cycle of life.

03:52:14.880 --> 03:52:19.880
And speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington.

03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:27.880
So hopefully when you get out of the way, nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.

03:52:27.880 --> 03:52:32.880
What do you think, to do a bit of a callback,

03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:34.880
what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:52:34.880 --> 03:52:36.880
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

03:52:36.880 --> 03:52:39.880
We talked about the rise of human civilization.

03:52:39.880 --> 03:52:43.880
It seems like we're engineers at heart. We build cool stuff.

03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:48.880
Better and better use of energy, channeling energy to be productive.

03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:54.880
Why? What's it all for?

03:52:54.880 --> 03:52:56.880
You're getting metaphysical on me.

03:52:56.880 --> 03:52:58.880
Very. There's a beautiful boat to the left of us.

03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:03.880
Like, why do we do that? This boat that sailed the ocean.

03:53:03.880 --> 03:53:07.880
Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past.

03:53:07.880 --> 03:53:11.880
To engineer is divine.

03:53:11.880 --> 03:53:13.880
You can make lots of arguments as to why we're here.

03:53:13.880 --> 03:53:21.880
We're either here to entertain ourselves or we're here to create something that's beautiful or something that's functional.

03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:26.880
I think if you're an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that's both beautiful and functional.

03:53:26.880 --> 03:53:32.880
So I think all three of those things, it's entertaining, but it's ethical.

03:53:32.880 --> 03:53:39.880
You got to admire the first person that built a bridge, crossing a chasm,

03:53:39.880 --> 03:53:44.880
the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village,

03:53:44.880 --> 03:53:53.880
the first person to figure out how to dam up a river or master agriculture.

03:53:53.880 --> 03:53:57.880
The guy that figured out how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards,

03:53:57.880 --> 03:54:02.880
and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees, he's pretty proud of himself.

03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:04.880
So that's functional.

03:54:04.880 --> 03:54:08.880
There is also something to that, just like you said, that's just beautiful.

03:54:08.880 --> 03:54:14.880
It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine.

03:54:14.880 --> 03:54:21.880
Something, when you step back and look at the entirety of it,

03:54:21.880 --> 03:54:27.880
a collective of humans using a beautiful invention or creation,

03:54:27.880 --> 03:54:37.880
or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music.

03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:40.880
That seems just right. That's what we're here for.

03:54:40.880 --> 03:54:43.880
Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that.

03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:47.880
And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective,

03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:52.880
the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty.

03:54:52.880 --> 03:54:58.880
Isn't there something beautiful about making the world a better place for people that you love,

03:54:58.880 --> 03:55:03.880
your friends, your family, or yourself?

03:55:03.880 --> 03:55:11.880
When you think about the entire arc of human existence,

03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:14.880
and you roll the clock back 500,000 years,

03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:18.880
and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us

03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:23.880
and everything they had to overcome in order to put you here right now,

03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:29.880
you know, you kind of, you got to admire that, right? You got to respect that.

03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:35.880
That's a heck of a gift they gave us. It's also a heck of a responsibility.

03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:38.880
Don't screw it up.

03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:43.880
If I dropped you 500,000 years ago and I said, figure out steel refining,

03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:51.880
or, you know, figure out silicon chips, fab reproduction, or whatever it is.

03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:53.880
To fly or fire.

03:55:53.880 --> 03:56:00.880
And so now we're here, and I guess the way you repay them is you fix everything in front of your face you can, right?

03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:07.880
And that means to someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet, right?

03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:13.880
To someone like me, it's like, I think, you know, fix the energy in the system.

03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:16.880
And that gives me hope. Michael, this was an incredible conversation.

03:56:16.880 --> 03:56:20.880
You're an incredible human. It's a huge honor you would sit down with me.

03:56:20.880 --> 03:56:22.880
Thank you so much for talking to me.

03:56:22.880 --> 03:56:24.880
Thanks for having me, Lex.

03:56:24.880 --> 03:56:27.880
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Saylor.

03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:31.880
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:56:31.880 --> 03:56:35.880
And now, let me leave you with a few words from Francis Bacon.

03:56:35.880 --> 03:56:40.880
Money is a great servant, but a bad master.

03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:44.880
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
