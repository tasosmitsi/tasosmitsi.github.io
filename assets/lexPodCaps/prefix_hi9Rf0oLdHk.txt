Do you think he is incompetent, insane, or evil?

00:06.140 --> 00:09.280
The following is a conversation with Coffee Zilla,

00:09.280 --> 00:10.920
an investigator and journalist

00:10.920 --> 00:14.160
exposing frauds, scams, and fake gurus.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.640
He's one of the most important journalistic voices

00:16.640 --> 00:18.260
we have working today,

00:18.260 --> 00:21.080
both in terms of his integrity and fearlessness

00:21.080 --> 00:23.320
in the pursuit of truth.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.480

00:34.320 --> 00:37.540
And now, dear friends, here's Coffee Zilla.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.280
How do you like your coffee?

00:40.280 --> 00:42.120
Dark and soul crushing?

00:42.120 --> 00:44.660
That was the number one question on the internet.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.480
Do you like your coffee to reverberate deeply

00:47.480 --> 00:49.080
through the worst of human nature?

00:49.080 --> 00:50.420
Is that how you drink your coffee?

00:50.420 --> 00:52.600
I've gone through a lot of phases on coffee.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.600
I used to, in college, I would go super deep

00:56.600 --> 01:00.920
into grinding fresh beans, all of that kind of stuff,

01:00.920 --> 01:03.600
water temperature exactly right.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.600
And then I hit a phase where I was just,

01:05.600 --> 01:07.640
it was the maintenance dose.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.400
Then I went to espresso because I could get a lot more in.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.520
And now I go through phases of like,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.580
sometimes I like it with a little oat milk,

01:15.580 --> 01:17.560
sometimes a little half and half in sugar.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.080
Oh, you've gotten soft in your old age.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.320
I've gone a little, I have.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.300
But hey, if I'm doing a SPF interview,

01:23.300 --> 01:25.040
it's black that day, nothing less.

01:25.040 --> 01:25.880
Yeah.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.360
The lights go down.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.040
What do you actually do in those situations,

01:30.040 --> 01:32.640
like leading up to a show, do you get hyped up?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.840
Like, how do you put yourself in the right mind space

01:34.840 --> 01:37.340
to explore some of these really difficult topics?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.280
I think a lot of it's preparation.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.120
And then once it happens,

01:43.120 --> 01:46.300
it's mostly fueled by sort of adrenaline, I would say.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.800
I really deeply care about getting to like,

01:50.800 --> 01:52.640
the root cause of some of these issues,

01:52.640 --> 01:55.260
because I think so often people

01:55.260 --> 01:57.540
in positions of power are led off the hook.

01:57.540 --> 02:00.500
So I really care about holding their feet to the fire

02:00.500 --> 02:04.380
and it translates into like, a lot of energy the day of.

02:04.380 --> 02:07.180
So I never find myself like, funny enough,

02:07.180 --> 02:09.820
I usually drink a lot of caffeine leading up

02:09.820 --> 02:12.900
to the interview, and then I try to drink like minimum

02:12.900 --> 02:14.980
the day of because I have so much adrenaline,

02:14.980 --> 02:17.260
I don't wanna be like hyper stimulated.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.940
I have to say, of all the recent guests I've had,

02:20.940 --> 02:23.980
the energy you had when you walked into the door

02:24.580 --> 02:25.420
was pretty intense.

02:25.420 --> 02:29.220
I'm excited, are people not excited to be here?

02:29.220 --> 02:30.060
I don't know.

02:30.060 --> 02:30.900
I think they're scared.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.720
And you're a big deal, Lex, I mean,

02:31.720 --> 02:32.560
I don't know if you know.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.460
I felt like you were gonna knock down the door or something.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.580
You were very excited.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.420
Like that just energy.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.980
It was terrifying because I'm terrified

02:39.980 --> 02:41.100
of social interaction.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.420
Anyway, speaking of terrifying.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.860
You chose a good living of interviewing people.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.540
Face your fears, my friend.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.940
So let's talk about SBF and FTX.

02:50.940 --> 02:53.820
Who is Sam Banquin Fried?

02:54.660 --> 02:56.220
Can you tell the story from the beginning

02:56.220 --> 02:57.580
as you understand it?

02:57.580 --> 03:02.040
Yeah, so Sam Banquin Fried is a kid who grew up

03:02.040 --> 03:04.500
sort of from a position of huge privilege.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.520
Both his parents are lawyers.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.580
I believe both of them were from Harvard.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.620
He went to MIT, went to like,

03:10.620 --> 03:11.940
or sorry, backing up a bit more.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.300
He went to like this top prep high school,

03:14.300 --> 03:17.700
then to MIT, then he went to Jane Street.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.140
And after that, he started a trading firm

03:20.140 --> 03:22.940
in I think 2017 called Alameda Research

03:22.980 --> 03:24.180
with a few friends.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.760
Some of them were from Jane Street.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.380
Some of them worked at Google.

03:27.380 --> 03:31.140
And they were sort of the smartest kids on the block

03:31.140 --> 03:32.580
or that's what everyone thought.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.500
They made a lot of their money

03:33.500 --> 03:35.460
on something called the kimchi premium

03:35.460 --> 03:38.620
or at least the story goes, which just to explain that,

03:38.620 --> 03:42.240
the price of Bitcoin in Korea was substantially higher

03:42.240 --> 03:43.820
than in the rest of the world.

03:43.820 --> 03:47.100
And so you could arbitrage that by buying Bitcoin elsewhere

03:47.100 --> 03:48.660
and selling it on a Korean exchange.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.160
So they made their money early,

03:51.160 --> 03:53.160
doing kind of smart trades like that.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.360
They flipped that into market making,

03:55.360 --> 03:57.420
which they were pretty early on that,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.680
just providing liquidity to an exchange.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.400
And it's a strategy that is considered delta neutral,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.360
which means basically if you take kind of both sides

04:07.360 --> 04:09.760
of the trade and you're making a spread,

04:09.760 --> 04:11.840
like a fee on that, you make money,

04:11.840 --> 04:13.480
whether it goes up or down.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.240
So in theory, there shouldn't be that much risk

04:15.240 --> 04:16.520
associated with it.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.880
So Alameda kind of blew up

04:18.880 --> 04:21.420
because they would offer these people,

04:21.420 --> 04:22.680
people who are giving out loans, they'd say,

04:22.680 --> 04:25.560
hey, we'll give you this really attractive rate of return

04:25.560 --> 04:29.000
and we're doing strategies that seemingly are low risk.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.780
So we're a low risk bet.

04:30.780 --> 04:32.480
We're these smart kids from Jane Street

04:32.480 --> 04:36.000
and you can kind of trust us to be this smarter

04:36.000 --> 04:37.640
than everyone else kind of thing.

04:37.640 --> 04:42.640
Around 2019, Sam started FTX, which is an exchange.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.200
Specifically, it specialized in derivatives.

04:47.240 --> 04:52.120
So like margins, kind of more sophisticated crypto products.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.480
And it got in with Binance early on.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.440
So Binance actually has a prior relationship to FTX,

04:58.440 --> 04:59.760
which we'll explore in a second

04:59.760 --> 05:01.000
because they're gonna play a role

05:01.000 --> 05:02.600
in FTX's collapse actually.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.400
Binance is the number one crypto exchange

05:05.400 --> 05:09.080
and they're led by, he's called CZ on Twitter.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.920
I don't wanna butcher his full name,

05:10.920 --> 05:15.240
but really smart guy has played his hand really well

05:15.240 --> 05:18.720
and built up a quite large exchange.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.760
And Binance was funding a bunch of different startups.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.160
So they funded, they helped invest into FTX early on.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.540
They invested 100 million.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.760
So these guys were kind of like teammates early on,

05:28.760 --> 05:33.160
SBF and CZ and FTX quickly grew.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.120
They got like, especially in 2020, 2021,

05:36.120 --> 05:38.060
they got a lot of endorsements.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.800
They got a lot of credibility in the space

05:40.800 --> 05:43.920
and eventually FTX actually bought out Binance.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.360
They gave them $2 billion.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.580
So pretty good investment for CZ in a couple of years.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.800
And now lead that up to 2022, what happens?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.820
Luna collapse, three arrows, capital collapse,

05:56.820 --> 05:57.660
which if you don't know,

05:57.660 --> 06:00.880
there's just these kind of cataclysmic events in crypto

06:00.880 --> 06:02.820
led by some pretty risky behavior,

06:02.820 --> 06:04.640
whether Luna was a token

06:04.640 --> 06:06.480
that promised really attractive returns

06:06.480 --> 06:08.480
that were unsustainable ultimately,

06:08.480 --> 06:09.940
and it just kind of spiraled.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.800
It did what's called a stable coin death spiral,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.520
which we can talk about if we need to.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.780
A stable coin death spiral.

06:15.780 --> 06:18.800
I can't wait till that like actually enters the lexicon,

06:18.800 --> 06:20.400
like a Wikipedia page on it,

06:20.400 --> 06:24.080
like economic students are learning in a school.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.400
That's like a chapter in a book.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.240
Anyway, I mean, this is the reality of our world.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.600
This is a really big part of the economic system

06:31.600 --> 06:34.140
is cryptocurrency and stable coin is part of that.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.120
Yeah, it's weird because on the one hand,

06:36.120 --> 06:39.060
cryptocurrency is supposed to somewhat simplify

06:39.060 --> 06:41.880
or add transparency to the financial markets.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.080
The idea is for the first time,

06:43.080 --> 06:44.620
you don't have to wait for an SEC filing

06:44.620 --> 06:46.360
from some corporate business.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.540
You can look at what they're doing on chain, right?

06:48.540 --> 06:51.700
So that's good because a lot of big financial problems

06:51.700 --> 06:53.840
are caused by lack of transparency

06:53.840 --> 06:55.760
and lack of understanding risk.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.160
But ironically, you get some people creating

06:59.160 --> 07:02.120
these arbitrarily complicated financial products

07:02.120 --> 07:03.680
like algorithmic stable coins,

07:03.680 --> 07:05.720
which then introduce more risk and blow everything up.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.280
So anyways, three arrows, capital blew up,

07:09.280 --> 07:10.800
and all of a sudden this crypto industry,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.600
which everyone thought was going to the moon,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.800
Bitcoin to 100,000, is in some trouble.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.680
And FTX seems like the only people who,

07:19.680 --> 07:22.560
besides like Binance, who's also really big and stable,

07:22.560 --> 07:25.160
and Coinbase, they seemed like they were doing fine.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.000
In fact, they were bailing out companies in the summer.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.200
I don't know if you remember that.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.120
SBF was likened to like Jamie Dimon,

07:32.120 --> 07:34.440
who's the CEO of Chase,

07:34.440 --> 07:36.540
who kind of was like the buck stops here.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.320
I'm like the backstop, right?

07:40.320 --> 07:42.580
So SBF was supporting the industry.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.420
He was like the stable guy.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.560
So come to like around October and November,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.140
there's all this talk about regulation.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.760
Everything's been blowing up.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.500
SBF's leading the charge on regulation.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.320
And CZ, the CEO of Binance, gets word

07:57.320 --> 08:00.280
that maybe SBF is kind of like cutting him out

08:00.280 --> 08:03.160
or making regulation that would maybe impact his business.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.880
And he doesn't like that too much.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.240
They start kind of feuding a little bit on Twitter.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.560
So when it comes out, a CoinDesk report came out

08:12.560 --> 08:16.340
that FTX's balance sheet wasn't looking that good.

08:16.340 --> 08:17.540
Like it looked pretty weak.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.240
They had a lot of coins that in theory had value

08:21.240 --> 08:23.200
if you looked at their market price.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.960
But for a variety of reasons,

08:25.960 --> 08:28.040
if you tried to sell them, they'd collapse in value.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.680
So it was sort of like this thing, a house built on sand.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.080
And a friend of mine on Twitter,

08:35.080 --> 08:36.620
he goes by Dirty Bubble Media.

08:36.620 --> 08:39.040
He released a report and he basically said,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.920
I think these guys are insolvent.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.360
Well, CZ saw that and he retweeted it

08:44.360 --> 08:47.300
and started adding fuel to the fire of like the speculation.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.140
Cause up till this point,

08:48.140 --> 08:50.700
everyone thought FTX is super safe, super secure.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.520
There's no reason to not keep your money there.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.860
Tom Brady keeps his money there, whatever.

08:54.860 --> 08:58.280
And CZ kind of adds fuel to the fire by saying,

08:58.280 --> 09:00.380
not only am I retweeting this,

09:00.380 --> 09:03.600
adding kind of like validity to this speculation,

09:03.600 --> 09:07.080
but also I'm going to take the FTT that I got,

09:07.080 --> 09:09.800
which part of their balance sheet was this FTT token,

09:09.800 --> 09:13.340
which is FTX is like proprietary token.

09:13.340 --> 09:18.140
And Alameda and FTX control a lot of it.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.300
They were using this token to basically be a large amount

09:22.300 --> 09:24.980
of collateral for their whole balance sheet.

09:24.980 --> 09:28.500
So it accounted for this huge amount of their value.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.860
And the CEO of Binance had a huge chunk of it as well.

09:31.860 --> 09:34.140
And he said, I'm going to sell all of it.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.940
And the fuel that that introduced to the market is,

09:37.760 --> 09:38.920
if he sells all this FTT,

09:38.920 --> 09:43.000
and this FTT is underwriting a lot of the value of FTX.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.080
Does FTTs almost approximate like similar things

09:47.080 --> 09:49.780
if you were to buy a stock in a public company?

09:49.780 --> 09:51.800
Is that kind of like a stock in FTX?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.080
It sort of was this proxy

09:54.080 --> 09:57.200
because what FTX was committed to doing

09:57.200 --> 10:00.600
was sort of like buying back FTT tokens.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.260
They would do this thing called the buy and burn.

10:02.260 --> 10:04.400
I think there was some amount of sharing

10:04.400 --> 10:07.180
in the revenue fees of FTX.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.180
It was kind of this convoluted thing.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.540
In my opinion, the exact value of FTT

10:11.540 --> 10:13.300
was speculated from the beginning.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.500
And it was clear that it was very tied

10:16.500 --> 10:18.980
to the performance of FTX,

10:18.980 --> 10:22.660
which is important because we'll get to later,

10:22.660 --> 10:26.500
FTX sort of built their whole scaffold on FTT,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.860
which meant that this scaffold was very wobbly.

10:28.860 --> 10:32.060
Because if FTX loses a little bit of confidence,

10:32.060 --> 10:33.500
then your value goes down.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.880
When your value goes down,

10:34.880 --> 10:37.200
you lose more confidence and this goes down.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.240
So it was kind of like this thing that this flywheel

10:40.240 --> 10:42.080
that when it was going well,

10:42.080 --> 10:43.760
you got huge amounts of growth.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.180
When it's going bad,

10:45.180 --> 10:49.320
you get a exchange death spiral, so to speak.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.960
Actually, this structure,

10:50.960 --> 10:53.200
it's a pretty nonstandard structure.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.540
Did the architects of its initial design

10:57.540 --> 11:00.560
anticipate the wobbliness of the whole system?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.600
So putting fraud and all those things

11:02.600 --> 11:03.940
that happened later aside,

11:03.940 --> 11:06.720
do you think it was difficult to anticipate

11:06.720 --> 11:11.580
this kind of FTT, FTX, Alameda research, weird dynamic?

11:11.580 --> 11:15.340
No, because I think sophisticated traders

11:15.340 --> 11:19.080
always think in terms of diversification and correlation.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.580
So if you're trying to,

11:20.580 --> 11:23.780
the way to think about risk in investing is like,

11:23.780 --> 11:26.980
if I invest in you, Lex Friedman,

11:26.980 --> 11:31.060
and then I also invest in some product you produce,

11:31.060 --> 11:32.100
the performance of those two things

11:32.100 --> 11:33.460
will be pretty correlated.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.900
So whether I invest in you or I invest in this product

11:35.900 --> 11:40.320
that you like are completely behind, I'm not de-risking.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.660
I'm basically counting all on you doing well, right?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.700
And if you do bad, my investments do very bad.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.800
So if I'm trying to build a stable thing,

11:46.800 --> 11:50.680
I shouldn't put all my eggs in the Lex Friedman basket

11:50.680 --> 11:52.660
unless I'm positive that you're gonna do well, right?

11:52.660 --> 11:53.780
And these people-

11:53.780 --> 11:54.980
As your financial advisor,

11:54.980 --> 11:56.460
I would definitely recommend

11:56.460 --> 11:58.700
you do not put all your eggs in this basket.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.180
Right, and so you can think about it

12:00.420 --> 12:04.460
if I know that these people were trained to think like this.

12:04.460 --> 12:08.060
And so the idea that you could start this exchange,

12:08.060 --> 12:10.260
you're worth billions of dollars

12:10.260 --> 12:13.500
and you underwrite your whole system by betting,

12:13.500 --> 12:16.380
putting most of it on your own token is insane.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.420
And what's crazy is we'll later find out

12:19.420 --> 12:22.180
that they were basically taking customer assets,

12:22.180 --> 12:24.980
which were real things like Bitcoin and Ethereum

12:24.980 --> 12:28.940
with risks that were not so correlated to FTX,

12:28.940 --> 12:30.220
and they were swapping them out.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.980
They were using to go basically gamble those

12:32.980 --> 12:37.540
and putting FTT in its place as quote value.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.740
So they were increasing the risk of the system

12:39.740 --> 12:42.420
in order to bet big with the idea

12:42.420 --> 12:43.860
that if they bet big and won,

12:43.860 --> 12:45.620
we'd all be singing their praises.

12:45.620 --> 12:50.020
If they bet big and lost, I don't know if they had a plan,

12:50.020 --> 12:52.360
but I think they were being extremely risky

12:52.360 --> 12:55.220
and there's no way to avoid their knowledge of that.

12:55.220 --> 12:57.100
So when you say customer assets,

12:57.140 --> 12:58.980
I come to this crypto exchange,

12:58.980 --> 13:01.340
I have Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency,

13:01.340 --> 13:06.340
and this is a thing that has pretty stable value over time.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.460
I mean, as crypto, relatively so,

13:10.460 --> 13:13.780
and I'm going to store it on this crypto exchange.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.060
And that's the whole point.

13:15.060 --> 13:20.060
This is, so this thing to the degree that crypto holds value

13:21.340 --> 13:23.620
is supposed to continue holding value.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.420
There's not supposed to be an extra risk

13:26.420 --> 13:27.780
inserted into the thing.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.780
Right, and FTX was pretty clear from the beginning

13:30.780 --> 13:33.720
that they wouldn't invest your assets in anything else.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.220
They wouldn't do anything else with it.

13:35.220 --> 13:37.200
They wouldn't trade it.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.680
That's what made FTX such like a horror story

13:41.680 --> 13:46.440
for investor confidence is basically they made every signal

13:46.440 --> 13:49.620
that they would not do anything nefarious with your tokens.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.740
They would just put them into the side,

13:51.740 --> 13:52.980
put them in a separate account

13:52.980 --> 13:54.540
that they don't have access to,

13:54.540 --> 13:57.040
and they just kind of wait there until the day

13:57.040 --> 13:59.340
that you're ready to withdraw them.

13:59.340 --> 14:03.100
That's explicitly what they told their customers.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.460
So going back to the story a little bit,

14:05.460 --> 14:07.900
CZ then says, hey, I'm selling this token

14:07.900 --> 14:09.920
that underwrites the value of FTX.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.980
There's a total panic.

14:11.980 --> 14:15.620
SBF during this time makes, says several lies

14:15.620 --> 14:18.300
such as FTX assets are fine.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.700
We have enough money to cover all withdrawals.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.660
And a day later, he basically admits

14:23.660 --> 14:25.140
that that wasn't the case.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.180
They don't have the money.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.140
They're shutting down.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.060
And then a few days later after that,

14:29.060 --> 14:31.060
they declared bankruptcy.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.660
There's, I should be clear.

14:32.660 --> 14:37.260
There's Alameda Research, FTX International and FTX US,

14:37.260 --> 14:39.100
which is the US side of things.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.800
These are three different entities.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.340
All of them are in bankruptcy.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.860
And it's not clear to the extent

14:45.860 --> 14:47.980
that they were co-mingling funds,

14:47.980 --> 14:49.780
but it's clear that they were co-mingling funds

14:49.780 --> 14:50.620
to some extent.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.060
They kind of were taking from each other.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.420
And that is where the fraud happens, right?

14:56.420 --> 14:59.260
Because if going back to our earlier analogy,

14:59.260 --> 15:01.260
if you're supposed to set funds aside

15:01.260 --> 15:02.820
and I find out you were using it

15:02.820 --> 15:05.380
to go make all these arbitrage trades

15:05.380 --> 15:07.620
or do market making or all these activities

15:07.620 --> 15:09.180
you were known for for your like hedge fund

15:09.180 --> 15:11.360
trading firm thing, that's a huge problem

15:11.360 --> 15:14.060
because he basically lied about this.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.760
And especially when he's saying explicitly

15:16.760 --> 15:19.200
that we have these things, we have these funds

15:19.200 --> 15:21.240
and these things turn out to be lies.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.520
Well, again, the question of fraud comes in

15:23.520 --> 15:25.880
and it's just like, there's no way he didn't know.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.880
So the obvious question might be,

15:27.880 --> 15:29.760
well, why isn't he locked up?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.760
Why is he running around?

15:31.760 --> 15:35.600
And it's because really his story

15:35.600 --> 15:37.040
is that he didn't know any of it.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.800
He found out that they had to steal man's position.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.220
He would say he was totally disconnected

15:44.220 --> 15:45.840
from what Alameda was doing.

15:45.840 --> 15:50.280
He had no idea that they had such a large margin position

15:50.280 --> 15:52.520
that they'd had an accounting quirk

15:52.520 --> 15:57.520
and that accounting quirk hit $8 billion from his view.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.840
And so when he was saying that they had money to cover it,

16:01.840 --> 16:05.080
he was saying that truthfully to the best of his ability

16:05.080 --> 16:07.480
and he just was so distracted at the time

16:07.480 --> 16:11.400
that he made a series of increasingly embarrassing mistakes.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.240
And now he owes it to the people to right those wrongs

16:16.240 --> 16:18.640
by publicly making this huge apology tour.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.960
So you might've seen him on,

16:19.960 --> 16:22.320
I mean, he's been talking to nearly everyone

16:23.720 --> 16:26.640
about basically how he's just didn't know what he's doing.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.480
He's the stupidest man alive.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.400
It's basically it.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.880
What are some interesting things you've learned

16:30.880 --> 16:31.980
from those interviews?

16:34.440 --> 16:39.240
I think I've appreciated why you don't talk in that position.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.640
Most people wouldn't talk.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.480
Most people would listen to their legal counsel

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
and not talk.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.280
I do not think he's any lawyer worth their salt

16:46.280 --> 16:47.120
would tell him to talk.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.560
Because right now I think the danger of what he's doing

16:49.560 --> 16:53.940
is he's locking himself into a story of how things happened.

16:53.940 --> 16:55.640
And I don't think that story is gonna hold up

16:55.640 --> 16:56.800
in the coming months.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.840
Because I think it's impossible

16:58.840 --> 17:00.740
from the insider conversations I've had

17:00.740 --> 17:04.440
with Alameda research employees, with FTX employees,

17:04.440 --> 17:08.160
it's impossible to square what they are telling me

17:08.160 --> 17:13.160
with no incentive to lie with what SBF is telling me

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
with every incentive to lie,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.320
which is fundamentally that he didn't know

17:18.320 --> 17:19.440
they were commingling funds.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.320
He didn't know they were gambling with customer money.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.480
And it was basically this huge mistake

17:24.480 --> 17:26.100
and it's Alameda's fault,

17:26.100 --> 17:28.560
but he wasn't involved in Alameda, a company he owned.

17:28.560 --> 17:32.160
So like a compassionate but hard hitting gangster

17:32.160 --> 17:37.160
that you are, very recently you interacted with SBF on,

17:37.520 --> 17:41.120
I like how you adjust the suspenders as you're saying this.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.000
You interact on Twitter spaces with SBF

17:47.400 --> 17:51.240
and really put his feet to the fire

17:51.240 --> 17:53.400
with some hard hitting questions.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.240
What did you ask and what did you learn

17:55.240 --> 17:56.640
from that interaction?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.140
Sure, I should say first,

17:58.140 --> 17:59.960
this was not a willing interaction.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.880
I mean, I thought that was kind of the funny part of it.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.560
Cause I've been asking him for an interview for a while.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.260
He's been giving interviews to nearly everyone

18:05.260 --> 18:07.860
who wants one big channels, small channels.

18:08.820 --> 18:09.900
He didn't give me one,

18:09.900 --> 18:12.380
but I managed to get some by sneaking up

18:12.380 --> 18:14.580
on some Twitter spaces and DMing the people

18:14.580 --> 18:16.340
and like being like, hey, can I come up?

18:16.340 --> 18:19.360
So I didn't get him to ask everything that I wanted

18:19.360 --> 18:22.620
because he like would leave sometimes,

18:23.620 --> 18:25.060
after I asked some of the questions.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.780
But really what I asked was about this 8 billion

18:28.780 --> 18:33.780
and zooming in on the improbability of his lack of knowledge.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.140
It's sort of like if you run a company

18:38.140 --> 18:40.460
and you know the insides and outs

18:40.460 --> 18:42.620
and you're the top of your field,

18:42.620 --> 18:45.980
top in class and all of a sudden it all goes bust

18:45.980 --> 18:48.340
and you say, I had no idea how any of this worked.

18:48.340 --> 18:51.100
I didn't know it's like the guy who runs Whataburger

18:51.100 --> 18:53.540
saying, I didn't know where we sourced our beef.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.020
I didn't know where we, that's a Texas example actually.

18:56.020 --> 18:57.620
Thank you, I appreciate that.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.860
Let's take it like worldwide, Walmart.

18:59.860 --> 19:03.080
Like I didn't know we used Chinese manufacturers.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.720
That's impossible.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.560
To become Walmart, you have to know

19:07.560 --> 19:09.360
like how your supply chain works.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.180
You have to know, even if you're at a high level,

19:11.180 --> 19:12.400
you know how this stuff works.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.680
Can I do a hard turn on that and go as one must to Hitler?

19:17.680 --> 19:20.880
Hitler's writing is not on any of the documents around

19:20.880 --> 19:23.940
as far as I know on The Final Solution.

19:23.940 --> 19:28.540
So in some crazy world, he could theoretically say,

19:28.540 --> 19:32.260
I knew, I didn't know anything about the death camps.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.640
So there's this plausible deniability in theory.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.520
So that's, but that most people would look at that

19:39.520 --> 19:43.720
and say, it's very unlikely, you don't know.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.700
Especially if all the insiders are coming out and saying,

19:45.700 --> 19:46.760
no, no, no, of course he knew.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.680
He was directing us from the top.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.400
I mean, what was clear, what's interesting

19:51.400 --> 19:53.640
about the structure and like, I love the nitty-gritty.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.120
Sorry, we're back to SPF.

19:55.120 --> 19:55.960
Yeah.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.160
We went to Hitler, now we're back to the SPF.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.200
I wanted to turn us as fast as possible away from Hitler.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.040
Yeah.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.600
So the insiders in what Alameda research?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.680
Alameda research.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.360
What was interesting is that there was this sort of

20:09.360 --> 20:13.160
one way window going on between Alameda and FTX

20:13.160 --> 20:16.720
where FTX employees didn't know a lot of what was going on.

20:16.720 --> 20:20.800
Alameda insiders, and I would say by design,

20:20.800 --> 20:23.760
knew almost everything that was going on at FTX.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.000
And so I think that was really interesting

20:28.000 --> 20:31.720
from the perspective of a lot of the so-called,

20:31.720 --> 20:34.280
like what you could, what he's trying to ascribe to

20:34.280 --> 20:39.160
as like failures or mistakes or ignorance and negligence,

20:39.160 --> 20:43.320
when looked at closely are much more designed

20:43.320 --> 20:46.560
and they sort of don't arise spontaneously.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.980
Because like, let's say, so there's this thing in banking

20:48.980 --> 20:51.280
and like trading where if I run a bank

20:51.280 --> 20:52.880
and you run like a trading firm,

20:52.880 --> 20:55.120
we need to have informational walls between us

20:55.120 --> 20:58.360
because there's huge conflicts of interest that can arise.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.760
So the negligent argument might be that like,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.080
oh, we just didn't know,

21:02.080 --> 21:03.760
we're sort of these dumb kids in the Bahamas,

21:03.760 --> 21:06.720
so we shared information equally.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.440
But when you see a one-way wall

21:08.440 --> 21:10.720
that starts to look a lot different.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.080
If I have a backend source of looking at,

21:13.080 --> 21:14.240
or sorry, you're the trading firm,

21:14.240 --> 21:17.480
so you have a backend way to look at all my accounts

21:17.480 --> 21:19.700
and I have no idea that you're doing that,

21:19.700 --> 21:22.600
that all of a sudden looks like a much more designed thing.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.440
When it would be plausible,

21:24.440 --> 21:28.760
let's say going to use another analogy too,

21:28.760 --> 21:30.960
if you're saying, look, I commingled funds

21:30.960 --> 21:33.320
because I was so bad at corporate structures,

21:33.320 --> 21:35.440
you would expect those companies

21:35.440 --> 21:37.760
to have a very simple corporate structure

21:37.760 --> 21:39.440
because you didn't know what you're doing, right?

21:39.440 --> 21:42.360
But what we see with FTX and Alameda

21:42.360 --> 21:45.720
is they had something like 50 companies and subsidiaries

21:45.720 --> 21:50.720
and this impossibly complicated web of corporate activity.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.680
You don't get there by accident.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.640
You don't wake up and go,

21:55.640 --> 21:57.680
oh, I designed like this watch

21:57.680 --> 21:59.500
that ticked a very specific way,

21:59.500 --> 22:01.200
but it was all accidental.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.720
If you really didn't know what you were doing,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.640
you'd end up with a simple structure.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.960
So even just like from a fundamental perspective,

22:08.960 --> 22:11.560
what SPF was doing and like the activities

22:11.560 --> 22:13.940
they were engaging in were so complicated

22:13.940 --> 22:17.200
and purposely designed to obfuscate what they were doing,

22:17.200 --> 22:21.760
it's impossible to subscribe to the negligence argument.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.880
And I wanna quickly say too,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.720
like I don't think a lot of people have honed in on this.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.360
There was insider trading going on

22:28.360 --> 22:30.080
from Alameda's perspective

22:30.080 --> 22:34.720
where they would know what coins FTX was going to list

22:34.720 --> 22:36.000
on their exchange.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.800
There's a famous effect where,

22:37.800 --> 22:39.360
let's say you're this legitimate exchange,

22:39.360 --> 22:41.400
you list a coin, the price spikes.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.080
Insiders told me it was a regular practice

22:45.080 --> 22:47.840
for Alameda insiders to know

22:47.840 --> 22:49.720
that FTX was going to list a coin.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.040
And as a company buy up that coin

22:52.040 --> 22:54.000
so they could sell it after it listed.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
And they made millions of dollars.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.600
How do you do that accidentally?

22:56.600 --> 22:59.240
Yeah, and that's illegal.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.360
Totally illegal.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.480
So that's illegal from like,

23:02.480 --> 23:05.240
and if an individual does it, it's illegal, it's fraud.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.400
What if a company is systematically doing it?

23:08.400 --> 23:11.840
And you can't tell me that FTX

23:11.840 --> 23:15.120
or someone at FTX wasn't feeding that information

23:15.120 --> 23:19.400
to Alameda or somehow giving them keys to know that.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.040
And that would happen at the highest level.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.720
It would happen at SPS level.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.040
And this is why his arguments of,

23:25.040 --> 23:28.280
I was dumb, I was naive, I was sort of ignorant

23:28.280 --> 23:31.040
are so preposterous because he's dumb and ignorant

23:31.040 --> 23:33.960
the second it becomes criminal to be smart

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
and sophisticated, right?

23:35.960 --> 23:38.040
But then also coming out and talking about it,

23:38.040 --> 23:39.640
which is-

23:39.640 --> 23:40.560
It's a bizarre move.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.440
It's a bizarre and almost a dark move.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.840
Can you tell the story of the eight billion?

23:45.840 --> 23:46.720
You mentioned eight billion.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.560
What's the eight billion?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.440
What's the missing eight billion?

23:48.440 --> 23:50.400
Yeah, so it's really interesting

23:50.400 --> 23:52.680
because it's sort of like wire fraud.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.560
He's sort of copping to like smaller crimes

23:56.560 --> 23:57.680
to avoid the big crime.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.200
The big crime is, you knew everything

23:59.200 --> 24:01.080
and you were behind it, right?

24:01.080 --> 24:04.800
The smaller crimes are like a little wire fraud here,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.040
little wire fraud there.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.600
So what the eight billion is

24:07.600 --> 24:09.560
is that FTX didn't always have banking.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.680
It's hard to get banking as a crypto exchange.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
There's all these questions of like,

24:12.680 --> 24:13.760
where's the money coming from?

24:13.760 --> 24:14.920
Is it coming from money launderer?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.040
So for a variety of reasons,

24:17.040 --> 24:19.240
it's always been hard for exchanges to get bank accounts.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.360
So before, when FTX was just getting started,

24:22.360 --> 24:23.400
they didn't have a bank account.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.720
So how do you put money on FTX?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.360
Well, they would have you wire your money

24:27.360 --> 24:28.760
to their trading firm.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.760
Their wiring instructions would go to their trading firm.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.320
It's easier to get banking as a trading firm.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.040
So you'd put your money with the trading firm

24:35.040 --> 24:38.800
and then they'd credit you the money on FTX.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.800
Okay, first of all, this is a whole circumvention

24:40.800 --> 24:43.960
of all these banking guidelines and regulations.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.600
That's the first like thing that I think is illegal.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.720
But basically what SBF argued

24:50.720 --> 24:55.440
is that there was an accounting glitch error problem

24:55.440 --> 24:58.000
where when you'd send money to Alameda,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.240
even though they'd credit you on FTX,

25:00.240 --> 25:02.240
they wouldn't safeguard your deposits.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.680
Like your deposits would go into

25:03.680 --> 25:05.360
what he called a stub account,

25:05.360 --> 25:07.560
which is just like some account

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
that's not very well labeled,

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
kind of like a placeholder account.

25:11.560 --> 25:16.120
And he didn't realize that those were Alameda's funds

25:16.120 --> 25:17.760
or they were playing with those funds

25:17.760 --> 25:19.520
and that they basically should have safeguarded

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
that for customers.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.200
That's his explanation.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.160
It's preposterous because it's $8 billion.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.800
But anyways-

25:25.800 --> 25:27.760
Just poor labeling of accounts.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.880
Of an $8 billion account.

25:29.880 --> 25:30.720
I mean, it's like-

25:30.720 --> 25:31.640
What's a billion?

25:31.640 --> 25:32.640
A billion.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.480
This is like-

25:33.480 --> 25:34.320
I did this all the time in programming.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.720
This is the craziest thing.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.400
Like he was talking to me

25:37.400 --> 25:38.880
and at one point in the conversation,

25:38.880 --> 25:41.520
he's like, yeah, I didn't have precise,

25:41.520 --> 25:42.880
because he said I didn't have knowledge

25:42.880 --> 25:44.280
of Alameda's accounts.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.920
And I said, well, Forbes a month ago

25:45.920 --> 25:48.680
was getting detailed accounting of Alameda.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.440
And he goes, oh, that wasn't detailed accounting.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.840
I just knew I was right within 10 billion or so.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.000
What is that error margin?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.200
$10 billion for a company that is arguably

26:01.200 --> 26:03.800
never worth more than a hundred million.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.760
Probably never even worth more than 50 billion.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.920
Your error margin is $10 billion.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.880
You have to be-

26:09.880 --> 26:13.400
This is a guy who is sending around statements

26:13.400 --> 26:15.520
that like there was no risk involved.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.720
And you're telling me he had an error margin

26:17.720 --> 26:18.720
of $10 billion.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.680
That is the difference between like a healthy company

26:21.680 --> 26:24.640
and a company so deep underwater you're going to jail.

26:24.640 --> 26:29.640
So you have to believe that he is impossibly stupid

26:30.600 --> 26:32.560
and square that with the sophistication

26:32.560 --> 26:33.760
that he brought to the table.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.000
I think it's an impossible argument.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.160
I don't even think it's-

26:36.160 --> 26:40.120
Did you think he is incompetent, insane, or evil

26:41.080 --> 26:45.520
if you were to bet money on each of those?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.400
Incompetent, insane, or evil?

26:48.400 --> 26:51.240
Insane meaning he's lying to everyone,

26:51.240 --> 26:52.440
but also to himself,

26:54.320 --> 26:57.520
which is a little bit different than incompetence.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.840
He's not incompetent.

27:00.240 --> 27:05.040
So I think he's some combination of insane and evil,

27:05.040 --> 27:07.080
but it's impossible to know unless we know

27:07.320 --> 27:12.320
deep inside his heart how self-deluded he is

27:12.520 --> 27:15.200
versus a calculated strategy.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.840
And I think if you look at SBF,

27:17.840 --> 27:20.920
he's such a, I think he's a fascinating individual.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.720
Just, I mean, you know, he's a horrible human being.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.800
Let's start there.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.960
But he's also somewhat interesting

27:28.960 --> 27:30.520
from a psychology perspective

27:30.520 --> 27:32.800
because he's very open about the fact

27:32.800 --> 27:35.560
that he understands image

27:35.560 --> 27:38.400
and he understands how to cultivate image,

27:38.400 --> 27:41.360
the importance of image, so well

27:41.360 --> 27:42.840
that I think a lot of people,

27:42.840 --> 27:44.160
even though they've talked about it,

27:44.160 --> 27:48.280
aren't emphasizing that enough when interacting with him.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.680
This is a man whose entire history

27:50.680 --> 27:53.440
is about cultivating the right opinions

27:53.440 --> 27:56.160
at the right time to achieve the right effect.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.080
Why do you think he would suddenly change that approach

27:59.080 --> 28:01.800
when he has all the more reason to cultivate an image?

28:01.800 --> 28:05.800
So he is extremely good naturally or?

28:06.720 --> 28:07.640
I don't know if he's good,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.200
but he's like, he's a hyper aware.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.920
So he's deliberate in cultivating a public image

28:12.920 --> 28:14.960
and controlling the public image.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.720
You know about the like Democrat donations,

28:17.720 --> 28:21.600
like he knew to donate to the right people, $40 million.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.800
He says on a call that we released with Tiffany Fong,

28:25.800 --> 28:28.160
he says on a call that he donated

28:28.160 --> 28:29.640
the same amount to Republicans.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.360
There's speculation on whether this is true

28:31.360 --> 28:32.720
because he's a liar or whatever.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.280
So caveat there, but he said he donated to Republicans

28:35.280 --> 28:37.440
the same amount, but he donated dark

28:37.440 --> 28:40.920
because he knew that most journalists are liberal

28:40.920 --> 28:43.160
and they would kind of hold that against him.

28:43.160 --> 28:48.160
So he wanted all the sides to be in his favor,

28:48.360 --> 28:51.840
in his pocket, while simultaneously understanding

28:51.840 --> 28:55.520
the entire media landscape and playing them like a fiddle

28:55.520 --> 28:58.320
by cultivating this image of I'm this progressive,

28:58.320 --> 29:01.400
woke billionaire who wants to give it all away,

29:01.400 --> 29:02.920
do everything for charity.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.240
I drive a Corolla while living in a million dollar

29:05.240 --> 29:09.040
print house, multimillion, but that was sort of the angle.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.840
He understood so well how to play the media.

29:11.840 --> 29:16.840
And I think he underestimated when he did this,

29:17.000 --> 29:21.080
how much people would put him under a deeper microscope.

29:21.080 --> 29:25.600
And I don't think he has achieved the same level of success

29:25.600 --> 29:26.920
in cultivating this new image.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.480
Because I think people are so skeptical now,

29:28.480 --> 29:31.640
no one's buying it, but I think he's trying it.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.480
He's doing it to the best of his ability.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.640
But it has worked leading up to this particular

29:35.640 --> 29:37.480
wobbly situation.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.160
So before that, wasn't there a public perception

29:40.160 --> 29:43.040
of him being a force for good,

29:43.040 --> 29:43.880
a financial force for good?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.360
100%, yeah.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.320
Somebody from Sequoia Capital wrote this glowing review

29:49.320 --> 29:51.000
that he was gonna be the world's first trillionaire.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.920
There's so many pieces done on he's the most generous

29:52.920 --> 29:56.680
billionaire in the world that he was sort of like

29:56.680 --> 30:01.680
the steel man of it's possible to make tons of money.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.960
This is like the effect of altruism movement,

30:03.960 --> 30:06.040
make as much money as you can, as fast as you can,

30:06.040 --> 30:07.360
and then give it all away.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.760
And he was sort of like the poster child for that.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.520
And he did give some of it away

30:12.520 --> 30:15.240
and got a lot of press for it.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.920
And I think that was kind of by design.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.760
I wanna address a real quick point.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.040
A lot of people have said that like Binance played a role.

30:22.080 --> 30:27.080
And while they catalyzed this, insolvency is a problem

30:28.480 --> 30:30.880
that will eventually manifest either way.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.280
So I don't put any blame on CZ

30:33.280 --> 30:36.840
for basically causing this meltdown.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.680
The underlying foundation was unstable

30:39.680 --> 30:41.560
and it was gonna fall apart at the next push.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.400
I mean, he just happened to be the final kind of like,

30:46.120 --> 30:48.440
I don't know, the straw that broke the camel's back.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.280
Yeah, the catalyst that revealed the fraud.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.040
Yeah, but it's like, I don't think he's culpable

30:53.040 --> 30:57.800
for FTX's like malfeasance in how they handle accounts,

30:57.800 --> 30:58.640
if that makes sense.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.200
So what role did they play?

31:01.200 --> 31:04.400
Could they have helped alleviate some of the pain

31:04.400 --> 31:09.400
of investors, of people that held funds there?

31:09.800 --> 31:14.800
Yeah, I mean, probably, I don't know.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.400
I would see some kind of weird obligation,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.960
like with the two billion they made on FTX.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.680
Remember, they got two billion, some of it in cash,

31:24.680 --> 31:26.640
some of it in FTT tokens.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.040
I don't know how much actual cash they have from that deal,

31:29.040 --> 31:30.840
but they have billions from the success

31:30.840 --> 31:32.400
of what seems to be a fraud.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.080
It seems to have been a fraud from early on.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.240
They had the back door as early as early 2020,

31:38.240 --> 31:39.080
from what I can tell.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.440
So the back door between FTX and Alameda.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.240
Alameda, yes.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.680
Do you think CZ saw through who SPF is?

31:47.680 --> 31:50.000
What is he doing?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.640
No, I think CZ is like, he's a shark.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.120
I think he's good at building a big business.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.640
Like a good shark or a bad shark?

31:59.640 --> 32:00.480
I don't know.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.840
I don't know, I think sharks just eat.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.080
I mean, I don't know, I think.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.400
My relationship with shark has like a finding Nemo,

32:06.400 --> 32:07.800
there's a shark in that.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
Sure, I think like Jeff Bezos is a shark.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.920
So whether people have loaded connotations

32:12.920 --> 32:15.040
of like how they feel about Jeff Bezos.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.200
I mean, I would say like,

32:16.200 --> 32:18.920
I think CZ is a ruthless businessman.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.600
I think he's cold, he's calculated.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.520
He's very deliberate.

32:23.520 --> 32:28.000
And I think what he should do in this position is forfeit

32:28.000 --> 32:30.680
the funds that he profited from that investment

32:30.680 --> 32:35.280
because largely I think it's owed to the customers.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.640
There's so much hurting out there.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.720
So I think they could do a lot of good around that.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.040
I don't know if they will

32:41.040 --> 32:43.680
because I don't know if he sees it in his best interest.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.720
I think that's probably how he's thinking.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.320
But yeah, I think they could have helped

32:49.320 --> 32:51.160
or they could still help there.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.200
Who do you think suffered the most from this so far?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.040
The little account holders.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.200
This is always true.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.080
So one of the big temptations with fraud,

33:01.080 --> 33:03.440
I've covered a lot of scams, frauds,

33:03.440 --> 33:05.240
is everyone looks at the big number.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.040
Everyone, that's the headline, billions of dollars,

33:08.040 --> 33:11.400
the top 50 creditors or what everyone thinks at first.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.800
But quickly when you dig down,

33:12.840 --> 33:15.240
you realize that most people who lost $10 million,

33:15.240 --> 33:16.640
I mean, I'm sure that's terrible for them.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.320
I wish them to get their money back.

33:18.320 --> 33:22.080
But it's usually the people with like 50,000 or less

33:22.080 --> 33:23.280
that are most impacted.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.600
Usually they do not have the money to spare.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.800
Usually they're not diversified in a sophisticated way.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.880
So I think it's those people.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.440
I think it's the small account holders

33:32.440 --> 33:33.360
that I feel the worst for.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.200
And unfortunately,

33:34.200 --> 33:37.080
they often get the least press time or air time.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
That's the really difficult truth of this

33:39.080 --> 33:41.480
is that especially in the culture of cryptocurrency,

33:41.480 --> 33:45.560
there's a lot of young people who are not diversified.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.400
They're basically all in on a particular crypto.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.960
And it just breaks my heart

33:50.960 --> 33:53.000
to think that there's somebody with 50,000

33:53.000 --> 33:54.760
or 30,000 or 20,000.

33:54.760 --> 33:59.160
But the point is that money is everything they own.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.000
Right.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.560
And now-

34:01.560 --> 34:02.400
Now what?

34:02.400 --> 34:03.960
Their life is basically destroyed.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.320
Like, imagine you're 18, 19, 20, 21 years old.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.080
You saved up, you've been working,

34:11.680 --> 34:13.840
you saved up, and this is it.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.160
This is basically destroying a life.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.720
What's so brutal about this is that

34:18.720 --> 34:20.120
this all comes on the back.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.600
The entire crypto market comes on the back of,

34:24.640 --> 34:28.600
comes from the deep distrust of traditional finance.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.440
Right?

34:29.440 --> 34:33.000
Yeah, 2008, everybody lost trust in the banking systems.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.880
And they lost trust that if those banking systems

34:35.880 --> 34:37.600
acted in a corrupt way,

34:37.600 --> 34:39.280
that they would receive the justice.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.640
It turned out that the banks received favorable treatment.

34:41.640 --> 34:42.880
People didn't.

34:42.880 --> 34:47.880
So people lost faith in the structure

34:48.080 --> 34:50.160
of our financial system in a way that is,

34:50.160 --> 34:52.720
we're still feeling the reverberations of it.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.680
And so when crypto came along,

34:53.680 --> 34:55.920
it was like kind of this way to reinvent the wheel,

34:55.920 --> 34:59.800
reinvent the world for the sort of lowly

34:59.800 --> 35:03.640
and the less powerful and kind of level the playing field.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.160
So what's so sad about events like this

35:06.200 --> 35:08.560
is you see that fundamentally,

35:08.560 --> 35:10.960
a lot of the power structures are the same,

35:10.960 --> 35:14.200
where the people at the top face little repercussions

35:14.200 --> 35:15.080
for what they do.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.560
The people at the bottom are still getting screwed.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.680
The people at the bottom are still getting lied to.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.400
And law enforcement is way behind the ball.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.720
Do you think this really damaged people trust

35:27.720 --> 35:28.720
in cryptocurrency?

35:28.720 --> 35:29.560
For sure.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.040
Way bigger than Luna,

35:31.040 --> 35:33.080
way bigger than Three Arrows Capital.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.320
It's because of who SBF was.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.960
It's not just the dollar figure behind it.

35:37.960 --> 35:42.120
It's because he wooed so many of our media elites

35:42.120 --> 35:44.560
who should have been calling him out

35:44.560 --> 35:48.120
or at least investigating him and not rubber stamping him.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.840
It's an indictment of our financial system,

35:51.840 --> 35:55.480
even our most sophisticated people in BlackRock, in Sequoia,

35:55.480 --> 35:58.960
who didn't see this coming, who also rubber stamped him.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.840
And you just wonder like,

36:01.840 --> 36:05.000
if you can't trust the top people in crypto

36:05.680 --> 36:07.280
who are supposedly the good guys,

36:07.280 --> 36:12.280
the guys saving crypto just a month ago or two months ago,

36:12.280 --> 36:14.360
he was the guy on Capitol Hill

36:14.360 --> 36:15.680
that was talking to Gary Gensler,

36:15.680 --> 36:18.000
to all the top people in Washington.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.040
He was orchestrating the regulation of crypto.

36:21.040 --> 36:26.040
If that guy is a complete fraudster, liar, psychopath

36:26.040 --> 36:28.720
and nobody knew it until it was too late,

36:28.720 --> 36:31.280
what does that mean about the system itself

36:31.280 --> 36:32.360
that we're building?

36:32.360 --> 36:35.320
So you are one of, if not the best,

36:35.320 --> 36:39.000
like fraudster investigators in the world.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.360
Did you sense, was this on your radar at all,

36:42.360 --> 36:46.000
SBF, over the past couple of years?

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Were any red flags going off for you?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.200
Yes, so funny enough,

36:51.200 --> 36:54.040
one of my videos from six months ago or so blew up

36:54.040 --> 36:57.360
because I gotta give a lot of credit to Matt Levine

36:57.360 --> 37:00.360
of Bloomberg, great journalist, great finance journalist.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.360
And I wanna say, when I like talk about media elite,

37:03.360 --> 37:05.640
there are people doing great work

37:05.640 --> 37:07.040
in these mainstream institutions.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.360
It's not a monolith, just like independent media

37:09.360 --> 37:10.760
isn't all doing great work

37:10.760 --> 37:12.800
and all the corporate media is bad or whatever.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.680
There's like these overarching narratives

37:14.680 --> 37:16.120
that I don't subscribe to.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.440
So Matt Levine's great journalist.

37:17.440 --> 37:21.960
He did an interview with SBF where he got Sam

37:21.960 --> 37:25.540
to basically describe a lot of what was going on in DeFi,

37:25.540 --> 37:28.120
but it kind of a larger philosophy around crypto.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.840
And he described a Ponzi scheme

37:29.840 --> 37:31.560
where he just described this black box.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.120
It does nothing, but if we ascribe it value,

37:34.120 --> 37:36.280
then we can create more value and more value and more value.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.640
And it kind of was this ridiculous description

37:38.640 --> 37:40.760
of a Ponzi scheme, but there was no moral judgment on it.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.800
It was like, oh yeah, this is great.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.440
We can make a lot of money from this.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.680
And Matt is like, well, it sounds like

37:45.680 --> 37:48.480
you're in the Ponzi business and business is good.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.660
I made a video about that.

37:49.660 --> 37:50.920
I said, this is ridiculous.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.640
This is absurd, whatever, it's obscene.

37:53.640 --> 37:58.640
But I didn't explicitly call SBF a fraud there.

37:59.840 --> 38:04.320
And I think if I'm being, I think I saw some of it,

38:04.320 --> 38:09.320
but like many people, I think a lot of us were kind of like,

38:14.560 --> 38:16.280
I think a lot of us missed

38:16.280 --> 38:19.680
how wrong everyone could be at the same time.

38:20.620 --> 38:23.720
I did notice leading up to the crash, what was happening.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.920
And I called it out a day or a day and a half

38:26.920 --> 38:28.060
before it happened.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.100
Cause I saw my friends post a dirty bubble media

38:31.100 --> 38:32.700
and this was the first real look

38:32.700 --> 38:35.100
into the heart of their finances.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.460
Cause they're this black box.

38:36.460 --> 38:41.020
You just kind of had to evaluate them without knowing much.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.660
And once we got a peek under the hood

38:44.660 --> 38:47.860
of what their finances were, I realized, oh my gosh,

38:47.860 --> 38:49.260
these guys might be completely insolvent.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.900
So I made a tweet about it.

38:50.900 --> 38:53.400
I hope some people saw it and got their money out.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.360
But pretty quickly after that,

38:56.360 --> 38:59.200
I caught the narrative of what was really going on

38:59.200 --> 39:03.240
at Alameda, that it was basically this Ponzi scheme

39:03.240 --> 39:04.080
that they had built.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.640
Do you ever sit like Batman in the dark

39:06.640 --> 39:10.520
since he fight crime and wonder, like sad,

39:10.520 --> 39:12.280
just staring into the darkness and thinking

39:12.280 --> 39:13.920
I should have caught this earlier?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.160
Yeah, I think.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.960
In your $10 billion studio.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.800
$10 million studio.

39:21.800 --> 39:22.620
$10 million studio.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.640
Whether you're working or whether.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.140
With a bunch of cocaine on the table.

39:26.140 --> 39:27.220
Sure, it's never enough.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.580
It's never enough.

39:28.580 --> 39:31.320
Like you always could be catching stuff sooner.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.700
You always could be doing more.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.940
I mean, the fascinating thing you said is that

39:36.940 --> 39:40.780
one of the lessons here is that a large number of people,

39:40.780 --> 39:44.500
influential, smart people could all be wrong at the same time

39:44.500 --> 39:47.900
in terms of their evaluation of SBF.

39:47.900 --> 39:51.700
This is one thing that I don't understand too is like,

39:51.740 --> 39:54.180
I think it's one thing to not see something.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.720
I think it's another thing to like rubber stamp

39:56.720 --> 39:59.140
or explicitly endorse.

39:59.140 --> 40:04.140
I feel like a lot of people didn't look too close at SBF

40:04.180 --> 40:07.340
because I think a lot of the warning signs were there.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.620
But my feeling is if you're a Sequoia,

40:09.620 --> 40:13.740
if you're a BlackRock, wouldn't you do that due diligence?

40:13.740 --> 40:17.320
I mean, like before just endorsing something,

40:17.320 --> 40:18.580
especially in the crypto space,

40:18.580 --> 40:20.300
this is just why I don't do any deals

40:20.300 --> 40:21.580
in the crypto space ever.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.660
Because it's impossible to know which ones

40:23.660 --> 40:25.340
are going to be the like big hits

40:25.340 --> 40:27.120
or the big frauds or whatever.

40:27.980 --> 40:29.300
But if you're going to make that bet,

40:29.300 --> 40:30.820
if you're going to make that play,

40:30.820 --> 40:34.300
you would think that you would do all the research

40:34.300 --> 40:37.220
in the world and you would get sophisticated looks

40:37.220 --> 40:39.900
at their liabilities, at how they were structured,

40:39.900 --> 40:41.040
all that stuff.

40:41.040 --> 40:45.020
And that is the most shocking part is not that,

40:45.020 --> 40:47.180
people missed it because you can miss fraud,

40:47.180 --> 40:50.080
but that there were so many glowing endorsements

40:50.480 --> 40:52.520
like this guy is not going to be that thing.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.240
We explicitly endorse him.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.640
I saw a Fortune magazine.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.200
He was called the next Warren Buffett.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.200
It's just crazy.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.600
Do you think it's possible to have enough

41:00.600 --> 41:03.680
like Tom Brady endorsements

41:03.680 --> 41:05.420
that you don't really investigate?

41:05.420 --> 41:07.720
So like that there's a kind of momentum,

41:07.720 --> 41:09.360
like societal social momentum.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.000
I think that's the problem.

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
I actually think that's hugely a blind spot of our society

41:16.720 --> 41:19.720
is we have all these heuristics

41:19.720 --> 41:22.520
that can be points of failure

41:22.520 --> 41:25.960
where like a rule of thumb is if you go to an Ivy league,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.540
well, you must be smart, right?

41:27.540 --> 41:29.440
A rule of thumb is if you're both your parents

41:29.440 --> 41:31.960
or Harvard lawyers, you must know the law.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.280
You must like kind of be sophisticated.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.760
The rule of thumb is if you're running a billion dollar

41:36.760 --> 41:39.980
exchange, you must be somehow somewhat ethical, right?

41:39.980 --> 41:43.320
And all of these heuristics can lead to giant blind spots

41:43.320 --> 41:45.900
where you kind of just go, oh, we'll check.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.840
It's a lot of energy to look into people

41:48.840 --> 41:51.020
and if enough of those rules of thumb are met,

41:51.020 --> 41:52.100
we just kind of check them off

41:52.100 --> 41:53.180
and put them through the system.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.680
So yeah, it's been hugely exposing

41:55.680 --> 41:57.860
for sort of like our blind spots.

41:57.860 --> 42:00.340
And you don't know maybe how to look in.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.280
For example, there's a few assumptions.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.300
Now there's a lot of people are very skeptical

42:04.300 --> 42:05.860
of institutions of government and so on,

42:05.860 --> 42:08.820
but perhaps too much so.

42:08.820 --> 42:09.660
I agree.

42:09.660 --> 42:11.300
But for some part of history,

42:11.300 --> 42:14.140
there was too much faith in government.

42:14.220 --> 42:17.180
So right now, I think there's faith

42:17.180 --> 42:19.020
in certain large companies.

42:19.020 --> 42:22.140
There's distrust in certain ones and trust in others.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.340
Like people seem to distrust Facebook,

42:24.340 --> 42:26.720
extremely skeptical of Facebook.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.620
But they trust, I think, Google with their data.

42:29.620 --> 42:31.420
I think they trust Apple with their data,

42:31.420 --> 42:34.260
much more so like search.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.100
People don't seem to be Google search,

42:36.100 --> 42:38.900
like I'm just gonna put it in there.

42:38.900 --> 42:41.020
Have you ever looked at your Google search history?

42:41.020 --> 42:42.860
Your Google search history has got to be

42:42.860 --> 42:44.660
some of the darkest things.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.700
Oh, I don't think I've ever looked

42:46.700 --> 42:47.920
at my Google search history.

42:47.920 --> 42:48.760
You should.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.380
I'm pretty careful with like browser hygiene

42:52.380 --> 42:56.360
and stuff like that because I think it's.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.340
Well, Google search history,

42:57.340 --> 42:58.980
unless you explicitly delete it, is there.

42:58.980 --> 43:00.300
I recommend you look at it.

43:00.300 --> 43:02.260
It's fascinating look because it goes back

43:02.260 --> 43:05.620
to the first days of you using Google search history.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.060
Fun fact actually about that.

43:07.060 --> 43:10.100
No, no, no, I am aware of that.

43:10.100 --> 43:12.660
I just mean for like certain sensitive topics

43:13.500 --> 43:14.340
where like I'm investigating some fraud

43:14.340 --> 43:16.460
and I go sign into their website, right?

43:16.460 --> 43:17.380
Log in.

43:17.380 --> 43:19.180
I won't use like a traditional browser.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.540
I'll use a VPN and I'll like put it on like Brave

43:21.540 --> 43:22.500
or something like that.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.020
You log in, you create an account, it's Lex Friedman.

43:25.020 --> 43:27.820
Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.420
You mentioned effective altruism.

43:29.420 --> 43:30.260
Yes.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.500
You know, SBF has been associated

43:31.500 --> 43:32.940
with this effective altruism,

43:32.940 --> 43:37.460
which made me look twice at EA and see like, wait.

43:38.140 --> 43:42.580
What's going on here?

43:43.980 --> 43:46.940
Is this, was this used by SBF to give himself

43:46.940 --> 43:50.180
a good public image or is there something

43:50.180 --> 43:52.500
about effective altruism that makes it easy

43:52.500 --> 43:56.100
to misuse by bad people?

43:56.100 --> 43:56.940
What do you think?

43:56.940 --> 43:57.760
Yeah, it's interesting.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.660
He could have endorsed a wide range of philosophies

44:00.660 --> 44:03.740
and I guess you just have to wonder are all those,

44:03.740 --> 44:05.780
would those philosophies also be tainted

44:05.780 --> 44:09.100
if he had gone bad?

44:09.100 --> 44:11.340
I guess effective altruism is sort of unique

44:11.340 --> 44:13.860
because he used it as part of his brand.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.220
It wasn't like he was, he described himself

44:16.220 --> 44:19.620
as a consequentialist and like that ended up mattering.

44:19.620 --> 44:22.820
It was like he described himself as an effective altruist

44:22.820 --> 44:25.580
and he used that part of the brand to lift himself up.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.460
I guess that's why it's getting so much scrutiny.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.580
I think the merits of it should speak for themselves.

44:31.580 --> 44:32.740
I mean, I don't personally,

44:32.740 --> 44:35.380
I'm not personally an effective altruist.

44:36.820 --> 44:40.220
I personally am motivated by giving in part emotionally

44:40.220 --> 44:43.860
and for some reason that I can't exactly describe,

44:43.860 --> 44:45.780
I think that's somewhat important.

44:45.780 --> 44:47.900
I don't think you should detach giving

44:47.900 --> 44:50.300
from some personal connection.

44:50.300 --> 44:53.780
I find trouble with that and like I said,

44:53.780 --> 44:54.860
it's for reasons I can't describe

44:54.860 --> 44:58.180
because effective altruism is sort of the most logical

44:58.180 --> 45:00.620
ivory tower position you could possibly take.

45:00.620 --> 45:03.340
It's like strip all humanity away from giving.

45:03.340 --> 45:04.660
Let's treat it like a business

45:04.660 --> 45:06.260
and how many people can we serve

45:06.260 --> 45:08.460
through the McDonald's line of charity

45:08.460 --> 45:09.940
for like the dollar, right?

45:11.460 --> 45:13.340
I just personally don't resonate with that

45:13.340 --> 45:15.940
but I don't think the entire movement

45:15.940 --> 45:18.700
is like indicted because of it.

45:18.700 --> 45:22.540
Typically, most people who care about giving

45:22.540 --> 45:26.980
and charity on the whole are nice people

45:26.980 --> 45:29.100
and so I can't speak for the whole movement.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.940
I certainly don't think SBF indicts the whole movement

45:31.940 --> 45:33.860
even though I personally don't subscribe to it.

45:33.860 --> 45:37.780
Yeah, it made me pause, reflect and step back

45:37.780 --> 45:41.500
like about the movement and about anything

45:41.500 --> 45:42.980
that has a strong ideology.

45:42.980 --> 45:45.340
So if there's anything in your life

45:45.340 --> 45:50.180
that has a strong set of ideas behind it, be careful.

45:50.180 --> 45:53.140
Yeah, I mean, look, I kind of feel like

45:53.140 --> 45:57.460
what it teaches me and what I kind of think about

45:57.460 --> 45:59.340
when I think about systems

45:59.340 --> 46:02.500
is that no system saves you from the individual.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.140
No system saves you from the individual,

46:05.140 --> 46:10.140
their intentions, their lust for power or greed.

46:10.140 --> 46:13.660
I mean, I think one of the great ideas

46:13.660 --> 46:16.740
is the decentralization of power

46:16.740 --> 46:20.580
and like this is why I think democracies are so great

46:20.580 --> 46:23.580
is because they decentralize power

46:23.580 --> 46:28.140
across a wide range of like interests and groups

46:28.140 --> 46:29.740
and that being an effective way

46:29.740 --> 46:32.620
to kind of try as best as you can

46:32.620 --> 46:35.500
to spread out the impact of one individual

46:35.500 --> 46:39.340
because one bad individual can do a lot of harm

46:39.340 --> 46:41.980
as I mean, clearly as seen here.

46:41.980 --> 46:44.900
But now I don't think it has anything to do with ideology

46:44.900 --> 46:47.460
because it's not like being an effective altruist

46:47.460 --> 46:49.700
made Sam Bankman free to fraud.

46:49.700 --> 46:52.540
He was a fraud who happened to be an effective altruist.

46:52.980 --> 46:53.820
That makes sense.

46:53.820 --> 46:54.980
So there is something about yes,

46:54.980 --> 46:56.780
no system protects you from an individual

46:56.780 --> 47:01.260
but some system enable or serve as a better catalyst

47:01.260 --> 47:06.020
than others for the worst aspects of human nature.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.500
So for example, communist ideology,

47:08.500 --> 47:09.980
I don't know if it's the ideology

47:09.980 --> 47:13.980
or its implementation in the 20th century,

47:13.980 --> 47:18.540
it seemed like such a sexy and powerful and viral ideology

47:18.540 --> 47:21.420
that it somehow allows the evil bad people

47:21.420 --> 47:23.780
to like sneak into the very top.

47:23.780 --> 47:26.820
And so like, that's what I mean about certain ideas

47:26.820 --> 47:31.820
sound so nice that allow you like the lower classes,

47:31.860 --> 47:33.940
the workers, the people that do all the work,

47:33.940 --> 47:35.340
they should have power.

47:35.340 --> 47:37.860
They have been screwed over for far too long.

47:37.860 --> 47:39.380
They need to take power back.

47:39.380 --> 47:41.780
That sounds like a really powerful idea.

47:41.780 --> 47:45.180
And then it just seems like with those powerful ideas,

47:45.180 --> 47:47.380
evil people sneak in to the top

47:47.380 --> 47:48.660
and start to abuse that power.

47:48.660 --> 47:52.060
Yeah, I think, I mean, I don't have a lot of

47:52.060 --> 47:54.340
probably big brain political takes,

47:54.340 --> 47:56.940
but what I can say is that you can never get away

47:56.940 --> 47:59.980
from both the system and the individual mattering.

47:59.980 --> 48:03.340
For sure, some systems incentivize some behaviors

48:03.340 --> 48:06.100
in certain ways, but some people will take that and go,

48:06.100 --> 48:08.220
okay, all we need to do is design the perfect system

48:08.220 --> 48:11.380
and then these individuals will act completely rationally

48:11.380 --> 48:14.260
or responsibly in accordance to what our incentives say.

48:14.260 --> 48:15.460
That's not true.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.540
You could also say all we have to do

48:17.540 --> 48:18.980
is focus on the individual.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.140
And all we have to do is just create a society

48:21.140 --> 48:23.380
which raises very well-adjusted people

48:23.380 --> 48:25.020
and then we can throw them into any system

48:25.020 --> 48:27.180
with any incentives and they will act

48:27.180 --> 48:28.940
like responsibly, ethically, morally.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.460
And I also don't think that's true.

48:30.460 --> 48:31.740
So incentives are real,

48:31.740 --> 48:35.980
but also the individual ultimately plays a large role too.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.300
So yeah, I don't know.

48:37.300 --> 48:39.180
I come down sort of in the middle there.

48:39.180 --> 48:43.100
And some of that is just accidents of history too.

48:43.100 --> 48:46.340
Which individuals finds which system, you know.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.940
In the face of that.

48:47.940 --> 48:52.340
Yeah, with FTX versus Coinbase versus Binance,

48:52.340 --> 48:55.860
which individual, which kinds of ideas

48:55.860 --> 48:59.860
and life story come to power.

48:59.860 --> 49:00.820
That matters.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.980
It's kind of fascinating that history turns

49:02.980 --> 49:04.940
on these small little events

49:04.940 --> 49:07.860
done by small little individuals

49:07.860 --> 49:10.540
that, you know, Hitler's a failed artist

49:10.540 --> 49:14.660
or you have FDR or you have all these different characters

49:14.660 --> 49:16.820
that do good or do evil onto the world.

49:16.820 --> 49:19.780
And it's like single individuals and they have a life story

49:19.780 --> 49:21.900
and it could have turned out completely different.

49:21.900 --> 49:24.580
It's, I mean, it's the flap of the butterfly wings.

49:24.580 --> 49:25.820
So yeah, you're right.

49:25.820 --> 49:29.420
We should be skeptical as attributing too much

49:29.420 --> 49:31.260
to the system or the individual.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.860
It's all like a beautiful mess.

49:34.980 --> 49:36.300
The Lex Friedman podcast.

49:37.620 --> 49:39.180
That's like, that was like a Lex line.

49:39.180 --> 49:41.140
I've heard quite a few episodes

49:41.140 --> 49:42.380
and that's like such a Lex line.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.620
It's a beautiful, beautifully said.

49:45.460 --> 49:46.500
Sorry, I'm a fan of the show.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.420
Okay, all right.

49:47.420 --> 49:48.820
I love you too.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.220
All right.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.980
Can you think of possible trajectories,

49:51.980 --> 49:56.980
how this FTX, SPF saga ends?

49:58.700 --> 50:00.340
And which one do you hope for?

50:00.340 --> 50:03.220
Do you hope that SPF goes to jail?

50:03.220 --> 50:04.460
That's the individual.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.860
And in terms of the investors and the customers,

50:07.860 --> 50:08.860
what do you hope happens?

50:08.860 --> 50:10.300
And what do you think are the possible things

50:10.300 --> 50:12.020
that can happen?

50:12.020 --> 50:15.660
So A, yeah, I definitely think SPF should go to jail.

50:16.580 --> 50:20.220
For nothing else, for a semblance of justice,

50:20.220 --> 50:23.420
the facsimile of justice to occur for all the investors.

50:24.340 --> 50:28.340
I also think there are people probably several steps

50:28.340 --> 50:30.060
down the chain that probably knew,

50:30.060 --> 50:32.260
at least Caroline Ellison.

50:32.260 --> 50:34.500
You can have questions about sort of their,

50:34.500 --> 50:37.980
Dan Friedberg, who I'd love to talk about as well.

50:37.980 --> 50:40.500
There were a lot of people in that room who I think knew.

50:40.500 --> 50:44.860
I think we do so much of like, the one guy is all to blame.

50:44.860 --> 50:46.860
Let's throw everything at him.

50:46.860 --> 50:51.020
When clearly this was a company wide issue.

50:51.020 --> 50:54.740
So everyone who knew I think should face

50:54.740 --> 50:56.700
the same punishment, which I think should be jail

50:56.700 --> 50:58.180
for all of those people.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.820
In part to send a signal to anybody

51:01.820 --> 51:04.060
that tries this kind of stuff in the future.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.100
Yeah, absolutely. Harsh, harsh punishment.

51:05.100 --> 51:07.620
I mean, one of the big things that you saw,

51:07.860 --> 51:11.780
like, okay, take a microcosm of all of this action

51:11.780 --> 51:14.700
and just look at like the influencer space, right?

51:14.700 --> 51:16.580
There's a ton of deals that were done

51:16.580 --> 51:21.300
that I've covered ad nauseam about influencer finds out

51:21.300 --> 51:24.100
they can make a lot of money selling a crypto coin.

51:24.100 --> 51:27.580
The first thing they wonder is, am I gonna get caught?

51:27.580 --> 51:30.620
If I do this, is there a consequence?

51:30.620 --> 51:34.260
And if the answer is no, then it's a pretty easy decision.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.500
As long as you don't like have any moral scruples about it,

51:36.500 --> 51:37.780
which apparently none of them did,

51:37.780 --> 51:40.300
or a lot of them didn't, I should say.

51:40.300 --> 51:44.060
So as soon as somebody steps in and regulates,

51:44.060 --> 51:45.940
that math changes.

51:45.940 --> 51:47.580
And all of a sudden there's a self-interest reason

51:47.580 --> 51:49.380
to not go do the bad thing.

51:49.380 --> 51:51.860
So, and I can give a concrete example of this.

51:53.260 --> 51:56.340
There was a NFT, the first ever NFT

51:56.340 --> 52:00.020
sort of like official indictment

52:00.020 --> 52:02.460
or the DOJ released this press release,

52:02.460 --> 52:05.740
that they're charging these guys who ran a NFT project

52:05.740 --> 52:07.340
that they didn't follow through on their promises.

52:07.340 --> 52:08.180
They made all these promises,

52:08.180 --> 52:10.420
lied and then ran away with the money.

52:10.420 --> 52:13.460
First ever consequence for anyone in the NFT space.

52:13.460 --> 52:15.540
That day that that press release came out,

52:15.540 --> 52:20.540
I saw several NFT projects come back to life from the dead.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.660
Why?

52:21.660 --> 52:24.260
Because all those founders are freaking out

52:24.260 --> 52:26.100
and they realized we scammed people.

52:26.100 --> 52:27.940
We have to go at least make it look like

52:27.940 --> 52:29.060
we're doing the right thing, right?

52:29.060 --> 52:30.740
Even just, so that's on the optic side,

52:30.740 --> 52:32.980
but there's also tons of people who now go,

52:32.980 --> 52:36.620
oh, basically law enforcement is on the scene.

52:36.620 --> 52:37.620
We can't do the same thing.

52:37.620 --> 52:42.620
So there is a very pragmatic reason for this punishment.

52:42.780 --> 52:45.500
It's very much just because people work it into their math

52:45.500 --> 52:47.460
of should I commit fraud?

52:47.460 --> 52:49.940
And the last several years have been very,

52:50.900 --> 52:55.860
sort of it's been like a little bit of a nihilistic landscape

52:55.860 --> 52:57.420
where no one was getting punished.

52:57.420 --> 52:59.740
And so there's this question of you're almost an idiot

52:59.740 --> 53:01.740
if you didn't take the deals.

53:01.740 --> 53:03.060
So I think it's really important,

53:03.060 --> 53:07.380
extremely important for kind of law enforcement

53:07.380 --> 53:09.900
to play a role, regulation to play a role,

53:09.900 --> 53:11.300
to make it harder to commit those crimes.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.860
And if you commit those crimes,

53:12.860 --> 53:15.380
there's actual real world punishment for it.

53:16.380 --> 53:17.220
To your point about like,

53:17.220 --> 53:18.580
what's gonna happen to the investors?

53:18.580 --> 53:21.100
I think that was kind of your question.

53:21.100 --> 53:23.540
It's tough because if the money's not there,

53:23.540 --> 53:24.380
the money's not there.

53:24.380 --> 53:26.020
I mean, there's gonna be the guy,

53:26.020 --> 53:27.780
they got the best in class guy.

53:27.780 --> 53:30.340
It's the guy who ran the dissolving of Enron.

53:30.380 --> 53:33.020
So I mean, I can't imagine someone better equipped

53:33.020 --> 53:36.780
to run a complicated corporate fraud, like dissolution.

53:36.780 --> 53:39.380
But yeah, it's tough

53:39.380 --> 53:41.660
because everyone's gonna get probably, I don't know,

53:41.660 --> 53:44.220
10 cents on the dollar, maybe less.

53:44.220 --> 53:45.060
I wonder if there's a way

53:45.060 --> 53:47.940
to do a progressive redistribution of funds.

53:47.940 --> 53:51.100
So I'm just really worried about the pain

53:51.100 --> 53:53.660
that small investors feel, you know?

53:53.660 --> 53:57.980
Yeah, I think there's a lot of thought around that.

53:57.980 --> 54:02.060
I forget if they actually do do this.

54:02.060 --> 54:03.180
I mean, I know there's a lot of law

54:03.180 --> 54:06.700
about like, you can't treat creditors differently.

54:06.700 --> 54:08.260
You have to treat them all the same.

54:08.260 --> 54:12.340
So I think it'll be some kind of proportional payback.

54:12.340 --> 54:14.780
It's certainly not gonna be that the guys at the top

54:14.780 --> 54:17.180
get a significant amount of their money back

54:17.180 --> 54:18.900
and the rest get nothing.

54:18.900 --> 54:22.740
Unfortunately, I think there's such a small amount

54:22.740 --> 54:25.180
of assets that back this whole thing in the end.

54:25.180 --> 54:28.020
And that value is actually declining every day

54:28.020 --> 54:31.380
because it was inextricably tied to FSPF.

54:31.380 --> 54:35.300
It was like the FTT tokens, which now what are those worth?

54:35.300 --> 54:37.300
The serum tokens, that was his project

54:37.300 --> 54:39.460
or the project they made, what is that worth?

54:39.460 --> 54:40.340
Basically nothing.

54:40.340 --> 54:44.260
So, you know, it's a very, it's a hard situation.

54:44.260 --> 54:46.780
And you know, there's a bigger ethical concern,

54:46.780 --> 54:51.220
which is FTX US, it's unclear how backed it was,

54:51.220 --> 54:55.060
but it was clearly more backed than FTX International.

54:55.060 --> 54:57.980
Do you take all that money and throw it into a big pot

54:57.980 --> 54:59.540
and give people money back?

54:59.540 --> 55:03.820
Or do you give the US people back their amount of money,

55:03.820 --> 55:05.860
which is probably gonna be significantly more

55:05.860 --> 55:08.380
and leave everyone internationally out in the cold?

55:08.380 --> 55:10.660
And to add to that ethical issue,

55:10.660 --> 55:14.700
let's say you're a liquidator and you're US based.

55:14.700 --> 55:19.180
There's a tremendous question, like legal questions about,

55:19.180 --> 55:20.820
you know, how do you ethically do that?

55:20.820 --> 55:23.500
It's not clear, there's a tremendous incentive

55:23.500 --> 55:26.260
to just favor the US people over everyone else

55:26.260 --> 55:28.380
because it's our country, America, whatever.

55:28.380 --> 55:30.820
But I don't know if that's necessarily fair.

55:30.820 --> 55:32.940
It's really hard, it's like, it's impossible.

55:32.940 --> 55:35.100
And some, I forget where you said this,

55:35.100 --> 55:39.100
but one of the, I mean, it probably permeates

55:39.100 --> 55:41.700
a lot of the investigations you do,

55:41.700 --> 55:44.180
which is this idea that it's really sad

55:44.180 --> 55:47.100
that the middle class in most situations like this

55:47.100 --> 55:48.380
get fucked over.

55:48.380 --> 55:52.860
So the IRS go after the middle class,

55:52.860 --> 55:54.020
then go after the rich.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.740
It's basically everyone who doesn't have a lot of leverage

55:57.740 --> 56:02.500
in terms of lawyers, money, get fucked over.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.780
Yes, and then they're the ones,

56:05.780 --> 56:07.420
like it's always the rich and powerful

56:07.420 --> 56:08.740
who get the favorable treatment.

56:08.740 --> 56:11.180
As like a microcosm of this funny story.

56:11.180 --> 56:14.900
So one of the big criticisms of crypto,

56:14.900 --> 56:16.340
and I think rightly so,

56:16.340 --> 56:18.460
is the irreversibility of the transaction.

56:18.460 --> 56:21.860
So if I accidentally send a transaction somewhere,

56:21.860 --> 56:23.220
it's gone, right?

56:23.220 --> 56:27.340
So crypto.com accidentally sent a lady $10 million,

56:28.300 --> 56:30.700
and now they want the money back and they're suing her.

56:30.700 --> 56:33.820
But the funny thing is, is if you are on crypto.com

56:33.820 --> 56:37.100
and you send, let's say I accidentally send you money

56:37.100 --> 56:38.260
and I come knocking on your door,

56:38.260 --> 56:42.460
Lex, I didn't mean to send you like $1,000,

56:42.460 --> 56:44.380
I need my money back.

56:44.380 --> 56:45.660
Or if I go to crypto.com and I said,

56:45.660 --> 56:47.420
hey, I sent that to the wrong person, can you reverse it?

56:47.420 --> 56:49.860
They'll say, screw off, no way.

56:49.860 --> 56:52.100
If I go to court, they'll kill me in court

56:52.100 --> 56:52.940
because they're gonna go, look,

56:52.940 --> 56:54.100
this is how the blockchain works.

56:54.100 --> 56:56.060
But then they do it, they do the exact same thing.

56:56.060 --> 56:57.700
They send this lady $10 million,

56:57.700 --> 56:58.940
they're suing her and they're gonna win.

56:58.940 --> 57:02.020
Now what's in court is not whether they get the money back,

57:02.020 --> 57:04.940
it's should she be liable for theft, I believe.

57:04.940 --> 57:08.460
So, and that's in just another case of

57:09.620 --> 57:12.060
the same rules apply differently to different people,

57:12.060 --> 57:14.180
whether you have the money to back you or not.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.620
It's a very sad thing.

57:15.620 --> 57:17.220
And that's why I think people like,

57:17.220 --> 57:22.220
you need journalists fighting for the little person.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.060
We really need it.

57:25.060 --> 57:26.580
And it's kind of like this unfortunate thing

57:26.580 --> 57:29.540
where that's the most risky thing to do, like legally.

57:29.540 --> 57:31.020
You should not be doing that,

57:31.020 --> 57:33.620
but I think it's important to do.

57:33.620 --> 57:36.900
It's the ethical thing, it's the right thing to do.

57:36.900 --> 57:39.460
What do you think about influencers and celebrities

57:39.460 --> 57:41.340
that supported FTX and SBF?

57:41.340 --> 57:43.380
Do they, should they be punished?

57:43.380 --> 57:46.220
Yeah, I think they should take a huge reputational hit.

57:46.460 --> 57:48.660
I think they should be embarrassed.

57:48.660 --> 57:51.700
I think they should be ashamed of themselves.

57:51.700 --> 57:54.300
But it was really hard to know, sorry to interrupt,

57:54.300 --> 57:58.140
for them to know, for example, I think about this a lot.

57:58.140 --> 58:03.140
It's like, who do I, because I don't investigate,

58:04.980 --> 58:08.860
sponsored by Athletic Greens, it's a nutritional drink.

58:08.860 --> 58:11.300
Should I investigate them deeply?

58:11.300 --> 58:13.900
I don't know, you just kind of use reputational,

58:13.900 --> 58:15.140
it seems to work for me.

58:15.140 --> 58:16.860
Should I, like, investigate them deeply?

58:16.860 --> 58:19.100
I think it really depends on,

58:19.100 --> 58:22.100
I think your credibility hit will depend on

58:22.100 --> 58:23.900
what domain you're an expert in.

58:23.900 --> 58:26.540
If you're sponsored by a robotics company,

58:26.540 --> 58:28.420
and you're an expert in robotics,

58:28.420 --> 58:31.460
if that company turns out to be a disaster and a fraud,

58:31.460 --> 58:32.980
then you should have looked more deeply.

58:32.980 --> 58:34.780
We're talking mostly about,

58:34.780 --> 58:37.460
like I hold Tom Brady a lot less accountable

58:37.460 --> 58:40.260
than financial advisors, financial influencers,

58:40.260 --> 58:42.420
because that is their world of expertise.

58:42.420 --> 58:46.100
And you treat their recommendation differently,

58:46.100 --> 58:48.860
proportionally to what you think their expertise is.

58:48.860 --> 58:50.740
So in some ways, I don't actually think,

58:50.740 --> 58:52.620
Tom Brady, I'm sure he reached a lot of people.

58:52.620 --> 58:55.340
I personally didn't feel at all moved by his recommendation,

58:55.340 --> 58:57.100
because you know it's just money.

58:57.100 --> 58:57.980
But when you hear somebody

58:57.980 --> 59:00.740
who should be an expert in that thing,

59:00.740 --> 59:03.180
endorse a product in that space.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.100
You hold that opinion to a higher standard,

59:06.100 --> 59:10.340
and when they're completely cataclysmically wrong,

59:10.340 --> 59:12.420
it's gonna be a different level of accountability.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.620
And I think rightfully so.

59:13.620 --> 59:17.620
When Jim Cramer was saying Bear Stearns is fine,

59:17.620 --> 59:20.540
he made that terrible call with Bear Stearns in 2008.

59:20.540 --> 59:24.460
He was rightfully reamed for all of that.

59:24.460 --> 59:26.740
Even though it could be considered that like,

59:26.740 --> 59:29.100
well, you know, did he have all the information?

59:29.100 --> 59:31.780
Maybe not, but he's a financial advisor.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.780
He does this for a living.

59:33.780 --> 59:35.940
If you go on and you make a big call,

59:35.940 --> 59:37.180
and you turn out to be wrong,

59:37.180 --> 59:39.340
and people lose tons of money,

59:39.340 --> 59:41.420
you are going to take a hit, and I think rightfully so.

59:41.420 --> 59:43.220
But no, I don't think these people should go to jail

59:43.220 --> 59:44.060
or anything like that.

59:44.060 --> 59:45.340
No, but it's such a complicated thing.

59:45.340 --> 59:47.060
I mean, I just feel it personally myself.

59:47.060 --> 59:50.980
I get it, but you still feel the burden of the fact

59:50.980 --> 59:53.820
that your opinion has influence.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.100
I know it shouldn't.

59:55.100 --> 59:57.300
I know Tom Brady's opinion on financial investment

59:57.300 --> 59:59.900
should not have influence, but it does.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.500
That's just the reality of it.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.900
That's a real burden.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.820
I didn't know anything about SBF or FTX.

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.500
It wasn't on my radar at all.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.980
But I could have seen myself taking them on as a sponsor.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.380
I've seen a lot of people I respect,

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.980
Sam Harris and others, talk with SBF,

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.820
like he's doing good for the world.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.820
So I could see myself being hoodwinked,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.300
having not done research.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.820
And the same thing, it makes me wonder.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.380
I don't want to become cynical, man,

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.540
but it makes you wonder, who are the people in your life

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.860
you trust that are like, that could be the next SBF

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.260
or worse, big, powerful leaders,

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.020
Hitler and all that kind of stuff.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.860
To what degree do you want to investigate?

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.100
Do you want to hold their feet to the fire,

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.220
see through their bullshit, call them on their bullshit?

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.860
And also as a friend, if you happen to be friends

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.700
or have a connection, how to help them

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.460
not slip into the land of fraud.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.860
I don't know, all of it is just overwhelming.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.980
Yeah, I mean, we should be clear,

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.980
finance is sort of a special space

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.780
where you're talking about people's money.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.260
You're not talking about whether someone

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.300
takes a bad supplement or like a supplement

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.020
that is just, they're $50 out, right?

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.460
I think the scale of harm and therefore responsibility

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.540
escalates depending on what field you're in.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:25.860
Just like I wouldn't hold Tom Brady as,

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.860
like if he gives a bad football opinion, right?

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.460
And he should have known better.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.260
That is a different scale of harm

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.460
than a doctor giving bad advice, right?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.260
Like he tells you a pill works and the pill kills you

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260
or something like that.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.180
There's just different levels of accountability

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.140
depending on the field you're in

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.420
and you have to be aware of it.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.900
Finance is an, you have to be extremely conservative

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.660
if you're going to give financial advice

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.420
because you're playing with people's lives

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.940
and you cannot play with them haphazardly.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.300
You cannot gamble with them.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.580
You cannot play with them on a bet

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.460
because you're getting paid a lot of money.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.780
It's just the nature of the space.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.020
And so with the space comes the responsibility

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.860
and the accountability.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.500
And I don't think you can get around that.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.140
Who was Dan Friedberg that you mentioned?

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.380
Some of these figures in the SPF realm

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.660
that are interesting to you.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.580
Super interesting kind of subject

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.500
because Dan Friedberg is the former general counsel

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.820
for Ultimate Bet.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.300
Ultimate Bet was a poker site

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.260
where famously they got in a scandal

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.700
because the owner, Russ Hamilton,

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.820
was cheating with a little software piece of code

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.100
they called God Mode.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.940
God Mode allowed you to see the guy across from you's hand.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.300
Obviously you can imagine you can win pretty consistently

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.700
if you know exactly what your opponent has.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.500
Very unethical.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.340
They, I should be clear that for some inexplicable reason,

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.060
I don't think they were ever charged

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.580
and convicted of a crime,

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.860
but they were investigated by a gambling commission

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.140
that found they made tens of millions of dollars this way.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.540
For sure.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.340
And Dan Friedberg is the general counsel.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.740
He's caught on a call,

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:04.100
basically conspiring with Russ to hide this fraud.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.660
He's saying we should blame it on a consultant third party.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.780
And Russ Hamilton famously says,

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.900
it was me, I did it.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.700
I don't wanna give the money back.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.620
Find basically a way to get rid of this.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.860
So that's Dan Friedberg's big achievement.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.420
That's what he's known for, he's most known for.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.900
And this is the guy they pick

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.620
as their chief regulatory officer for FTX.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.740
Why do you hire somebody who, I get it,

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.300
not formally charged and convicted, investigated,

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.940
there's all the, and there's tape out there.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.860
So I wanna be clear about what's actually available evidence.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.060
But someone who's seemingly only achievement

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.260
is hiding fraud, why do you hire that guy

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:46.100
if the intention is not to hide fraud?

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.420
So this is a question I put to Sam Bankman Fried

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.100
and his answer was, well, we have a lot of lawyers.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.220
And I said, well, it's your chief regulatory officer.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.660
He's like, well, it wasn't, we did regulate a lot.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.740
And it was just this big dance of,

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.020
basically he's done great work, he's a great guy.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.340
And I think that tells you everything you need to know.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.740
And there's figures like that,

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.300
probably even at the lower levels,

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.380
like just infiltrate the entire organization.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.940
Well, it's just like, yeah, why wasn't there a CFA?

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.340
Why wasn't there anyone in that space

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.980
who could seemingly be the eyes that goes,

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.060
holy whatever, we need to,

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.500
we were in dangerous territory here, right?

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.860
So yeah, it seems very deliberate.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.580
I mean, I talked to one FTX employee that they talked about,

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.700
who's told me they talked about taking,

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.340
I think it was taking FTX US public

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.380
and Sam was very against the idea.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:44.020
And the employee in retrospect speculated

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.660
that it might've been because you'd faced so much scrutiny,

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:50.060
like regulation wise, like you'd have to go through a lot,

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.340
like more thorough audits, all that kind of stuff,

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.540
that basically he knew they would never pass.

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.180
So yeah, I mean, it's red flags all the way down

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.500
with that guy.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.740
And you hope all of them get punished?

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.700
Everyone who knew.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.140
I mean, I think for sure there are people at FTX

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.140
who didn't know.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.500
I think there are some people at Alameda who didn't know.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.220
Well, there's degrees, sorry to interrupt,

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.580
but there's degrees of not knowing.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.420
Yes.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.340
There's a looking away.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.020
When you kind of know shady stuff,

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.900
that's still the same as knowing, right?

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.220
That might be even worse.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.740
Well, yeah, like I was talking to one insider

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.620
and we were talking about the insider trading.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.820
They were telling me about this insider trading.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.900
And I said, do you think this was criminal?

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.420
And they said it was probably criminal in hindsight, yes.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.220
And the question is someone who answers a question like that,

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.780
what does that mean?

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.580
You know, like it was probably criminal.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.500
So you're right, there are different degrees.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.940
I mean, I'll say at the most basic,

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.980
I would be very happy if everyone who had direct knowledge

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.260
went to jail, which I don't think will happen to be clear.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.020
I think a lot of people are gonna cut deals.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.540
Prosecutors are gonna cut deals

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.500
so they actually nail Sam Bankman Fried.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.180
I think that's their only focus.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.340
What about his reputation?

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.540
What do you think about all these interviews?

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.700
Do you think they are helping him?

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.580
Do you think they're good for the world?

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.900
Do you think they're bad for the world?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.300
Like what's your sense?

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.500
And like, say you get a sit down interview

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.700
with him for three hours

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.740
and I'm holding the door closed.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.180
Is that a useful conversation or not?

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:27.740
Or at this point, it should be legal and that's it.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.060
I think it's useful.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.300
I mean, I think it's all about how you interview him.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.980
You can interview someone responsibly.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.620
You can interview him irresponsibly.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.820
I think we've seen examples of both.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.100
What's an irresponsible?

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.300
I keep interrupting you rudely.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.140
That's okay, no, no, no.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.460
It's unacceptable. No, no, no.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.940
I think it's fine.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.300
There was like a New York Times interview

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.540
which spends any amount of time talking about his sleep.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.020
And he's like, yeah, I'm sleeping great.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.340
I mean, I think that's so deeply disrespectful

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.340
to the victims.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.700
And especially when you're,

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.380
you're not even releasing an interview live.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.180
It's like you have time to triage

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.420
what you're gonna talk about.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.220
Why would you spend any amount of time talking

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.060
about the sleep that a fraudster is getting?

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.740
It's just so weird.

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.260
Well, can I steal a man in that case?

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.420
I don't think it turned out well.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.500
I think that's true.

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.380
Okay, here's the thing.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.940
I could see myself talking about somebody's sleep

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.100
or getting in somebody's mind

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.740
if I knew I have unlimited time with them.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.300
If I knew I had like four hours.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.780
Cause you get into the mind of the person,

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.140
how they think, how they see the world.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.140
Because I think that ultimately reveals,

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.140
if they're actually really good at lying,

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.860
it reveals the depths, the complexity of the mind

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:42.340
that through like osmosis,

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.220
you get to understand like this person,

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.460
this person is not as trivial as you realize.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.140
Also makes you maybe realize that this person is,

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.780
has a lot of hope, has a lot of positive ambition

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.100
that's like, that has developed over their life.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.340
And then certain interesting ways things went wrong.

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.980
It become corrupt and all that kind of stuff.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.220
You just, that's all fine.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:08.260
But this conversation was not properly contextualized

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.380
in the world of what he did.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:14.300
It, and I, you know, I've asked about this interview

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.180
cause I was like so curious.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.060
It was out of the New York Times.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.660
And there was not much mention of fraud or jail

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.260
or the big crimes, like misappropriation

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.980
of even client assets.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:27.380
It was just sort of this, you know, Sam sat down with me.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.300
He's under investigation, but there's not much specifics.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.100
And then it's like, yeah, he's playing storybook brawl.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:33.980
He's sleeping.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.540
He's, and it's just like, okay,

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.860
this isn't adding to the conversation.

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.100
Especially when the New York Times,

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.340
it's like you should be grilling.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.540
Right, right, exactly.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.060
So, but as I've said, I mean, it's all arranged the gamut

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.260
and some interviews, like some of it's okay.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.180
And then some of it's weird,

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.500
like the Andrew Sorkin interview,

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.940
he asked some hard hitting questions,

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.660
which I really appreciate it.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.420
And then at the end he goes, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.380
Sam Bankman Fried and everyone gives like a,

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.780
like an ovation for Sam.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.700
I mean, the steel man of that of course is like,

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.220
they're actually applauding Andrew Sorkin,

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.660
but the way you like lay it up,

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.620
I wouldn't go like ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.460
it's like an applause line.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.780
It's like ladies and gentlemen, the Eagles, Elton John,

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.180
Lex Friedman, and so to go to,

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.500
so you have this like deal book summit

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.460
where you have all these important figures

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.300
that are positively important.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.020
And at the end you have Sam Bankman Fried a fraudster

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:24.900
and you go ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.780
Sam Bankman Fried, everyone's applauding.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.180
That I think is a net, like, I think that's a negative.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.900
I think the way that the optics of that just were all wrong.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.300
And so I think, yeah, you have to be very responsible.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.460
I think it's useful,

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.340
going back to how you can usefully do this,

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.540
you can, even when somebody's determined to lie to you,

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.540
it's always important to pin them down

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.460
to an accounting of events,

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.900
because that is unimaginably helpful

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.380
when it comes to a prosecutor trying

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.860
to prove this guy's guilty,

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:59.060
is if you say you didn't do a crime,

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.500
but you don't tell me any details about it,

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.260
day of the trial, you can basically make up any story,

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.140
but if you tell me in detail where you were that day,

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.100
I can go hunt down, you say you were with Joe,

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.980
I go hunt down Joe and he says he wasn't with you,

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.140
boom, you've lost credibility

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.580
and now you're much more likely to be convicted.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.620
So it's really important to get SBF's exact accounting

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.100
of how things went wrong,

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.540
because right now he's positioning himself

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.300
to throw his Alameda CEO, Caroline Ellison, under the bus.

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.460
Like, she did everything, she knew everything,

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.900
I knew nothing.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.620
Caroline Ellison's gonna take the stand and go,

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.860
well, I have all these text messages and this is all a lie

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.300
and then Sam Beckman Fried is gonna be completely

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.540
ruined, like self-ruined by his own design.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.380
So I think it's important.

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.700
So more like a legal type of,

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.540
like get the details of where he was,

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.700
what he was thinking, what the...

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.460
I think it's like, yeah, I think it's,

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.020
I think the public probably cares

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.860
to get to know what happened to,

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:59.420
and again, I think if you're careful,

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.940
you can expose someone as they lie to you

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.420
without giving into those lies, right?

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.020
Like without capitulating to,

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.140
oh, I'm just gonna assume you're correct.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.220
I think you can point to, well, Lex,

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.340
you say it happened this way,

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.980
but you've lied about X, Y, and Z,

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.260
why should we believe you?

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.460
That's a suddenly a totally different conversation

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.740
than just being like, oh, okay, that's how it happened.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:24.620
The thing I caught that bothered me,

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:26.740
and the thing I hope to do in interviews,

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.740
if I eventually get good at this thing,

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.460
is the human aspect of it,

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.780
which is like, which I think you have to do in person,

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.140
is he seems a bit nonchalant about the pain

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.060
and the suffering of people.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.540
I have red flags about,

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.540
in the way he communicates about the loss of money,

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.140
like the pain that people are feeling about the money,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.340
I get red flags.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.180
Like you're not, forget if you're involved

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.020
in that pain or not.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.260
You're not feeling that pain.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.860
He'll say he is,

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.100
but he'll be playing a game of League of Legends

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:05.940
while doing it.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.540
No, but I just see it from his face.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.380
No, I know.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.380
And that needs to be grilled,

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.620
like that little human dance there.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.140
That's, I mean, I considered,

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.500
I talked to him,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.940
I considered doing an in-person interview with him.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.780
Are you still considering it?

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.900
I don't know, do you think I should, in person?

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:33.260
I think it depends if you think you have anything

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.220
to add to the conversation.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.060
A lot of people have.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.020
Yeah, there's been already,

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.380
you did an incredible job.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.220
Thanks.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.540
I think.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.660
I think I would like to grill the shit out of him

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.940
as a fellow human,

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:44.940
but not an investigative.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:45.780
No, no.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.860
Like another human being,

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.500
another human being who I can have compassion for,

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.940
who has caused a lot of suffering in the world.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.700
Like that, that grilling,

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.900
like basically convey the anger that people,

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.500
and the pain that people are feeling, right?

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.340
Like that.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.460
Yeah.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.540
I think, I think it'd be really hard.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.820
I mean, like that guy is sort of a master dancer.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.380
And what he would say at the end of it,

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.900
because I've listened to so many interviews of him,

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.740
I probably am like a GPT model for Sam.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.100
I think he would do some kind of thing about like,

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.620
yeah, I really hear you.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.540
It's just terrible.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.660
I feel such an obligation to the people who've lost money.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.420
And it's just, it's a lot of money.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.620
It's a lot of money.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:34.820
He'd do something like that.

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.020
And it would be very superficially like, okay.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:42.380
But when you drill down to the details of what he did,

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.660
it's just impossible that he didn't know.

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.060
And one of the things that I wish I had asked,

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.420
maybe I can talk about like,

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.860
I wish I had gone on this.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.500
It's just so hard when you're doing a live interview

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.460
to kind of focus on one thing.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.220
Everyone's asked about the terms of service.

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.980
So in the terms of service, there was like,

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:58.940
we can't touch your funds.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.780
Your funds are safe.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.820
We're never gonna do anything with that.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.060
Anytime anyone brings that up, he says, oh,

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.460
well, there's this other terms of service over here

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.700
with margin trading accounts.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.100
Remember we talked about, it's a derivatives platform.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.220
If you're in our derivative side,

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.260
you're subject to different terms of service,

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.340
which kind of lets us like move your money around

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.140
with everyone else, okay?

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.140
So we treat it as one big pool of funds.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.260
And that's sort of the explanation of how this all happened

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.420
is we had this huge leverage position

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.220
and we lost everything.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.860
But what no one has sort of done a good enough job

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.300
getting to the heart of

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.220
is that this pool of funds never was segregated properly.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.460
It was all treated under the same umbrella

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.300
of we can use your funds.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.420
There was no amount of we have the client deposits,

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.980
which were just deposited with us

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.940
and not like used to margin trade or do anything over here.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.820
These funds over here, we have saved.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:48.900
They didn't.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.580
Fundamentally, they lied from the get-go

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.020
about how they were treating the most precious assets,

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.980
which is your customer deposits

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.580
that you said you didn't invest.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.820
Clearly, you put them all over here,

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.980
you yolo gambled them,

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.500
and then when everyone starts withdrawing from here,

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.940
they don't have any money over here.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.740
So that is like one of the most fundamental things

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.460
that I haven't seen anyone grill him on.

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.380
And the next time,

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.660
if I get the chance to ambush him again,

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.060
that's what I'm gonna drill down on

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.900
because it's impossible for that not to be fraud.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.660
There's no world where you had a pool of funds over here

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.060
and now you don't have them

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.100
without you somehow borrowing over here.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.340
Because if you deposited one Bitcoin

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.580
and I never sold that Bitcoin

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.860
and it's earmarked Lex Friedman,

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.500
and you come and it's not there,

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.140
something had to happen, right?

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.460
Well, so this is so interesting.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.460
So for me, the approach that, like you said,

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.980
the most important question of,

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.820
because for you, it's like, were those funds segregated?

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:57.180
For me, the question is, as a human being,

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.780
how would you feel if you were observing that?

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.980
So like, you know, that like marshmallow test with the babies,

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.380
like it's the human thing.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.740
This is a human nature question.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.540
Like, I can understand there's a pile of money

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.660
and you, the good faith interpretation is like,

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.500
well, I know what to do with that pile of money

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.620
to grow that pile of money.

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.940
Let me just take a little bit of that.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.100
Like, how willing are you to do that kind of thing?

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.020
How able are you to do that kind of thing?

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.740
And when shit goes wrong, what goes through your mind?

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.060
How does it become corrupted?

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.980
How do you begin to delude yourself?

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.660
How do you delegate responsibility for the failures?

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.300
Like, as opposed to getting facts,

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.780
try to sneak into the human mind of a person

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.780
when they're thinking of that.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:47.780
Because the facts, they're gonna start waffling.

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:50.820
They're gonna start like trying to make sure

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.740
they don't say anything that gets them incriminated.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.420
But I just, I want to understand the human being there

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.700
because I think that indirectly gives you a sense of

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.300
where were you in this big picture?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.580
I think I've talked to so many people

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.540
who have sort of committed some range

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.220
of like outright fraud to like misleading marketing.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.820
No one thinks they're a bad person.

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.780
Nobody admits that they did it

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.460
and they knew they, or almost nobody does.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.820
There's actually one funny exception,

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.140
but I had a guy who admitted like,

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.700
yeah, I did it, it was wrong.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.140
And, you know, but I did it and I wanted the money,

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.140
which was kind of like almost refreshing in its honesty.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.140
But the reason I focus on like the facts is because

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.980
unless you find a bright red line,

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.020
humans can rationalize anything.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.220
I can rationalize any level of like,

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.180
well, I did this because I had the best of intentions.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.980
And if you play the intention game,

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.260
you'll never convict anyone

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.620
because everyone has good intentions.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.140
Everyone's honest, everyone's doing the best they can

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.020
and got misleaded and got misguided and dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:57.140
Ultimately, you have to drill down to the concrete

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.740
and go, look, I get it.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.820
You're just like the last 50 guys that I interviewed.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.260
You had the best of intentions.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.100
It all went wrong, I'm very sorry for you.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.660
But at the end of the day, there's people hurting

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.980
and there's people that have significant damage to their life

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.060
because of you.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.220
What did you actually do and what can we prove

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.620
taking intention out of it, taking motivation out?

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.060
What can we prove that you did

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.020
that was unethical, illegal or immoral?

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.660
And like, that is sort of what usually I try to go to

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.180
because I will do those human interviews,

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:32.020
but you know, it's just like the same record on repeat.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.980
I mean, a lot of people go to the same.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.820
I'm with you, I'm with you on everything you said,

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.860
but there is ways to avoid the record on repeat.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.100
I mean, those are different skill set.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.660
You're exceptionally good at the investigative,

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.180
like investigating.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.420
I do believe there's a way to break through the repeat.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.380
There's different techniques to it.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.300
One of which is like taking outside

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.620
of their particular story.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:57.500
Yes, when everyone looks at their own story,

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.140
they can see themselves as a good player doing good,

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.620
but you can do other thought experiments.

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.460
I mean, there's a-

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.660
But they'll follow you,

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.300
they'll know what the thought experiment is.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:08.900
No, well, it depends.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.420
It depends, my friend.

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.460
I mean, to me, there's a million of them,

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.660
but of just exploring your ethics.

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:22.780
Would you kill somebody to protect your family?

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.420
And you explore that.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.900
You start to sneak into like,

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:30.900
what's your sense of the in-group versus the out-group?

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.220
How much damage you can do to the out-group

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.740
and who is the out-group?

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.380
And you start to build that sense of the person.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:40.100
Are we like the two mobsters that we're dressed as?

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.340
Do we protect the family and fuck everyone else?

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:46.460
You're with us and the ones who are against us, fuck them.

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:51.180
Or do we have a sense that human beings all have value,

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.020
equal value, and we're a joint humanity?

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.300
There's ways to get to that.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.260
And you start to build up this sense of like,

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.220
some people that make a lot of money are better than others.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.980
They deserve to be at the top.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:08.180
If you have that feeling, you start to get a sense of like,

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.140
yeah, the poor people are the dumbasses.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:10.980
They're the idiots.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.380
If you believe that, then you start to understand

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.140
that this person may have been at the core

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.140
of this whole corrupt organization.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:19.740
Yes, two things.

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.860
One, I think you should join me on this side of the table.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.380
We'll put SBF over here.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.780
Well, good guy, bad guy, human facts.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.780
You're the bad guy.

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.780
I'm like, no, no, no, slow down, coffee.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.900
What is your feeling about humanity?

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.100
Have you been getting enough sleep?

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:36.940
Yeah, right.

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.540
So I think, no, I think there's a lot of truth

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.460
to what you said.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.300
One thing I've noticed that is hard to combat

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:47.140
is sort of like preference falsification

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.420
and just like, just the outright lying about those things

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.180
is tough to kind of pin down.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.980
But yeah, you're absolutely right.

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.060
There's ways to interview people.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.940
There's all sorts of interesting techniques.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.740
And yeah, I don't disagree.

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.420
Good cop, bad cop.

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.980
We should do, this should be like a sitcom.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.620
Okay, you did an incredible documentary on SafeMoon.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.580
The title is, I Uncovered a Billion Dollar Fraud.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.100
Can you tell me the story of SafeMoon?

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.060
Sure, so SafeMoon was a crypto coin

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:23.060
that exploded on the scene in 2021, I think at this point.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.580
Sorry, I'm losing track of my years.

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.900
One year in crypto is like five years in real life.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.980
But it kind of gained a huge amount of popularity

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.900
because of this idea that it's in the name.

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.500
You go safely to the moon.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.900
How they were gonna do this

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.220
is with sort of a sophisticated smart contract idea

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.820
where there's, I kind of have to explain

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.260
the way some contracts get rug pulled for a second

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.300
or there's scams happen.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.060
So in the, sometimes it's called like the shit coin space,

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.980
the alt coin space, anything like below Bitcoin, Ethereum

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.860
and maybe the top five or 10

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.580
is kind of seen as this wasteland of gambling.

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.260
And like, you know, you don't know if they're,

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.180
the developers are gonna become anything or not.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.180
You're kind of like reading the white paper,

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.420
trying to figure it out.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:11.220
So there's this big question about like,

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.380
how can you get scammed?

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.980
How can, back to the interests,

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.620
you don't want the developer to have some like parachute cord

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.260
where they can pull all the money out.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:26.260
So one way this happens is that in decentralized finance,

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.620
there's something called the liquidity pool, okay?

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.140
It's basically this big pot of money

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.340
that allows people to trade between two different currencies.

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.180
So let's say like SafeMoon and Bitcoin, right?

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:41.620
Or Ethereum, or it's actually on the Binance Smart Chain.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.180
So it'd be BNB.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.260
And this pool of money can be controlled by the developers

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.780
in such a way they can steal it all, right?

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.340
They can just grab it.

01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.580
I don't wanna go too much into details

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.620
because I feel like I'll lose people here.

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.500
But the point of SafeMoon was,

01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:00.140
the core idea was we're locking this money up.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.540
You can't touch it.

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:05.700
And actually every transaction that you buy SafeMoon with,

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.900
we'll take a 5% tax of that.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.340
We'll do a 10% tax, but 5% of it

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.540
will go back to all the holders of SafeMoon, okay?

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:17.140
And 5% of it will go back into this little pool of money, okay?

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.580
So the idea is as you trade,

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.380
as this token becomes more viral, two things will happen.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.340
One, the people who are holding it long-term

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.980
will be rewarded for holding it long-term

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.100
by receiving this 5% tax that's distributed to everyone.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.260
And two, you can kind of trust

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.940
that your money's gonna have this stable value

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:37.380
because this pool of money here in the middle,

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.500
that's kind of guaranteeing you can get your SafeMoon

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.660
out into this actually valuable currency,

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.820
it's not gonna move.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:47.700
So the story of SafeMoon was that fundamentally

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.420
this was not the case.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.660
They promised that this money was gonna be locked up.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.140
It was not actually locked up at all.

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.540
They said it was automatically locked up.

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.700
You don't have to worry about it.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.300
Well, it was very manually locked up

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.020
and they didn't actually lock a lot of it up.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:04.020
They took a lot of it for themselves, for the developers.

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.780
So there's a lot of players in this.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.220
A lot of them have left by now.

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.540
There's kind of this main CEO

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.620
that everyone knows, John Corone now.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:16.260
And despite saying that they were gonna lock up

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.260
all the funds for four years, somehow he's gone from,

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.420
as everyone else in the token has lost 99%

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.020
of the value of the token, so they've lost 99%.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.780
Like a $6 million crypto portfolio,

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.460
multimillion dollar real estate portfolio,

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:37.420
invested millions into various companies.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.100
So he's accrued this huge wealth.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.020
And so I made a video basically exposing that

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.420
and showing how this coin,

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:45.980
which once had a $4 billion market cap,

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.420
is just viral everywhere.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.900
Everyone was talking about it.

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.940
Because of these viral ideas,

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:53.020
it is sort of a captivating idea

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.900
that by holding it, you could get returns, right?

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.100
Like you just hold onto it, you automatically get money.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.660
And it's a viral idea that this money in the middle,

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.220
in the pot, isn't gonna leave you.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.740
When those things turned out to be false,

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.340
this community has had a slow death

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.620
as a lot of people realized it was a scam.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.180
And there's been a core part of the community,

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.700
which gets to an interesting dynamic

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.740
we can talk about if you want to,

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.700
where they have like doubled down on the belief in Corone.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.780
And so part of it was out of a hope

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.700
to let those people know what was really going on

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.500
in their coin and like hopefully save some of them.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.780
Not in like some altruistic sense,

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.220
but like, or not in like some like, I'm like a hero sense,

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:37.060
but in the sense of like, I think a lot of them didn't know,

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:37.900
like literally didn't know.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.780
So just sort of like as a public service,

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.660
letting them know so they could get their money out

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.740
and hopefully save themselves a lot of pain and suffering.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.580
So yeah.

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.140
So they really dug in.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:49.980
So they're-

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.820
Some did, some did, some did, some left.

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.860
I mean, a lot of people have left,

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.220
but the people who are left are people

01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:57.900
with large amounts of safe moon holdings

01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.220
that are down immensely.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.820
And you can imagine at a certain point in losses,

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.140
there's a tremendous psychological pressure to go,

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:06.940
look, I'm in it.

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.740
I got to go for the long haul.

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.900
And then you want to believe that this thing is legitimate

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.860
and will succeed because A,

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.820
there's an ego component around, I haven't been scammed.

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.540
I'm too smart to get scammed.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.980
It's tremendously, you know,

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.580
it hurts psychologically to acknowledge

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.820
you've been taken for a ride.

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.500
And also you just want this thing to succeed

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.500
for your financial wellbeing.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.820
So you like want to believe it.

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.780
So there's tremendous psychological pressure

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.620
to build cult-like communities around these tokens.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:40.380
And I've noticed with the incentive of like community built,

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.780
it's sort of new to finance.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.780
There's like these meme coins or these cults.

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:46.620
I don't want to,

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:47.900
it's not really fair to call all of them cults.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.580
Like some of them are open to criticism,

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.060
but one of the things that defines cults

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:55.700
is they're not open to sunlight or criticism.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.020
There's these financial communities that are opening up

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.940
with crypto, with a few stocks,

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.460
where if you criticize them, you are attacked.

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.780
And the entire community has every incentive

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.940
to kind of like downplay your legitimate criticisms

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.940
or kind of go after you.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.420
And so it creates this interesting dynamic

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.180
that I'm fascinated by.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:19.940
What do you think about Bitcoin then?

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.580
Do you think it's one of those communities

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.860
that does attack you when criticized?

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.460
So which, I guess, which coins do you think

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.940
are open to criticism and which are not?

01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:30.780
It's kind of tough.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.100
Like no community is a monolith.

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:37.980
So just like, it's just a spectrum of how open they are.

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.940
There's just like, there's always this core contingent

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:44.700
of extreme believers who will go after anyone

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.060
who criticizes them.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.620
And it's just about how wide of a band

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:51.380
that makes up of the entire token.

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.460
How intensely, how active that small community is.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:57.700
So it's in Bitcoin, they're called Bitcoin maximalists,

01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:01.580
but you can also call any communities

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.780
subgroup like that maximalists, whatever the belief is.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.020
I don't know, Dunkin' Donuts maximalists.

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.260
That community is probably small

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.060
in terms of attack you online.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.780
You know which community has a very intense following?

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:18.420
So I got attacked on the internet

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.500
when I said Messi's better than Ronaldo.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.700
Oh yeah, that's controversial.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.500
And so that's a very intense maximalist community there.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.580
The other one that surprised me is when I said,

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.500
now I did it in jest, okay folks?

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.660
I said Emacs is a better ID than Vim.

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:40.100
I love Emacs, I agree.

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:42.820
Listen, I have trauma.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.860
I wake up sweating sometimes at night thinking.

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.500
Emacs master race.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.740
The Vim people are after me.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.500
They're everywhere, they're in the shadows.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.580
No, Vim is an amazing, and it's actually surprised

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.660
I've recently learned that it's still even more so

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.660
than before, an incredibly active community.

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:01.500
So a lot of people wrote to me.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.700
But do you use Spacemax?

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.500
It's just Emacs and Vim?

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.540
No, I haven't.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.220
I use raw, I have.

01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.260
Old school Emacs?

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.100
But so.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:09.940
Oh, you gotta use, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:10.780
But hold on a second.

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.860
I have recently said, you know what?

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.820
Let's make love, not war, and I went to VS Code.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.020
I went to a more modern ID.

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:25.220
Because I did most of my programming in Emacs.

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.580
I did most of anything as one does in Emacs,

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.860
just because I also love Lisp,

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.380
so I can customize everything.

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.700
Then I realized, how long will Vim and Emacs be around,

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.540
really?

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:40.540
I was thinking, as a programmer looking 10, 20 years out,

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.580
I should challenge myself to learn new IDs,

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.540
to learn the new tools that the majority

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.780
of the community is using,

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.300
so that I can understand what are the benefits and the costs.

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.100
I found myself getting a little too comfortable

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.180
with the tools that I grew up with.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:58.140
I think one of the fundamental ways of being as a programmer,

01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.940
as anyone involved with technology,

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.860
based on how quickly it's evolving,

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.660
is to keep learning new tools.

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.940
The way of life should be constantly learning.

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.940
You're not a mathematician or a physicist

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.740
or any of those disciplines that are more stable.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.100
This is like everything is changing.

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.740
Crypto is, like you said, a perfect example of that.

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.460
You have to constantly update your understanding

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:22.540
of digital finance, constantly,

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.900
in order to be able to function,

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.380
in order to be able to criticize it,

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.060
in order to be able to know what to invest in.

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:33.060
So yeah, that was why I tried PyCharm a bunch,

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:36.580
the whole JetBrains infrastructure,

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.580
and then also VS Code, because that's really popular,

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:43.700
and you know, Atom and Sublime, all of those.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:46.060
I've been exploring, I've been exploring.

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:46.900
But VS Code is amazing.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.260
You should check out Space Max.

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:49.780
I'm just gonna give one more pitch for it.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:53.820
It's just basically like a customizable configuration.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.140
Well, Emacs is already customizable,

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.260
but it's pretty useful.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.980
I'm not even much of a coder,

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:03.660
but for like certain journaling applications

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.460
or like time management, like I find it really useful, so.

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.260
Anyway, we're so like, I feel like half this podcast

01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:11.100
is what it should have been,

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.740
and then half of it's just us nerding out

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.900
about our own engineering, like idiosyncrasies.

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.740
Sorry, sorry guys.

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.300
All right, so what were we talking about?

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:24.260
SafeMoon and Bitcoin, Bitcoin, what do you think?

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:29.260
Is there, have you made enemies in certain communities?

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.660
What do you think about Bitcoin?

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.420
So I've made certain enemies

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.220
in the sort of crypto skeptics space,

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.260
because there's sort of this range of skepticism

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.300
you can have about cryptocurrency.

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.700
I'm obviously a skeptic of a lot of it,

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.860
but there are certain aspects of crypto

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.620
that I think are inevitable,

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.500
and I'm gonna do my best to kind of describe those here,

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.620
but I'm not committed to any crypto specifically,

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.940
but there are some, I've taken a lot of heat,

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.860
ironically, for not being skeptical enough.

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.060
There's some people who believe that like the entire thing

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.820
is a complete waste of time.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:04.740
There are rslashbutcoin on Reddit.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.220
It's an amazing community, actually.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.260
It's very funny.

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.100
They have-

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:08.940
What's a butcoin?

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.540
It's like a play on Bitcoin.

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.620
They're like, they're just like,

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.180
at least we admit it's a scam.

01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:17.220
Very funny guys, very funny people there.

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.460
So, but they'll be like, coffee's delicious,

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.500
just admit that all of it's a giant Ponzi scheme.

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.020
All of it's basically like not real.

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:27.020
So everything including Bitcoin?

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.820
Yeah, it's all basically all the Ponzi-nomics.

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.180
It's all, it's Ponzi-nomics all the way down.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:34.620
It's like, there is no fundamental use case

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:36.460
that is that useful.

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.500
I don't know if,

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.580
I guess I don't wanna straw man them here.

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.820
I don't wanna say that,

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.300
I don't know if they're saying that it's all useless.

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:47.420
At minimum, they're saying the level of interest

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.740
in cryptocurrencies is far,

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.460
the actual usefulness of it is far less

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:56.260
than the amount of attention and time and money

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.100
that's being poured into it.

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.620
So like the revolutionariness of this technology

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.460
is not at all revolutionary.

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.540
Let me kind of steel man

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.100
what I think the pro crypto take is.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:12.020
I think that technologies are sort of this inert thing

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.860
and the success of them, in my opinion,

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.300
is not based on PR, it's not based on marketing,

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.660
it's based on cheaper, faster, better, fundamentally.

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:24.460
The success of any technology relies on those three things

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.260
and longevity of it.

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.700
So I have two employees

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.820
and both of them are out of the country.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.180
So I have to frequently make

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.260
international wire payments to them.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.220
Is one of them SPF just,

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:39.420
as a reporter I have to ask.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.260
No.

01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.540
Okay, all right, he's not on the payroll.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.140
Yeah, I think he'd have to pay me.

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.140
I'm trying to do my best Coffeezilla words,

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.620
I get hard hitting investigative questions.

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:49.460
It's good, it's good.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.580
So with these international payments,

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:55.940
you face all sorts of slow fees

01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:59.220
and you face like kind of like this time thing

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.180
and it's this painful process.

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:06.420
So if I use different cryptocurrencies,

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:07.900
some of them are like really fast,

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.780
some of them have really low fees,

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:14.220
I just believe in a world where digital currencies

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:16.660
with fast payments, with cheap payments,

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:21.300
revolutionize the global exchange of currency

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:25.580
and I don't know if this is going to include the blockchain,

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.660
it's just that the blockchain is the first thing

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.500
that's really embraced truly digital currency,

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.100
which doesn't need to go through

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:36.380
this complicated system of wire transfers and just happens.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.660
So I can send you,

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.340
let's say I wanna send you Ethereum or Bitcoin,

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:42.460
I can send it to you just as fast,

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.900
if I send you a dollar or a billion dollars

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.820
and I can send it to you just as fast

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.300
if you're across from me

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.380
or if you're across the world from me.

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:57.380
That I think is a step change in easier, faster, better

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.580
in terms of like just this really basic

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:03.140
international payments kind of idea.

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.700
So I think at like its core,

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.420
if the lowest form use case of cryptocurrencies is that,

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.420
I think it will change the world in some variety.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.100
It's just kind of the larger question is,

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.260
is that technology going to include

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:19.540
the blockchain specifically or not?

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.660
The other benefit is transparency,

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.980
which I personally like as an investigator.

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.100
It's just that previously,

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:30.620
it's like hard to describe how opaque

01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.540
our financial system is

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.380
until you've tried to investigate someone or something.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:38.780
Understanding finances, unless you have a subpoena,

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:41.660
unless you're like the FBI or like the SEC

01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.740
and you can get a subpoena for someone's finances

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.300
or you're going through discovery,

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.700
you don't know what someone has.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.340
You're basically playing poker with everyone

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.420
and the cards are face down.

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.540
For the first time, the blockchain to some extent,

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.500
because there are ways to obfuscate it.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.260
And in some ways, cryptocurrency has enabled more fraud,

01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.740
which is kind of this irony,

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:01.260
but in some ways it's enabled people

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:04.460
to also audit a lot better and in real time.

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.580
And I think that is a structural change

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:10.420
that is fundamentally for the better.

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.980
The question of all this is,

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.980
do those betters outweigh the cons that this introduces?

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:22.220
And how much can regulation mitigate those cons?

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.140
Some of those cons being like fraud, money laundering,

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:27.340
all these negative externalities

01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.860
that are easier with cryptocurrency.

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.500
Why do you think cryptocurrency in particular

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:34.220
seems to attract fraudulent people,

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:37.340
like scammers and fraudsters?

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.100
Because it's unregulated, it's the Wild West,

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.820
and you can transmit large amounts of money

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:42.460
very quickly across the world.

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:47.460
What about creating new crypto projects, like new coins?

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:50.740
Because you have to show very little actual use case,

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.820
you can just promise.

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:54.020
So it's like true of any emerging technology,

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.260
so much vaporware happens at the beginning

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.620
when it's all promise.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.900
Because fundamentally, let's say you're legitimate,

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.180
I'm illegitimate, we look the same

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:04.380
at the start of a technology,

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.140
because both of us are promising what this can do.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.740
And in fact, the less scruples and morals I have,

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.060
in some ways I can outcompete you.

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:12.300
Because I can say mine does what Lexis does,

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.700
but like way better and way faster,

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.780
and it's gonna happen in a year rather than 10 years.

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.260
You're being honest, I'm playing a dishonest game,

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:19.540
I look better.

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.300
Once this space matures,

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.780
and you actually have some people actually doing the things

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.620
that they say they're going to do,

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.100
suddenly this equation changes.

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.420
Now you're Amazon, you're delivering in two days,

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.500
I can say whatever I want.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.060
You do the thing you do, and I have no credibility.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:38.700
So I think that like part of the fraud is,

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.900
just the ability to transmit so much money so quickly

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.260
with such little oversight.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.300
Part of it is like,

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.820
this just happens with any emerging technology,

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.260
vaporware is a real thing.

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:50.060
And hopefully, as this space matures,

01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:53.540
as regulation comes in, things will improve.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.060
Well, let me ask you your own psychology.

01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:57.980
Sure.

01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.060
You're going after some of the richest,

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.940
some of the most powerful people in the world.

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.620
Do you worry about your own financial,

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:07.420
legal and psychological well-being?

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.220
Yes.

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.060
Yeah, I do.

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:14.020
I mean, I'm not totally oblivious to the precariousness

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:19.220
of like any kind of journalism like this.

01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.620
Obviously there's risks.

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:23.140
I've always believed there's a quote,

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.420
and I'm going to butcher it,

01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:26.700
but I hope you guys understand the spirit of it.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.500
News is when you print something,

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.180
someone else doesn't want you to print everything else

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.780
as public relations.

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.300
I really believe to do meaningful journalism,

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.060
you have to go after people.

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:40.780
Like it's not inherently a safe profession.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:42.500
I mean, if you're going to do important work,

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.780
you have to have risk tolerances.

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:46.740
And I think everyone has a line

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.340
of what that risk tolerance is,

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.940
and it's different for everyone.

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.580
I don't think I could do what Edward Snowden did.

01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.140
I think that would be my bright red line,

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:57.260
is going against my own government.

01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:01.300
It's such a, in my opinion, I really see him as a hero.

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.340
Like it's such a selfless act of self-destruction.

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.300
You know that the party you're going after

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.820
has all the power and will crush you.

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:14.180
And you do it anyway out of the like the true,

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.900
I don't know, platonic ideal of journalism.

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:16.940
I think that's beautiful.

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.980
I don't think I could do that.

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.580
I think I need some ability to live and subsist

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:24.260
in the society that I am in.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
And I think my bright red line would be like,

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.700
if I'm forced to flee the country for my work,

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.260
I think I'd finally have to say no.

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:36.020
But for, as journalists go, I'm pretty risk,

01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.740
I take risk pretty well.

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.620
I especially like think risk is important to take

01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:44.020
when you're young and when you can do that.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.140
I think when I have, I mean, I'm married.

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.460
So when I have a family,

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.020
I think I will probably dial this risk thing down.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.580
Just being honest.

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.380
I mean, I think you kind of have to.

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.060
But right now, I mean,

01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.420
I'm kind of like running on all cylinders.

01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:02.100
I'm willing to take on quite a, quite a range of people,

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.580
but I think a lot about it.

01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:08.420
Wolf pack of one or small wolf pack,

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:10.700
as opposed to having like a New York Times behind you

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.900
or a huge organizations with lawyers,

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.740
with a team, with a history with.

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.740
These people are less courageous.

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.060
This is the dirty truth.

01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.540
The bigger the organization,

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.540
the more conservative a lot of them are.

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:26.100
It's true that sometimes they like,

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.140
and this is not to bash big organizations.

01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.100
I'm just saying this as an observation

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:32.700
of someone who's talked to a lot of people.

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.260
And especially in the world of fraud,

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.180
a lot of them are scared to engage in fraud

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.740
that is obvious, but hasn't been litigated yet.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:45.060
This is why you'll never see documentaries

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.780
about ongoing fraud on Netflix.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.260
It's too much of a liability.

01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.700
They'll sue Netflix to hell.

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.180
And they know that if they win,

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.020
Netflix has the money to pay it.

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.980
So corporations like the New York Times,

01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:58.340
a lot of these, some of them are very,

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:00.420
like they're as courageous as they can be.

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.580
But at the bottom line,

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.660
if someone sues you to hell and back

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.140
and you have to pay up, you will disappear.

01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.660
And you're relying on liability insurance,

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.700
which you're already paying out the ass for,

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.740
to try to cover you if you get sued.

01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:14.660
But if you get sued, even if you win,

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:16.780
that liability insurance now goes up in price

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.740
the next year.

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.740
And if you're the New York Times, it goes up by a lot.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.700
So, I mean, I think there's work

01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:26.860
that independent journalists can do uniquely

01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:29.980
that they can actually take, like in some ways,

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.260
more risk than a giant institution,

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:34.500
which has a lot more in my sense to lose,

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.420
even though it would appear like they have more

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.700
in terms of defense too.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:41.020
But you get, you can be bullied legally.

01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:41.860
Yeah.

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:44.020
Do you get afraid of that?

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:46.260
Sure, I mean, I just,

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.820
all these things are things you have to be aware of

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.460
and then forget to do your job.

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.500
Like you have to be, it's like being like a snowboarder

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.660
and it's like, do you realize you could hit your head?

01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:57.740
And it's like, yeah, of course.

01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:00.100
But in order to go do the flip or whatever,

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.660
you have to just accept the risk,

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.740
mitigate the risk as much as possible and move on.

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:08.420
So we have like insurance,

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:12.020
we keep like a pool of funds for that kind of thing.

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:15.100
Like I'm very conservative with how I spend my money

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.540
basically all on production

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:21.580
and like trying to make my life as secure as I can.

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.660
And then I just do the work that I want to do because.

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:30.980
So 99% of your fund goes into the studio

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:35.300
and then into that elaborate space of yours.

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.140
Yeah, of course.

01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.380
How many kittens had to die to manufacture that studio?

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:44.140
But anyway, that's my investigation for later.

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.980
What keeps you mentally strong through all of this?

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.540
What's your source of mental like strength

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.900
or your psychological strength through this?

01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.460
I think there was a time

01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:00.500
when I was getting a lot of cease and desists.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.060
Some people were like actually like saying

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:04.220
like they're gonna show up to my house,

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.140
all that kind of stuff.

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.860
I don't think I was that.

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:08.620
I think I was pretty worried about that for a while.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:12.220
My wife was huge source of strength here

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.780
where she was like, hey, if you're not comfortable with it,

01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:17.180
you need to get out of the game

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:19.460
or you need to basically like suck it up

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:21.300
and like this is what it is.

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.020
If you're gonna go after these people,

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:28.020
you have to basically be mentally strong around this

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:31.060
and seeing her have that realization

01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.660
helped me have the same realization

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:37.620
and I really deeply admire and respect that about her

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:41.380
and it solved a lot of my concerns around that.

01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:45.540
It just made me realize every profession has risks.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.380
It is what it is.

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.540
You mitigate and then you move on.

01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:51.620
Why do you think there's so few journalists like you?

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.580
You're basically the embodiment,

01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.020
at least in the space you operate

01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.940
of what great journalism should be.

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.380
Why do you think there's very few like you?

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.020
That's such an enormous compliment

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.940
and probably overstatement,

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:11.940
but I first want to pay respect.

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.180
There are a lot of great journalists

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:17.900
and a lot of them are like,

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.020
I don't wanna just kind of take it and go,

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.620
yeah, it's just me.

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:23.340
There's so many great journalists.

01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:27.460
Matt Levine, Kelsey Piper,

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.940
you've got anonymous journalists like Dirty Bubble,

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.780
you've got citizen journalists like Tiffany Fong,

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:38.780
but I think if you're gonna be in the space

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:43.660
in the longterm, you do need to accept certain risks

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.620
and I think in the longterm,

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:49.060
it's like, I don't know how easy it is to play that game

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:52.500
for a long period of time because you make,

01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.500
to do great journalism, you don't get paid a lot

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.700
compared to what you could get paid

01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.660
if you did press pieces or anything like that.

01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:02.340
You take a lot of risks legally,

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:04.940
you take physical risks, you take,

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:08.580
it's just like, if you care about money,

01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:10.660
it's not the profession.

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:14.700
And I feel like a lot of people, when they get notoriety,

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:17.500
they move to like, well, I can just maximize

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.460
the money security side of things

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.580
and I think it takes out a lot of

01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.700
would-be great journalists.

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:25.380
And also, so first of all,

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:29.180
comfort of a physical and mental wellbeing

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.100
and also being invited to parties with powerful people.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:38.860
You make enemies, rich and powerful enemies doing this,

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.060
but that's why it makes it,

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.860
that's why it's admirable.

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.740
It's an interesting case study

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.340
that you've been doing it as long as you have

01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.580
and I hope you keep doing it,

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.820
but it's just interesting that it's rare.

01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:00.820
I'll say, I wanna make a call,

01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:05.820
I think societies can create better journalists

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:10.260
and worse journalists insofar as they support

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:12.060
the journalists who are doing great work

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:15.540
and I wanna call out Edward Snowden specifically

01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:18.620
because what we have done to him is such a travesty

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.340
and the only lesson you can learn

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.980
if you're a logical human being

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.620
is that you should never whistle blow

01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:24.740
on the United States government

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.900
after looking at what they did to Snowden.

01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:30.340
So as a society,

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.980
we can put pressure on lawmakers

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:35.500
to make it easier for people to do the great work

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.380
by not punishing the people who do great work,

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:40.740
if that makes sense, and de-risking it for them

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:42.420
because we shouldn't expect journalists

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.140
to be martyrs to do great work, right?

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:46.380
To do important work.

01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:49.660
And part of that comes from protecting whistleblowers.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:51.940
There's like very common sense things.

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:55.860
I love like, it's great to heroize,

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.540
people like Edward Snowden and stuff like that,

01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.220
but we shouldn't expect them to be heroes to do that work.

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.300
Do you ever think about going,

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.860
you've been focused on financial fraud.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.540
Do you ever think about going

01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.420
after other centers of power?

01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:15.140
Like government, politics?

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:18.740
Politics, it seems to me, you can't do good work.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.100
Like everybody doing good work in politics

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.100
is to some extent, from my limited perspective,

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.180
as I said, I'm not that into it,

01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.300
it seems like everyone has to take a side

01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.260
because even if you do great work,

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:35.740
whoever you're exposing, half the other people,

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.980
no matter how good your work is,

01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:39.940
are going to claim it's just for partisan hackery

01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.620
and they're going to malign you.

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:46.620
So it seems like a lot of journalists have to take a slant,

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.700
even if it's not explicit like bias,

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.700
they have to take a slant on who they expose.

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:52.780
I hate that, I would really like a world

01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:56.660
where you could freely expose both sides

01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.220
without having a constant malignment of like,

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.580
who are you working for or you did this for XYZ

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.660
I really find that deeply problematic

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.620
about our current journalism in the political sphere.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.660
As far as government stuff, I think it's easy to do,

01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:21.380
not easy, but it's much more enticing

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:25.340
to do foreign journalism than to do local journalism

01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:26.740
on positions of power.

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:30.700
Because if you question, it's so easy to just get,

01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:34.060
the bigger cases you expose locally,

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.420
you get in danger, like it's just like very clear cut.

01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.580
The bigger the case, the more your financial wellbeing,

01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:45.780
your access, your entire life is like sort of in jeopardy.

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.180
Whereas if you do foreign journalism, you can do great work

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.300
and largely you're protected by your own government.

01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.260
So it's kind of this weird thing

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.500
where if you want great journalism on America,

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:58.060
sometimes going abroad might be the way to go.

01:48:58.060 --> 01:48:59.460
But the politician thing,

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.860
this interesting you mentioned that and going abroad,

01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.780
I think the way you think about your current work,

01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:09.460
I think applies in great journalism in politics as well.

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.140
So what happens, I have that sense,

01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.700
because I aspire to be like you

01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.900
in the conversation space with politicians.

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.580
I try to talk to people on the left and the right

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:23.820
and do so in nonpartisan way and criticize,

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.580
but also steel man their cases.

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.620
What happens, I've learned,

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.140
is when you talk to somebody on the right,

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.820
the right kind of brings you in,

01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:34.020
it's like, yes, we'll keep you comfortable,

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.740
come with us, and then the left attacks you.

01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:40.060
And the same happens on the left.

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.900
You talk on the left, the right attacks you,

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.700
and the left is like, come with us.

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:47.740
So there's a temptation, a momentum

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:51.300
to staying to that one side, whatever that side is.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.660
The same with foreign journalism.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.260
You can cover Putin critically.

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:58.900
There's a strong pull to being pro-Ukraine,

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:02.220
pro-Zelensky, pro, basically,

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.660
really covering in a favorable way

01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.300
to the point of propaganda, to the point of PR,

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.940
the Zelensky regime.

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.500
If you criticize the Zelensky regime,

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.380
there's a strong pull towards then being supportive of,

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.700
not necessarily the Putin regime,

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.900
but a very different perspective on it,

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.180
which is like NATO is the one that created that war.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.740
There's narratives that pull you,

01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.340
and what I think a great journalist does

01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.180
is make enemies on both sides.

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.900
And walk through that fire,

01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:35.260
and not get pulled in to the protection of any one side

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.420
because they get so harshly attacked

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.100
any time they deviate from the center.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:42.740
Well, and I think also there's a criticism

01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:45.700
of all centrists, which I think in some way is fair.

01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:48.260
And I say that to someone largely who's a centrist,

01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.740
which is that this what about is,

01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:52.900
or this what about the left or what about the right

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.820
can skew when it's not a both sides issue.

01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:01.340
So in the case of like Russia, Ukraine,

01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:04.420
I think like I'm strongly in favor of Ukraine,

01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.980
even though I tend to go like on both sides.

01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.300
And that might be partly because

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:09.180
one of my employees is Ukrainian.

01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:13.460
And I think what a great journalist does,

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.380
especially like in politics,

01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:20.260
is I think they criticize the regime that's most in power,

01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.940
most who controls the keys,

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.620
and is the most corrupt at that time.

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:27.180
And they might appear to be like,

01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.740
let's say during the realm of Trump,

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.860
a great journalist would criticize Trump,

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:34.940
but that same journalist who held Trump's feet to the fire

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:37.700
should be capable of holding Biden's feet to the fire

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.860
four years later, if that kind of makes sense.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.420
That's exactly right, yeah.

01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:46.220
So any revealing any, so attacking any power center

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.980
for the corruption, for the flaws they have.

01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:51.620
Irrespective of like your political agenda

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:53.020
or your political ideas.

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.260
And that's what I mean about sort of the war in Ukraine.

01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.660
There's several key players.

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:03.660
NATO, Russia, Ukraine, China, India.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:10.420
I mean, there's several less important players,

01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:13.740
maybe some of the like Iran and like Israel

01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:15.900
and maybe Africa.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.420
And what great journalism requires

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.660
is basically revealing the flaws

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.540
of each one of those players,

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:25.100
irrespective of the attacks you get.

01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:29.100
You're right, that throughout any particular situation,

01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.140
there is some parties that are worse than others

01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:36.140
and you have to weigh your perspective accordingly.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.860
But also it requires you to be fearless in certain things.

01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:41.620
Like for example, I don't even know

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:44.980
what it's like to be a journalist covering China now.

01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.940
Oh, that's an exact case of like,

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:51.460
China has made it so difficult to be a good journalist

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:53.740
that they've effectively squashed criticism

01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:56.060
because to be a journalist in China

01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:00.620
means constantly risking your life every single day

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.140
to criticize that government.

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:03.820
And so the best journalists

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:06.220
are a lot of times outside the country

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.020
or they have sources inside the country

01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:11.420
who are like, there's like this different,

01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.740
there's layers to the journalism

01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.540
where there's insiders who are leaking information,

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.780
but they themselves cannot publish

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:19.820
because it's like, it's extremely risky.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:23.420
So yeah, I think as a society,

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:28.420
one measure of how healthy the political structure is

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:31.580
is how well you can criticize it

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.300
without fearing for your safety.

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.260
In that sense, the chaos and the bickering

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.540
going on in the United States politics is a good thing

01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:43.700
that people can criticize very harshly.

01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:44.540
Very harsh.

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.900
And be, in terms of safety, are pretty safe.

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:48.300
Yes, absolutely.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.860
I think our only challenge is like where it gets dangerous

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.740
is around like top secret information.

01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.180
The government comes down so hard

01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:01.380
that the danger in covering politics here

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.700
is you can expose something that's top secret

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:07.060
that should be exposed and they'll ruin you.

01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:10.500
So that's where you again give props to Snowden

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.340
for stepping up.

01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.540
100%, 100%.

01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:18.540
What's the origin of the suspender wearing Batman?

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.980
How did you come to do what you do?

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.260
We talked about where you are and how your mind works,

01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.100
but how did it start?

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.020
I've kind of always been interested in fraud

01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:30.540
or at least I saw fraud early on

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.380
and I was just like curious about what is this?

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.980
I didn't know what I was really looking at.

01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:38.220
So basically my mom got cancer when I was in high school

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.140
and it was pretty traumatic.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:40.980
I mean, she's fine.

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.260
She had thyroid cancer, which is,

01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.100
we didn't know it at the time.

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.340
It's like cancer's cancer,

01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:47.140
but it's fairly easily treatable with surgery.

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:50.380
It's one of the better survivable ones.

01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.620
And I just watched her get like bombarded

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:54.420
with all these like phony health scams

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.660
of just like colloidal silver,

01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.460
all these different like remedies.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:03.260
And she was very into all the different ways

01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.980
that she might treat her cancer.

01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:07.420
And obviously surgery is very daunting.

01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.420
And I was just confused.

01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.380
I was like, why are we doing so many different remedies

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.660
that all seem a very dubious health value?

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.740
Later I'd find out that these are like all grifters.

01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:21.100
I mean, they take advantage of free speech in America

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.780
to like advertise their products as life-saving miracles,

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:27.260
whatever, when they're, of course not.

01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:28.780
Eventually she got the surgery, thank God.

01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.140
But I know people in my life who,

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.260
their parents passed away

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.700
because they didn't have the surgery.

01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:40.380
They instead took the alternative option.

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.620
I know like, I don't wanna go into specifics

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.740
because I don't wanna mention their specific like case,

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.980
but their family member went to Mexico

01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:49.980
for some alternate treatment, health treatment,

01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:52.620
instead of getting an easy surgery and they died.

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.460
And so it's like, I realized,

01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:56.660
where is the outrage about this?

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.940
Where's the, who covers this stuff?

01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.540
And I realized, well, not many people do.

01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:01.660
Then I went to college,

01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.460
I was getting a chemical engineering degree

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.300
and all my friends were like telling me,

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:06.980
hey, you should come to this meeting.

01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.180
We don't need this.

01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:09.900
You're doing this engineering stuff, that's great.

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.940
You're gonna make like 70K a year,

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:13.220
but don't you wanna get like rich now?

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.460
Like, why wait till you're 60 years old to retire?

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:17.100
Like, you can be rich now, Lex.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.180
So I'd go show up to a hotel

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:23.340
and there'd be an MLM like multi-level marketing,

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:27.620
pitch for Amway or whatever it was that day.

01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:30.700
And I was once again fascinated.

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.500
I didn't know what I was looking at, but I was like,

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.420
what is this weird game we're all playing

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:35.900
where we sit in this room,

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:36.980
we're looking at the speaker

01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:39.060
who says he's so successful, right?

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.780
But why is he taking a Friday or a Saturday

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.620
to do this, you know, pitch at night?

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.620
And they're gonna telling me

01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:45.700
I'm gonna be financially free,

01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:47.700
but they're working on their Saturday and Sunday.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.660
And so it's like, how financially free are they?

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:50.620
So I was just like confused.

01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:52.300
I was like, you know, none of my friends were rich.

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:53.460
They all said they were gonna be rich.

01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.140
No one ever seemed to get rich.

01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:58.340
And so I was sort of baffled by what I was looking at.

01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:59.900
Later I graduate.

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:02.260
I had no interest in doing engineering,

01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:03.380
which we can kind of get into,

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:05.180
but I wanna do something in media.

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.340
And I started covering a variety of topics,

01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:11.740
but eventually I sort of revisited this interest

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.020
and fraud and I started talking about these

01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:16.740
kind of get rich quick grifters that were online,

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.980
sort of the Tai Lopez variety, you know,

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.500
67 steps or, you know, whatever,

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.100
like five steps to get rich,

01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:23.380
five coins to five million,

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:25.100
you know, these get rich quick schemes

01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.500
that a lot of people were interested in.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.020
No one seemed to get rich once again,

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:30.900
except for the people at the tippity tippity top

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.940
selling the get rich quick thing.

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.820
And I was like fascinated by the structure of it.

01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.980
And I was like, does nobody see what this is?

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.300
Like, does nobody get it?

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.860
So I started making a series of videos on that

01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.380
and the response was like palpable.

01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.780
I mean, it was like, I've made a lot of stuff before that.

01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:47.140
I had made stuff that got a million views.

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.420
I'd had like some marginal success,

01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:53.220
but the response of like the emails that came in,

01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:55.540
the, I could tell this work,

01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:58.900
even though it had far less views at the time

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:00.980
was having a different level of impact.

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:02.780
And that's what I was really interested in.

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:07.020
One of my problems with engineering was from my standpoint,

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.660
I did chemical engineering at Texas A&M.

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.100
And like, I was like, is my future

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.500
just gonna be in a chemical plant,

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.580
improving some process by 2%?

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.420
And that's like my gift to the world.

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:19.420
Like I just, I didn't see the hard impact

01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:21.500
and that maybe that's a lack of imagination

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.540
cause chemicals matter,

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.580
but I needed, I wanted to see an impact in the world.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:29.260
And so when like, I did started doing this fraud stuff,

01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:30.820
exposing fraud, I like clicked in my brain.

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:34.700
I was like, whoa, this is kind of doing what I want to do.

01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:37.580
And so I started posting videos.

01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.900
At first, it really focused on like get rich,

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.620
quick scheme, grifty advertising,

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:46.020
which I think is super predatory and we can go into why,

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:48.500
but it eventually graduated to crypto

01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.780
and it snowballed, I guess,

01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:53.700
cause now we're talking to Sam Bankman Fried.

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:56.140
Okay, grifty advertising.

01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.740
So actually there's just a step back.

01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:00.180
What is the multi-level marketing scheme?

01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:04.740
Like what, cause I've experienced a similar thing.

01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:08.620
I remember I worked at, I sold women's shoes

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:11.060
at Sears and a bank.

01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:13.420
And I just remember like some kind of,

01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:14.620
I forgot the name of the company,

01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:16.620
but you'd like, you can sell like knives or whatever.

01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.980
Like that's a couple of comments.

01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:21.220
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.060
I'm sure there's a lot of things like this, right?

01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.780
And I remember feeling a similar thing.

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:29.780
Like why, to me, what was fascinating about it is like,

01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:32.540
wow, like human civilization

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:35.060
is a interesting, like a pyramid scheme.

01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:37.700
Like I didn't, maybe didn't know the words for that,

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.780
but it's like, it's cool.

01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.540
Like you can like get in a room

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.020
and you convince each other of ideas

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:45.260
and you have these ambitions, there's a general desire,

01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.780
especially when you're young to like,

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.660
like life sucks right now.

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.660
Nobody respects you.

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:53.100
You have no money and you want to do good

01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.940
and you want to be sold this dream of like,

01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:58.580
if I work hard enough at this weird thing,

01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:01.260
I can shortcut and get to the very top.

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.100
I don't know what that is.

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:05.860
And I also in me felt that like life really sucks

02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.740
and I could do good and I'm lucky.

02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:10.340
I found a way to do good.

02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.460
I'm like, and I don't know, you connect with that somehow.

02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:16.100
I think there's like this weird fire inside people

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:18.580
to like, to make better of themselves, right?

02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.980
I don't know if it's just an American thing or if it,

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.300
but anyway, that was fascinating to me

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.700
from a human nature perspective.

02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.180
Grifters play on this though, right?

02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:30.180
Like this is, so the best salesman play on true narratives

02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:32.380
that you already believe.

02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.980
So the true narrative is, you know, life is unfair.

02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:37.060
It is tough.

02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.140
The American dream as described by go to a job,

02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:45.420
work at the same company for 40 years and then retire

02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.940
to a safety net that you're positive is gonna be there,

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.340
that is largely debt.

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:52.740
And so they like play on those fears and those problems

02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:55.820
to then sell you a pill, a solution, a thing.

02:00:55.820 --> 02:01:00.020
And the problem is that the solution is usually worse

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.900
than even the problem they sketched out.

02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:03.980
Like you will do better most of the time

02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:05.660
by going with the regular company

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:06.500
than you will by going

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.780
with these goofy multi-level marketing.

02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.060
But let me answer your question.

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:10.820
What is a multi-level marketing?

02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:13.980
So there's a criticism, first of all, that,

02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:15.900
well, let me get to what it is in theory.

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.100
Like at its most ideal, multi-level marketing

02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.380
is where you have a product that you're selling.

02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:23.340
And one of the ways you help sell it

02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:25.900
is by rather than going through traditional marketing,

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.980
like where you go and you put out print advertising,

02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.820
it's like sort of a social network of marketing.

02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:34.340
I sell to you and then actually, Lex,

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:35.380
not only can I sell to you,

02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:36.540
you can then go sell this product

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.740
and you'll make money selling it.

02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:38.580
And you know what?

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.420
To incentivize me to get other salesmen,

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:41.420
because when I get another salesman,

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:43.140
I'm actually giving myself competition.

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.340
So that's bad.

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:45.940
So to incentivize me to do that,

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:48.620
they'll pay me part of what you make, right?

02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:50.020
And then you go out and you go,

02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.380
okay, well, I can sell this product.

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.980
I also can get new salesmen to like sell for me

02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:55.740
and I'm gonna make money from you, whatever.

02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:58.740
So it goes down the line of you create multiple levels

02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:01.820
where you can profit from their marketing, right?

02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:03.860
The problem with this system

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:06.660
is that however well-intentioned it is,

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.980
is that usually the emphasis of that selling

02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.020
and making money ends up not being about the product at all

02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:16.780
and ends up entirely being about recruiting new people

02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:18.740
to recruit new people to recruit new people.

02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.180
That's the real way to make money in multi-level marketing.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:23.860
This is where the very true criticism

02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:26.460
of most multi-level marketing, if not all,

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:28.540
are pyramid schemes in structure,

02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:30.140
because what a pyramid scheme is,

02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:33.180
is it's all about I put in $500

02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:34.900
and I recruit two people to put in $500

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:35.980
and that comes up to me

02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:39.020
and they get two people to put in $500 and it goes to them.

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.660
And the reason it's a flawed business model is

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.340
in order for it to work and everyone to make money,

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:45.940
you'd have to assume an infinite human race.

02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:47.660
And so that's not the case.

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.980
Most people end up getting screwed

02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:52.020
in multi-level marketing and in pyramid schemes.

02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.020
That's what that is.

02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:54.140
That's that thing.

02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.500
And the quality of the product,

02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.740
it doesn't necessarily matter where you're selling.

02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.460
It's to people who are financially incentivized

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.420
to buy this thing.

02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:02.260
Yeah.

02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:06.460
And so you're selling the dream of becoming rich

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.100
to the people down in the pyramid.

02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:10.180
That's the real product of multi-level marketing,

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:11.060
unfortunately.

02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:15.100
And so you look at the statistics of these companies

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.540
and although they'll make it seem like it's so easy

02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.420
to be the top 0.1% who's making all this money,

02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:25.100
the statistics are that 97% make less

02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:26.820
than a minimum wage doing this.

02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.500
They spend an enormous amount of time.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.100
And just what's so cruel about it

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:32.500
is that's not advertised upfront.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.220
I mean, it's like, if I go at work at McDonald's,

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.420
I know what I'm getting.

02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:37.940
If I go work at Amway, I have visions of,

02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:40.540
they've sold me visions of beaches and whatever,

02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:42.700
and more than likely I'm losing money.

02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:44.900
So better than 50% of people lose money,

02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:47.060
but 97% of people make less than minimum wage.

02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:50.740
So it's like, it's such a bad business

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:53.220
for the vast majority of people who join it.

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:55.740
And the people at the very top who are lying

02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:57.420
to the people at the bottom saying they all can do it

02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:59.620
when they can't are making all the money.

02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:01.940
So it's, yeah, it's really messed up.

02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:03.900
The interesting thing I've noticed,

02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:05.820
maybe myself too, because I've participated

02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:08.180
in the knife selling for like a short amount of time.

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.700
That's probably the experience that most people have.

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:11.340
Not Cutco, is it?

02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:12.180
I don't know.

02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:13.580
I don't think it was Cutco.

02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:14.540
I know what you're talking about.

02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:15.380
It's killing me.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:17.180
But I think there's several variations of it.

02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:22.180
I think I was part of a less popular one.

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:25.660
It doesn't, I keep wanting to say it was called Vector.

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:30.100
Yes, something with a V was what I was gonna say.

02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:31.660
It might be Vector.

02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:32.700
Yeah, I get what you're saying though.

02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:34.380
It's a multi-level marketing knife selling.

02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:37.160
But the thing is, I just remember

02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.180
my own small experience with it is I was too,

02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:44.500
I was embarrassed at myself for having participated.

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.980
I think there's an embarrassment.

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.540
That's why people down in the pyramid

02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.460
don't speak about it, right?

02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:54.520
That you're part, I'm trying to understand

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.040
the aspects of human nature that facilitates this.

02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.680
Well, this is one of the problems with fraud

02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.920
is there's a tremendous embarrassment to being had.

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:05.560
Also, if you buy, so slightly different human nature

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.320
is that if you buy into a get rich quick scheme

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.840
and then it doesn't deliver,

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.960
you're more likely to blame yourself

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:14.000
than blame the product for not actually working.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.680
You go, well, there must be something flawed with me.

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:16.520
That's true.

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:17.600
And they constantly reinforce this.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.480
They go, well, it's all about your hard work.

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:21.520
The system works, look at me, I did it.

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.600
So if you're failing,

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:25.160
it must be some indictment of your character

02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.280
and you have to always double down.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:30.120
The system can't be flawed, you must be flawed.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.600
And so yeah, it's a really messed up system.

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:35.120
It really preys on people's psychology

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.240
to keep them in this loop.

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.240
And that's why in some ways these things are so viral,

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.840
even though they don't actually get most people

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.280
a significant amount of wealth

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.600
and they cost most people money.

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.240
So it's very unfortunate.

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:49.080
Most people do have the dream of becoming rich.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.640
Most young people.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.000
Right, and the thing is,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.360
is that everyone knows in business, what do you sell?

02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:57.240
You sell solutions to problems.

02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:59.760
So if so many young people wanna get rich,

02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:01.800
the product is that pitch.

02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:04.120
It's you sell them the dream.

02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:08.560
Why this gets so grifty and so cruel and predatory

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:11.120
is because there is no easy solution to this.

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:14.120
There is no solution that people are gonna buy

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.600
because the real solution people want is no work,

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:21.240
no education, no skills required, no money upfront.

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:24.800
And people will pay any price for that magic pill

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.520
and people are happy to sell that magic pill.

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.120
And I think those people are very cruel

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:33.200
and I think deserve to get exposed for it.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:38.200
So somebody that's been criticized for MLM type schemes

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:40.640
is Andrew Tate.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:43.760
Somebody that I'm very likely to talk with.

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:46.800
So for people who have been telling me

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.600
that I'm too afraid to talk to Andrew Tate,

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.480
firstly, let me just say,

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:54.560
I'm not afraid to talk to anyone.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.320
It's just that certain people require preparation

02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:01.840
and you have to allocate your life in such a way

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:04.040
that you wanna prepare properly for them.

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:08.240
And so you have to think who you want to prepare for

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:11.600
because I have other folks that have more power

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:14.320
than this particular figure that I'm preparing for.

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.880
So you have to make sure you allocate your time wisely.

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.480
But I do think he's a very influential person

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:24.080
that raises questions of what it means to be a man

02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.400
in the 21st century.

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.160
And that's a very important and interesting question

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:33.360
because young people look up to philosophers,

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:36.200
to influencers about what it means to be a man.

02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:37.520
They look up to Jordan Peterson,

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:38.640
they look up to Andrew Tate,

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.800
they look up to others, to other figures.

02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:43.880
I think it's important to talk about that,

02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.920
to think what does it mean to be a good man in the society?

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.400
Of course, in the other gender, there's the same question,

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.080
what does it mean to be a good woman?

02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.720
I think obviously the bigger question is,

02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:56.560
what does it mean to be a good person?

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:57.380
But-

02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:58.960
Spring Men podcast.

02:07:58.960 --> 02:07:59.880
I swear to God.

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.720
Did not mean to, okay.

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:10.360
So that said, one aspect of the criticism

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:14.640
that Andrew's received is not just on the misogyny,

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:19.640
is on the MLM aspect of the multi-level marketing schemes.

02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.040
So is there some truth to that?

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:24.160
Is there some fraudulent aspect to that?

02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.280
So yeah, I definitely think so.

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.680
I mean, that's the main reason I criticized him.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:32.640
So let's back up.

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:34.560
There's a few clarifications I need to make.

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.720
What Andrew Tate is selling is not multi-level marketing,

02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:39.160
although he is selling the dream.

02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:40.840
He's selling an affiliate marketing thing,

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.520
which is slightly different.

02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:45.720
So in multi-level marketing, if I sell to you

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.200
and then you go sell to two other people,

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.280
I make money from those two other people down the chain,

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:50.400
multi-level.

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:52.280
Affiliate marketing is sort of like one level.

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.040
I only make money.

02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.000
So Andrew Tate had this affiliate program

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.200
where if you sold Hustler's University to somebody else,

02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.480
which sounds like something people would,

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.600
boomers would put on Facebook in like 2010,

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.360
like I went to Hustler's University, school of hard-

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.800
By the way, you were a member of Hustler's University.

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:10.640
Yeah, I joined.

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:11.560
I joined, I became a hustler.

02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:14.840
That's in large part due to why I'm so successful

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.360
is because of my Hustler University membership.

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:18.560
I'm just kidding.

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:20.600
But so it's an affiliate program.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:24.080
So you'd sell, like I sell to you this $50 course

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.400
and I make like $5 and Andrew Tate in perpetuity

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.160
makes $50 a month off of you.

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.320
Okay.

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.440
What does this course actually sell, right?

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.440
Cause ultimately he's selling the dream.

02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:37.320
He's selling, hey, the matrix has enslaved you.

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.600
He's really gone down this like Neo rabbit hole.

02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.280
So the matrix has enslaved you.

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.880
Your life is controlled by these people

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.960
who want to keep you like kind of weak, you know, lazy,

02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.320
whatever you need to break out and you need to achieve

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.280
the new dream, which is sort of like

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.640
hustling your way to the top.

02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.520
You don't need the antiquated systems of school.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:58.960
You can just pay me $50 a month

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.000
and I will teach you everything.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:00.840
Okay.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:01.760
So what do you actually get?

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.120
Well, and why is it a scam?

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.480
So you actually, I think it's just a scam in terms

02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:07.800
of like value and like you're selling based

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:09.280
on these completely unrealistic things.

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.480
He's like, let's get rich.

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.440
Okay.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.680
You get a series of discord rooms.

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.920
So you, do you know what discord?

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:16.000
Most people know what discord is.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.640
It's like a bunch of, you know, chat rooms basically, right?

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.200
So it's like AOL or is it like-

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.800
Well, I'm talking to the guy who quit Emacs.

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:24.920
So I don't know.

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.000
There's discord servers and in these, like, there's like,

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.800
there's like seven different rooms you can go in

02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:31.640
or there's several rooms

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.320
and each one is like a different field of making money.

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.160
Yes.

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:39.280
E-commerce, trading, cryptocurrency,

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.920
I think fulfillment by Amazon, like copywriting.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:48.320
Okay.

02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:50.000
So I went to all of these, I checked them out.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.160
I checked all their money making tools.

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.760
The first funny thing is that Andrew Tate

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:54.600
is nowhere to be found.

02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.880
The supposed successful guy that you like bought into

02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:57.880
is nowhere to be found.

02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:01.240
It's these professors that you have now,

02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.400
he is hired and said, these guys are super qualified.

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.240
So like looked up some of what

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.880
some of these guys have done

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.920
and some of them have launched like scammy crypto coins.

02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:14.680
The cryptocurrency professor was like shilling

02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.880
a bunch of coins that did bad

02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:17.120
and then like deleted the tweets.

02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.720
I mean, just completely exactly what you'd expect.

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:23.480
Behind the paywall, it's nothing of substance.

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:26.520
You're not gonna learn to get rich by escaping the matrix

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:28.000
and going to work for Jeff Bezos.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.200
Fulfillment by Amazon is not escaping the matrix, right?

02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.240
Like that's not the way to hustle to the top.

02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:35.640
It's literally a field of making money

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.600
that everyone in the world has access to.

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.600
If you wanna differentiate yourself and make money,

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.240
the first thing you realize is going into skillsets

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:45.680
that literally anyone with an internet account can do

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:47.200
is a bad way to do that

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:49.800
because you have to have some differentiating factor

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.000
to add value.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
So it's just such a obvious and complete scam

02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.840
because there is no value to this like so-called education.

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:03.280
The professors are crap.

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.880
The advice, they're like hiding

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.080
some of the bad things they've done

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.360
and Andrew Tate's nowhere to be found.

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.280
Ultimately, that's why everyone joins.

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.120
What he's done is very interesting because,

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.040
and I'll give him credit in his marketing,

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:17.680
he's been very savvy to like make the reasons you admire him

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.120
not the thing he's sort of selling, which is weird.

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.600
Like he's selling get rich quick,

02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.240
which seems like it relates to his persona,

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.440
but is actually very orthogonal to it.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.520
His persona is like the tell it how it is,

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:36.120
like tall buff rich guy.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:39.400
It's like actually his persona that you're buying into

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.720
and then he's selling you this thing to the side,

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:42.880
which when people get in there

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.360
and they're not delivered on the product,

02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.680
he still is those things that you first thought he was.

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:48.440
So it's like, I think it's to some extent,

02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:51.600
he's made a lot of money

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:53.760
by making the thing that he makes money on,

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.920
not the thing he gets so much pushback online for

02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.400
and what he's also loved for.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.360
So people will push back for his misogyny,

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.640
but the real way he's making money

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.640
is just like basic get rich quick schemes

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.560
that are super obvious to spot,

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.320
but everyone's distracted by like,

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:09.400
oh, he said some crazy stuff about women

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:13.000
or all these various other scandals he's gotten himself in.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.880
To get more and more and more attention.

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:17.000
So with the persona,

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.400
is the Hustler University still operating?

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:21.560
I think they've rebranded it.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.400
I'm part of their pitch now.

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.080
I'm like, they put me on as like,

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:28.320
I mean, as like the matrix is trying to take us out Lex

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.040
and then it's me saying like,

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.040
they put me in like saying,

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:32.200
I'm part of the matrix.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.800
They put me in saying,

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.480
oh, this guy sucks, I joined, it sucks.

02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.720
And so they'll play that and they do like a bass drop

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.120
and it's like, don't listen to people like this,

02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:42.960
da, da, da, da.

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.560
I mean, it's, I'm basically like an individual

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.400
promotional. Oh, so you've been co-opted

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.000
by the matrix to attack.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.840
Yes.

02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.840
You're an insider threat that infiltrated

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.680
and now is being used by the matrix to attack him.

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.520
Well, to-

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.280
Everyone who criticizes him as part of the matrix,

02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.840
he won't say who the matrix is.

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:02.280
It's just the shadowy cabal of rich, powerful people.

02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.080
It's just like the easy narrative for people

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.160
who are disaffected and who feel cheated by the system.

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.440
You just collectivize that system and you make it the bad guy

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.000
and you go, look, look, those guys,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.720
those guys who have been cheating you,

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:14.720
they're the bad guys.

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.080
They want me shut up.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.280
And then now the person that the people who harmed you,

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:22.120
they want this guy shut up,

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:22.960
you're gonna listen to him.

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:25.600
So that's like, it's like the most basic

02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:28.040
psychological manipulation that everyone seems

02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.160
to constantly fall for.

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.880
It's really a trivial and stupid, but-

02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:37.320
Can you still man the case for Hustlers University

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:42.320
where it's actually giving young people confidence,

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:46.120
teaching invaluable lessons about like actually

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.600
incentivizing them to do something like fulfillment

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:52.600
by Amazon, the basic thing to try it, to learn about it,

02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:55.080
to fail or maybe see like, to try,

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.080
to give a catalyst and incentive to try these things.

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.240
As much as it pains me, I will try to give a succinct,

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:07.480
maybe steel man of it as best as I can,

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:09.120
thinking that it's such a grift.

02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:14.120
But I think what you would say is that some people

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:17.680
in order to make a change in their life

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.680
need someone who they can look up to.

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.500
And men don't have a lot of like strong role models,

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:29.560
like big male presences in their life

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.040
who can serve as a proper example.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.880
So the most charitable interpretation would be

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.880
Andrew Tate would encourage you to go reach

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.800
for the stars, I guess.

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:43.680
My problem is I have a deep like,

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:48.200
I have a deep issue with the like lust and greed

02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.240
that centers all these things.

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.240
It's like this glorification of wealth equals status,

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.440
wealth equals good person,

02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:02.280
wealth and Bugatti equals you are meaningful, you matter.

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:05.640
And like the dark underlying thing

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.640
is that none of that matters.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:12.260
Like it matters that you make a decent living,

02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:16.280
but past just like that, I think the like lust

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:19.540
for more stuff and the idolization of these people

02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:23.140
that is just like opulence is a net bad.

02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:25.220
So that's like, my steel man has to stop there

02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:27.640
because I really disagree with like the values

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:30.820
that are pushed by people like that.

02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.940
Yeah, no, I agree.

02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:33.300
That's the thing that should be criticized.

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:35.180
I shouldn't say it doesn't matter.

02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:37.740
I think it's just like an amazing meal

02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:40.060
at a great restaurant that matters.

02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:45.060
It's money and Bugattis for many people make life beautiful.

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:47.140
Like those are all components,

02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.540
but I think money isn't the,

02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:52.740
you can also enjoy a beautiful life on a hike in nature.

02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:55.980
You can, there's a lot of ways to enjoy life.

02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.660
And one of the deepest has been tested through time

02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:00.880
is the intimacy, close connection, friendship

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.300
with other people or with a loved one.

02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:05.980
They don't talk about like love.

02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:08.180
Like what it means to be deeply connected

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:12.020
with another person is just like get women, get money,

02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:13.340
all those kinds of things.

02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:16.020
But that, I think I don't wanna dismiss that

02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:17.180
because there's like value in that.

02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:18.500
There's fun in that.

02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:20.720
I think the positive,

02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:23.580
I haven't investigated Huston University,

02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:27.020
but the positive I see in general

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:32.020
is young people don't get much respect from society.

02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:34.100
I know it's easy to call it the matrix and so on,

02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:39.100
but there's a kind of dismissal of them as human beings,

02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:44.020
as capable of contributing, of doing anything special.

02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:45.940
And then here's, you have young people

02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:50.140
who are sitting there broke with big dreams.

02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:51.260
They need the mentors.

02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:52.500
They need somebody to inspire them.

02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:55.460
And so like I would criticize

02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:57.900
the flawed nature of the message,

02:17:57.900 --> 02:17:59.660
but also it's just like you have to realize

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:03.900
like there needs to be institutions or people

02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:07.340
or influencers that help like inspire, right?

02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:08.640
The problem is though,

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.580
is the people who are pitching unrealistic versions of that

02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.660
are getting a lot of attention.

02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:18.460
Whereas like there's so many great free courses

02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:20.500
where you can learn everything and more

02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:25.500
about fulfillment by Amazon or about copywriting

02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:27.620
or all these different things

02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.700
that I think like so often the air is just,

02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:31.540
the oxygen is sucked up

02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:33.220
by all the grifters who promise everything.

02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:35.220
It's back to what we said about vaporware.

02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:40.220
This is one of the reasons that like educational products

02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:43.260
can so often be co-opted by grifters

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.300
is vaporware is very hard to distinguish

02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:51.300
because like the feedback loop on education is not clear.

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:53.900
It's not obvious immediately.

02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:56.100
So I can sell you a book and I can say,

02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.660
this is gonna change your life if you apply it.

02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.500
If you don't, if your life doesn't change,

02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:01.860
I just say, well, you didn't apply it, right?

02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:03.480
Like it's, there's this weird relationship.

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.320
It's not clear the value.

02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.940
It's not so easy to like quantify education.

02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:12.220
So that gets co-opted by people who make all the promises.

02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.340
They get a ton of attention, a ton of money.

02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:18.340
And then those people are often left confused

02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:21.660
and like kind of disillusioned maybe thinking,

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:23.460
well, this didn't work in one year,

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:24.860
so it's not gonna work at all.

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:28.700
And so I think, yeah, there are problems there.

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:31.660
There's certainly a need for like male role models.

02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:33.820
There's certainly a need for somebody kind of

02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:36.860
to speak to a younger generation.

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.860
I just think that person shouldn't be maybe Andrew Tate,

02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:42.860
like personally.

02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:46.560
Yeah, so you have to criticize those particular individuals.

02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:47.400
I also-

02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:51.140
And yeah, I think like the Bugatti aspiration is so stupid.

02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:52.700
Like it's like, it's so-

02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:53.540
Let me steal, man.

02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.660
So I'm a person who doesn't care about money,

02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:56.660
don't like money.

02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:01.140
The women maybe appreciate the sort of the beauty

02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:06.140
of the other sex, but like, yeah, cars in particular

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.140
is like, really, is this really the manifestation

02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:11.720
of all the highest accomplishments a human being

02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:13.520
can have in life?

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.360
Yes, I can criticize all that.

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:19.360
But to steal me on that case is a young person,

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.560
a dreamer has ambition.

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:27.480
And I often find that education throughout my whole life,

02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:30.240
there's been people who love me, teachers

02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:34.720
who saw ambition in me and try to reason with me

02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:37.080
that my ambition is not justified.

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:41.080
Looking at the data, look kid, you're not that special.

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:44.440
Look at the data, you're not, and they want it,

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:48.240
they want you to like not dream essentially.

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:52.840
And then again, I look at the data, which is all the people,

02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:54.820
I just talked to Hodger Gracie.

02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:58.160
Hodger Gracie is just a person widely acknowledged

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:02.080
as probably the greatest of all time, dominated everybody.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:04.400
But for the longest time he sucked

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:08.320
and he was surrounded by people that kind of,

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:10.800
don't necessarily believe in him.

02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:13.160
So he had to believe in himself.

02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:17.840
It's nice to have somebody, as older I get and I've seen it,

02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:20.880
it's so powerful to have somebody who comes to you,

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:24.080
an older person, whether it's real or not,

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.400
that says you got this kid.

02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:26.240
Believes in you?

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:27.060
I believe in you.

02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:28.600
Sure.

02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:29.440
Yeah, it does.

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:34.360
I mean, I think, so I think dreaming

02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:36.740
is actually really important.

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:40.580
I'm more protective over,

02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:42.540
people co-opt those dreams for money.

02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:43.380
Yes, yes.

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:45.620
And like, I do think it matters so much

02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:48.300
that we encourage people to take risks.

02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:50.660
It's one of the great things about America

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:52.420
is it lionizes like sort of people

02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:54.620
who have taken risks in one.

02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:59.620
But I think it's just a weird, vapid thing

02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:02.420
when like the reason you do all of it

02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:04.980
is for this thing you can get out at the end of the day.

02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:06.420
When we all know and you,

02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:07.860
like you've just heard a million interviews,

02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:10.500
like nobody ever is gets the Bugatti and goes,

02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:12.260
this now completely fulfills me.

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:15.580
Everyone knows the beauty and the like fulfillment

02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:18.220
actually comes from becoming obsessed

02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:19.900
about what you're doing for its own sake,

02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:22.660
sort of the journey, the beauty of that thing.

02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:28.020
And I think money is just this thing we have to deal with

02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.060
to be able to do cool stuff.

02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:33.500
Like I acknowledge that you need money

02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:35.620
to build the $10 million studio to like,

02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:37.100
you gotta get the cameras, you gotta get the lights

02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.820
and I'm very blessed to be able to have gotten that.

02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:41.580
But past a certain point,

02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:43.740
like I think that is really the function of money

02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:46.060
is to just do cool stuff.

02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:50.020
But ultimately, if you can't fall in love with the process

02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:51.700
and like the craft itself,

02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:54.420
you will be left very unhappy at the end of it.

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:58.420
And so to start people off on that journey

02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:00.620
by pointing to the shiny object and going like,

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:02.380
that's what you should care about,

02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:03.940
seems to me so backwards.

02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:06.140
We should learn from the actual people who have done it

02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:09.340
and said, that shiny thing did nothing for me.

02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:10.460
Learn to love the journey

02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:12.700
and like that's the thing we pitch people

02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.860
as unsexy as that might be.

02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:15.700
Yeah, absolutely.

02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:17.140
That's also, and the same applies

02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:18.580
to like the Red Pill community

02:23:18.580 --> 02:23:20.420
that talks about dating and so on.

02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:24.100
That there is, it's not just about the number

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:27.220
of hot women you go to bed with,

02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:29.140
it's also about intimacy and love

02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:30.100
and all those kinds of things.

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:35.100
And so like there's components to a fulfilling life

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:40.980
that is important to sort of educate young people about.

02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.180
Totally.

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.660
But at the same time, feeding the dream

02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:45.060
and saying, take big risks.

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:45.900
Sure.

02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:49.060
And you, the little you that has no evidence

02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:51.780
of ever being great can be great

02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:54.220
because there's evidence time and time again

02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:56.180
of people that come from very humble beginnings

02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:58.260
and doing incredible things that change the world.

02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:01.140
Yeah, and there's just a tremendous like funny thing

02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.220
where you can't become great

02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:06.500
without having a willful denial of the statistics.

02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:08.340
Like in some ways you have to take the chance

02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:10.940
even if that chance is so improbable.

02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:13.060
And it's always those people who did take that chance

02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:15.300
who ended up winning, so I agree.

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:19.460
Probably SBF and FTX is the biggest thing

02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:20.460
you've ever covered.

02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:23.880
But previously you've called the Save the Kids scam,

02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:26.060
the world's influencer scam,

02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:28.780
like the biggest in the world influencer scam

02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:30.260
you've ever seen.

02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:31.780
Can you describe it?

02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:34.740
Sure, so Save the Kids was a charity coin

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:37.540
that was launched by a number

02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:40.060
of extremely popular influencers.

02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.300
I think they had over 50 million followers together,

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:45.140
huge names, and they basically said,

02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:48.580
hey guys, invest in this coin, we're gonna save the kids.

02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:51.240
A portion of the proceeds go to charity.

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.280
And this coin, it's unruggable.

02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:56.480
So, rugging is the term for,

02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:57.920
remember earlier we talked about Safemoon,

02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:59.440
you just grab the pool of funds in the middle

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:00.480
and you take them out?

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:04.540
Okay, it's unruggable because we have this smart code

02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:08.600
that is gonna prevent people who are quote whales,

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.840
which is a crypto term for saying

02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:13.440
you have a large portion of the tokens.

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:15.480
It'll prevent those people from selling a large amount

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.080
of that at one time, right?

02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:20.040
And so basically, you don't have to worry

02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:23.000
about trusting us, it just is what it is.

02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:26.900
Join and we will change the world, save the kids, whatever.

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:30.200
It was really skeezy from the beginning and sketchy

02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:33.760
because their logo matched the Save the Children logo,

02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:36.180
which is like an actual charity that,

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:39.460
so they basically copied it and said we're saving the kids,

02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:41.920
like a knockoff brand, and almost immediately

02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:44.660
the project rubbed, they stole the money.

02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:49.280
And tracing back through, the code was changed

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.520
at the last second before launch.

02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.520
Like if you looked at their code that they launched

02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:56.840
as a test versus the code they launched in actuality,

02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:00.360
they changed only like two lines and it was the whale code

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.040
to basically make the whale code non-existent.

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:05.040
Like you can sell as much as you want, as fast as you want.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.260
And it turned out that some of the influencers

02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.840
had not only sold that and made money,

02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:15.680
but also had a pattern of pump and dumping tokens.

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:17.000
So we can talk about what that is.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.440
Yeah, what's pump and dump?

02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:21.000
A pump and dump is just where you have

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.360
a huge following, you promote your little lex coin

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.040
to everybody while holding a big portion of it.

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:28.640
And as everyone rushes in to buy it,

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:32.480
the price is gonna pump and you dump at the same time.

02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:34.760
So that's where the name comes from, pump and dump.

02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.040
You pump the price, sell all your tokens,

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:38.120
make a lot of money.

02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:41.240
So I traced basically their wallets on the blockchain

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:44.400
and found that two of the actors specifically

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.460
had had a long history of doing this,

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:49.940
which really proved malicious intent.

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:51.540
And why I called it the worst is not,

02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:53.220
it certainly wasn't the worst in terms of like

02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:54.940
the amount of people affected.

02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.300
It relatively was like a small pump and dump

02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:00.900
because it rubbed almost immediately.

02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:03.180
But in terms of the amount of people

02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:04.600
that were involved in it,

02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.780
in terms of the amount of malicious behavior before it

02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:10.780
that like sort of proved that this wasn't an accident,

02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:12.740
the fact that there was like this whale code,

02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:14.600
it was one of the most cynical attempts

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.700
to just take the money of the followers you had

02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:19.860
and just like, that's mine now.

02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:23.180
That's why I called it that, but that's to save the kids.

02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:24.980
So that was...

02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:26.780
That was a lot of the Faze members

02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:29.860
and it was, I think Addison Rae.

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:31.300
There were a lot of people who seemed like

02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:33.580
they were kind of taking shrapnel on it.

02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:34.940
There was like this guy, Tico,

02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:36.240
who he didn't even sell the tokens.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.820
He just like held onto it the entire time

02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:40.820
and lost like a few thousand dollars or maybe even,

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:41.900
I forget the exact amount.

02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:43.980
He lost a lot of money, a decent amount.

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:47.120
And so like he took a lot of shrapnel with that,

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.740
but there were also people who were maliciously doing this.

02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:52.700
So in that investigation,

02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:55.560
several of the members of Faze got kicked out.

02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.620
One of them got like permanently banned.

02:27:57.620 --> 02:28:00.060
And then this other guy that I talked about

02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:00.900
fled the country.

02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:03.740
Like he sold all his belongings and like fled the country

02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:07.300
and hid out in London or wherever he is now.

02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:08.220
I don't really know where he is.

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:10.260
Somewhere in the UK area.

02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:12.920
So the basic idea there is to try to convert

02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:14.980
your influence into money.

02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:16.300
Correct.

02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:17.140
Okay.

02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:17.980
That's the basic idea

02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:21.140
to find a lot of influencer crypto promotions.

02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:23.260
Well, but, right.

02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:25.940
But that little word influencer means something

02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:29.140
because there are most crypto scams,

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:30.620
influencer scams, they're not, right?

02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:35.620
Most high-profile ones, like just by nature,

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:39.260
they tend to be made high-profile by the influencer.

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:41.740
So sometimes they are, but you're right.

02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:44.340
A lot of money has been lost and like nobody finds out

02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:46.380
because there's no one big sort of attached to it.

02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:47.980
They just steal a lot of money.

02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:51.500
But influencers are great salespeople

02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:55.340
because like in order to overcome the resistance

02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.540
of getting you to buy some random coin,

02:28:58.540 --> 02:28:59.780
there has to be a reason.

02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:03.180
And so much of the 21st century content creator generation

02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:06.500
is defined by these strange parasocial relationships

02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:08.980
where people feel like they know you.

02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:11.420
Not the character you play, but you.

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:13.900
And you have some friendship with them.

02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:16.300
When in actuality, you don't know the viewers.

02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:19.100
You have a sense, but you don't actually know

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:20.460
all of these people.

02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:25.100
And so that relationship is extremely powerful

02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:26.700
in terms of persuasion.

02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:29.340
So you can say, I believe in this

02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:31.740
and I've watched you for years

02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:33.580
and all of a sudden I say, if Lex believes in it,

02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:35.940
I believe in it, I trust him as a human.

02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:38.460
And so that differentiates these coins

02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:40.620
and all of a sudden the coin blows up,

02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:41.860
gets really popular.

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:44.260
You made this side deal and you make a ton of money.

02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:47.100
I have to say podcasting in particular is an intimacy.

02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:48.460
Like I'm a huge fan of podcasts

02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:51.540
and I feel like I'm friends with the people I listen to.

02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:52.380
Right.

02:29:52.380 --> 02:29:54.540
And boys that are responsibility.

02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:55.380
Yes.

02:29:57.140 --> 02:30:02.020
And that's why it really hurts me to announce

02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:04.260
that I am launching Lex coin.

02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:05.100
No.

02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:05.940
No!

02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:11.620
No, man, I hate money.

02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:14.380
I hate this kind of, the schemingness of all of this,

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:18.500
the use of any kind of degree of fame

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:19.620
that you have for that kind of stuff.

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:20.460
There's something just-

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:23.580
What makes it so frustrating is these people,

02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:26.500
I have a general sense of what they were like,

02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:29.180
sort of what I'm in the,

02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:31.060
even though I wouldn't describe myself as an influencer,

02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:32.460
I make content on YouTube.

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:34.980
I know that especially since they were taking

02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:36.860
these huge corporate sponsorships,

02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:38.340
they were making tons of money.

02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:41.060
They didn't have need for these scams.

02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:44.660
I think it's one thing to scam if you're like broke

02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:48.500
on the street and you're playing three card Monte to live.

02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:51.940
And I think it's a whole other ethically cruel thing to do

02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:55.020
if you're basically trying to upgrade your penthouse

02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:56.220
to the building next door.

02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:57.620
And you're already well off

02:30:57.620 --> 02:31:00.100
and you just kind of want to get even further ahead.

02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:01.060
I think that's where it-

02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:02.420
Well, this is the fascinating thing.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.020
So I've been very fortunate recently to sort of get,

02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:11.260
you know, whatever, a larger platform.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:13.540
And when you find out it's like life is amazing.

02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:14.980
I always thought life is amazing,

02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:16.500
but it becomes more amazing,

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:19.060
like you meet so many cool people and so on.

02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:22.740
But what you start getting is you have more opportunities

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:27.180
to like, yeah, like scammers will come to you

02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:29.340
and then try to use you, right?

02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:31.380
And I could see for somebody,

02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:32.540
it could be tempting to be like,

02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:34.220
ooh, it would be nice to make some money.

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:35.940
I wanted to say like on this,

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:38.140
kind of we're on this topic of opportunities you get,

02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:40.500
you know, kind of when you get a platform.

02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:42.300
So one of the reasons kind of I railed

02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:46.100
a little bit earlier against materialism or whatever,

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:47.580
I think to the extent to which

02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:49.580
you can moderate your own greed,

02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:52.860
you can play longer term games.

02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:56.020
And I think so many people end up cutting

02:31:56.020 --> 02:31:58.460
an otherwise promising career short

02:31:58.460 --> 02:32:01.220
by just wanting it too fast.

02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:02.900
So I think it's like a huge edge,

02:32:02.900 --> 02:32:05.340
just like discipline is in terms of like

02:32:05.340 --> 02:32:06.540
achieving what you want.

02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:08.300
I think I'm like a very moderate,

02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:10.260
like being comfortable with a moderate existence

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.780
and finding happiness in that is a huge edge

02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:15.980
because really your overhead is so much cheaper

02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.660
than the people who need a Ferrari

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:20.300
or a super nice house to feel fulfilled.

02:32:20.300 --> 02:32:21.580
And when your overhead is less,

02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:25.380
you have the luxury to say no to like sketchy offers.

02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:27.060
You have freedom that other people don't have

02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:30.060
because a lot of times people don't pitch it this way.

02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:32.820
They pitch a Ferrari as freedom or like big houses

02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:33.660
like you've made it.

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:35.700
In a lot of ways, those shackle you back

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:38.140
to like you gotta find the cashflow for those things.

02:32:38.140 --> 02:32:39.780
It's never a free ride.

02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:41.420
Yeah, that's really beautifully put.

02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.700
I've always said that I had fuck you money

02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:44.860
at the very beginning.

02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:46.980
I was broke for most of my life.

02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:48.980
The way you have fuck you money

02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:51.140
is by not needing much to say fuck you.

02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:51.980
That's right.

02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:53.820
I mean, that's the overhead that you're talking about.

02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:57.100
If you can live simply and be truly happy

02:32:57.100 --> 02:32:58.820
and be truly free,

02:32:58.820 --> 02:33:02.580
I think that means you could be free

02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:04.060
in any kind of situation.

02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:06.140
You could make the wise kind of decisions.

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:10.940
And in that case, money enables you in certain ways

02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.140
to do more cool stuff,

02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:14.180
but it doesn't shackle you, like you said.

02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:17.060
Too many people in this society, you would shackle

02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:19.420
because material possessions kind of like draw you

02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:24.420
into this race of more and more and more and more.

02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:27.260
And then you feel the burden of that bigger houses

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.100
and all that kind of stuff.

02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:29.940
Now, you have to keep working.

02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:31.820
Now, you have to keep doing this thing.

02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.140
Now, you have to make more money.

02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:35.460
And if it's a YouTube channel and so on,

02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:36.620
you have to get more.

02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:38.860
And the same, it's not even just about money.

02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:43.980
That's why I deliberately don't check views and likes

02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:45.220
and all that kind of stuff,

02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:49.740
is you don't want that dopamine of pulling you in.

02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:52.140
I have to do the thing that gets more and more attention

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:57.140
or more and more like, yeah, like money and-

02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.500
So wise, yeah, agreed.

02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:00.860
It's a huge negative hit

02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:05.860
and your ability to do creative work.

02:34:06.260 --> 02:34:07.340
Can I ask you about that?

02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:09.100
Cause I'm always interested in this.

02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:12.380
I completely agree.

02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:15.020
I think it's funny because when you abstract yourself out

02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:17.020
to the people you admire and respect

02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:20.060
who inspired you to do the creative work you do,

02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:23.500
you never think about like the views they were getting

02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:26.380
or the money they were making or the influence they had,

02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:29.220
all you ever think about is the work itself.

02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:33.180
And it's funny when a lot of people get in this position,

02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:36.220
your temptation is to focus on that which you can measure,

02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:38.780
which is like all the stuff you said,

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:40.420
like the likes, the views.

02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:45.140
That's not actually the target or what you got into it for.

02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:46.500
If you get into it for like,

02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:47.420
cause you're inspired or whatever,

02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:49.700
your goal is inspiration, it's impact.

02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:52.280
And like that can't be quantified that same way.

02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:54.460
So it's interesting,

02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:59.020
you have to find a way as a creator of any of this stuff

02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:03.540
to like deliberately detach yourself from the measurable

02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:05.620
and focus on this thing, which is kind of abstract.

02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:08.260
And I was wondering if you have any like ideas for that.

02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:10.300
So one, yeah, there's a bunch of ideas.

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:15.300
So one is figure out ways where you don't see

02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:19.380
the number of views on things.

02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:20.220
How do you do that?

02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:23.160
So I wrote a Chrome extension for myself

02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:24.640
that hides the number of views.

02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:27.160
That's really funny.

02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:28.000
No, what's funny is I have-

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.920
For me, cause it's useful for other people's content.

02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:33.320
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna need to borrow this.

02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:34.360
That was my problem.

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:37.560
I actually have some Chrome extensions for like,

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:40.600
I don't like going down like recommendation rabbit holes

02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:41.440
when I'm at work.

02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:43.400
I just wanna like search for a video, find it.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.480
I don't wanna see like all the up next

02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:46.600
cause all the waste time.

02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.020
So I use Chrome extensions for that.

02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:49.520
But the views is a problem

02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:51.240
because it's relevant to me as a creator.

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:52.480
Like, is this a big video?

02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:55.040
Which is why I really hurt when they remove

02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:56.160
like likes and dislikes

02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:59.180
cause I wanna know for tutorials and so on.

02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:01.620
What's, I mean, that's probably really useful

02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:03.280
for you, the dislikes.

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:04.120
Do you have that?

02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.520
Do you ever considered making that Chrome extension public?

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:08.360
Sure.

02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:09.200
Actually, yeah.

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:10.720
And there would be a good philosophy behind it, right?

02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:12.200
Like don't, if you're a creator-

02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:13.040
I really like it.

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:13.860
I love the idea.

02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:14.760
I've wanted this thing before.

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.960
I don't know if it necessarily exists.

02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:19.760
Cause I don't think I've made a Chrome extension public.

02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:20.600
That'd be cool.

02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:21.720
I would love to see.

02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:25.240
Yeah, I would go to that process of adding it to the,

02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:26.760
cause I love like open-sourcing stuff.

02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:29.640
So yeah, I'll go add it to the Chrome extension,

02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:30.720
like the store.

02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:32.320
Yeah, cause I totally have.

02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.940
I've hated this for like a long time.

02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:36.260
YouTube made a change

02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:38.440
and they just continue to make the analytics front

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.840
and center, which makes sense from their perspective.

02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:42.600
They're trying to give people better data

02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:45.360
on what is successful and what makes something successful.

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.000
They're trying to train their creators,

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.780
but in the process,

02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:51.700
it can lead to some unhealthy habits

02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:53.820
of thinking views define a video.

02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:56.300
And so I've long thought, okay, I've learned analytics.

02:36:56.300 --> 02:36:57.640
I understand retention.

02:36:57.640 --> 02:36:59.460
Now I sort of want to do like the Zen,

02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:01.020
like forget it all.

02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:03.120
And you can only do that if it's out of your site.

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:05.500
Depends how many friends you have who are creators.

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:07.540
The other really important thing,

02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:10.100
and I found this, this has nothing to do with creatives,

02:37:10.100 --> 02:37:13.240
but people I respect very much in my life.

02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:17.980
Some of them people would know that they could be famous.

02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:20.100
They will come to me and say,

02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:23.940
they will comment on how popular a video was on YouTube.

02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:25.940
They will sort of compliment.

02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:26.780
The success.

02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:29.220
The success defined by the popularity.

02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:32.160
Even for a podcast where most of the listenership

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:36.140
is not on YouTube or in Spotify now is getting crazy.

02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:39.760
They will still compliment the YouTube number.

02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:42.060
So one of the deliberate things I do

02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:43.900
is I either depending if it's a close friend,

02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.780
I'll get offended and made fun of them for that.

02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:48.460
And there's a signal to them.

02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:50.060
This is not the right thing.

02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:51.340
I don't want that.

02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:53.900
And for people more like strangers

02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:55.520
that compliment that kind of stuff,

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:57.880
I show zero interest.

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.940
I don't receive the compliment well.

02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:02.020
And I focus on the aspects of the compliment

02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:03.780
that have to do with like,

02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:05.620
what do they find interesting?

02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:08.420
Like, you know, I kind of make them,

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:10.340
reveal to them that you shouldn't care

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:11.900
about the number of views.

02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:12.740
It is strange.

02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:14.960
There's like this weird hypnotism that happens

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:17.360
once you get past a certain number

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:19.000
and that number is some approximation.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.360
It's like, it's always like hard numbers.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:23.320
It's like a hundred thousand, a million, 10 million.

02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:25.080
People just see a number and they just go like,

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.520
wow, that is, and they assign a quality to it

02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.700
that may not like, it usually means nothing at all.

02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:31.800
So I agree.

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.520
I've never been good at like handling that

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:36.320
because you're like, thank you.

02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:37.720
You know, it's like, okay, okay.

02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:40.120
That said, I do admire, very different from me,

02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:44.840
but I admire Mr. Beast who unapologetically says like,

02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.800
the number is all that matters.

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:50.480
Like basically the number shows,

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:52.680
like the number of views you get

02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:55.880
shows like how much, I don't know,

02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:57.540
joy you brought to people's lives

02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.400
because if they watch the thing,

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:03.160
they kept watching the thing, they didn't turn to now.

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:04.280
That means they loved it.

02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:05.840
You brought value to their life.

02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:06.840
You brought enjoyment.

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:09.920
And I'm going to bring the maximum amount of enjoyment

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:12.040
to the maximum number of people.

02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:14.200
And I'm gonna do the most epic videos

02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:15.040
and all that kind of stuff.

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:18.520
So I admire that when you're so unapologetically

02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.040
into the numbers.

02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:21.860
Yeah, he's sort of, it's interesting.

02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:24.360
He's like, gosh, we're getting way too in the weeds.

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:26.400
Am I, is this a, I don't know.

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:28.040
I'm like constantly self-monitoring

02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:29.240
about like what topics we went on.

02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:31.720
But if we can, Mr. Beast is so interesting

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:32.880
because he's almost done what,

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:34.280
have you ever seen Moneyball?

02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:36.360
Yes.

02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:37.720
It's this story of how someone brought statistics

02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:39.960
to baseball and it revolutionized everything.

02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:42.440
He's Moneyballed YouTube.

02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.040
He took statistics to YouTube and it changed everything.

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.400
And everybody now, so many people are playing catch up.

02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:52.560
I think it would be interesting in a few years

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.760
to see how he develops.

02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:57.480
And now that he's like kind of revolutionized

02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:59.460
like the data side of things,

02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:03.200
how he then approaches future videos.

02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:06.500
Because there's a point at which you've optimized,

02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:08.120
you've optimized, you've optimized.

02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:10.720
But optimizing for short-term video performance

02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:11.940
is not the same as optimizing

02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:13.840
for long-term viewer happiness.

02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.800
And how do you do that?

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:18.760
Assuming the YouTube algorithm does not perfectly

02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.800
already do it for you, which it doesn't.

02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.480
But they're trying to obviously do that,

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.040
optimize for long-term happiness.

02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:28.240
And also growing, optimize for long-term creative growth.

02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:29.080
Sure.

02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:30.880
I think the thing that people don't,

02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:32.200
I mean, maybe I don't know.

02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:34.120
I actually don't know enough about Jimmy.

02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:38.560
But like to me, the thing that seems to be special

02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.040
about him isn't the money ball aspect.

02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:43.680
That's really important.

02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:46.200
It's like taking the data seriously.

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:49.420
But to me is that the part of the idea generation,

02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:52.160
the constant brainstorming and coming up with videos.

02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.960
So it's nice to connect the idea generation with the data.

02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.800
But like how many people when they create

02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:01.800
on YouTube and other platforms

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:04.880
really generate a huge amount of ideas.

02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:06.680
Like constantly brainstorm.

02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:08.760
Constantly, constantly brainstorm.

02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:13.400
At least for me, I don't think I go

02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:17.680
so many steps ahead in my thinking.

02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:20.240
I don't like try to come up with all possible conversations.

02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:23.000
I don't come up with all possible videos I can make.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.520
But you can't, so the one mistake to make

02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:29.120
is to map Jimmy's philosophy onto every genre.

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:31.640
Because not every genre fits that model.

02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:34.780
Your model is not an idea-centric model.

02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:36.280
It's a people-centric model.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:40.360
And so you like, if you were in the business

02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:42.520
of creating just mass entertainment

02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:44.600
for the sake of mass entertainment,

02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.440
you might focus on, okay, the reason going idea-focused

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:52.760
instead of person-focused is such a revolutionary idea

02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:55.880
in some senses is because ideas can be broader,

02:41:55.880 --> 02:41:58.520
more broadly appealing than any single human can be.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.520
But you're not going for that.

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.680
You're going for a podcast interview.

02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:06.920
And I think for you, the goal should always be

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:09.360
how deep can you get with interesting guests

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.260
and like finding the most interesting guest,

02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:13.960
which is a different probably set of skills.

02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.240
Well put, really well put.

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:17.380
But I think the right mapping there

02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:19.040
is finding the most interesting guest.

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:19.880
Yeah, right.

02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.240
And I think I don't do enough work on that.

02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.240
So for example, I try to be, something I do prioritize

02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:30.760
is talking to people that nobody's talked to before.

02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:35.760
So, because it's like, I kind of see myself as not a good,

02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:37.240
I know a lot of people that are much better than me.

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:41.640
I really admire, I think Joe Rogan is still the GOAT.

02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:43.480
He's just an incredible conversationalist.

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:46.880
So it's like, all right, who is somebody

02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:48.440
Joe's not gonna talk to?

02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.600
Either he's not interested or it's not gonna happen.

02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.120
Like I wanna talk to that person.

02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:57.640
I wanna reveal the interesting aspect of that person.

02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:02.640
And I think I should do a Mr. Beast style rigor

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.240
in searching for interesting people.

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.680
And you should probably find people to help you search.

02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:12.720
Sure, so he does that.

02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:15.280
But if we're being honest, he does that of course,

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:18.800
with other folks, but he's the main engine.

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:22.920
Yeah, you need like sort of like a pre-filter,

02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:24.320
you're the final filter.

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.320
Cause your problem is you're only able to think of humans

02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:32.680
that you've thought of before or been exposed to.

02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:35.240
And most of the world you've never been exposed to.

02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:37.920
So you need people to like pre-filter and go,

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:40.440
okay, these guys are just interesting humans.

02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:41.600
Lex has never heard of them.

02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:45.240
And then you sort of take a batch of like a hundred people

02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:47.480
and you go, who seems the most interesting for me?

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.640
Yeah, but by the way, on that topic,

02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:52.800
where we's into we's, I've almost done,

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:57.640
I'm building up, I programmed this guest recommendation

02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:00.560
thing where I wanna get suggestions from other people.

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:03.880
Cause I really wanna find people that nobody knows.

02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:05.400
This is the tricky thing.

02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.280
Not, you're not famous.

02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:11.000
But the idea is there's probably fascinating humans

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.880
out there that nobody knows.

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:13.760
Correct.

02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:14.960
That I wanna find those.

02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:17.880
And I believe in the crowdsourcing aspect will raise them.

02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:20.960
And now of course, the top hundred will be crypto scams.

02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:22.480
No, but yes.

02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:26.480
I have to make sure that these kinds of swarms of humans

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:28.640
that recommend, I can filter through

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.680
and there's this whole kinds of systems for that.

02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:33.720
But I wanna find the fascinating people out there

02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:35.000
that nobody's ever heard from.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:38.120
And from a programmer perspective,

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:39.360
I thought surely I could do that

02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:41.480
by just building the system.

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:42.840
Yeah, that's how programmers always think.

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:44.480
They'll just automate a system to do it.

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.160
Well, that's the Jimmy money ball, right?

02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:47.600
Like looking at the data.

02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:48.440
Yep.

02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.280
Weeds on weeds.

02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:53.240
How do we get to Mr. Beast exactly?

02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:54.080
I'm not sure.

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:56.280
Okay, save the kids.

02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:57.120
Influencer.

02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:58.440
Influencer, that's probably how.

02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.600
Let me ask you more on the guru front.

02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:03.080
You've, okay, let's start with somebody

02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:05.800
that you've covered that I think you've covered a lot

02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:08.680
and I'm really embarrassed to not know much about him.

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:10.240
I think this is like old school coffee cell.

02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.720
You've been through stages, okay?

02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:13.720
I've been through stages and phases, true.

02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:15.760
So a character named Dan Lok.

02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:16.600
Yeah.

02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:18.800
Who is he?

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.120
You've exposed him for cult-like human

02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:24.880
and his cult-like practices.

02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.720
Who is he?

02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:26.560
What has he done?

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:29.360
So Dan Lok is sort of,

02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.080
he's gone through a number of iterations,

02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:34.520
but he was kind of this like sales trainer guy

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:36.800
who really made a hard push

02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.960
into what he called high ticket sales.

02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:40.360
And he was telling people

02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.420
that they could kind of escape the nine to five rat race

02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:45.320
if they just learn high ticket sales

02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:47.640
and they can have the life of their dreams.

02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:50.000
Basically, it's like, I'll teach you to sell,

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.920
but I'll teach you to ask,

02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:54.440
like not only will I teach you to sell you that pen,

02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:57.080
but I'll teach you to sell it for $50,000

02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.760
instead of a dollar, right?

02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:02.000
So I talked to a lot of the people

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.040
who had taken this course,

02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:04.200
because it was pretty expensive.

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:08.000
I think it was like $2,500 or $1,000.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.960
And mind you, the people who are taking it are like teachers

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:14.120
and like people who don't have a lot of money.

02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.360
And then you take the course and immediately you find out,

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:18.620
okay, well, there's an upsell.

02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:21.020
At the end of the course, you're not ready.

02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:23.320
You need to go from like high ticket closer,

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:26.440
which is one of the products to inner circle

02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:28.720
or like the level up, right?

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.360
And all of these courses are structured like this.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.640
So they spend a tremendous amount on Google ads

02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.300
to get people in the door, promising the dream.

02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:38.800
And then once you're in,

02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:41.640
you're actually not done being like the product.

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.000
You're actually in the system that tries to upsell you

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.880
again and again and again and again.

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.520
And eventually you're paying monthly

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:49.780
and you're getting more and more.

02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:52.360
You're constantly paying for access to Dan Lok's wisdom

02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.040
and like ideas.

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:55.840
And fundamentally,

02:46:57.680 --> 02:46:59.480
this sales system wasn't working for people.

02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:01.360
I mean, I talked to like, for example, a teacher

02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:04.400
who put in like $25,000,

02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:07.080
was in debt at one point and has nothing to show for it.

02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:08.080
I know.

02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:10.000
And it was sort of these tactics

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
of pressuring, pressuring, pressuring.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:13.760
And then anytime anyone would complain,

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:14.860
he would try to silence them.

02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:18.500
So I heard from like, funny enough,

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:20.100
this lady was a teacher as well.

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:23.060
She put together a Facebook group,

02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:24.720
basically saying, I think this guy's a scam.

02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:25.820
His course didn't work.

02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:28.140
It's not working for a lot of people

02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:30.300
because fundamentally the promise of turning someone

02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:33.660
from a non-salesman into a person

02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:37.060
who's making six figures selling is not an easy thing to do.

02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:39.080
It's not just a matter of just like take my course.

02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:40.700
But anyways, it wasn't working.

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:42.540
She created a Facebook group about it

02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:44.140
and he liked to sue her

02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:47.460
and was like legally pressuring her to stop doing that.

02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:50.980
And I realized like somebody has to speak out about this

02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:53.700
and everyone who is, is getting silenced.

02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:55.060
So I was like, I'm gonna use my platform

02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:56.920
to raise awareness to this.

02:47:56.920 --> 02:47:58.340
And people came out of the woodwork.

02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:01.560
I mean, saying that this guy defrauded me or he scammed me.

02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:05.080
And I wanna just really quickly take a second,

02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:10.080
take a beat to explain why get rich quick schemes

02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:14.000
are different than let's say selling a water bottle

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.600
and saying it's the greatest water bottle ever, right?

02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:18.060
Cause sometimes people wonder, they go like,

02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:20.800
well, doesn't like Nissan say their car

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.640
is gonna make you happy

02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:22.460
and then it doesn't make you happy.

02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:25.440
Like, why is that different from the kind of advertising

02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:27.720
of a get rich quick course?

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:29.240
I mean, both of them are sort of promising things

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:31.440
that aren't true, but you get something.

02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:32.880
You take some kind of a training.

02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.820
You know, isn't it the same thing?

02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:36.140
No, here's why.

02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:40.380
There's this concept in economics called elastic demand

02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:41.900
and inelastic demand.

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.740
What it essentially means is that if I raise the value

02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:47.780
of this water bottle, there's a point at which

02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:49.060
you're just gonna be like, no,

02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:50.980
it doesn't make any sense, right?

02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:52.980
But there are areas in our lives

02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:56.980
where we have desperation around them

02:48:56.980 --> 02:49:00.180
that can get deeply predatory very quickly

02:49:00.180 --> 02:49:02.740
because they have no,

02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:05.180
there's no elasticity around their demand.

02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.460
For example, your health.

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:11.700
If you get cancer and I have the pill that will solve it,

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:14.540
or at least let's say I don't, I have a sugar pill here,

02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:16.100
but if I can convince you that this pill

02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:19.220
will solve your cancer or treat your cancer,

02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:22.500
you will pay any amount of money you have on this earth

02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:23.940
to get this pill.

02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:26.780
But obviously that gets really predatory really quick

02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:30.340
because selling something that isn't real

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:31.300
is almost as compelling

02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:33.100
as selling something that is real, right?

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.820
So this happens in the get rich quick space too.

02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:37.580
There's any amount of money you would pay

02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:40.660
to make a lot more money, right?

02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:42.500
So these products have inelastic demand.

02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:46.220
That's why you see what is essentially a few webinars

02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:48.660
getting sold for $2,500.

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:52.660
Courses that literally have identical videos on YouTube,

02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:54.540
like very similar course curriculums

02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:57.420
that are selling for such extravagant amounts of money.

02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:01.700
And I think there can be comparisons made to college

02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:06.700
because obviously there's similar questions about benefits.

02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:09.100
But in this case, there's not even statistics available

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:11.740
that even shows the average person gets something out of it.

02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:13.580
That's true of like, if you go to college,

02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:15.780
your average income will improve, right?

02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:16.860
That's the justification there.

02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:17.740
There's none of that.

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:19.060
There's no case studies.

02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.740
There's nothing backing their extravagant claims

02:50:21.740 --> 02:50:22.940
of you're gonna make all this money,

02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:23.940
you're gonna make all this wealth.

02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:25.900
Instead, they're just, as we said before,

02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:27.220
they're selling you a dream.

02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:30.020
So that's why I find all those types

02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:32.020
of get-rich-quick schemes so problematic.

02:50:32.020 --> 02:50:33.940
And that's why I've railed against them

02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:35.500
for a significant amount of time.

02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:38.300
What have you learned from attacking,

02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:41.340
exposing some of the things that Dan Lok is doing?

02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:43.100
What have you learned about human nature

02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:45.700
and frosters and gurus and so on?

02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:46.540
That's a great question.

02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:49.620
So I think one of them is that

02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:54.860
there's this systemic problem that the phrase,

02:50:54.860 --> 02:50:57.980
there's a sucker born every minute, is very true.

02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:00.500
There is no end to the people

02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:03.580
who will fall for something like this.

02:51:03.580 --> 02:51:05.900
And the problem is because there's just no end

02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:09.460
to need and want and just lack.

02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:11.660
I mean, it's easy to, on the one hand,

02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:13.700
criticize people's greed, but a lot of times,

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:15.500
you have to put yourself in their shoes.

02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:17.700
If you're at a dead-end job,

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.340
you have nothing going for you,

02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:20.500
you don't have the money to go to college,

02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:22.780
you don't wanna get in debt, fair play,

02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:24.740
where do you go, right?

02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:26.660
As you said, there's somebody who's there saying,

02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:29.820
they believe in you, they believe you can make six figures.

02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:31.980
You're gonna believe in that.

02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:36.980
And so I really felt like it made a lot more sense

02:51:36.980 --> 02:51:39.900
to tackle it from the other side,

02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:42.220
from the side of people that can stop,

02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:46.460
that can basically be exposed and basically be,

02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:50.140
have sort of like a negative put on their work.

02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:52.260
I mean, they're largely going under the radar.

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:53.940
So I kind of felt like,

02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:56.980
do you wanna educate the,

02:51:56.980 --> 02:51:58.540
do you wanna like blame it on the victims

02:51:58.540 --> 02:51:59.620
and say, you should have known better,

02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:01.780
you should have done this, you should stop,

02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:04.220
but there's no end to that.

02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:06.660
Or do you go after the grifters themselves?

02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:07.860
And so that's what I realized.

02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:12.300
I realized like, that's the tactic that I went with.

02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:13.140
And it's tough,

02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:14.620
cause it's a little like legally risky to do that,

02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:18.620
but yeah, you just kinda gotta be smart about it.

02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:21.260
So your platform has gotten really big.

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:22.940
So there's some responsibility to that?

02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:24.100
Weirdly big, yeah.

02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:24.940
Yeah.

02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:27.500
Let's say.

02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:30.940
Cause like only a year ago it was like a lot smaller

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:34.220
and then it's hard to make that adjustment,

02:52:34.220 --> 02:52:38.300
cause like to me it's just the same show I've been doing.

02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:41.740
So how do you avoid becoming a guru yourself

02:52:41.740 --> 02:52:44.460
or your ego growing?

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:48.340
There's different trajectories it could take.

02:52:48.340 --> 02:52:52.020
One of which is you can start seeing everybody

02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:55.100
as a scammer and only you can reveal it.

02:52:55.100 --> 02:52:58.340
And like you have a audience of people

02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:02.620
who love seeing the epic coffeezilla grilling

02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:04.340
and you can destroy everyone

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.700
and that power now is getting to your head.

02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:08.020
How do you avoid that?

02:53:08.020 --> 02:53:11.580
Well, I mean, this is like less optically obvious.

02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:13.260
I think the main way is like,

02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:16.140
my circle of friends doesn't care about any of that.

02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:17.940
Like my wife doesn't care.

02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:20.060
The people whose opinion I value

02:53:20.100 --> 02:53:23.420
has no relation to like a subscriber metric

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.540
or anything like that.

02:53:24.540 --> 02:53:27.020
I think that's like tangibly the most important thing

02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:28.220
to just staying grounded.

02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:30.180
As far as like becoming a guru,

02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:32.540
I just don't have anything to like sell.

02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:35.340
I mean, I'm not interested in teaching people finance.

02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:36.980
I'm not interested in teaching people,

02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:39.260
not interested in selling a course.

02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:42.140
And I've kind of given myself a hard line on that,

02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:43.980
which I think has helped me a bit

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:46.580
is there's a temptation to go,

02:53:46.580 --> 02:53:48.300
well, I can tell what's a scam.

02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:50.420
So let me tell you what's not a scam.

02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:52.980
And a lot of people have offered a lot of money to do that

02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:53.940
and basically be like,

02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:57.100
hey, I have such and such legitimate product,

02:53:57.100 --> 02:53:59.100
come be like an endorser.

02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:01.100
And I just don't do that

02:54:01.100 --> 02:54:04.100
because I think it undermines a lot of what I do

02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:05.620
is if you get like,

02:54:06.500 --> 02:54:09.460
if you're taking money in on the side to say this is legit

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:10.660
and you're saying this isn't legit,

02:54:10.660 --> 02:54:12.140
that's a huge conflict of interest.

02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:14.300
So I think it's about managing conflicts of interest

02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:17.820
and keeping people around me that are grounded.

02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:19.060
And also I think,

02:54:20.780 --> 02:54:24.500
yeah, my only interest really is just like make cool stuff.

02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:27.260
And I guess I'll do that until people stop watching.

02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:30.740
A question on that topic

02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:33.020
from the Coffeezilla subreddit, shout out.

02:54:33.020 --> 02:54:33.860
Shout out.

02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:38.060
How does Coffee find the strength to maintain his integrity

02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:41.180
and resist temptation of being paid a great amount of money

02:54:41.180 --> 02:54:43.380
to advertise or promote a potential scam?

02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:46.180
I think that's like,

02:54:46.180 --> 02:54:47.860
goes back to what we've been talking about a lot,

02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:50.460
which is just on what you prioritize, what you value.

02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:51.660
I've just never,

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:54.460
I guess I grew up kind of lower middle class

02:54:55.460 --> 02:54:57.540
and I had a great time.

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:00.620
Like I had a great childhood, I had very loving parents.

02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:02.020
And because of that,

02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:05.340
I guess, intuited at an early age

02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.860
that money doesn't do a whole lot.

02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:10.540
And I knew a lot of people who were way better off,

02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:13.020
who had miserable childhoods

02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:15.500
because whether their dad was always gone at work

02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:18.220
or like they just had other family issues

02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:20.300
that just money can't buy.

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:22.540
And I realized,

02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:23.940
I guess quickly

02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:28.460
that money's a very like,

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:31.900
it's a glittery object that isn't what it appears to be.

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:34.380
And so to me, I'm like,

02:55:34.380 --> 02:55:37.340
I'm having the time of my life making my show.

02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:38.180
I'm not gonna have the time,

02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:40.100
like you could ruin all that

02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:42.060
just trying to go for this quick check

02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:44.260
when it's like, no, I'm having a great time.

02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:46.780
Yeah, it's actually maybe,

02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:48.100
you're probably the same way,

02:55:48.100 --> 02:55:50.380
but for me, there's a lot of happiness

02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:52.100
in having integrity,

02:55:52.100 --> 02:55:53.180
in looking in the mirror

02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:56.060
and knowing that you're the kind of person that has that.

02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:59.660
In fact, walking away from money is also fun

02:55:59.660 --> 02:56:01.660
because it's like promising your,

02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:02.900
like it's showing,

02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:04.740
it's easy to like just say you have integrity.

02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:06.020
It's nice to like,

02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:07.140
ha, I actually,

02:56:07.140 --> 02:56:08.820
I've discovered several times in my life

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.020
that I have integrity.

02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:11.860
It's-

02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:12.700
Well, you get put,

02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:14.740
yeah, you get put like basically to the test.

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:16.980
Yeah, I've said,

02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:18.820
like, I don't know if I probably said,

02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:20.060
but to myself, I say like,

02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:21.500
you can't buy,

02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.060
there's a lot of things you can't buy with me,

02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:24.700
like for a billion dollars,

02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:26.860
like a trillion dollars.

02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:28.780
But it'd be nice to get tested that way.

02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:30.060
It'd be cool to see,

02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:32.020
because you never know until you're in that room.

02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:33.100
It's true.

02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:34.580
Same with power, given power.

02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:36.940
I'd like to believe I'm the kind of person

02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:38.100
that wouldn't abuse power,

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:39.980
but you don't know until you're tested.

02:56:40.980 --> 02:56:41.820
So anyway,

02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:43.020
you're in a really tricky position

02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:44.860
because you're doing incredible,

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:47.740
I mean, you are a world-class journalist straight up.

02:56:47.740 --> 02:56:49.980
And so there is pressure on that

02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:53.220
of like not having,

02:56:53.220 --> 02:56:55.780
like erring on the side of caution

02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:57.540
with like having conflicts of interest

02:56:57.540 --> 02:56:58.380
and stuff like that.

02:56:58.380 --> 02:56:59.220
It's tough.

02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:00.860
It's a really tough seat to sit in.

02:57:02.780 --> 02:57:03.620
It's really tough.

02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:04.460
It's really tough,

02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:07.100
but it's unfairly tough, I feel like.

02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:09.180
But it's good that you're sort of

02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:10.500
weighing all of those.

02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:14.260
But that said, go donate to Coffeezilla.

02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:16.340
Donate everything.

02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:17.340
Support them.

02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:19.900
It's a really, really important human being.

02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:23.020
The other guy I did,

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:24.700
I think is the first person I discovered

02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:28.860
that you investigated is Brian Rose of London Real.

02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:31.380
Can you talk about his story?

02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:34.020
Brian Rose,

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:36.740
he was sort of this interesting figure

02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:39.500
because he was like trying to be,

02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:40.740
to one level or another,

02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:43.700
the Joe Rogan of London,

02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:45.980
which I don't think he did a terribly bad job of,

02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:46.900
especially initially,

02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:48.940
he had some really interesting podcasts

02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:50.980
with some really interesting people.

02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:52.020
And it's funny enough,

02:57:52.020 --> 02:57:53.140
I started out as I like,

02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:53.980
I would watch him.

02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:55.340
I mean, I don't know if I was like a huge fan,

02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:56.180
but I was like,

02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:57.020
I like some of his interviews.

02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:59.380
He had some really good like big gets

02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:02.540
in terms of great guests.

02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:06.740
However, when kind of COVID started,

02:58:06.740 --> 02:58:11.100
he went down this really weird grifting rabbit hole

02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:15.420
where he did like this interview with David Icke,

02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:16.660
who's as you know,

02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:19.060
like a pretty big COVID conspiracy theorist.

02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:21.860
And I mean like actual,

02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:25.460
like he believes some of the Royals are literally lizards.

02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:29.220
So he got shut down for that.

02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:31.620
And he kind of made a big stink,

02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:33.020
which I think it's fine.

02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:34.540
Nobody likes to be censored.

02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:37.860
And I'm not even saying that he should have been censored,

02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:40.700
but his reaction to that was to like raise a ton of money

02:58:40.700 --> 02:58:41.540
from his audience,

02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:44.980
promising this digital freedom platform.

02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:46.220
And at first it was like,

02:58:46.220 --> 02:58:47.820
oh, we want to raise a hundred thousand dollars.

02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:49.500
And then they raised it like within a day.

02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:52.100
So he's like, well, we got to raise a lot more money.

02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:54.020
And so eventually they raised a million dollars

02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:57.020
and he's trying to raise $250,000 a month

02:58:57.020 --> 02:59:00.860
to kind of keep putting his viewers money into this stuff.

02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:02.500
So I started digging into the platform they were building

02:59:02.500 --> 02:59:04.500
and there was nothing free about it.

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:06.300
They had censorship guidelines

02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:07.940
and there was nothing about a platform at all.

02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:09.940
There was no underlying infrastructure.

02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:14.340
He just got some white label live streaming thing.

02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:16.580
So I criticized him for that.

02:59:16.580 --> 02:59:17.900
It was just this ridiculous thing.

02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:19.900
All the donators expected one thing.

02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:22.420
They thought Brian Rose was going to take on Google

02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:25.540
and Facebook and like bring free speech back for everybody.

02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:26.740
And of course he didn't.

02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:29.860
And then it kind of got worse

02:59:29.860 --> 02:59:32.980
because he started taking a lot of heat for that

02:59:32.980 --> 02:59:37.220
and he really pivoted hard into like the DeFi grift.

02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:40.220
So he started selling this course about DeFi mastery.

02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:43.460
And this is a guy who knows nothing about crypto

02:59:43.460 --> 02:59:45.180
or very little at the least.

02:59:45.180 --> 02:59:47.660
So it just got really kind of,

02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:51.100
he just kind of doubled down on this course model

02:59:51.100 --> 02:59:52.740
of you're going to be rich if you just follow me.

02:59:52.740 --> 02:59:54.900
And it was ultimately,

02:59:54.900 --> 02:59:57.140
you just type in Brian Rose on YouTube,

02:59:57.140 --> 02:59:58.980
you can see what his audience thought of that.

02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:01.780
Because almost all of them have left him at this point.

03:00:01.780 --> 03:00:04.380
He's getting like a thousand views of video.

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:05.740
And it wasn't because of me.

03:00:05.740 --> 03:00:09.060
I mean, it was like people lost taste

03:00:09.060 --> 03:00:12.260
in just the constant ask for more money,

03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:13.580
more money, more money.

03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:15.340
At some point people get sick of it.

03:00:15.340 --> 03:00:18.060
And it's like, everyone has an understanding

03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:19.460
that like no one works for free.

03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:22.620
But when it starts to be ego driven

03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:25.580
and driven around money, everything's about money,

03:00:25.580 --> 03:00:28.180
it drives people away.

03:00:28.180 --> 03:00:30.540
Well, you're a part of that sort of helping people.

03:00:30.540 --> 03:00:32.660
It's nice to have a voice.

03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:33.740
Yeah, I certainly spoke out.

03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:35.100
I mean, it wasn't like I was quiet.

03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:36.980
I was very loud about it at the time.

03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:39.900
But I mean in the sense that

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.900
if you look at someone like Andrew Tate,

03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:47.420
I've made a video about him,

03:00:47.420 --> 03:00:49.020
even though he's been banned off all the platforms,

03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:51.420
he gets more views than Brian Rose.

03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:54.220
And I think it's just like it was a testament

03:00:54.220 --> 03:00:57.140
to how much Brian Rose was like doing like the grift

03:00:58.100 --> 03:00:59.420
even people who were fans

03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:01.300
and didn't care about what I said,

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.940
like couldn't look past just the constant ask

03:01:03.940 --> 03:01:05.700
for more and more money.

03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:07.940
People just get burned out.

03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:10.020
Is there some aspect that you worry about

03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:12.940
where with a large audience,

03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:16.580
there seems to be a certain aspect of human nature

03:01:16.580 --> 03:01:19.740
where people like to see others destroyed.

03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:21.180
Sure.

03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:25.300
Do you worry about hurting people that don't deserve it?

03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:30.300
Or rather sort of attacking people that are grift or light,

03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:36.940
but they get like a giant storm of negativity towards them

03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:41.220
and therefore sort of overpoweringly cancel them

03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:44.220
or like hurt them disproportionately?

03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:45.340
Sure.

03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:50.340
I mean, I try to be sensitive to my platform

03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:52.220
and as I've grown,

03:01:52.220 --> 03:01:56.180
I've tried to make sure my video topics have grown with me

03:01:56.180 --> 03:02:00.220
and like it does reach this tricky point

03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:04.660
where if you're exposing a grifter with like 50,000 subs

03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:08.460
who's doing some harm, are you punching down?

03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:09.300
Right.

03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:14.300
And so far there's been enough high profile things

03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:16.500
that I can distract myself with

03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:18.220
to where this has never been a problem.

03:02:18.220 --> 03:02:23.220
You don't ever want to be sort of like Sir Lancelot

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:25.660
in retirement.

03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:28.500
Where have you heard this analogy?

03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:30.180
Okay, so there's this great analogy

03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:32.020
where it's like Sir Lancelot's the guy

03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:34.620
who slays the dragon, right?

03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:35.780
He gets a lot of fame

03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:37.860
and he gets a lot of fortune for saving the dragon

03:02:37.860 --> 03:02:39.660
or at least a lot of people love him.

03:02:41.220 --> 03:02:43.900
But what happens after he slays the first dragon?

03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:45.100
He's got to go find a bigger dragon.

03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:46.860
So he goes finds a bigger dragon.

03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:49.540
And eventually, depending on how many dragons

03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:51.180
you think are there in the world,

03:02:51.180 --> 03:02:53.260
maybe he kills all the dragons.

03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:55.340
And one day people go see Sir Lancelot

03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:59.140
and he's in a field with cows and he's chopping their heads.

03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:03.340
And he's sort of put himself in retirement

03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:04.700
but he can't even enjoy the fruits

03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:08.300
because his whole thing is like, I'm killing the dragon.

03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:10.100
So I try to be cognizant

03:03:10.100 --> 03:03:15.060
and I try to always make myself willing to hang up my,

03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:17.980
my suspenders, I guess, hang up my hat.

03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:19.380
I try to be aware of like,

03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:21.820
if I significantly improve the problem,

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:23.700
I put myself out of business,

03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:27.020
I want to be okay with that, basically.

03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:29.300
And just be fine with it.

03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:32.220
I don't, the funny thing is I was more worried about this

03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:34.980
as like an issue earlier

03:03:34.980 --> 03:03:37.380
because I thought there was a finite like,

03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:39.940
I was like, man, I'm gonna solve this faster,

03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:41.300
especially as it started gaining traction.

03:03:41.300 --> 03:03:43.620
Like, I'm gonna solve this fast, I got this.

03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:46.420
Classic, naive, you know,

03:03:46.420 --> 03:03:47.900
we all think we're so influential.

03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:49.460
FTX comes along.

03:03:49.460 --> 03:03:51.660
Well, yeah, and you just, you just, yeah,

03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:54.260
you just get like, with time you get humbled

03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:55.300
because you talk to people.

03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:59.660
I've talked to like versions of Coffeezilla that are older

03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:02.540
and it's like, oh yeah, they didn't solve it

03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:03.900
and they probably were better.

03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:06.300
I just imagine a smoke-filled room

03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:11.300
of just like retired Batman

03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:14.260
and you're this young, bright-eyed.

03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:17.020
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:19.060
Fiery-spirited investigator.

03:04:19.060 --> 03:04:19.900
Yeah, exactly.

03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:24.180
What's the process of investigation that you can speak to?

03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:27.500
What are some interesting things you've learned

03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:30.740
about what it takes to do great investigations?

03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:34.540
Sure, great investigations reveal something new

03:04:34.540 --> 03:04:36.420
or bring something to light.

03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:40.260
So I think what everyone thinks in terms of investigations

03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:42.380
is like a lot of like, you know, Googling

03:04:42.380 --> 03:04:44.420
or like searching through articles.

03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:47.340
I think that's the first thing you wanna get away from

03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:51.060
and you wanna try to talk to people,

03:04:51.060 --> 03:04:52.820
doing like the non-obvious things

03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:55.060
and just trying to get perspectives

03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:57.180
that are beyond just what is available.

03:04:57.180 --> 03:05:00.060
So a lot of it's just having conversations

03:05:00.060 --> 03:05:03.140
is so enlightening, both to victims

03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:04.380
and also obviously trying to get,

03:05:04.380 --> 03:05:05.900
talk to the people themselves.

03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:09.820
Secondly, there's sometimes some analysis you can generate

03:05:09.820 --> 03:05:12.020
that's meaningful, like blockchain evidence.

03:05:12.020 --> 03:05:15.020
So in the case of SafeMoon, for example,

03:05:15.020 --> 03:05:18.660
going back to that, I found someone's secret account

03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:20.100
where they were pumping, dumping coins.

03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:22.220
They were saying things like, who sold?

03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:25.140
I'll, you know, I'm so mad at the guy who sold,

03:05:25.140 --> 03:05:27.180
F the guy who sold, and you look at his account

03:05:27.180 --> 03:05:28.420
and he was the guy selling.

03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:30.940
And it's like, that is just, that's great stuff.

03:05:30.940 --> 03:05:33.620
So digging through the blockchain,

03:05:33.620 --> 03:05:35.620
kind of I've gained some skills there

03:05:36.660 --> 03:05:38.420
and that's kind of this fun,

03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:41.100
I guess I would say it's this weird edge I have right now

03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:43.900
because a lot of people don't know too much about that.

03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:46.540
And so I have this weird expertise that works now.

03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:47.460
I don't think that'll work forever

03:05:47.460 --> 03:05:48.940
because I think people kind of figure out

03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:50.700
how to do very similar analyses,

03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:54.340
but so it's like kind of an interesting edge right now

03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:55.180
that I have.

03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:56.700
So that's like a data-driven investigation,

03:05:56.700 --> 03:05:58.140
but you also do interviews, right?

03:05:58.140 --> 03:05:58.980
Yeah, definitely.

03:05:58.980 --> 03:06:01.820
And then also recently I've tried to get more response,

03:06:01.820 --> 03:06:03.260
speaking to your point about like,

03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:05.820
as your platform gets bigger, you need more responsibility.

03:06:05.820 --> 03:06:09.580
I've tried to get much more responsible

03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:11.260
about like reaching out

03:06:11.260 --> 03:06:15.060
or somehow giving the subject some way to talk

03:06:15.060 --> 03:06:17.220
because I think in early on,

03:06:17.220 --> 03:06:19.180
I was such a small channel that A,

03:06:19.180 --> 03:06:21.500
if I asked them, they wouldn't answer.

03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:24.340
But B, I kind of felt like I was launching these videos

03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:26.060
into the abyss.

03:06:26.060 --> 03:06:28.740
And when some of my videos had real traction,

03:06:28.740 --> 03:06:31.220
I was like, okay, hang on a second.

03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:33.460
Let's double check this, let's triple check it.

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:36.700
Let's try to make sure all this stuff is correct

03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:38.940
and there's no other side of the story.

03:06:38.940 --> 03:06:41.100
I'll say this has interesting implications

03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:42.460
because for example,

03:06:42.460 --> 03:06:44.260
I investigated this thing called Genesis,

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:46.180
their billion dollar crypto lender.

03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:49.220
And my conclusion was that they were insolvent.

03:06:49.220 --> 03:06:50.260
That's a huge accusation.

03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:51.100
So what do you do?

03:06:51.100 --> 03:06:52.820
Well, I emailed their press team, everybody.

03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:55.220
I said, hey, I think you're insolvent.

03:06:55.220 --> 03:06:56.060
I think you're this.

03:06:56.060 --> 03:06:57.900
I think I laid out all my accusations.

03:06:57.900 --> 03:07:00.940
And I said, you have till I think 2 p.m.

03:07:00.940 --> 03:07:02.220
the next day to respond.

03:07:03.620 --> 03:07:06.460
At 8 a.m., before I made my video,

03:07:06.460 --> 03:07:07.740
they announced to all their investors

03:07:07.740 --> 03:07:08.940
that they're freezing withdrawals.

03:07:08.940 --> 03:07:10.300
They don't have the money.

03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:11.700
So they front.

03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:12.980
I don't know if they saw the inner,

03:07:12.980 --> 03:07:14.580
like I don't know if they actually saw that email.

03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:17.300
I don't wanna take credit for collapsing them or whatever.

03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:21.500
But my point is had I not taken that level of kind of care

03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:24.980
and just said, hey, you're a scammer, you're frauds.

03:07:24.980 --> 03:07:27.700
Ironically, could I have done more good

03:07:27.700 --> 03:07:30.500
by allowing people to withdraw their money early?

03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:32.620
I made some tweets that people did see

03:07:32.780 --> 03:07:34.740
that like some people got their money out,

03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:36.620
but my YouTube audience is much larger.

03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:38.260
And could I have helped more people

03:07:38.260 --> 03:07:41.020
had I not given them basically the ability

03:07:41.020 --> 03:07:43.380
to know what I was gonna produce when I produced it?

03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:45.380
Boy, your life is difficult

03:07:45.380 --> 03:07:48.300
because you can potentially hurt the company

03:07:48.300 --> 03:07:51.140
that doesn't deserve it if you're wrong.

03:07:51.140 --> 03:07:54.500
Or if you're right and you weren't in the company,

03:07:54.500 --> 03:07:55.660
you might hurt the...

03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:01.700
Well, I'm glad your wife is a supporter

03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:02.820
and keeps you strong.

03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:04.660
That's a tough, tough decision.

03:08:06.220 --> 03:08:08.260
Ultimately, I guess you wanna err on the side

03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:11.340
of the individual people,

03:08:12.340 --> 03:08:14.780
of the investors and so on.

03:08:14.780 --> 03:08:15.700
But it's tough.

03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:18.340
It's always a really, really tricky decision to make.

03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:19.660
Very tricky.

03:08:19.660 --> 03:08:20.620
Oh boy.

03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:23.700
That's so interesting.

03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:28.180
And then the thing I've seen in your interviews

03:08:29.180 --> 03:08:30.020
that I don't remember,

03:08:30.020 --> 03:08:32.020
because I think when you,

03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:34.980
I watched you earlier in your career,

03:08:34.980 --> 03:08:36.180
you were a little bit harsher.

03:08:36.180 --> 03:08:38.660
You were having, you were like trollier.

03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:40.580
You're having a little more fun.

03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:41.420
Sure.

03:08:41.420 --> 03:08:43.220
And when I've seen you recently,

03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:44.940
you do have the fun,

03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:47.980
but whenever you interview, you seem respectful.

03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:50.860
Like you attack in good faith,

03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:52.820
which is really important for an interviewer.

03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:54.820
So then people can go on

03:08:54.820 --> 03:08:56.820
and actually try to defend themselves.

03:08:56.820 --> 03:08:59.180
That's really important signal to send to people

03:08:59.220 --> 03:09:01.540
because then you're not just about tearing down.

03:09:01.540 --> 03:09:02.540
You're after like the,

03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:05.180
it's cliche to say, but the truth.

03:09:05.180 --> 03:09:07.820
Like you're really trying to actually investigate

03:09:07.820 --> 03:09:09.460
in good faith, which is great.

03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:10.940
So that signal is out there.

03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:13.180
So like people like SBF could,

03:09:13.180 --> 03:09:16.460
like he should go on your platform, I think.

03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:19.980
I mean, now it's like in full,

03:09:19.980 --> 03:09:22.420
not just like a half-assed conversation on Twitter space,

03:09:22.420 --> 03:09:23.260
but in full.

03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:25.860
So that's great that that signal is out there.

03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:27.700
But of course the downside of sort of,

03:09:28.100 --> 03:09:29.860
as you become more famous,

03:09:29.860 --> 03:09:32.820
people might be scared to sort of go on.

03:09:32.820 --> 03:09:35.380
But you do put that signal being respectful out there,

03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:36.580
which is really, really important.

03:09:36.580 --> 03:09:38.180
You know, it's interesting.

03:09:38.180 --> 03:09:39.940
It surprises me.

03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:41.060
I know it surprises other people

03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:42.540
because other people have commented,

03:09:42.540 --> 03:09:44.140
but it consistently surprises me

03:09:44.140 --> 03:09:45.820
how many people still talk to me.

03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:48.980
And maybe it's because they,

03:09:48.980 --> 03:09:50.820
and I really do give a good attempt

03:09:50.820 --> 03:09:52.540
to try to argue in good faith.

03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:55.020
I try not to just like load up ad homonyms

03:09:55.020 --> 03:09:55.840
or anything like that.

03:09:55.840 --> 03:09:56.940
I just try to present the evidence

03:09:56.940 --> 03:09:58.980
and let the audience make up their mind.

03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:04.260
But it surprises me sometimes that people will just be like,

03:10:04.260 --> 03:10:06.300
yeah, they wanna talk, they wanna talk, they wanna talk.

03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:11.140
I think it's very human in a way.

03:10:11.140 --> 03:10:14.900
And I think it's like almost, it's almost like good.

03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:17.020
Like one of the things that is always told

03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:18.340
to everyone who's gonna talk to the cops

03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:21.420
is like, you should never talk to the cops, whatever.

03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:23.420
Which is true, you shouldn't talk to the cops.

03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:25.860
Because even if you're innocent, they can use your words,

03:10:25.860 --> 03:10:27.380
they can twist your words, et cetera.

03:10:27.380 --> 03:10:29.820
But there's something that gets lost

03:10:29.820 --> 03:10:34.380
in that like almost robotic, like self-interest

03:10:34.380 --> 03:10:38.060
that I think having open conversations,

03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:39.900
even if you've done something wrong,

03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:42.060
I think there's something really compelling about that

03:10:42.060 --> 03:10:45.940
that continues to make people talk in interrogation rooms,

03:10:45.940 --> 03:10:48.220
in Twitter spaces, wherever you are,

03:10:48.220 --> 03:10:51.860
regardless of whether you totally shouldn't be talking.

03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:53.940
And I don't wanna downplay that.

03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:55.140
That's actually really important.

03:10:55.300 --> 03:10:58.540
It's like a lot of cases get solved,

03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:00.580
a lot of investigations go farther

03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:04.420
because people sort of make the miscalculation to talk.

03:11:04.420 --> 03:11:06.500
But I think it's like almost important in a way

03:11:06.500 --> 03:11:09.700
that we have that human bias to like connect

03:11:09.700 --> 03:11:11.340
in spite of self-interest.

03:11:11.340 --> 03:11:14.780
Yeah, but also they're judging the integrity

03:11:14.780 --> 03:11:16.700
and the good faith of the other person.

03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:18.740
So I think when people consume your content,

03:11:18.740 --> 03:11:20.780
especially your latest content,

03:11:20.780 --> 03:11:23.740
they know that you're a good person.

03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:26.380
I found myself,

03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:30.380
like there's a lot of journalists that reach out to me

03:11:30.380 --> 03:11:33.380
and I find myself like not willing to talk to them

03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:35.540
because I don't know if the other person on the side

03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:37.260
is coming in good faith.

03:11:37.260 --> 03:11:38.900
Even on silly stuff, I'm not a-

03:11:38.900 --> 03:11:39.820
Same way.

03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:42.580
Like I'm not a, I don't have anything to hide.

03:11:42.580 --> 03:11:44.380
Like you don't really have anything to hide,

03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:49.140
but you don't know what their like spin is.

03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:50.700
Can I tell you an example?

03:11:50.700 --> 03:11:52.940
I'm dying, cause I believe so strongly

03:11:52.940 --> 03:11:55.860
that journalists have done themselves such a disservice.

03:11:55.860 --> 03:11:57.780
Okay, one of the truest things is that like,

03:11:57.780 --> 03:12:00.460
everyone loves journalism in theory

03:12:00.460 --> 03:12:04.260
and almost everyone dislikes journalists as a whole.

03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:05.860
Like there's a deep distrust of journalists

03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:08.180
and there's a deep love for journalism.

03:12:08.180 --> 03:12:09.580
It's this weird disconnect.

03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:11.660
I think a lot of it can be summarized in,

03:12:11.660 --> 03:12:13.580
there's this book called the,

03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:15.700
God, what it's called.

03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:17.820
I think it's called The Journalist and the Murderer.

03:12:17.820 --> 03:12:20.300
It's written by Janet Malcolm.

03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:23.260
The first line of this book is that like,

03:12:23.260 --> 03:12:26.900
every journalist who knows what they're doing,

03:12:26.900 --> 03:12:29.500
who isn't too like, is smart enough to know

03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:31.260
what they're doing, knows what they're doing

03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:33.380
is deeply unethical or something like that.

03:12:33.380 --> 03:12:36.340
And what they're talking about is that there's a tradition

03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:38.860
in journalism to betray the subject,

03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:43.180
to lie to them in the hopes of getting a story

03:12:43.180 --> 03:12:47.300
and play to their ego and to their sense of self,

03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:49.620
to make it seem like you're gonna write one article

03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:51.260
and you stab them in the back at the end

03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:52.100
when you press publish

03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:53.980
and you write the totally different article.

03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:56.820
This is what actually everyone hates about journalists.

03:12:56.820 --> 03:12:57.860
And it's happened to me before.

03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:00.500
So I did a story like way back in the day,

03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:01.900
I got interviewed about something

03:13:01.900 --> 03:13:03.740
that was like data with YouTube.

03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:06.900
I made a few comments about data and YouTube.

03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:09.300
And somehow by the time the article got published,

03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:11.820
it's about me endorsing their opinion

03:13:11.820 --> 03:13:13.900
that PewDiePie is an anti-Semite.

03:13:13.900 --> 03:13:15.300
And I'm like, I reached out to this person,

03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:16.700
I said, I never said that.

03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:19.460
Like, how did you even twist my words to say that?

03:13:20.300 --> 03:13:23.220
And I felt so disgusted and betrayed to have like,

03:13:23.220 --> 03:13:25.780
I'm like this mouthpiece for an ideology

03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:28.980
or like a thought that I do not actually agree with.

03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:32.540
So, and when journalists do this, they think,

03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:34.100
well, I'm never gonna interview this person again,

03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:34.940
so it's okay.

03:13:34.940 --> 03:13:38.060
So it's like, it's almost like the ends justify the means,

03:13:38.060 --> 03:13:39.540
I get the story.

03:13:39.540 --> 03:13:41.020
But the ends don't justify the means

03:13:41.020 --> 03:13:45.740
because you've now undermined the entire field's credibility

03:13:45.740 --> 03:13:46.780
with that person.

03:13:46.780 --> 03:13:49.300
And when that happens, enough time,

03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:52.180
you end up sitting across from Lex Friedman

03:13:52.180 --> 03:13:53.260
and it's like, well, I don't know

03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:54.700
if they're gonna represent me fairly.

03:13:54.700 --> 03:13:57.940
Because the base assumption is that

03:13:57.940 --> 03:13:59.780
regardless of what the journalist says,

03:13:59.780 --> 03:14:01.660
they could betray you and they might betray you

03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:03.820
at the end of the day and be saying you're great

03:14:03.820 --> 03:14:05.860
while they're secretly writing like a hit piece

03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:10.860
about like how much you're a bad force for the world.

03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:14.380
Whereas there's an alternate universe

03:14:14.380 --> 03:14:17.020
where if the journalist was somewhat upfront

03:14:17.020 --> 03:14:20.100
about their approach, or at least didn't mislead

03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:21.380
and didn't say like, I love you.

03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:22.580
I think you're great.

03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:27.900
You would end up with less access,

03:14:27.900 --> 03:14:30.540
but you would end up with more trusted journalism,

03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:33.460
which I think in the long run would be better.

03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:35.620
I think you get more access.

03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:36.580
I think in the long term, yeah.

03:14:36.580 --> 03:14:38.380
But all of these, like everything we're talking about

03:14:38.380 --> 03:14:40.860
is long-term games versus short-term games.

03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:42.300
In the short term, you get more access

03:14:42.300 --> 03:14:44.580
if you suck up to the person, if you say this,

03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:47.100
and you stab them in the back later.

03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:49.540
Long-term, you build a long-term reputation,

03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:51.660
people trust you, it actually matters more.

03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:54.380
And it's nice when that reputation is your own individual.

03:14:54.380 --> 03:14:58.420
So like you have a YouTube channel, you're one individual.

03:14:58.420 --> 03:15:02.460
So people trust that because you have a huge disincentive

03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:04.260
to screw people over.

03:15:04.260 --> 03:15:05.100
True.

03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:07.820
I feel like if you're in the New York Times,

03:15:07.820 --> 03:15:08.980
if you screw somebody over,

03:15:08.980 --> 03:15:11.700
the New York Times gets the hit, not you individually.

03:15:11.740 --> 03:15:15.780
So you can like, you're safer.

03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:18.300
But like the reason I don't screw people over

03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:23.300
is I know that, well, there's my own ethics and integrity.

03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:25.940
Also, there's a strong disincentive to like,

03:15:25.940 --> 03:15:29.540
because you're now, that person is gonna go public

03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:30.660
with me screwing them over,

03:15:30.660 --> 03:15:32.700
completely lying about everything,

03:15:32.700 --> 03:15:35.020
how I presented the person, for example.

03:15:35.020 --> 03:15:39.620
And that's just gonna percolate throughout the populace.

03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:40.460
And they're gonna be like,

03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:43.820
this is the person that's lying, lying sack of shit.

03:15:43.820 --> 03:15:46.020
And so there's a huge disincentive to do that.

03:15:46.020 --> 03:15:47.740
Yeah, journalists don't have that.

03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:50.740
That is what's interesting about the move

03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:52.740
towards independent journalism.

03:15:53.860 --> 03:15:55.780
I think we'll probably end up at a space

03:15:55.780 --> 03:15:59.060
where it's so interesting.

03:15:59.060 --> 03:16:01.460
Mainstream journalism has so much work to do

03:16:01.460 --> 03:16:04.860
to repair the trust with the average individual.

03:16:06.700 --> 03:16:09.660
And it's going to take a lot of like self-reflection.

03:16:09.660 --> 03:16:12.580
I've talked to a few mainstream journalists about this.

03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:16.100
And a lot of them will admit it behind closed doors,

03:16:16.100 --> 03:16:18.300
but like, there's this general sense that,

03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:19.940
oh, the public's not being fair to us.

03:16:19.940 --> 03:16:23.340
Like they're very self, they're defensive, I guess,

03:16:23.340 --> 03:16:24.180
in a way.

03:16:24.180 --> 03:16:25.420
And I understand why,

03:16:25.420 --> 03:16:29.000
because sometimes it's just a few bad apples

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:30.700
that ruin it for everybody.

03:16:30.700 --> 03:16:34.300
But without the acknowledgement of the deep distrust

03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:39.300
that they have with a good portion of our society,

03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:41.460
there's no way to rebuild that.

03:16:41.460 --> 03:16:43.140
Just like when there's no acknowledgement

03:16:43.140 --> 03:16:46.620
of the corruption of the 2008 financial crash,

03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:48.100
there's no way to rebuild that.

03:16:48.100 --> 03:16:52.900
Even if most bankers, most traders are not unethical

03:16:52.900 --> 03:16:56.780
or duplicitous or they're totally normal people

03:16:56.780 --> 03:16:58.840
who maybe aren't deserving of the bad reputation,

03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:01.700
but you have to acknowledge the damage that's been done

03:17:01.700 --> 03:17:05.620
by bad actors before you can like heal that system.

03:17:05.620 --> 03:17:07.260
Well, what do you think about Elon

03:17:07.260 --> 03:17:09.420
just opening the door to a journalist

03:17:09.420 --> 03:17:11.560
to see all the emails that were sent,

03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:14.660
the quote unquote Twitter files?

03:17:14.660 --> 03:17:15.980
Yeah, that's really interesting.

03:17:15.980 --> 03:17:18.540
I mean, I saw a lot of,

03:17:18.540 --> 03:17:20.900
I'm like in this weird thing where I see,

03:17:20.900 --> 03:17:23.860
I'm so, I follow a lot of independent people

03:17:23.860 --> 03:17:25.660
and I follow a lot of mainstream journalists

03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:29.500
and there are very polar opposite takes on that.

03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:31.100
People really quickly politicize it,

03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:32.620
but to me, the thing that was fascinating

03:17:32.620 --> 03:17:35.660
is just the transparency that I've never seen from,

03:17:35.660 --> 03:17:37.340
one of the really frustrating things to me,

03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:39.500
because a lot of this podcast has been about

03:17:39.500 --> 03:17:41.940
interviewing tech people, CEOs and so on,

03:17:41.940 --> 03:17:44.620
and they're just so guarded with everything.

03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:47.300
It's hard to get to, and so it's nice to get,

03:17:49.220 --> 03:17:52.140
hopefully this is a signal, look, you can be transparent.

03:17:52.140 --> 03:17:55.820
Like this is a signal to increase transparency.

03:17:55.820 --> 03:17:56.860
Hopefully so.

03:17:56.860 --> 03:17:59.700
I don't, yeah, it's been tribalized so quickly.

03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:01.800
It's like I've lost a lot of faith in that.

03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:04.920
And unfortunately it's been this like bludgeon match of like,

03:18:05.860 --> 03:18:08.260
you know, if you're on the right,

03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:10.620
you think it's uncovering the greatest story ever

03:18:10.620 --> 03:18:11.460
about Hunter Biden.

03:18:11.460 --> 03:18:13.900
If you're on the left, you think they were just sharing,

03:18:13.900 --> 03:18:16.900
they were just silencing revenge porn pics of Hunter Biden.

03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:17.940
So therefore it was justified.

03:18:17.940 --> 03:18:20.580
And by the way, Trump also sent messages to Twitter.

03:18:20.580 --> 03:18:22.540
So doesn't that mean that like we should be criticizing?

03:18:22.540 --> 03:18:26.700
It just like, this goes back to why I don't touch politics

03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:29.900
is because I think as many problems as I have,

03:18:29.900 --> 03:18:32.500
I think when you become a journalist that,

03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:33.820
not even a political journalist,

03:18:33.860 --> 03:18:36.460
when you become a journalist in politics,

03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:38.220
you have like twice the problem.

03:18:38.220 --> 03:18:41.020
So I'm like, I'm happy to be well outside

03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:43.300
of that kind of sphere.

03:18:43.300 --> 03:18:44.940
But it's an interesting-

03:18:44.940 --> 03:18:45.780
It is interesting.

03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:47.380
Twitter, you know, forget Twitter files,

03:18:47.380 --> 03:18:50.540
but Twitter itself is really, really interesting

03:18:50.540 --> 03:18:54.780
from the virality of information transfer.

03:18:54.780 --> 03:18:55.620
Yeah.

03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:57.220
And from a journalistic perspective,

03:18:57.220 --> 03:18:59.580
it's like how information travels,

03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:01.700
how it becomes distributed.

03:19:01.700 --> 03:19:03.020
It's interesting.

03:19:03.020 --> 03:19:05.700
What do you think about Twitter?

03:19:05.700 --> 03:19:07.100
I'm always conflicted on Twitter

03:19:07.100 --> 03:19:12.100
because I almost hate how much I enjoy using it

03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:15.700
because I'm like, this is like this mindless bird app

03:19:15.700 --> 03:19:16.900
is consuming my time.

03:19:18.100 --> 03:19:20.460
It's this incredible networking tool.

03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:23.060
But what's weird is when I think about my own presence

03:19:23.060 --> 03:19:25.740
on Twitter, they've almost made it too easy

03:19:25.740 --> 03:19:29.020
to like say something that you've half thought.

03:19:29.020 --> 03:19:31.260
Like the friction to send a tweet is so much less

03:19:31.260 --> 03:19:33.340
than like if I'm gonna make a YouTube video,

03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:34.740
there's several points at which I'm like,

03:19:34.740 --> 03:19:35.980
well, what's the other side?

03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:37.180
What's this, what's that?

03:19:37.180 --> 03:19:38.460
There's no friction there.

03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:39.620
And so one thing I've noticed is

03:19:39.620 --> 03:19:41.020
everyone I follow on Twitter,

03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:44.500
a lot of them after reading all their tweets,

03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:47.460
I think nothing more of them, nothing less of them.

03:19:47.460 --> 03:19:49.420
But there's a lot of them that I think less of.

03:19:49.420 --> 03:19:51.620
And I don't think I've ever had an experience

03:19:51.620 --> 03:19:53.500
where I've read someone tweets

03:19:53.500 --> 03:19:55.300
and I think more of them in a way.

03:19:55.300 --> 03:19:57.460
And I'm like, what does that say that?

03:19:58.740 --> 03:19:59.580
Yeah, what is that?

03:19:59.660 --> 03:20:03.540
There's so many people I admire

03:20:03.540 --> 03:20:07.260
that the worst of them is represented on Twitter.

03:20:09.660 --> 03:20:10.500
There's a lot of people.

03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:11.340
There's a million examples.

03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:16.340
They become like snarky and sometimes mocking and derisive

03:20:16.340 --> 03:20:19.380
and negative and like emotional messes.

03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:23.420
Yeah, what is that?

03:20:23.420 --> 03:20:26.260
Maybe we shouldn't criticize it

03:20:26.260 --> 03:20:29.500
and accept that as like a beautiful raw aspect

03:20:30.420 --> 03:20:32.020
of the human being, but not encompassing,

03:20:32.020 --> 03:20:34.580
not representing the full entirety of the human being.

03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:35.420
But it does reflect,

03:20:35.420 --> 03:20:38.380
like it's impossible to not reflect it to some extent

03:20:38.380 --> 03:20:40.340
or you'd have to counter that bias really carefully

03:20:40.340 --> 03:20:41.660
because that is them.

03:20:41.660 --> 03:20:43.180
It is a thought they had.

03:20:43.180 --> 03:20:44.660
It's just probably something that should have been

03:20:44.660 --> 03:20:46.940
an unexpressed thought perhaps.

03:20:48.380 --> 03:20:51.140
So yeah, I kind of wonder like my,

03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:52.540
I'm like, should I be on Twitter?

03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:55.980
But the problem is it's such a great place

03:20:55.980 --> 03:20:59.900
where so many, like so much of the news happens on Twitter,

03:20:59.900 --> 03:21:03.060
so much of the journalism breaks on Twitter.

03:21:03.060 --> 03:21:05.820
Even people in the New York Times, they'll tweet their scoop

03:21:05.820 --> 03:21:07.940
and they'll put that out on Twitter first.

03:21:07.940 --> 03:21:11.940
So it's this really weird thing where I'd love to be off it

03:21:11.940 --> 03:21:13.660
and it's like too useful for my job,

03:21:13.660 --> 03:21:15.580
but I kind of hate it.

03:21:15.580 --> 03:21:17.780
No, no, you need to, well, it depends,

03:21:17.780 --> 03:21:20.540
but from my perspective, you should be on it.

03:21:20.540 --> 03:21:22.260
Oh, I definitely am, yeah.

03:21:22.260 --> 03:21:25.900
So like Coffeezilla should definitely be on Twitter,

03:21:26.780 --> 03:21:31.780
but have developed the catalysis and the strength

03:21:32.540 --> 03:21:36.780
to not give into the sort of the lesser aspects.

03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:39.540
Because you're silly, you're funny,

03:21:39.540 --> 03:21:42.380
you could be cutting with your humor.

03:21:42.380 --> 03:21:47.380
I wouldn't give into the darker aspects of that,

03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:50.180
like low effort negativity.

03:21:50.180 --> 03:21:52.260
If you're, the way you are in your videos,

03:21:52.260 --> 03:21:55.420
I would say if you're ever negative or making fun of stuff,

03:21:55.420 --> 03:21:57.060
I think that's high effort.

03:21:57.060 --> 03:21:59.340
So I would still put a lot of effort into it,

03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:01.820
like calmly thinking through that,

03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:06.100
because, and also not giving into the dopamine desire

03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:08.900
to say something that's gonna get a lot of likes.

03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:11.540
You know, I have that all the time.

03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:14.740
You use Twitter enough, you realize certain messages

03:22:14.740 --> 03:22:16.980
that are going to get more likes than others.

03:22:16.980 --> 03:22:17.820
And-

03:22:17.820 --> 03:22:20.500
And are usually the ones that are extreme, more extreme.

03:22:20.500 --> 03:22:21.340
Yeah.

03:22:21.340 --> 03:22:23.940
And like emotional, like Lex is an idiot,

03:22:23.940 --> 03:22:26.580
or like Lex is the greatest human being ever.

03:22:26.580 --> 03:22:27.940
It's much better than, oh wow,

03:22:27.940 --> 03:22:30.100
what a polite, nuanced conversation.

03:22:30.100 --> 03:22:31.900
I can tell you right now which of those three tweets

03:22:31.900 --> 03:22:33.740
it isn't gonna perform well.

03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:35.140
Yeah, yeah.

03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:38.500
So I think extremes are okay, if you believe it.

03:22:38.500 --> 03:22:42.780
Like I will sometimes say positive things.

03:22:42.780 --> 03:22:46.780
I said that the Twitter files release was historic.

03:22:46.780 --> 03:22:49.500
Of course, this before I realized,

03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:53.420
I mean, the reason I said it is not,

03:22:53.460 --> 03:22:55.580
is because the transparency,

03:22:55.580 --> 03:23:00.580
it's so refreshing to see some any level of transparency.

03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:04.300
And then of course, those kinds of comments,

03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:05.500
the way Twitter does,

03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:08.180
is every side will interpret it

03:23:08.180 --> 03:23:10.020
in the worst possible way for them,

03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:12.580
and they will run with it.

03:23:12.580 --> 03:23:14.340
Or some side, when it's political,

03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:18.420
yeah, one side will interpret, yes, I agree with Lex.

03:23:18.420 --> 03:23:20.100
You're right, it's historic.

03:23:20.100 --> 03:23:21.620
They might not have even read the article.

03:23:21.620 --> 03:23:22.700
They just like, they literally,

03:23:22.700 --> 03:23:23.980
or the tweet thread,

03:23:23.980 --> 03:23:25.980
and they're just like, it is historic.

03:23:25.980 --> 03:23:28.260
Historic because Hunter Biden was finally,

03:23:28.260 --> 03:23:30.180
the collusion, or whatever it is.

03:23:30.180 --> 03:23:31.740
And then the other side is like,

03:23:31.740 --> 03:23:33.540
no, it's a nothing burger.

03:23:34.540 --> 03:23:36.740
But yeah, that aspect of nuance,

03:23:36.740 --> 03:23:38.220
and that's frozen in time,

03:23:38.220 --> 03:23:39.740
even with editing, there's a-

03:23:39.740 --> 03:23:40.780
So tough.

03:23:40.780 --> 03:23:41.980
It's tricky.

03:23:41.980 --> 03:23:45.500
But if you maintain a cool head through all of that,

03:23:45.500 --> 03:23:49.180
and hold to your ethics and your ideas,

03:23:49.180 --> 03:23:52.140
and use it to spread the ideas,

03:23:52.180 --> 03:23:54.900
which you do extremely well on YouTube,

03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:57.140
I think it could be a really powerful platform.

03:23:57.140 --> 03:23:59.460
There's no other platform

03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:02.420
that allows for the viral spread of ideas,

03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:07.180
good ideas, than this.

03:24:07.180 --> 03:24:10.540
And this is where, especially with Twitter spaces,

03:24:11.860 --> 03:24:15.220
I mean, where else would I see,

03:24:15.220 --> 03:24:18.260
I think twice, impromptu conversations

03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:20.060
with CoffeeZilla and SPF?

03:24:20.060 --> 03:24:21.540
Never, yeah, nowhere else,

03:24:21.580 --> 03:24:23.020
because he wasn't going to come on my show.

03:24:23.020 --> 03:24:24.700
He wasn't going to come on some big prepared thing.

03:24:24.700 --> 03:24:28.140
It's like, hey, YOLO, let's go on a Twitter space,

03:24:28.140 --> 03:24:29.260
and I like pop up.

03:24:29.260 --> 03:24:31.140
And you know what's funny?

03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:32.900
And this, I hope this release is late enough,

03:24:32.900 --> 03:24:35.500
or well, SPF probably won't see this,

03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:36.500
although I'm sure he's-

03:24:36.500 --> 03:24:39.180
And unfortunately, unfortunately he will.

03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:40.020
Oh, okay.

03:24:40.020 --> 03:24:44.180
Well, hopefully I'll have time to enact my little plan,

03:24:44.180 --> 03:24:46.940
but I'm hoping if he goes on any future spaces,

03:24:46.940 --> 03:24:49.860
I can like haunt him from interview to interview,

03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:51.300
which is like, I keep showing up,

03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:52.980
and he's like, oh, I hate this guy.

03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:55.580
But I think he's already kind of probably

03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:02.740
has like PTSD of like, in the shadows lurks CoffeeZilla.

03:25:02.740 --> 03:25:04.580
That just would, that would just,

03:25:04.580 --> 03:25:07.260
it's just like, that really amuses me.

03:25:07.260 --> 03:25:08.100
I mean, there is,

03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:11.100
I think he honestly would enjoy talking to you.

03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:12.900
There's a aspect of Twitter spaces

03:25:12.900 --> 03:25:16.020
that's a little uncertain of like, what are we doing here?

03:25:16.020 --> 03:25:17.620
Because there's an urgency

03:25:17.620 --> 03:25:19.340
because other voices might want to butt in.

03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:20.180
Exactly, exactly.

03:25:20.180 --> 03:25:23.180
If it's an intimate one-on-one where you can like breathe,

03:25:23.180 --> 03:25:26.500
like hold on a second, I think it's much easier.

03:25:26.500 --> 03:25:29.860
So that sense Squarespace is a little bit negative

03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:33.580
that there's too many voices if,

03:25:33.580 --> 03:25:35.620
especially if it's a very controversial kind of thing.

03:25:35.620 --> 03:25:36.900
So it's tricky.

03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:38.940
But at the same time, the friction,

03:25:38.940 --> 03:25:40.700
it's so easy to just jump in.

03:25:42.540 --> 03:25:45.460
So I can just, I mean, I could,

03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:47.500
I mean, you just imagine like a Twitter space

03:25:47.500 --> 03:25:49.060
with like Zelensky and Putin.

03:25:50.020 --> 03:25:52.900
How else are these two going to talk, right?

03:25:52.900 --> 03:25:54.500
Like, can't you imagine?

03:25:54.500 --> 03:25:56.060
If you try to set it up on Zoom,

03:25:56.060 --> 03:25:56.900
like it's never happening.

03:25:56.900 --> 03:25:57.740
It's never happening.

03:25:57.740 --> 03:25:59.500
Too many delegates, like the only way it happens.

03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:01.580
Just imagine Putin like sitting there like.

03:26:01.580 --> 03:26:02.900
Zelensky's live.

03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:05.340
Just live, right, just jumping in.

03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:06.180
It's hilarious.

03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:09.380
Let's talk in Russian.

03:26:09.380 --> 03:26:12.540
Okay, actually just on a small tangent.

03:26:12.540 --> 03:26:14.460
So how do you have a productive day?

03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:15.300
Do you have any insights

03:26:15.300 --> 03:26:17.860
in how to manage your time optimally?

03:26:17.860 --> 03:26:19.980
Yeah, I mean, I've gone the gamut

03:26:19.980 --> 03:26:23.780
of from obsessive time tracking in 15 minute buckets

03:26:23.780 --> 03:26:27.140
to kind of like the other extreme

03:26:27.140 --> 03:26:32.140
where it's more kind of like large scale,

03:26:32.500 --> 03:26:35.220
some deep work here, two hour bucket,

03:26:35.220 --> 03:26:37.980
account for an hour of lunch and some other thing.

03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:41.700
But now I just roughly, because I manage a team

03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:44.700
and there's some things that kind of come up.

03:26:44.700 --> 03:26:45.540
It's only a team of two.

03:26:45.540 --> 03:26:47.100
It's not like big, but I just have things

03:26:47.100 --> 03:26:48.900
that are not necessarily controllable by me.

03:26:48.900 --> 03:26:50.940
I like have to take some meetings or whatever.

03:26:50.940 --> 03:26:53.380
It's not as easy to plan out my day ahead of time.

03:26:53.380 --> 03:26:56.580
So I do a lot of retrospective time management

03:26:56.580 --> 03:26:59.380
where I look at my day and that's what I mostly do now.

03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:02.380
And I account, did I spend this day productively?

03:27:02.380 --> 03:27:03.500
What could I do better?

03:27:03.500 --> 03:27:05.740
And then try to implement it in the future.

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:09.980
So a lot of this I realized is very personal for me.

03:27:09.980 --> 03:27:14.100
I do very well in long streaks of working.

03:27:14.100 --> 03:27:16.700
And if I can't do a lot of work in 15 minutes,

03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:19.060
I can't do a lot of work in even an hour.

03:27:19.060 --> 03:27:21.540
But if you give me like three hours or five hours

03:27:21.540 --> 03:27:23.660
or six hours of uninterrupted work,

03:27:23.660 --> 03:27:25.580
that's where I get most of my stuff done.

03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:28.500
So from the, it'd be fun to explore those.

03:27:28.500 --> 03:27:30.500
When you did 15 minute buckets,

03:27:30.500 --> 03:27:33.940
so you have a day in front of you

03:27:33.940 --> 03:27:35.020
and you have like a Google sheet

03:27:35.020 --> 03:27:36.140
or a spreadsheet or something.

03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:37.340
Yeah, I did an Excel.

03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:38.180
Excel.

03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:42.340
And you're, do you have a plan for the day

03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:44.220
or do you go like when you did it

03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:50.020
or you just literally sort of focus on a particular task

03:27:50.300 --> 03:27:52.580
and then you're tracking as you're doing that task

03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:53.620
of every 15 minutes?

03:27:53.620 --> 03:27:55.260
Yeah, I would kind of do it live.

03:27:56.340 --> 03:27:58.660
I'm not, so one of the reasons I'm so obsessive about it

03:27:58.660 --> 03:28:00.860
is because I'm not organized by nature.

03:28:00.860 --> 03:28:03.060
And I lost, like in college,

03:28:03.060 --> 03:28:06.740
I learned how much lack of organization

03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:09.860
can just hurt you in terms of output.

03:28:09.860 --> 03:28:12.620
And so I realized like I just had to build systems

03:28:12.620 --> 03:28:15.740
that would enable me to become more organized.

03:28:15.740 --> 03:28:20.820
So really I think that doing that

03:28:20.820 --> 03:28:23.180
really taught me a lot about time

03:28:23.180 --> 03:28:24.860
in the same way that tracking calories

03:28:24.860 --> 03:28:26.300
can teach you about food.

03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:29.020
Like just learning accounting for these things

03:28:29.020 --> 03:28:30.860
will give you skills that eventually

03:28:30.860 --> 03:28:33.220
you might not need to track on such a granular level

03:28:33.220 --> 03:28:35.300
because you've kind of like figured out.

03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:37.340
So that's kind of how I feel about it.

03:28:37.340 --> 03:28:38.540
I think everyone should,

03:28:38.540 --> 03:28:40.340
if you care about productivity and stuff,

03:28:40.340 --> 03:28:41.780
should do a little bit of it.

03:28:41.780 --> 03:28:43.860
I don't think it's sustainable in the long-term.

03:28:43.860 --> 03:28:46.060
It just takes so much effort and time to like,

03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:49.460
and I think the marginal effect of it in the long-term

03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:52.700
is kind of minimal once you learn these basic skills.

03:28:52.700 --> 03:28:56.580
But yeah, I was basically tracking like live what I did.

03:28:56.580 --> 03:29:01.500
And what I saw is that a lot of my real work

03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:04.140
would be done in small sections of the day.

03:29:04.140 --> 03:29:06.140
And then it'd be like a lot of just nothing,

03:29:06.140 --> 03:29:08.980
like a lot of small things where I'm busy,

03:29:08.980 --> 03:29:11.540
but little is being achieved.

03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:14.700
And so I think that's a really interesting insight.

03:29:14.700 --> 03:29:16.940
I've never figured out how to unbusy myself

03:29:16.940 --> 03:29:19.300
and focus on the like core essentials.

03:29:19.300 --> 03:29:21.060
I'm still getting to that,

03:29:21.060 --> 03:29:23.780
but it is interesting realizing most of your day

03:29:23.780 --> 03:29:26.820
is like a lot of nothing and then like some real deep work

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:29.700
where most of your value comes from is like 20% of your day.

03:29:29.700 --> 03:29:31.860
Yeah, I try to start every day with that.

03:29:31.860 --> 03:29:33.060
So the hardest task of the day

03:29:33.060 --> 03:29:34.900
and you focus for long periods of time.

03:29:34.900 --> 03:29:37.620
And I also have the segment of two hours

03:29:37.620 --> 03:29:40.100
where it's a set of tasks that I do every single day.

03:29:40.100 --> 03:29:43.180
The idea is you do that for like your whole life.

03:29:43.180 --> 03:29:45.780
It's like long-term investment of Anki

03:29:45.780 --> 03:29:50.780
and it's just like learning and reminding yourself of facts.

03:29:52.420 --> 03:29:54.660
You know, they're useful in your everyday life.

03:29:54.660 --> 03:29:56.300
And then for me, also music,

03:29:56.300 --> 03:29:57.420
I'll play a little bit of music.

03:29:57.420 --> 03:29:58.460
Play piano.

03:29:58.460 --> 03:29:59.300
Piano.

03:29:59.300 --> 03:30:01.020
And so like keeping that regular thing

03:30:01.020 --> 03:30:01.860
as part of your life.

03:30:01.860 --> 03:30:04.340
And one thing that I've really taken from this

03:30:04.340 --> 03:30:06.020
is because I've read all the like,

03:30:06.020 --> 03:30:08.780
I had a self-improvement phase in my early 20s.

03:30:10.380 --> 03:30:12.500
And one thing you learn is that everyone wants

03:30:12.500 --> 03:30:15.060
to give you a broad general solution,

03:30:15.060 --> 03:30:20.060
but really the real trick of figuring out like optimizing

03:30:20.660 --> 03:30:23.380
is figuring out the things that work for you specifically.

03:30:23.380 --> 03:30:25.700
So like one interesting thing you said is like,

03:30:25.700 --> 03:30:28.500
oh, I like to do my hard work at the beginning of the day.

03:30:29.900 --> 03:30:32.260
I know a lot of people recommend this.

03:30:32.260 --> 03:30:34.340
I've tried so many times

03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:37.300
and I just do better work late at night.

03:30:37.300 --> 03:30:38.860
And so usually my streak of work

03:30:38.860 --> 03:30:43.300
is like from like after dinner, 7.30 to like 2 a.m.

03:30:43.300 --> 03:30:45.060
That's my prime time.

03:30:46.140 --> 03:30:47.660
And so like a lot of my videos, which you'll see,

03:30:47.660 --> 03:30:49.780
which is like lit from this studio,

03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:50.700
which appears to be daytime.

03:30:50.700 --> 03:30:52.740
It's like shot at 3 a.m., you know,

03:30:52.740 --> 03:30:54.940
just like in a caffeine fueled rush.

03:30:55.860 --> 03:30:58.060
But that's kind of how it works for me.

03:30:58.060 --> 03:31:00.980
And then also like with the social outlets

03:31:00.980 --> 03:31:03.220
and stuff like that, which it's easy.

03:31:03.220 --> 03:31:05.980
And I know, I feel like we think similarly on this.

03:31:05.980 --> 03:31:07.900
So it's easy to discount these things

03:31:07.900 --> 03:31:09.700
as less relevant

03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:13.060
because they don't have quantitative metrics

03:31:13.060 --> 03:31:14.860
associated with them.

03:31:14.860 --> 03:31:17.780
But in terms of longevity and like,

03:31:17.780 --> 03:31:21.460
I think to be able to do creative work,

03:31:21.460 --> 03:31:25.100
there's an amount of recharge and like re-inputting stuff

03:31:25.100 --> 03:31:27.660
that is frequently discounted by people like us

03:31:27.660 --> 03:31:30.660
who are like obsessed with, you know, quantitative metrics.

03:31:30.660 --> 03:31:33.900
And so I really found that some of my best work gets done

03:31:33.900 --> 03:31:36.460
after I take like a break or like I'll go play

03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:39.380
like live sets of music.

03:31:39.380 --> 03:31:41.860
And I mean, like that's like for me really recharging,

03:31:41.860 --> 03:31:44.460
but nowhere on a spreadsheet is that gonna show up

03:31:44.460 --> 03:31:46.580
as productive or like meaningful.

03:31:46.580 --> 03:31:49.300
But for me, for whatever reason,

03:31:49.300 --> 03:31:51.060
it recharges me in a way that like,

03:31:51.060 --> 03:31:52.140
I need to pay attention to.

03:31:52.140 --> 03:31:52.980
Yeah, for sure.

03:31:52.980 --> 03:31:55.220
I usually have a spreadsheet at 15 minute increments

03:31:55.220 --> 03:31:57.140
when I'm socially interacting with people.

03:31:57.140 --> 03:31:58.500
And I evaluate how-

03:31:58.500 --> 03:31:59.700
I'm getting roasted right now.

03:31:59.700 --> 03:32:00.540
No, I'm not.

03:32:00.540 --> 03:32:04.020
It's actually, I probably roasting myself,

03:32:04.020 --> 03:32:08.180
but I do find that when I do have social interactions,

03:32:08.180 --> 03:32:11.140
I like to do with people that are in outside of that,

03:32:11.140 --> 03:32:13.860
exceptionally busy of themselves.

03:32:13.860 --> 03:32:16.620
Cause then you understand the value of time.

03:32:16.620 --> 03:32:18.580
And when you understand the value of time,

03:32:18.580 --> 03:32:22.660
your interaction becomes more intimate and intense.

03:32:22.660 --> 03:32:26.460
Like the cliche of work hard, party hard

03:32:26.460 --> 03:32:28.140
or whatever the cliche is.

03:32:28.140 --> 03:32:29.380
Play hard, damn it.

03:32:29.380 --> 03:32:30.620
Whatever the-

03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:32.300
Any more social interaction.

03:32:32.300 --> 03:32:33.140
No, I'm just kidding.

03:32:37.140 --> 03:32:39.540
That, I mean, that cliche, there's a truth to that,

03:32:39.540 --> 03:32:43.100
but the intensity of the social interaction,

03:32:43.100 --> 03:32:45.620
even like, you know, it's not even the intensity,

03:32:45.620 --> 03:32:46.740
it's not even the party hard.

03:32:46.740 --> 03:32:49.780
It's like, even if you're going hiking and relaxing

03:32:49.780 --> 03:32:52.100
and taking in nature, so it's very relaxed,

03:32:52.100 --> 03:32:53.700
but you understand the value of that.

03:32:53.700 --> 03:32:56.180
There's, when you put a huge amount of value

03:32:56.180 --> 03:32:58.900
on those moments spent in nature,

03:32:58.900 --> 03:33:01.300
that recharges me much more.

03:33:01.300 --> 03:33:02.700
So you have to surround yourself with people

03:33:02.700 --> 03:33:04.220
that think of life that way,

03:33:04.220 --> 03:33:06.700
that think about the value of every single moment.

03:33:06.700 --> 03:33:08.380
That's one of the things you do when you break it up

03:33:08.380 --> 03:33:10.260
in 15 minute increments,

03:33:10.260 --> 03:33:13.420
is you realize how much time there is in the day,

03:33:13.420 --> 03:33:15.220
how much awesomeness there is in the day

03:33:15.220 --> 03:33:17.260
to experience, to get done and so on.

03:33:17.260 --> 03:33:20.420
And then, so you can feel that when you're with somebody.

03:33:21.540 --> 03:33:24.660
And then for me personally, like when I interact with people,

03:33:24.660 --> 03:33:28.500
I really like to be fully present for the interaction.

03:33:29.060 --> 03:33:31.220
I can tell this is, for anyone who had,

03:33:32.340 --> 03:33:33.740
I've been the audience forever,

03:33:33.740 --> 03:33:36.020
so I haven't been on this side of the table before.

03:33:36.020 --> 03:33:36.860
You're very intense.

03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:38.980
You look right in the eye.

03:33:38.980 --> 03:33:39.980
I don't know about right in the eye.

03:33:39.980 --> 03:33:41.740
Eye contact is an issue, but yes, I'm there.

03:33:41.740 --> 03:33:43.540
Lex has a soulful gaze, guys,

03:33:43.540 --> 03:33:44.980
just in case you were wondering.

03:33:44.980 --> 03:33:47.100
It's very soulful, it's very comforting.

03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:48.900
It's like a warm hug.

03:33:48.900 --> 03:33:50.060
Back to serious talk.

03:33:50.060 --> 03:33:54.940
Okay, you've studied a lot of people who lie, who defraud,

03:33:55.940 --> 03:34:00.940
cheat and scam on a basic human level.

03:34:02.780 --> 03:34:06.060
How do you have trouble trusting human beings in your life?

03:34:07.900 --> 03:34:10.700
What's your relationship with trust of other humans?

03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:11.700
It's a great question.

03:34:11.700 --> 03:34:14.340
So funny enough, before I did this,

03:34:14.340 --> 03:34:16.700
I was like an incorrigible optimist.

03:34:18.420 --> 03:34:22.380
Everything, the sun shined, every which place.

03:34:23.380 --> 03:34:27.340
I always saw like everybody is fundamentally good.

03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:28.460
Nobody was bad.

03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:30.420
It just was like sort of wrong place, wrong time,

03:34:30.420 --> 03:34:31.260
bad incentives.

03:34:33.460 --> 03:34:36.140
That view has darkened significantly,

03:34:36.140 --> 03:34:40.460
but I just try to remember my sample set

03:34:40.460 --> 03:34:43.300
and just like I'm just sampling sort of the worst.

03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:48.260
And I try not to let it bleed into my day-to-day life.

03:34:48.260 --> 03:34:50.940
And I think it's probably because

03:34:50.940 --> 03:34:52.580
I was such an optimist early on

03:34:52.580 --> 03:34:55.940
that I've been able to kind of retain some of it.

03:34:55.940 --> 03:34:57.660
I call it enlightened optimism,

03:34:57.660 --> 03:35:00.300
like choosing to be optimistic in the face of

03:35:01.220 --> 03:35:04.100
a realistic sense of the problems in the world

03:35:04.100 --> 03:35:06.580
and with a realistic sense of like the scale

03:35:06.580 --> 03:35:08.180
and the challenge ahead.

03:35:10.220 --> 03:35:14.100
I actually think it's much braver to be an optimist

03:35:14.100 --> 03:35:16.380
when you're aware of what's going on in the world

03:35:16.380 --> 03:35:17.220
than to be a cynic.

03:35:17.220 --> 03:35:21.100
I think being a complete cynic is maybe,

03:35:21.100 --> 03:35:22.300
I'm not saying it's wrong,

03:35:22.300 --> 03:35:24.980
but I'm saying it's maybe the easier way

03:35:24.980 --> 03:35:29.340
just mentally to cope with so much negativity.

03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:31.540
It's like just saying, well, it's all bad.

03:35:31.540 --> 03:35:32.380
It's all doomed to fail.

03:35:32.380 --> 03:35:33.540
It's all gonna go bust.

03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:36.940
Is easier.

03:35:38.660 --> 03:35:42.220
Yeah, that leap into a believing that's a good world

03:35:42.220 --> 03:35:46.540
is a little baby act of courage.

03:35:47.540 --> 03:35:48.700
Or at least I think so.

03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:51.060
I don't think it's naive.

03:35:52.180 --> 03:35:53.540
No, it can be.

03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:55.100
Some people are naive that are optimistic,

03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:59.060
but oftentimes just because someone's optimistic

03:35:59.060 --> 03:35:59.980
does not mean they're naive.

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:03.580
They could be full well aware of how troubling the world is.

03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:07.700
And I also believe some of the people you study,

03:36:07.700 --> 03:36:09.900
I'm a big believer that all of us are capable

03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:10.940
of good and evil.

03:36:12.980 --> 03:36:14.980
So in some sense, the people you study

03:36:15.020 --> 03:36:17.860
are just the successful ones.

03:36:17.860 --> 03:36:22.740
The ones who chose sort of the dark path

03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:23.780
and were successful at it.

03:36:23.780 --> 03:36:26.580
And I think all of us can choose the dark path in life.

03:36:32.700 --> 03:36:34.380
That's the responsibility we all carry

03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:37.300
is we get to choose that at every moment.

03:36:37.300 --> 03:36:40.180
And it's like a big responsibility.

03:36:40.180 --> 03:36:42.380
And it's a chance to really have integrity.

03:36:42.380 --> 03:36:45.300
It's a chance to stand for something good in this world.

03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:47.300
And all of us have that because I think

03:36:47.300 --> 03:36:49.340
all of us are capable of evil.

03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:50.620
All of us could be good Germans.

03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:54.900
All of us could in atrocities be part of the atrocities.

03:36:55.940 --> 03:36:59.460
Yeah, I think it's, I really have,

03:36:59.460 --> 03:37:01.180
especially in recent years,

03:37:01.180 --> 03:37:05.420
tried to somewhat depersonalize my work

03:37:05.420 --> 03:37:10.420
and see it almost like as like a, I don't know,

03:37:11.420 --> 03:37:13.660
like a force of nature that I'm fighting

03:37:13.660 --> 03:37:15.940
more than like individuals.

03:37:15.940 --> 03:37:17.220
Because of this exact thing,

03:37:17.220 --> 03:37:19.300
I think like sort of therefore,

03:37:19.300 --> 03:37:20.700
but the grace of God there go I

03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:24.980
is kind of a really profound way to understand yourself

03:37:24.980 --> 03:37:27.900
rather than it's just like fundamentally good

03:37:27.900 --> 03:37:30.500
and like full of integrity.

03:37:30.500 --> 03:37:32.140
Acknowledging that so much of that

03:37:32.140 --> 03:37:34.500
is a product of your environment and your family

03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:36.140
and your upbringing.

03:37:36.140 --> 03:37:38.460
And so much of the people who don't have that

03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.860
is a product of their environment.

03:37:40.860 --> 03:37:42.700
It doesn't absolve them,

03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:44.780
but it gives you more perspective

03:37:46.340 --> 03:37:49.980
to sort of deal fairly, if that makes sense,

03:37:49.980 --> 03:37:52.340
and not approach it from a place of anger

03:37:52.340 --> 03:37:54.580
or a place of outrage.

03:37:54.580 --> 03:37:57.020
There is a sense of like sadness for the victims.

03:37:57.020 --> 03:37:59.140
There's a sense of outrage for the victims,

03:37:59.140 --> 03:38:02.500
but approach the individual who's done the thing

03:38:03.620 --> 03:38:06.540
from that place of understanding

03:38:07.020 --> 03:38:08.580
this isn't just this person.

03:38:08.580 --> 03:38:11.620
There's like a whole broader thing going on here.

03:38:11.620 --> 03:38:13.580
Do you have advice for young people

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:16.500
of how to live this life?

03:38:16.500 --> 03:38:18.980
How to have a career they can be proud of?

03:38:18.980 --> 03:38:20.620
So high school students, college students,

03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:22.580
or maybe a life they can be proud of?

03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:24.540
That's a great question.

03:38:24.540 --> 03:38:26.180
Well, let me think about this for a second.

03:38:31.300 --> 03:38:36.300
I think don't be afraid to go against the grain

03:38:36.540 --> 03:38:41.540
and sort of challenge the expectations on you.

03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:46.220
Like you sort of have to do this weird thing

03:38:46.220 --> 03:38:48.780
where you acknowledge how difficult it will be

03:38:48.780 --> 03:38:49.940
to achieve something great

03:38:49.940 --> 03:38:53.580
while also having the courage to go for it anyways.

03:38:53.580 --> 03:38:56.020
And understanding that other people

03:38:56.020 --> 03:38:57.260
don't have it figured out, I think,

03:38:57.260 --> 03:38:59.260
is a big theme of my work,

03:38:59.260 --> 03:39:02.380
which is that everyone wants like the guru

03:39:02.380 --> 03:39:05.100
to show them the way, to show them the secrets.

03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:07.540
So much of life and achieving anything

03:39:07.540 --> 03:39:09.860
is learning to figure it out yourself

03:39:09.860 --> 03:39:14.140
and like the meta skill of being an autodidactic

03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:15.940
where you can, I don't know if I said that word right,

03:39:15.940 --> 03:39:17.260
you basically use self-teach.

03:39:17.260 --> 03:39:20.620
You learn the meta skill of like learning to learn.

03:39:20.620 --> 03:39:23.540
I think that's such an underrated aspect of education.

03:39:23.540 --> 03:39:24.380
People leave education, they go,

03:39:24.380 --> 03:39:26.220
when am I gonna use two plus two?

03:39:26.220 --> 03:39:28.580
When am I gonna learn, you know, use calculus?

03:39:28.580 --> 03:39:30.700
But so much of it is learning this higher level

03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:33.980
abstract thinking that can apply to anything.

03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:38.980
And getting that early on is incredibly powerful.

03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:44.780
So yeah, I would say like a lot of it is,

03:39:45.700 --> 03:39:47.100
is I guess to some extent,

03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:48.940
like you kind of have to do that Steve Jobs thing

03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:50.940
where you realize that nobody else

03:39:50.940 --> 03:39:52.980
in the world is smarter than you.

03:39:52.980 --> 03:39:55.100
And that both means that like,

03:39:55.100 --> 03:39:56.420
they can't show you the perfect way,

03:39:56.420 --> 03:39:58.260
but it also means you could do great things

03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:00.220
and kind of chart your own path, I don't know.

03:40:00.220 --> 03:40:01.300
That's so cheesy.

03:40:01.300 --> 03:40:03.140
This is why I hate giving advice.

03:40:03.980 --> 03:40:05.660
I mean, and I don't think it is.

03:40:05.660 --> 03:40:08.820
I think my journey is so full of luck

03:40:08.820 --> 03:40:10.860
and like specific experience.

03:40:10.860 --> 03:40:12.580
I wonder how generalizable it is.

03:40:12.580 --> 03:40:14.860
But if I've learned anything,

03:40:14.860 --> 03:40:17.180
and if I could talk specifically to myself,

03:40:17.180 --> 03:40:18.260
I guess that's what I would say.

03:40:18.260 --> 03:40:21.580
I mean, you've taken a very difficult path.

03:40:21.580 --> 03:40:23.460
And I think part of taking that path,

03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:25.980
like of a great journalist, frankly,

03:40:25.980 --> 03:40:30.080
is like, I can be that person.

03:40:31.340 --> 03:40:32.540
Like just believing in yourself

03:40:32.540 --> 03:40:33.620
that you can take that.

03:40:33.620 --> 03:40:37.340
Cause like, if you see a problem in the world,

03:40:38.740 --> 03:40:40.980
you could be the solution to that problem.

03:40:40.980 --> 03:40:42.580
Like you can solve that problem.

03:40:42.580 --> 03:40:43.460
I think that's like,

03:40:43.460 --> 03:40:47.340
it's really important to believe that it depends.

03:40:47.340 --> 03:40:50.860
Maybe you're lucky to have the belief inside yourself.

03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:54.100
Maybe the thing that you're saying is like,

03:40:54.100 --> 03:40:56.740
don't look to others for that strength.

03:40:56.740 --> 03:40:59.540
And also, and also like be really comfortable failing.

03:40:59.540 --> 03:41:02.580
I think one of the best things

03:41:02.580 --> 03:41:05.100
that like you would never know about me,

03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:08.180
just looking at my background that helped me

03:41:08.180 --> 03:41:11.360
was playing music live.

03:41:12.300 --> 03:41:17.300
I had incredible amounts of stage fright growing up,

03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:19.220
mostly because I was terrible at piano.

03:41:19.220 --> 03:41:20.580
I was like sucked.

03:41:20.580 --> 03:41:23.140
And I specifically, I taught myself how to play

03:41:23.140 --> 03:41:25.940
and I joined jazz band in like high school,

03:41:25.940 --> 03:41:27.220
did it through college.

03:41:27.260 --> 03:41:29.780
I remember all my recitals,

03:41:29.780 --> 03:41:32.340
I messed up every single solo I ever did.

03:41:32.340 --> 03:41:34.660
I never like actually nailed it.

03:41:34.660 --> 03:41:35.660
And every time I'd go up there,

03:41:35.660 --> 03:41:38.420
I like have so much dread around this.

03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:41.340
And it was easier to get up there

03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:43.140
cause there were sort of some people up there.

03:41:43.140 --> 03:41:45.660
But eventually I started like playing live too

03:41:45.660 --> 03:41:47.340
and I sucked at that.

03:41:47.340 --> 03:41:49.060
And I've just gone through the trenches of like,

03:41:49.060 --> 03:41:54.060
just like being publicly sort of in my mind humiliated,

03:41:54.340 --> 03:41:58.380
like that prepared me so much for what I do now

03:41:58.380 --> 03:42:02.460
of trying to basically being fearless of failure

03:42:02.460 --> 03:42:05.140
in the face of like a wide audience.

03:42:05.140 --> 03:42:06.460
I don't have that anymore

03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:09.900
cause kind of I've experienced so many iterations of it

03:42:09.900 --> 03:42:12.980
at a smaller scale of just like abject public humiliation

03:42:12.980 --> 03:42:14.780
to where it's like not something that bothers me.

03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:16.100
I have no stage fright.

03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:17.660
That doesn't bother me anymore.

03:42:17.660 --> 03:42:19.740
But you'd think like, oh,

03:42:19.740 --> 03:42:20.980
maybe he just was always good at this.

03:42:20.980 --> 03:42:21.900
I was terrible at it.

03:42:21.900 --> 03:42:25.420
I had a complete phobia about public anything.

03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:30.340
So it was that rapid iteration of just failure.

03:42:30.340 --> 03:42:31.980
And eventually I just like came to the conclusion of like,

03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:33.060
I wanna love it.

03:42:33.060 --> 03:42:36.500
I wanna like love like getting up on a stage and bombing.

03:42:36.500 --> 03:42:40.340
If you can learn to like love that and be fearless there,

03:42:40.340 --> 03:42:42.900
there's almost nothing you can't do.

03:42:42.900 --> 03:42:44.420
Yeah, that's brilliant advice.

03:42:44.420 --> 03:42:45.260
I'm with you.

03:42:45.260 --> 03:42:48.060
It's still terrifying to me, like live performance.

03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:49.980
But yeah, that's exactly the feeling

03:42:50.420 --> 03:42:54.100
is loving the fact that you tried.

03:42:54.100 --> 03:42:58.820
And somehow failure is like a deeper celebration

03:42:58.820 --> 03:43:00.580
of the fact that you tried.

03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:04.860
Cause success is easy, but like failure is like bombing.

03:43:04.860 --> 03:43:06.740
I mean, music, yeah.

03:43:06.740 --> 03:43:10.700
On small scale, on the smallest and the largest of stages,

03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:14.580
I'm not gonna say who, but there's a huge band,

03:43:14.580 --> 03:43:18.060
huge band that wanted to be on stage.

03:43:18.100 --> 03:43:21.540
And it probably will happen.

03:43:21.540 --> 03:43:26.540
But like, but I turned it down because I was like, no.

03:43:27.140 --> 03:43:28.740
Cause I'm gonna suck for sure.

03:43:28.740 --> 03:43:32.260
So the question is, do I wanna suck

03:43:32.260 --> 03:43:35.700
in front of a very large live audience?

03:43:35.700 --> 03:43:36.540
Yeah.

03:43:36.540 --> 03:43:40.940
And then I turned it down and I was like, no, no, no, no.

03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:43.900
But now I realize, yes.

03:43:43.900 --> 03:43:44.740
Embrace it.

03:43:44.740 --> 03:43:45.700
It's gonna be good.

03:43:45.700 --> 03:43:46.940
It's gonna be good for you.

03:43:46.940 --> 03:43:50.300
It's gonna crush your ego to the degree it's remaining.

03:43:50.300 --> 03:43:51.260
And it's just good for you.

03:43:51.260 --> 03:43:53.020
It's good not to take yourself seriously

03:43:53.020 --> 03:43:54.300
and do those kinds of things.

03:43:54.300 --> 03:43:58.100
But honestly, I feel that way in an audience,

03:43:58.100 --> 03:44:01.540
like in an open mic, it hurts.

03:44:01.540 --> 03:44:03.180
That's why I really admire comedians.

03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:06.900
And like I go to open mics all the time

03:44:06.900 --> 03:44:10.500
with comedians and musicians, and I just see them bomb

03:44:10.500 --> 03:44:13.620
and play in front of like just a few folks

03:44:13.620 --> 03:44:15.340
and they're putting their heart out.

03:44:15.740 --> 03:44:17.500
Especially the ones that kind of suck,

03:44:17.500 --> 03:44:19.740
but are going all out anyway.

03:44:19.740 --> 03:44:22.780
I think open mics are the best place to learn though,

03:44:22.780 --> 03:44:25.220
because it's the lowest stakes you can get

03:44:25.220 --> 03:44:26.820
while still being public.

03:44:26.820 --> 03:44:29.140
If you're gonna face like fears around this,

03:44:29.140 --> 03:44:31.660
cause we're talking very specifically like public speaking

03:44:31.660 --> 03:44:34.340
or any kind of like being in front of a camera.

03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:37.140
If you're gonna face your fear, you have to do it.

03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:39.300
And the easiest way to do it is to lower the stakes.

03:44:39.300 --> 03:44:41.140
You're not gonna start being Lex Friedman

03:44:41.140 --> 03:44:42.180
on stage with a huge band.

03:44:42.180 --> 03:44:43.140
You don't wanna be.

03:44:43.140 --> 03:44:46.140
Like it's like in that way, it is so impossible,

03:44:47.580 --> 03:44:48.980
but the more you lower the stakes

03:44:48.980 --> 03:44:51.140
and just like open it up to like two strangers,

03:44:51.140 --> 03:44:54.260
five strangers, like the most dive bar open mic

03:44:54.260 --> 03:44:57.300
you can go to and like start performing.

03:44:57.300 --> 03:44:59.220
That's really what I did is like,

03:44:59.220 --> 03:45:00.740
like I love open mics now,

03:45:00.740 --> 03:45:03.180
cause it's like low stakes on the one hand,

03:45:03.180 --> 03:45:06.820
but you really get the feeling of like going for it.

03:45:06.820 --> 03:45:08.300
And get better and better and better at that.

03:45:08.300 --> 03:45:09.140
Yeah, for sure.

03:45:10.060 --> 03:45:12.620
And then you'll get the strength

03:45:12.620 --> 03:45:14.820
to take bigger and bigger and bigger risks.

03:45:14.820 --> 03:45:17.500
Listen, Kofi, I'm a huge fan of yours,

03:45:17.500 --> 03:45:21.540
not just for who you are, but for what you stand for.

03:45:21.540 --> 03:45:25.900
People like you are rare and they're a huge inspiration.

03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:29.100
I just, I'm inspired by your fearlessness

03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:32.980
that you're taking on some of the most powerful

03:45:32.980 --> 03:45:35.340
and richest people in this world and doing so

03:45:35.340 --> 03:45:37.780
with respect, I think, with good faith,

03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:40.460
but also with the boldness and fearlessness.

03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:42.060
Listen, man, I'm a huge fan.

03:45:42.060 --> 03:45:43.500
Keep doing what you're doing

03:45:43.500 --> 03:45:45.140
as long as you got the strength for it,

03:45:45.140 --> 03:45:46.540
cause I think you inspire all of us.

03:45:46.540 --> 03:45:48.020
You're doing important work, brother.

03:45:48.020 --> 03:45:49.740
Thanks for having me.

03:45:49.740 --> 03:45:52.460
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kofi Zilla.

03:45:55.980 --> 03:45:59.940
And now let me leave you with some words from Walter Lippmann.

03:45:59.940 --> 03:46:02.620
There can be no higher law in journalism

03:46:02.620 --> 03:46:05.780
than to tell the truth and to shame the devil.

03:46:05.780 --> 03:46:09.620
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
