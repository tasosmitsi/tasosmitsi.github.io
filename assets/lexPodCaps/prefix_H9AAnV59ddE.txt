00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
Blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls 6 is coming out.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.520
But are not going to tell me.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.760
The following is a conversation with Todd Howard, one of the greatest video game designers

00:12.760 --> 00:13.760
of all time.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.720
He has led the development of the Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls series, including

00:19.720 --> 00:27.640
Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and the future Elder Scrolls 6, and a totally

00:27.640 --> 00:31.680
new world in an upcoming game called Starfield.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.120
Many of these have won Game of the Year awards and have been some of the most celebrated

00:36.120 --> 00:38.740
and impactful games ever made.

00:38.740 --> 00:45.680
To me, Skyrim is quite possibly the greatest game ever.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.440
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.840
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:50.840 --> 00:55.360
And now, dear friends, here's Todd Howard.

00:55.360 --> 01:01.640
Is it possible that we are currently living inside a video game that the future you designed,

01:01.640 --> 01:07.240
can you give hints as to how one would escape if this was a video game?

01:07.240 --> 01:12.440
How can a video game character escape to outside the video game?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.760
Are these things you don't consider when you design the game?

01:14.760 --> 01:16.520
Actually, we do.

01:16.520 --> 01:21.360
Because in the kind of games that we make, we want it to be as open as possible.

01:21.360 --> 01:26.300
So when you start a game, you're always testing it.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.300
What can I do?

01:27.300 --> 01:28.560
What would the game allow me to do?

01:28.560 --> 01:29.560
And you check everything.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.600
You try to pick up the mugs.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.120
You try every door.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
You collide with everything.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.400
Like, hey, what are the rules of this world?

01:37.400 --> 01:41.760
We try to do games where we say yes as much as possible.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.200
That leads to some level of chaos.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.640
But if you were stuck in a video game, you would try everything.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.200
And usually, you're going to find a door or a space where the designers didn't anticipate

01:54.200 --> 01:58.920
you piling all those crates up and getting over a wall that they didn't expect.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
Right.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.160
So it's not a designed doorway out.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.640
It's an accidental, unintended doorway out.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.000
And it's a happy bug.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
You could like Truman Show.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Just get in the ocean and go.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Just keep going.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Right.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Right.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.360
But the more realistic the game becomes, the harder it is to find that door.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.960
The bigger the world, the bigger the open world.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.160
And then as we do it, we learn they're going to find a way.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.760
So just don't try to pen them in.

02:29.760 --> 02:36.800
Usually, we leave like this developer test cell area in the game that we don't anticipate

02:36.800 --> 02:39.080
anyone will find.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.640
And they ultimately find it.

02:40.640 --> 02:46.160
It usually has crates of all the weapons in the game and things like that.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.840
The little hints you drop now will just drive people mad, which is something I enjoy deeply.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.880
So Skyrim NPCs have at times hilarious dialogue.

02:55.880 --> 03:01.080
What does it take to build a good NPC dialogue?

03:01.080 --> 03:05.000
The main thing is to make them reactive.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.560
A lot of times when you write characters for movies or things like that, you want to make

03:08.560 --> 03:12.800
that character interesting for themselves, right?

03:12.800 --> 03:15.000
What's their story?

03:15.000 --> 03:20.440
And there's some characters like that that the player definitely cares about, but the

03:20.440 --> 03:25.160
best characters are the ones that react to you.

03:25.160 --> 03:31.360
So you'll find a lot of people love our guards, and the guards are written almost purely to

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
be reactive.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.440
Hey, nice tie, I like your jacket, do this cool watch, you know, hey, what'd you do?

03:37.440 --> 03:43.080
And so that, hey, you're the man as you walk by, that makes them interesting.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.280
Or the way they react to something that you do.

03:46.280 --> 03:51.480
Lydia in Skyrim, who everybody loves, I'm sworn to carry your burdens.

03:51.480 --> 03:56.520
That's a generic line that all of the House Carls have.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.440
And it just kind of lands when she says it.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.960
Why does it land?

04:01.960 --> 04:03.440
And did you anticipate it would land?

04:03.440 --> 04:10.000
There's a slight snarkiness in that particular read of it, and you're asking her to do something

04:10.320 --> 04:14.600
and she's reacting to you.

04:14.600 --> 04:23.960
What about the trade-off between maybe the randomness and the scripted nature of the

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
dialogue?

04:24.960 --> 04:28.600
Like, is there any room for randomness of the dialogue tree?

04:28.600 --> 04:29.840
Oh, absolutely.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.840
We tend to write them in stacks with, you know, it's a very small, think of it as a

04:34.840 --> 04:40.680
small state machine that just says, okay, this is what's happening.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.800
Here's a random list of things I could say to that.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.360
And then some of that plays out in ways you don't anticipate.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.000
But we look at the things, what are the players doing that we could have the characters respond

04:54.000 --> 04:55.280
to that they don't expect?

04:55.280 --> 05:01.680
You know, jumping on tables or stealing stuff or, you know, sneaking in in the middle of

05:01.680 --> 05:02.960
the night or those kinds of things.

05:02.960 --> 05:11.960
The more of that we can do, the more reactive and interesting the characters appear.

05:11.960 --> 05:16.080
And these state machines, how big are these things?

05:16.080 --> 05:19.040
Are these individual to the individual characters?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.800
That's just fascinating how you design state machines.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
Is it just a giant database?

05:23.800 --> 05:31.120
I would think of the AI as one big one, yeah, for sort of everybody.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.140
So there's an AI.

05:33.140 --> 05:41.720
There's a manager for all the people and one of the things that makes what we do particularly

05:41.720 --> 05:48.280
unique is, and this is a trade off for what people are seeing because a lot of it's not

05:48.280 --> 05:53.440
on the screen, but we're using cycles to run this, which is we're thinking about everybody

05:53.440 --> 05:56.880
in the whole world all the time.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.800
The ones that are further away at a much less tick rate, they go into low.

06:00.800 --> 06:06.520
But we know if they want to walk across the world and we're running every quest at the

06:06.520 --> 06:11.880
same time, whereas in other open world games, you start an activity, the rest of the world's

06:11.880 --> 06:18.840
going to shut down so that they can really make that as impactful.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.560
I really prefer that the rest of it's going on.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.100
It's more of a simulation that we're building.

06:25.100 --> 06:31.860
So when those things collide, that's where it gets the most interesting.

06:31.860 --> 06:35.900
And so we're running all of those people and understanding where they want to go in their

06:35.900 --> 06:37.340
cycles and what they want to do.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.060
And the ones that are closer to you, we just update a lot more.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.700
It's one way to think about it.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.980
I mean, that's really fascinating.

06:43.980 --> 06:50.500
That's something that people had, they were wondering about to what degree it's possible

06:50.500 --> 06:53.140
to run the world without you.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.380
So there is a feeling to role playing games that you're the central, you're at the center

06:57.380 --> 07:01.780
of the world and the whole world rotates around you as it does in normal life.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.540
Like when we walk around, when you forget yourself, you start to take yourself very

07:07.540 --> 07:08.540
seriously.

07:08.540 --> 07:09.540
Like you are the center of the world.

07:09.540 --> 07:14.020
You forget that there's 8 billion people on earth and you forget that they have lives.

07:14.020 --> 07:18.500
That's actually a sobering realization that they all have really interesting life stories

07:18.500 --> 07:25.380
and they have their worries, they suffer in different complicated ways.

07:25.380 --> 07:31.340
And yet when you play a role playing game, there's a, I mean, both computationally and

07:31.340 --> 07:35.980
from a storytelling perspective, you wonder if the world goes on without you.

07:35.980 --> 07:40.180
Like if you come back, if you take a break and you come back, is there still a bustling

07:40.180 --> 07:44.500
town that now has a history since you have last visited?

07:44.940 --> 07:50.500
So to what degree can you create a world that goes on without you or goes on at the same

07:50.500 --> 07:53.580
time as you do your thing, whatever the heck you're doing?

07:53.580 --> 07:55.900
We don't prioritize the stuff you can't see.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.100
So it's more like an amusement park.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.060
If you study like the design or level designers did this, how do they build Disney world in

08:02.060 --> 08:03.060
these places?

08:03.060 --> 08:07.040
So it still exists for you, the player.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.420
So it is fairly, you know, when you're going to come in, this is what you're going to see.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.820
The shops are in the front.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.520
You're going to do this.

08:13.520 --> 08:22.320
It's just for us to make it far more believable and get some more emergent behavior that not

08:22.320 --> 08:28.980
just make it sort of the verisimilitude of what you're in for that moment, but you buy

08:28.980 --> 08:29.980
it all.

08:29.980 --> 08:35.400
I always say like, you know, we got to do the little things so that you buy the reality

08:35.400 --> 08:36.800
of the virtual world you're in.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.340
So we want to do something crazy, you know, when a dragon lands or a death law comes out

08:41.340 --> 08:47.320
of the wasteland or those kind of things that you it has the impact to you as the viewer

08:47.320 --> 08:50.340
that it would to the people in the world.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.340
Okay.

08:52.340 --> 08:55.360
But still you are simulating stuff that's close to you.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.340
It is a bit of a simulation going on.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.340
Oh, absolutely.

08:58.340 --> 08:59.340
Yes.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.260
And so that creates some interesting dynamics then.

09:02.260 --> 09:06.040
And the stuff that we're looking at in the future, you know, our plan is to push that

09:06.040 --> 09:07.680
even more.

09:07.680 --> 09:16.560
To think about how these things exist in the world first, and we do some of this, but even

09:16.560 --> 09:20.000
more so in the future to say, how do these things exist?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.980
Take like a faction in the world.

09:21.980 --> 09:24.280
What is their role in the world?

09:24.280 --> 09:28.880
As opposed to just their role is for the player to join it, go through a bunch of quests and

09:28.880 --> 09:31.000
become the head of the faction.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.200
You know, think a little bit deeper about the simulation and what would the Mages Guild

09:35.360 --> 09:42.960
be doing in a fantasy world or the Fighters Guild be doing in a fantasy world versus just

09:42.960 --> 09:46.760
sign up, do quests, get gold.

09:46.760 --> 09:52.560
And so that when you show up to that Mages Guild, it's a bustling guild full of stuff

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
going on.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.460
It's not just that it's bustling is that they feel rooted in it.

09:56.460 --> 10:02.620
They don't feel like a storefront for come here, do quests, get experience.

10:02.620 --> 10:06.900
Is that one of the essential components of randomly generated worlds?

10:06.900 --> 10:14.260
So when I think back to Daggerfall as gigantic world, when I first played it, I thought like,

10:14.260 --> 10:19.820
I mean, you're just struck by the immensity of it.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.820
The immensity of the possibility.

10:20.820 --> 10:25.860
When you're young and you look into your future, it's wide open.

10:25.860 --> 10:26.860
You can do anything.

10:26.860 --> 10:31.460
And that's what Daggerfall felt like, the openness was gigantic.

10:31.460 --> 10:38.340
And Daggerfall is interesting coming off Arena where Arena does the same thing, but

10:38.340 --> 10:46.820
Daggerfall in many ways is bigger despite focusing on an area because of how the density

10:46.820 --> 10:52.420
of, okay, this is how much physical game space will do for these villages and towns.

10:52.420 --> 10:59.220
And it does feel endless even though you're looking at a map that has constraints.

10:59.220 --> 11:07.620
Daggerfall actually was a touchstone for us going into Starfield for how we do the planets

11:07.620 --> 11:14.460
because there's a different kind of gameplay experience when you just wander outside a

11:14.460 --> 11:17.660
city in Daggerfall.

11:17.660 --> 11:23.040
Then follow a quest line and go through, go to this place and it's completely handcrafted

11:23.040 --> 11:27.460
and everything around every corner we've kind of placed like Skyrim.

11:27.460 --> 11:32.700
Starfield's a bit more like Daggerfall and if you wander outside the city, we're going

11:32.700 --> 11:36.940
to be generating things and you kind of get used to that game flow, different than we've

11:36.940 --> 11:42.380
done before and fun in a different kind of way.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.020
We'll talk about Starfield.

11:44.020 --> 11:49.700
Just for people who don't know, and how dare you for not knowing, but with Daggerfall we're

11:49.700 --> 11:54.500
talking about the Elder Scrolls series that started talking about the big titles within

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
the series.

11:55.540 --> 12:01.180
So with Arena in 94, Daggerfall in 96, I didn't look up the years before this, this is depressing

12:01.180 --> 12:04.540
or awesome.

12:04.540 --> 12:11.020
So all of these games brought hundreds, probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy

12:11.020 --> 12:12.020
for me.

12:12.020 --> 12:18.320
So Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.940
So I don't remember Arena being that open world.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.500
Well it's all the provinces.

12:23.500 --> 12:28.260
It follows kind of the same pattern, it just doesn't have all the number of villages and

12:28.260 --> 12:34.740
places that Daggerfall has while Daggerfall focuses on the Iliac Bay area.

12:34.740 --> 12:39.820
Arena does it all, it just changes the scale in terms of one block on the map equals this

12:39.820 --> 12:40.820
much space.

12:40.820 --> 12:45.140
There is something that, I mean I'm speaking to anecdotal experience, but I just remember

12:45.140 --> 12:48.420
it feeling wide open, Daggerfall.

12:48.420 --> 12:49.420
It definitely was, yes.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.020
In the way Arena didn't.

12:51.020 --> 12:59.340
I don't remember, maybe because Arena, it was so cool to have just the role playing

12:59.340 --> 13:04.540
game aspect, you're focused on the items and the character development.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.500
Daggerfall has a lot more depth, particularly in the character system.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.020
That's what it introduces, all of the skills and those kind of things.

13:12.020 --> 13:19.420
Arena is actually, it's a game I love and it's very, very elegant if you look at the

13:19.460 --> 13:23.740
first one where it's just an XP based system, do this, get XP, level up.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.980
Very classic role playing game.

13:26.980 --> 13:30.380
Daggerfall digs deep into who's your character, how are you going to develop it, what are

13:30.380 --> 13:34.220
your skills, there's advantages, there's disadvantages.

13:34.220 --> 13:39.540
The environment going full 3D from Arena, which is actually like a two and a half D

13:39.540 --> 13:48.540
Doom style engine, I agree with you that Daggerfall feels like there's more possibilities when

13:48.660 --> 13:49.660
playing it.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.060
Were you able to look up to the sky in Daggerfall?

13:52.060 --> 13:54.420
Yep, it's full 3D.

13:54.420 --> 13:58.220
So that's what full 3D means, and then you can go outside the city?

13:58.220 --> 13:59.220
You can walk outside the city.

13:59.220 --> 14:01.460
You can do that in Arena too, but it looks more fakie, right?

14:01.460 --> 14:06.220
It's all going to be a flat plane, here comes things, and then a dungeon entrance is 8 bit,

14:06.220 --> 14:09.220
here comes a little flat coming at the camera.

14:09.220 --> 14:17.860
So before we go to the end, in the middle, so from Starfield to Fallout and the Elder

14:17.860 --> 14:21.300
Scrolls series, let's go to the very beginning, what's the origin story?

14:21.300 --> 14:27.100
You know what, let's even go before then, when's the first time you remember the thing

14:27.100 --> 14:30.140
that made you fall in love with video games?

14:30.140 --> 14:38.140
Well, I think it's partly my age coming up with the arcades and playing Space Invaders

14:38.140 --> 14:43.940
at the pizza place, and then Pac-Man really, it's interesting about video games and what

14:44.180 --> 14:50.420
Pac-Man did for video games, where it popularized them in a way that was just insane at the

14:50.420 --> 14:55.420
time, had a song, had a cartoon, had all of the things, Nintendo comes along, so it was

14:55.420 --> 15:01.380
always part of, you know, I think if you were a kid growing up then, it was such a newness

15:01.380 --> 15:03.020
to playing things like that.

15:03.020 --> 15:08.580
I remember being in 5th grade when the TRS-80 was brought into the classroom and there was

15:08.580 --> 15:15.260
a Star Trek game, and I was enamored with it, and they were going to start teaching

15:15.260 --> 15:20.860
some rudimentary programming, like, okay, would you like to know how this is made?

15:20.860 --> 15:21.860
And I was hooked.

15:21.860 --> 15:25.940
I was like, I need to figure out how to make this stuff.

15:25.940 --> 15:34.820
And so I was a self-taught programmer, and my whole goal was to write my own video games.

15:34.820 --> 15:44.980
And by 6th, 7th grade, I had written my own much better Star Trek clone, Apple II.

15:44.980 --> 15:51.480
And I really enjoyed programming on the Apple II then, and that I think was the right level

15:51.480 --> 15:57.100
of complexity at that age where you could kind of, you were always learning, but you

15:57.100 --> 16:01.140
could still understand a lot of the problem set for like, this is what I want to get on

16:01.140 --> 16:02.860
the screen.

16:02.860 --> 16:07.420
And I was also into art, so I did a lot of art, and I did a lot of programming, and I

16:07.420 --> 16:09.380
was always making games.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.260
That was my hobby from the time I was 10 or 12.

16:13.260 --> 16:16.380
What was, to you, involved in making games?

16:16.380 --> 16:17.380
How did you think of it?

16:17.380 --> 16:21.680
Was it from a graphics perspective, like what shows up on screen?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.180
Was it how it makes you feel?

16:23.180 --> 16:24.360
Was it about the story?

16:24.360 --> 16:31.020
Was it the text-based stuff and the dialogue and the prompting?

16:31.020 --> 16:34.380
What does it mean to create a video game at that young age, to you?

16:34.380 --> 16:40.900
Well, it was a way of experiencing things that I couldn't myself.

16:40.900 --> 16:49.260
So if you're playing Dungeons and Dragons at the time, too, where you really feel, even

16:49.260 --> 16:55.580
pen and paper, they feel somewhat, in quotes, real to you as you're playing them.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.360
You're very invested in your character and what you're doing.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.380
I love the games, The Wizardry and Ultima, that were able to bring that to a computer

17:03.380 --> 17:05.800
so I could do it on my own time.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.240
It was very, very real to me.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.880
I'd sit in my bedroom and then go to bed and think about it, and then, oh no, I have to

17:11.880 --> 17:12.880
go to school.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.520
I want to come home and figure out how to do this problem in the game.

17:16.520 --> 17:22.080
And so whatever I was creating was something that I was excited about at the time.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.960
I made Raiders of the Lost Ark games.

17:25.960 --> 17:26.960
Like with graphics and everything?

17:27.560 --> 17:34.000
So it was usually made a Miami Vice game, made a Gru the Wanderer game, made a Traveler game.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.680
But every time I was doing it, I wanted to figure out a new method on the Apple II of

17:39.680 --> 17:44.640
pulling it off graphically, whether that was editing character sets to get graphics in

17:44.640 --> 17:52.840
different formats, or how can I enable the secret double high-res mode it had, or just

17:53.000 --> 17:57.520
things like that where it became kind of this limitless, what can I make this do?

17:57.520 --> 18:01.320
And I had some friends who were doing the same thing, and then you get into who can

18:01.320 --> 18:02.840
impress each other.

18:02.840 --> 18:08.080
And I was kind of middle of the pack, I would say.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.400
But again, this was the time where they're bringing computers into the school and the

18:11.400 --> 18:16.600
Apples come into the school and the teachers are learning it because they have to teach

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
the students.

18:17.720 --> 18:23.960
I would say I was part of a group of students that were way past that.

18:23.960 --> 18:29.280
And it was very much of a self-taught, how do you make this thing dance?

18:29.280 --> 18:32.160
I'd like to ask a strange question.

18:32.160 --> 18:39.680
So at that time, a lot of people considered you one of, if not the greatest game designer,

18:39.680 --> 18:41.600
creator of all time.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.600
You were middle of the pack then.

18:44.560 --> 18:51.800
Did you have a sense that this would be your life, and you would also be creating the greatest

18:51.800 --> 18:54.320
games ever?

18:54.320 --> 18:56.760
Not in the slightest, no.

18:56.760 --> 19:03.840
I don't think anybody, but I was very much like that was my dream at that age.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.840
But you don't think that that's a job.

19:08.840 --> 19:15.880
As I got older, I was really going through college and even the computer classes then

19:15.880 --> 19:22.160
weren't where I wanted them to be, so I was still kind of doing my own stuff.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.720
And I ended up getting a business degree and then interviewing for some jobs, like finance

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
jobs.

19:27.720 --> 19:32.400
Well, I guess I should do this to make money and I can keep doing this on the side.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.720
And I remember I actually got to the final level of this corporate finance job at Circuit

19:37.720 --> 19:41.120
City, and they turned me down.

19:41.120 --> 19:45.320
And I was like, fuck them, I'm just going to go make video games.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.160
So thank you Circuit City.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.240
Yeah, I remember Circuit City.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.560
I think they weren't bankrupt, actually.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.880
Well, they were based in Richmond.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.720
I was going to school close to there.

19:55.720 --> 20:02.560
So what's the origin story of you joining Bethesda Softworks at the time?

20:02.560 --> 20:10.920
So I had gotten Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 for Christmas from my girlfriend at the time,

20:10.920 --> 20:13.760
who's now my wife.

20:13.760 --> 20:23.840
I was in college and I noticed that it was in Rockville, Maryland.

20:23.840 --> 20:28.040
And oh, that's on my way home over Christmas break back to William & Mary where I went

20:28.040 --> 20:29.560
to college.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.080
And I was at this point committed.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.620
This is what I want to do.

20:32.620 --> 20:36.480
So I'm just going to drive by and knock on the door, which is what I did.

20:36.480 --> 20:44.040
So I drove by and knocked on the doors, Martin Luther King Day, 93.

20:44.040 --> 20:48.920
And someone came out and met me and said, well, maybe, and I said, well, I'm in college.

20:48.920 --> 20:49.920
I'm talking about when I'm out of school.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.800
I'm like, okay, well, contact us then.

20:52.800 --> 20:58.120
And I will say I would contact them every once in a while.

20:58.200 --> 21:07.360
I did work for a small software company right out of school down in that area of Williamsburg

21:07.360 --> 21:09.380
and still would contact Bethesda.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.160
Arena had just come out.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.520
So then we're in 94.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.160
Arena had just come out and I loved it.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.160
So I was into sports games.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.160
I liked the hockey stuff.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.680
They were doing a basketball.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.680
They did a basketball game.

21:18.680 --> 21:24.400
Yeah, I'm just looking at they did a lot of they did like six sports games, six Bethesda

21:25.040 --> 21:32.520
10 games, six of them sports games and CAA basketball hockey league simulator simulator.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
Yeah.

21:33.520 --> 21:39.120
So it was really like sports gridiron, which is like the first kind of physics based football

21:39.120 --> 21:41.320
game at the time.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.720
And there's a famous story with Electronic Arts trying to do Madden and then hiring Bethesda

21:45.720 --> 21:50.720
before my time to make Madden because they were struggling.

21:50.800 --> 21:56.200
When I started Bethesda, I remember the owner had John Madden's Oakland Raiders playbook

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
in his office.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.080
Can I see that?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.080
And I love sports.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
Right.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.080
So I still play Madden to this day.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.080
I love it.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.640
So there's an alternate reality where I made sports games.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.080
Yeah, absolutely.

22:07.080 --> 22:11.320
I wanted to make I wanted to make like the ultimate college football game.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.280
Well, it's always like, you know, it's like music.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.840
You probably listen to lots of type of music like you don't play every time I think of

22:16.840 --> 22:19.600
open worlds is fundamentally different.

22:19.600 --> 22:28.040
Oh, we sure know like source of happiness, entertainment, storytelling, world gaming

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
than Madden.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.200
I mean, it's just because I love both.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.520
I love both worlds, but they're two totally different experiences.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.000
Just like when you might watch a movie, you might be in the mood for Lord of the Rings

22:39.000 --> 22:44.440
one day and then you want some other, I don't know, competitive show or game show or something

22:44.440 --> 22:45.960
like that or watch football on TV, right?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.280
You watch football on TV.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.060
But then I want to watch get really into Game of Thrones.

22:51.060 --> 22:54.560
So I think all those things have validity.

22:54.560 --> 23:00.320
And actually, one of the first things I worked on when I started Bethesda was NCAA basketball

23:00.320 --> 23:03.140
road to the Final Four two.

23:03.140 --> 23:07.760
So that was kind of an external project was came in like, hey, you you know, sports, get

23:07.760 --> 23:09.440
this game done.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.760
And then went on to but they were doing everything I loved was like, this is where I have to

23:12.760 --> 23:13.760
work.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.840
They're doing like the Terminator science fiction stuff.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
I love that.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.640
They're doing these open world role playing games like I love that and they're doing sports

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
like this.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.000
I have to work here.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.840
So I started there and you loved.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
I loved it.

23:26.840 --> 23:27.840
Yeah.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.000
So when I came in, it had just come out and they were doing the CD-ROM version.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.440
So CD-ROMs aren't even out yet.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.440
Oh, it used to be floppy disks.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.680
That's probably one.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.680
What was it?

23:39.680 --> 23:40.680
We would burn them in the basement.

23:40.680 --> 23:44.240
We had the disk replicators, right?

23:44.240 --> 23:48.920
So arena was not released on floppy.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
It was.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
Yes.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.840
I believe it's six floppy disks, six floppy disks.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.840
Maybe it was eight.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.840
Yeah.

23:55.840 --> 24:02.200
But in those days, the number of floppy disks was very, very important to what the money

24:02.200 --> 24:03.960
you were making.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.760
So if you want to do a big, huge game like, well, that's just too many disks.

24:07.760 --> 24:14.640
So the CD-ROM became this, this jumping off point for the whole industry where, oh, it's

24:14.640 --> 24:17.480
unlimited data.

24:17.480 --> 24:23.400
By the way, I played arena.

24:23.400 --> 24:30.720
So that was, of course, attained legally, as one does.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
Alternate means?

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
By alternate means.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
Right.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
Floppy disks.

24:35.680 --> 24:42.080
And that was, that was such an incredible, as you probably have seen interacted with

24:42.080 --> 24:44.920
a large number of people, it's a whole world.

24:44.920 --> 24:49.360
It's a world that you escape to in the way, like your favorite book, like Lord of the

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
Rings.

24:50.360 --> 24:55.840
It was just some, it was, it was unlike anything else.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
It was incredible.

24:56.840 --> 25:01.920
It's probably, I mean, of course, as people say, the first game you play is the most,

25:01.920 --> 25:06.160
is the one that really sentimentally means the most to you, as I think the first role

25:06.160 --> 25:10.080
playing game I played and it was just changed everything.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.080
Was arena?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.080
Was arena.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.080
Yeah.

25:13.080 --> 25:19.200
I think Daggerfall is what I really kind of really played, especially because like you

25:19.200 --> 25:25.280
said, the character development was really rich, but just like that you can be, feel

25:25.280 --> 25:27.680
like you traveled to this whole other world.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.480
That's less about entertainment, like a shooting game.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.480
Right.

25:32.040 --> 25:36.600
It felt like it's a world, like, like, like you're literally there.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
You can travel there.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
You can live there.

25:38.600 --> 25:46.040
You actually feel like that person versus like a Pac-Man, like, like an arcade fun,

25:46.040 --> 25:48.560
entertaining adventure adventure game.

25:48.560 --> 25:56.800
So, so you joined, you made it.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.040
What did you work on first there?

25:59.040 --> 26:01.440
I worked, well, everyone did a bunch of stuff.

26:01.440 --> 26:07.440
So I worked on the basketball game really just to get it out the door and Terminator

26:07.440 --> 26:08.840
Future Shock.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.660
So we were doing Future Shock and Daggerfall at the same time.

26:13.660 --> 26:15.160
They were developing a new engine.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.520
So it was one of the first 3D engines, the X engine.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.920
There were, there were a bunch of guys from Denmark, actually, it was like, there's like

26:21.920 --> 26:26.120
a big Danish demo scene in those days and the PC.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.400
And so a bunch of the top programmers there.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
Well, look, this is not big.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
This is not a big company.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.240
Maybe there's 20 people in development.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.280
And we were doing both Daggerfall and the new Terminator.

26:38.280 --> 26:43.040
And so Daggerfall was a bit more, again, behind the Terminator game.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.160
So I was one of the main people on the Terminator team.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.360
And I don't know, things kind of worked out.

26:49.360 --> 26:53.920
I very quickly, I don't know why, like I quickly became the producer and I was making levels

26:53.920 --> 26:58.640
and doing all these things and it was, it was awesome.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.080
And I, like, looking back now, I can understand it better.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.760
But at the time, I didn't appreciate it, which is no one quite owned the Terminator

27:05.760 --> 27:06.760
license.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.640
It was in like this limbo, legally.

27:09.640 --> 27:13.680
So there was no one to tell us what to, like, no, you can't do that.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.360
So we would, you know, pick apart the movies and how does he mention the gunny ones and

27:18.360 --> 27:21.040
the wattage of the laser and all these things.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.860
And so Future Shock is a game that I still love today.

27:24.860 --> 27:29.800
It does a lot of things that if you go back and look at it, we're frankly still doing.

27:29.800 --> 27:38.700
Like it's a large open world post-apocalyptic, you know, landscape height map with instanced

27:38.700 --> 27:40.380
objects all over it.

27:40.380 --> 27:45.180
And that is still a lot of how we build our worlds.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.340
What's an instanced object?

27:48.060 --> 27:56.300
Some games, every, you know, wall or building is kind of unique in its data, whereas we

27:56.300 --> 27:59.900
would just build, you know, these little husks of buildings and then place them all over

27:59.900 --> 28:00.900
the place.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.580
So the memory and the way you render it is much more optimal.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.780
So that allows you to build a bigger world.

28:06.780 --> 28:12.480
It allows you to build a bigger world much faster and not, you know, not every single

28:12.480 --> 28:17.280
version of that building is in its own unique architecture that is going to take up memory

28:17.280 --> 28:19.720
and processing speed, et cetera, et cetera.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.880
So you're there very much feeling the computational constraints of the system when you're creating

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
these open worlds.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.880
And you know what?

28:25.880 --> 28:26.880
That's the thing then.

28:26.880 --> 28:34.000
You see some of it now, but in those times, I do feel like every year the technology moved

28:34.000 --> 28:38.260
and maybe it's because the same thing where like that my age at that time where every

28:38.260 --> 28:45.300
year somebody was coming up with some new method or some new game system.

28:45.300 --> 28:53.420
And it was every year that innovation, innovation, innovation, and then, you know, 3D acceleration

28:53.420 --> 28:56.900
comes along and then these things come along and then HD comes along.

28:56.900 --> 29:03.400
And it is true that as time goes on, there is visually a diminishing return in terms

29:03.400 --> 29:06.700
of what you're able to do on the screen.

29:06.700 --> 29:11.580
And there's a ton of work that goes into it now because just rendering this cup to

29:11.580 --> 29:16.600
the perfect shine and material and roughness and how does the global illumination off this

29:16.600 --> 29:22.940
wall, it gets a ton of work, but you can pretty much do what you want now if you want to put

29:22.940 --> 29:27.700
the time in, whereas then, okay, you can't do everything you want.

29:27.700 --> 29:33.860
So pick your battles really carefully and technically you couldn't do what you want,

29:33.860 --> 29:34.860
if that makes sense.

29:35.220 --> 29:45.020
How much trade off is there now in how much effort you put into the realism of the graphics

29:45.020 --> 29:51.340
versus the story and actually not even how much effort you put in, but is there a trade

29:51.340 --> 29:58.300
off in the experience, the feel of the game in terms of realism and story?

29:58.300 --> 30:03.580
Usually we will start with let the player have as much agency and do as many things

30:03.580 --> 30:05.380
as they can as possible.

30:05.380 --> 30:11.220
And we will sacrifice some graphic fidelity for that, some speed for that.

30:11.220 --> 30:17.780
We could make a game that, traditionally our games are we okay with 30 frames a second

30:17.780 --> 30:20.820
as long as it looks really good and the simulation's running and all of those things.

30:20.820 --> 30:26.980
So we'll sacrifice some of that fidelity for the player experience in the kind of things

30:26.980 --> 30:29.460
that I do.

30:29.460 --> 30:34.300
But from like a manpower standpoint, the graphics programmers work on graphics, the artists

30:34.300 --> 30:40.100
work on art, and we have an awesome team of artists and designers and writers and programmers.

30:40.100 --> 30:47.180
It's usually where we find as time goes on, the amount of art time that it takes to create

30:47.180 --> 30:50.420
a cup compared to what it used to be.

30:50.420 --> 30:55.660
That has increased, so we do use, like most people use art outsourcing as well so that

30:55.660 --> 30:56.660
we're not.

30:56.660 --> 31:03.020
We're relatively, compared to our industry and what we're doing, have smaller teams.

31:03.020 --> 31:07.820
What about the experience of the beauty of the graphics?

31:07.820 --> 31:14.740
So like one of the most amazing things about Skyrim, and maybe you could say that about

31:14.740 --> 31:19.220
some of the other games, but for me Skyrim is the outdoor, when you step outside, it's

31:19.220 --> 31:20.820
the outdoor scenery.

31:20.820 --> 31:28.620
So what does it take to create the feeling, especially of that being outdoors of nature

31:28.620 --> 31:32.460
and just like lost in the beauty?

31:32.460 --> 31:36.740
Whatever it is when you go hiking and you feel the awe of it, how do you create that

31:36.740 --> 31:37.740
awe?

31:37.740 --> 31:38.740
Is that graphics?

31:38.740 --> 31:39.740
What is that?

31:39.740 --> 31:40.740
It's a lot of graphics.

31:40.740 --> 31:41.740
It's a lot of mood.

31:41.740 --> 31:44.900
We just talk about it in terms of tone.

31:44.900 --> 31:51.700
And those are, again, going back to my previous comment, the graphics are very, very important

31:51.700 --> 31:57.540
to us because, and we always push them, because when you're doing the kind of things we do

31:57.540 --> 32:02.940
where you step into a virtual world, it does have to have that moment of, wow, this feels

32:02.940 --> 32:03.940
real.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.780
I've never experienced this.

32:07.780 --> 32:17.220
And it's okay, I think it's okay to let just like the time settle, meaning you step out.

32:17.220 --> 32:19.260
How does the wind sound?

32:19.260 --> 32:20.820
How are the trees moving?

32:20.820 --> 32:24.380
How are the clouds moving?

32:24.380 --> 32:29.060
I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.300
How does it land over the water?

32:31.300 --> 32:35.380
Like it doesn't have to be like, hey, let's go, let's finish a quest, let's go kill things,

32:35.380 --> 32:37.220
let's figure out the next step, let's level up.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.900
Like I like the quiet moments a lot.

32:39.900 --> 32:44.060
And I think when you play our games, you can tell we spend a lot of time on them.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.100
Then you watch like the weather roll in.

32:46.100 --> 32:53.780
I think that's just part of being, being that character, being that person in that space.

32:53.780 --> 32:58.740
Yeah, I saw that there's a mod that removes all enemies.

32:58.740 --> 33:04.660
I've been meaning to do that, to just do like a live stream where for hours walk around

33:04.660 --> 33:07.980
the Skyrim, just, and then answer questions and so on.

33:07.980 --> 33:13.780
That just feels, that's a completely stress free environment.

33:13.780 --> 33:17.380
It's just, you are just like you said, in this moment in time.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.300
It's so incredible.

33:19.300 --> 33:22.540
It feels as incredible as going hiking or something like that.

33:22.540 --> 33:30.260
But in another totally different place, like Iceland or something like that, this whole

33:30.260 --> 33:33.060
other surreal, ethereal place.

33:33.780 --> 33:35.460
Yeah, it's incredible how you kind of create that.

33:35.460 --> 33:41.540
So graphics is a part of that, but also letting it, the temporal aspect of that, like the

33:41.540 --> 33:46.820
wind, the rustling sound and look and all of that.

33:46.820 --> 33:51.020
The soundscape is really, really important in the sky.

33:51.020 --> 33:55.900
We spend a lot of time on the sky because it's taking up much more of the screen than

33:55.900 --> 33:58.860
a lot of people give credit for.

33:58.860 --> 34:00.980
What about the rendering, the openness of it?

34:01.940 --> 34:08.060
There's a lot of level of detail, streaming work, and nowadays it's getting more common.

34:08.060 --> 34:11.820
Like frankly, the systems are built better for it.

34:11.820 --> 34:14.340
Hard drive speed is really prioritized.

34:14.340 --> 34:17.380
Like they're so blazing fast.

34:17.380 --> 34:25.900
You take Skyrim and Oblivion and the fallouts of that 360 era, it was a lot of time spent

34:25.900 --> 34:30.420
on how do we get all this data streaming in?

34:30.420 --> 34:38.940
As you move and then levels of detail so you can see all the way, but not crush the processor.

34:38.940 --> 34:39.940
You know what?

34:39.940 --> 34:40.940
Let's even step back.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.940
You mentioned tone.

34:41.940 --> 34:42.940
You mentioned tone a lot.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.620
What do you mean by tone?

34:44.620 --> 34:46.220
It's all of it together.

34:46.220 --> 34:52.500
If you look at, I think you can flip through, let's just take fantasy.

34:52.500 --> 34:57.380
You can sort of look at a couple images or things and know how does Lord of the Rings

34:57.380 --> 35:11.220
different from Game of Thrones that is different than a Thorian like Excalibur or your sci-fi

35:11.220 --> 35:21.220
channel series of the month kind of thing.

35:21.220 --> 35:27.180
So finding that, what's going to make it kind of unique and usually I lean on something

35:27.180 --> 35:39.620
that is grounded in reality for what it is and then have lesser kind of fantastical things

35:39.620 --> 35:43.560
at least at the start and then they kind of build.

35:43.560 --> 35:47.460
So even when we do Starfield, I mean it's a science fiction game, there are laser guns

35:47.460 --> 35:50.720
and spaceships that fly around and shoot each other and blah, blah, blah, blah, but it's

35:51.720 --> 35:58.200
can look at it and say, okay, this is kind of an extension of things as we view them

35:58.200 --> 36:06.760
today in space and we sort of take the same approach with fallout where admittedly things

36:06.760 --> 36:14.320
can get even a little bit crazier the longer you're developing fallout content.

36:14.320 --> 36:21.720
So just to linger on this, the tone starts at or the defining the tone starts at creating

36:21.720 --> 36:26.520
a realistic experience like you feel like I could walk into this and this feels like

36:26.520 --> 36:27.520
life.

36:27.520 --> 36:31.060
What's their technology level like even for a fantasy world like is magic, how prevalent

36:31.060 --> 36:34.960
is it or are they making weapons and things and armor?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.820
Is it for utility?

36:36.820 --> 36:38.700
Is it for decoration?

36:38.700 --> 36:40.420
How do they live their lives?

36:40.420 --> 36:48.260
Does this feel like a place that you believe that has some grounding in our reality, whether

36:48.260 --> 36:55.860
that's historical or near future or that it's grounded in some semblance of the reality

36:55.860 --> 37:01.620
that you and I understand so that it can feel, it's also making it feel a little bit welcoming.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.100
Like, okay, I understand this.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.540
Is that art or science?

37:06.180 --> 37:11.620
How do you know when he feels welcoming and everything fits in his grounding?

37:11.620 --> 37:13.220
I guess it's personal taste.

37:13.220 --> 37:18.820
Some people like things that are weirder, that have more fantastical from the get go.

37:18.820 --> 37:23.880
Even a game like Morrowind where we get into some more fantastical things, it intentionally

37:23.880 --> 37:26.620
starts a little more grounded.

37:26.620 --> 37:32.980
There's a very classic medieval looking town that you come into, but you look just beyond

37:32.980 --> 37:37.940
at her mushroom trees and giant insects and things like that.

37:37.940 --> 37:43.060
So in Skyrim, when you put a dragon in it, what are your thoughts about dragons and tone?

37:43.060 --> 37:46.420
How does that fit into tone?

37:46.420 --> 37:51.700
That's a great question.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.860
It's a ridiculous question, but yeah, I just love dragons so I want to bring it up.

37:54.860 --> 37:55.860
No, no, no.

37:55.860 --> 37:59.120
These are the things that we debate with.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.120
Do we include a dragon?

38:01.120 --> 38:02.940
Why didn't you include a dragon in Daggerfall?

38:02.940 --> 38:03.940
That's what I want to know.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.940
I think there's dragon.

38:04.940 --> 38:05.940
There's dragonlings.

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
They're hard to do.

38:06.940 --> 38:07.940
Dragons are hard to do.

38:07.940 --> 38:14.260
So when you start Skyrim and say, hey, look, dragons are going to be a theme, start visually.

38:14.260 --> 38:15.980
You can make the argument that dragons existed.

38:15.980 --> 38:17.380
Okay, what would they look like?

38:17.380 --> 38:19.900
How close to dinosaurs would they be?

38:19.900 --> 38:24.460
And ours are less, I believe they're less fantastical looking in general.

38:24.460 --> 38:29.060
They look like beasts that could exist in that world.

38:29.060 --> 38:31.220
And then how we introduce them.

38:31.220 --> 38:37.180
It's kind of a little bit of a slow, you know, role in Skyrim and that the people in the

38:37.180 --> 38:41.460
world are reacting to the dragons appearing.

38:41.460 --> 38:46.040
And that's somewhat, you know, mirrors, you want something that mirrors the player experience

38:46.040 --> 38:47.040
as well.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.140
It says back to you like, hey, no, these are, this is, have you heard this?

38:50.140 --> 38:52.020
Someone saw a dragon.

38:52.020 --> 38:55.780
That's what Daggerfall is there, isn't there mentions of dragons or something?

38:55.780 --> 39:01.380
Because I remember, I remember being sure that there's dragons in Daggerfall as I'm

39:01.380 --> 39:02.380
playing it.

39:02.380 --> 39:03.380
I'm pretty sure.

39:03.380 --> 39:06.060
Well, is there a dragon in Daggerfall?

39:06.060 --> 39:08.100
There's dragonlings in Daggerfall to my memory.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.420
Look, I guess someone will probably correct me.

39:09.420 --> 39:11.940
Like actually there is a dragon here.

39:11.940 --> 39:15.100
But I'm pretty sure they're sort of, they're not.

39:15.100 --> 39:21.660
And then game I did Redguard, which we bring back, it takes place beforehand.

39:21.660 --> 39:26.420
We have a dragon there in that game and that was unique to that at the time.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.740
Yeah.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.300
Just a brief tangent on that.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.980
I thought Redguard was a really, really good game.

39:31.980 --> 39:41.180
I played it as a, again, you don't, you know, you forget stuff, but I remember getting,

39:41.180 --> 39:45.340
I guess it was the first in the Elder Scrolls series to put it in into that world.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.860
But it was like an adventure game.

39:46.860 --> 39:50.900
It reminded me of another game I really love, like Prince of Persia.

39:50.900 --> 39:54.940
That was the, one of the inspirations, Prince of Persia is one of my favorite games.

39:54.940 --> 40:00.420
Like, I mean, okay, I apologize if I'm forgetting, but you can like jump in buildings and stuff.

40:00.420 --> 40:05.140
Like there's a jump, there's a dynamic, like airy nature, like it's a like parkour type

40:05.140 --> 40:06.140
of situation.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.140
Yeah.

40:07.140 --> 40:09.380
It was an incredible game.

40:09.380 --> 40:12.620
Why do you think, let me ask sort of a dark question, why do you think that game was a

40:12.620 --> 40:13.620
flop?

40:13.620 --> 40:14.620
One of the, one of the few.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.620
Not a dark question.

40:15.620 --> 40:16.620
Yeah.

40:16.620 --> 40:17.620
It was.

40:17.620 --> 40:18.620
Well, a lot of reasons.

40:19.460 --> 40:25.180
Game, game that I love and really got us going on a handcrafted world.

40:25.180 --> 40:31.460
So we're coming off of Daggerfall, Morrowind is sort of in design and then, you know, part

40:31.460 --> 40:34.460
of our development teams broke up to do different things.

40:34.460 --> 40:39.780
Game that did Battlespire and Redguard was my game.

40:39.780 --> 40:44.060
And I wanted to do something a little more Ultima feeling, handcrafted world.

40:44.060 --> 40:46.780
I really like things that blend up genres.

40:46.780 --> 40:51.020
So I know it's in the adventure game category, but it really does a lot of things.

40:51.020 --> 40:54.140
You know, it's a, it's a love letter to Prince of Persia.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.100
There's a little Raiders of the Lost Ark in it.

40:56.100 --> 41:01.940
There's a lot of Ultima in it and really see what we could do with the engine, but it's

41:01.940 --> 41:07.180
very much, I think plays like it would have had a much better home on say PlayStation

41:07.180 --> 41:08.180
or Xbox.

41:08.180 --> 41:10.780
Though this predates Xbox, right?

41:10.780 --> 41:14.260
Where it's much more like constantly Tomb Raider had come out.

41:14.500 --> 41:18.780
Do you see those influences of Tomb Raider on that game?

41:18.780 --> 41:24.020
And 3D effects cards had just come out and so, okay, we can do.

41:24.020 --> 41:29.260
And it was the last, I think it's one of the last like DOS games in a Windows world.

41:29.260 --> 41:36.660
So it, I think it missed kind of a technology window as well as ultimately not what people

41:36.660 --> 41:41.420
wanted from us, you know?

41:41.420 --> 41:50.460
And I felt I was really kind of the company let me make that game and it was a big flop.

41:50.460 --> 41:51.700
Battlespire hadn't done well.

41:51.700 --> 41:56.740
The company was in a really bad shape and I felt really like personally responsible.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.180
Like they let me do this creative thing.

41:59.180 --> 42:01.220
It didn't do what we needed it to do.

42:01.220 --> 42:04.140
And now we're in a very, very bad situation.

42:04.140 --> 42:08.220
Company almost went out of business.

42:08.980 --> 42:14.300
And that's when it got reformed with ZeniMax Media and Robert Altman came in and we were

42:14.300 --> 42:15.300
starting Morrowind.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.940
We had just sort of started and it was sort of that whole experience that made you sort

42:18.940 --> 42:23.780
of realize someone says to you, okay, you're going to get another shot.

42:23.780 --> 42:29.940
And that's where you're like, okay, we're going to make Morrowind and make the biggest

42:29.940 --> 42:31.380
best RPG we can make.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.940
We know what the audience wants from us.

42:32.940 --> 42:36.000
We know what we could do building a world.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.640
So there's like callbacks to how we built the world in Redguard.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.520
Morrowind is a large scale, handcrafted, but if you were to put it, you know, pixel per

42:43.520 --> 42:48.300
pixel with Daggerfall, you wouldn't even see Morrowind because Daggerfall is so big.

42:48.300 --> 42:55.240
But the impact of playing it, I think, is in many ways equal, but different.

42:55.240 --> 43:00.680
Just you personally, psychologically, did you have doubt about yourself from the performance

43:00.680 --> 43:01.680
of Redguard?

43:01.680 --> 43:04.400
Like do I even, do I know what it is?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
Of course.

43:05.680 --> 43:09.160
Where do you get the, how do you overcome that?

43:09.160 --> 43:11.160
I don't know.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.280
I would say this honestly, I enjoy it so much.

43:14.280 --> 43:19.160
You know, like I'm so, I'm so heads down, like that becomes, for better or worse, like

43:19.160 --> 43:22.160
my life.

43:22.160 --> 43:26.600
And it's just something that I want to play so much, it becomes like there's a little

43:26.600 --> 43:28.480
bit, you get a little obsessed with it.

43:28.480 --> 43:32.280
No, but I mean, you love Redguard, right?

43:32.280 --> 43:37.280
So like, doesn't that mean, isn't there a kind of self-doubt about, do I know what it

43:37.280 --> 43:38.880
takes to create a great game?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.760
Well, no, I think Redguard's a great game.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.560
Right, so you were sure, even if it wasn't...

43:42.560 --> 43:44.480
Okay, so if you're going to be like, do I like that game?

43:44.480 --> 43:48.880
It's about finding an, okay, so I love Redguard.

43:48.880 --> 43:53.120
And the people who play it, it won a bunch of awards and it, you know, it like critically

43:53.120 --> 43:57.640
was a pretty good game, did not sell.

43:57.640 --> 44:01.920
And the reason for that, again, like we probably made this the wrong type of game and we missed

44:01.920 --> 44:03.320
the technology window.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.280
We also thought it was very conservative.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.340
We're going to do this.

44:07.340 --> 44:12.520
So my main takeaway was, I'm not going to be conservative again, I'm going to swing for

44:12.520 --> 44:14.200
the fences.

44:14.200 --> 44:17.920
And we've had, you know, there'll be some rough edges in swinging for the fences and

44:17.920 --> 44:22.440
shooting for the moon, but we'd rather do that and land where we land than be very,

44:22.440 --> 44:27.560
very conservative in what we're putting out there.

44:27.560 --> 44:35.320
You've mentioned, just referencing this game on Reddit AMA, that long time ago during Redguard,

44:35.320 --> 44:40.720
the lead programmer made me, made all the buildings hop up and down after you played

44:40.720 --> 44:43.320
for 10 minutes just to mess with me.

44:43.320 --> 44:50.360
Just a curious tangent, what's involved with programming in open world game?

44:50.360 --> 44:56.400
So we talked about, we will talk about design and so on, but specifically the programming,

44:56.440 --> 45:01.040
because I think this question came from, what are some interesting sticky bugs that you've

45:01.040 --> 45:04.120
encountered throughout your life in creating these games?

45:04.120 --> 45:06.320
And this is one of them that you mentioned.

45:06.320 --> 45:12.600
So what are some of the challenges of programming these open world games?

45:12.600 --> 45:16.600
I mean, there are different flavors of them, right?

45:16.600 --> 45:23.040
Your GTAs will have different issues than, you know, the Ubisoft games versus R games.

45:23.040 --> 45:28.720
Things sort of speak to ours, which is you want to build systems, right?

45:28.720 --> 45:33.360
Because they're going to play the game for a very long time as well, which we've learned.

45:33.360 --> 45:39.840
And you can't go through and touch everything by hand, per se.

45:39.840 --> 45:46.600
So you have to rely on some systemic level of creation and a lot of systems that are

45:46.600 --> 45:52.640
robust enough so that when they touch another one, things aren't breaking apart.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.840
So there's like a, what are the major systems?

45:55.840 --> 46:01.720
Is there like the physics of the game, the engine of how like stuff, yeah, like, yeah,

46:01.720 --> 46:04.880
the physics, the motion and maybe how light is rendered and all that kind of stuff.

46:04.880 --> 46:05.040
Right.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.960
So you have the rendering, right?

46:06.960 --> 46:11.320
Of like, okay, this is how I'm going to render the data that I have.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.800
So a lot of people confuse engines with rendering.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.920
I mean, they're combined obviously, but there's the data you're going to give to a

46:18.920 --> 46:23.520
renderer, which is the thing that draws the pixels on the screen.

46:24.040 --> 46:29.800
So there's a, most of the engine is how are you going to bring in that data and give it

46:29.800 --> 46:31.960
to the renderer to draw it?

46:32.520 --> 46:35.880
So you have that whole system of walking through the world, feeding in the data and

46:35.880 --> 46:36.280
drawing it.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.920
You then obviously have the physics and the interactivity.

46:41.600 --> 46:45.920
What are the things that are there just to be drawn and what are the things there that

46:45.920 --> 46:48.080
are meant to be interacted with and touched?

46:48.720 --> 46:54.080
We put a big premium on the ones that can be interacted with and touched, whether it's

46:54.120 --> 46:58.760
flowers, whether the trees move, whether you can sleep on the sofa, sit in this chair,

46:58.760 --> 47:01.240
pick up all this stuff, bake bread, blah, blah, blah.

47:02.680 --> 47:07.400
You then have the AI, which loops in the stuff we talked about earlier in terms of

47:07.400 --> 47:14.280
processing everybody and combat systems, which is a lot of what people end up doing,

47:14.440 --> 47:17.360
combat systems on top of that AI.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.840
How do they react to those types of things?

47:20.240 --> 47:25.240
And then how do they look at the things that can be interacted with?

47:25.440 --> 47:29.280
One of my favorite things is when NPCs will go pick up weapons in the world, which you

47:29.280 --> 47:30.200
don't see in other games.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.680
And the first time you see it in one of ours, it's like very unexpected.

47:33.120 --> 47:37.640
You can drop like a crazy weapon, be in a fight and an NPC runs over, picks it up and

47:37.640 --> 47:38.360
uses it on you.

47:38.360 --> 47:42.120
It's not something you would expect, but I love that stuff.

47:42.360 --> 47:48.760
And that's integrated into a larger system, the ability to pick up the NPC, so it's not

47:48.760 --> 47:51.280
like a little quirk that's hard coded in.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.120
It's part of a bigger system.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.800
They have their own AI for scanning the environment.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.560
And that's one of the rules.

47:57.560 --> 48:01.440
Hey, is there a weapon that is better than the one I have?

48:02.400 --> 48:03.440
I'm going to go get it.

48:03.640 --> 48:07.440
Now we do lock off if it's in a chest and that's treasure we left for the player, but

48:07.440 --> 48:11.120
it's in particular because what you don't want, we actually had this problem started

48:11.120 --> 48:12.840
in Oblivion, I believe, which is we set up a level.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.040
Hey, let the enemies go pick up the weapons if they're better.

48:17.360 --> 48:21.360
So we make a level and go in and all of the enemies are armed to the teeth and there's

48:21.360 --> 48:25.000
no treasure for the player because the enemies went and took all the good weapons.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.600
OK, they don't take those.

48:26.720 --> 48:31.000
They take the ones that are dropped by other NPCs or the player.

48:31.560 --> 48:37.760
That's such a fascinating world of designing the experience for the NPC, because in part

48:38.000 --> 48:42.400
that experience is defines the experience of the player.

48:43.320 --> 48:48.320
So how they interact with their environment defines how the player experiences

48:48.320 --> 48:53.240
their environment. Is there room for further and further development of the AI

48:53.240 --> 48:55.240
that controls the NPC?

48:55.880 --> 48:57.760
Sure. We're always iterating on it.

48:58.120 --> 49:07.080
And again, as we look in the future, it's more about us finding those more reactivity

49:07.080 --> 49:11.240
to the player and also understanding their roles in the world.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.960
So they're not just there.

49:14.640 --> 49:19.160
They're not just there for the player as a signpost for the player, but they're

49:19.160 --> 49:23.720
reacting to the player. But what about, you know, some of the richest experiences we

49:23.720 --> 49:30.320
have with people is like the chaos of it, the push and pull, the unpredictability.

49:30.800 --> 49:35.080
Is there something I don't know if you've been following, but the quick, amazing

49:35.080 --> 49:41.600
development of language models, the neural network, natural language processing

49:41.600 --> 49:43.960
systems, dialogue systems.

49:45.360 --> 49:50.920
Do you think there's some possibility of using these incredible neural nets that

49:50.920 --> 49:55.480
can have open ended dialogue, basically chat bots?

49:55.560 --> 49:57.920
Yep. I've seen some incredible demos.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.560
I do think it's coming.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.520
I don't know when.

50:00.680 --> 50:00.920
Yeah.

50:01.360 --> 50:07.960
And there's a little bit of a question like what's ready for real deployment and

50:07.960 --> 50:15.480
release versus, hey, let's use that to generate some things that is then static

50:15.520 --> 50:21.720
that we're giving to the players versus it's generated on the fly.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.280
But it's definitely coming.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.320
It's definitely coming.

50:24.360 --> 50:27.320
And I think you'll see it in the types of games that we do.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.360
It has great, you know, application.

50:29.680 --> 50:35.880
I love the idea that you'd be using it to design different NPCs and then testing if

50:35.880 --> 50:39.920
they're, if they're good enough, if they're like, oh, too crazy.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.520
You don't want like the super.

50:41.560 --> 50:41.800
Right.

50:41.800 --> 50:45.960
But if we go back to it being reactive, some of that bot stuff, you know, it's

50:45.960 --> 50:47.320
pretty, it's incredible.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.400
It's then translating that into voice.

50:50.760 --> 50:54.280
And then is that being done by the client?

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
Is that being done on a server?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.080
Is it baked into the game?

50:58.080 --> 50:59.480
There's like different flavors of it.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.360
So there's still computational challenges.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.600
Like how do you actually make that happen?

51:03.640 --> 51:03.920
Right.

51:04.600 --> 51:11.200
Well, what about, oh, in terms of creating the feeling of an NPC, what's

51:11.200 --> 51:13.160
the role of voice actors and awesome.

51:13.600 --> 51:13.920
Yeah.

51:14.120 --> 51:19.120
We work with a ton of voice actors and they bring so much to it.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.360
And that's the thing.

51:20.600 --> 51:25.840
Um, they, you know, we can write some stuff and the best ones get in

51:25.840 --> 51:27.720
there and make it so much better.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.640
Or even ad lib things.

51:30.160 --> 51:35.200
And so we, we do a lot of voice recording and we used to do it kind

51:35.200 --> 51:36.840
of like at the end of the project.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.160
And now we do it throughout.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.520
We start really early and we just start recording.

51:42.520 --> 51:48.240
So we're recording for years and years, literally probably three years, four years.

51:48.240 --> 51:51.840
So part of the actual experience of the recording will help define the

51:51.840 --> 51:53.360
characters and the tone of the game.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.240
And we'll go back sometimes and Hey, we really like this.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
We want more of this.

51:57.240 --> 52:01.480
Let's write, let's do another session or Hey, we don't think this

52:01.480 --> 52:02.680
character is actually working.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
We want you to do different.

52:03.720 --> 52:04.800
You're going to be someone else now.

52:04.800 --> 52:05.520
Sorry, that got cut.

52:06.560 --> 52:11.440
Do you ever try to sort of imagine that people fall in love with

52:11.440 --> 52:12.920
the characters, with the NPCs?

52:12.960 --> 52:13.240
I do.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.680
Like, I mean, do they get really attached to the?

52:16.720 --> 52:17.240
Oh yeah.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.400
I mean, I've done it in games.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.120
These are like close friends, right?

52:20.520 --> 52:22.720
Like you can, like you miss them.

52:23.240 --> 52:23.800
A hundred percent.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.520
Isn't that part of the thing?

52:24.680 --> 52:27.680
Like whenever I'm playing a game and there is, you know, if there's like a

52:27.880 --> 52:31.880
friendship option or make friends or a romance thing, I find those moments

52:31.880 --> 52:34.400
really, I enjoy them.

52:34.400 --> 52:37.640
I find them pretty impactful emotionally to what we're doing.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.280
And so we've done a little bit of it.

52:40.280 --> 52:43.160
It's one of the things that we actually have pushed in Starfield.

52:43.960 --> 52:50.160
So we have a number of companions, but for them, we go, you know, I

52:50.160 --> 52:55.040
won't say super complex romantic, but more complex relationships than we've

52:55.040 --> 53:02.440
had in terms of not just some, you know, state of they like you or they don't

53:02.440 --> 53:07.920
like you, but they can be, they can be in love with you and dislike something you

53:07.920 --> 53:11.040
did and be pissed at you temporarily and then come back to loving you.

53:11.360 --> 53:15.640
So that, that relationship status of it's complicated, that they're,

53:15.640 --> 53:17.160
they're existing in that gray area.

53:17.160 --> 53:17.920
It's complicated.

53:17.960 --> 53:21.600
We're not dating or just, well, it's in a lot of games.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.200
You know, previous stuff, you just work your way up.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.720
They like you more and more and more and more.

53:24.720 --> 53:29.120
And now you're in a relationship and you, and when you make them upset, you

53:29.120 --> 53:30.880
drift out of like, it never happened.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.160
You know, you drift out of it.

53:32.160 --> 53:38.240
Whereas we wanted one where, okay, we can be in a relationship and we've committed

53:38.240 --> 53:41.760
to each other in some way, but I just did something that really made you angry.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.560
And as opposed to just drifting out of that status, you're in a temporary, I

53:46.560 --> 53:47.880
don't like what you did state.

53:48.280 --> 53:48.480
Wow.

53:48.480 --> 53:51.560
So some greater degree of complexity in the relationship with a

53:51.560 --> 53:54.240
companion, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.

53:54.920 --> 53:59.240
I don't want to oversell that part, but my point is I think those things where

53:59.240 --> 54:03.920
you meet a character in a game and you do spend time with them, a companion in

54:03.920 --> 54:08.200
a game and it leads to romance, you know, myself and others, and I find a lot of

54:08.200 --> 54:13.320
players, those moments are really, really impactful and special to them

54:13.320 --> 54:14.520
because they did put in the time.

54:15.480 --> 54:19.360
That's another thing that I always come at it with, which is I think people

54:19.360 --> 54:22.480
who don't play video games, they sometimes think like, oh, that's, I don't

54:22.480 --> 54:23.880
know, that's a waste of time, but that's not real.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.560
That's not like, you're not getting a lot out of that.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.560
Like, well, you haven't really experienced it in the way that you can

54:29.040 --> 54:34.280
because these moments that I spent in games, not the ones I made other ones

54:34.280 --> 54:37.440
when I was growing up or even now, those are, that is important time to me.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.800
Like I love those moments.

54:40.040 --> 54:44.000
I felt really like proud of what I accomplished.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.720
And we want people to have that in our games.

54:49.040 --> 54:52.360
And the fact that they've had, they have had those experiences and we hear from

54:52.360 --> 54:53.840
them and how important it is to them.

54:54.280 --> 54:58.400
It's like, no, this is, this is really, really special.

54:59.200 --> 54:59.440
Yeah.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.240
It's, uh, it's fun.

55:01.240 --> 55:04.720
I mean, from a, from a game design perspective, I wonder if you can honor

55:04.720 --> 55:11.040
the time you spent together with the game because, um, you know, sometimes

55:11.160 --> 55:13.000
there's a heartbreak at the end of the game.

55:13.000 --> 55:18.720
Like when you're, when you, when you leave a game, there's a, yeah, it's

55:18.720 --> 55:22.800
a really complicated relationship actually, because when you leave a game,

55:22.880 --> 55:28.200
it's almost like leaving a romantic partner because I think you spent

55:28.200 --> 55:29.680
so much meaningful time together.

55:31.040 --> 55:37.600
And there's a sense in which it was, uh, it was ephemeral.

55:37.920 --> 55:40.960
Like you, this, this is not, this didn't happen.

55:41.120 --> 55:41.280
Yeah.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.240
It didn't really happen.

55:42.480 --> 55:43.000
It was good.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.120
It was like, you went to Vegas and you got drunk and stuff for like, and now

55:47.120 --> 55:52.040
life goes on, I wonder if there's a way to sort of always carry that with you.

55:52.440 --> 55:55.840
I mean, I guess with words, you can kind of share with others.

55:55.840 --> 55:56.520
Like it's weird.

55:56.520 --> 56:00.720
I don't like now that we're in the age where you have achievements and you can

56:00.720 --> 56:05.800
look at your library and see your hours and games, like that's like, it's

56:05.800 --> 56:07.320
almost like a scrapbook now.

56:07.320 --> 56:12.000
Like I wish one of my wishes was like, I wish I had that achievement list

56:12.120 --> 56:17.680
for everything, like back to the late seventies, like every game you play.

56:17.720 --> 56:18.080
Right.

56:18.880 --> 56:19.320
Yeah.

56:19.360 --> 56:22.640
Like you, I mean, that's one of the cool things with Xbox.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.920
Like we're moving towards that direction.

56:25.200 --> 56:27.520
It'd be cool to be from like childhood.

56:27.840 --> 56:30.560
The first time you play a video game, it will actually tell you

56:30.840 --> 56:34.120
what is the first game, you know, what kids today, they will have that.

56:34.560 --> 56:39.680
They will have that and see, you can look back and see, oh my God, I

56:39.680 --> 56:40.960
put a thousand hours in there.

56:41.040 --> 56:41.960
What is the first?

56:41.960 --> 56:46.280
My last save was 1997.

56:48.800 --> 56:50.040
Man, I don't know.

56:50.080 --> 56:51.960
Golden Axe, maybe I'm trying to think.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.440
What was the first game I've ever played?

56:54.320 --> 56:56.560
Uh, no, it's probably common or 64 games.

56:56.560 --> 56:56.880
Yeah.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.240
Um, yeah.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.000
Arcade games.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.280
Okay.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.120
You mentioned Starfield.

57:03.240 --> 57:06.320
What is Starfield and what's the origin story of this game?

57:07.320 --> 57:12.720
We had always wanted to do something where you explore space, you know, the

57:12.720 --> 57:14.400
explore space role-playing game.

57:14.480 --> 57:20.240
So take the kind of games that we make and give it a little bit of a different spin.

57:20.680 --> 57:25.200
And you know, the other games that I love, there was a pen and paper RPG.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.320
I love traveler was one of the first games I made for the Apple too.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.920
Uh, didn't, uh, I never finished it.

57:31.920 --> 57:32.040
Right.

57:32.040 --> 57:32.960
I'm just doing it on my own.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.000
And I love this game.

57:36.040 --> 57:40.640
Star flight was one star control too, was a game that I loved.

57:40.760 --> 57:44.120
Um, sundog was a big one in the Apple two days that a lot of

57:44.120 --> 57:45.440
people don't know that I loved.

57:46.120 --> 57:51.760
And so a lot of us in the studio felt it was time to do something new.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.320
You know, we're going between elder scrolls and fallout and going back

57:54.320 --> 57:56.760
and forth and I mean, we love that.

57:57.200 --> 58:01.600
But Hey, we've always wanted to do this, explore the galaxy science fiction game.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.520
You know, now is the time, uh, to do that.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.320
And, uh, that's a brave move.

58:08.400 --> 58:14.280
So fallout is post-apocalyptic on a single planet.

58:15.080 --> 58:20.840
Uh, you know, elder scroll series is, um, on a single planet.

58:20.840 --> 58:25.960
So this is going out into the open world of many star systems, many planets.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.560
I saw that it's, uh, thinking about a hundred star systems and a thousand

58:31.560 --> 58:33.200
planets available to explore.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.560
Um, what is that world of stars and planets like?

58:37.400 --> 58:38.640
Well, you mentioned Daggerfall.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.760
We go back to some of that.

58:39.800 --> 58:45.280
Well, the first one we did it was how are we going to render a planet, like

58:45.280 --> 58:50.040
pull it off for the player, like, can we, or do we have to sort of do it where

58:50.040 --> 58:54.680
you can't land on all of them or you're landing in a very controlled, small

58:54.840 --> 58:59.920
world space that we, you know, kind of craft and you would have a very limited

58:59.920 --> 59:04.600
set of those, you go back to tone, like, well, that's probably the wrong tone.

59:05.760 --> 59:09.080
And how can we say yes, like I want to land on that ice ball.

59:09.080 --> 59:13.960
So it started, we started the game right after fallout four, so 2016.

59:14.720 --> 59:20.040
And the first thing we did was can, you know, how can we have a system to

59:20.080 --> 59:26.640
generate these planets and make them look, you know, I'll say reasonable as

59:26.640 --> 59:29.760
opposed to, you know, fractally goop.

59:30.840 --> 59:35.760
Um, what's the, what's the technical definition of goop fractally goop?

59:36.600 --> 59:39.240
You've probably seen a lot of like simulations, whether they're space

59:39.240 --> 59:42.480
things or landscape things where they're using fractals and just the

59:42.480 --> 59:43.960
landscape does not look real.

59:43.960 --> 59:46.800
It just, this is like highs and lows and it's muddy.

59:47.440 --> 59:51.920
And so we did find a way we came up with a way, um, had prototyped of, of

59:51.920 --> 59:56.400
building tiles, like large tiles of landscape, the way we would usually

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.720
build them, we kind of generate them offline, hand, do some things and end

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.320
up with these very realistic looking tiles of landscape, and then built a

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:11.560
system that wraps those around a planet and blends them all together.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.880
And we had pretty successful results with that.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.320
So we thought, yeah, we could, we could do this.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:25.200
Um, and so there was a big design kind of problem to solve in terms of, well,

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.800
what's fun about landing on a planet where there's potentially nothing.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.040
Cause there's a lot of planets and moons.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.360
If you kind of write in reality that, well, there's nothing on them, um,

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.360
except resources.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.600
And so we spent a lot of time figuring out, okay, let's just lean in on that

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.880
can a be a lonely experience, as long as we tell the player, here's what's there.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.640
Here are the resources that are there.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.040
Go find them.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.120
But I equate it to that moment of we said about listening to the

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.920
wind go and watching the sunset.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.840
And I do think there's a certain beauty to landing on a strange planet, being

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.680
somewhat the only person there building an outpost and we are modeling all of the

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.800
systems because that's how we like to do things.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.680
So you can watch whatever that gas giant or moon, it will rotate and go and

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.200
sunrise, sunset, and all of those things that you would expect.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.520
And it's, it's all really happening.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.760
And most people probably won't notice or appreciate all of that, but, um, I

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.840
think it gives them the ability to say, I want to go do that and see that on that

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.040
place, as long as we tell them, Hey, the quest leads over here.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.080
Here's where the handcrafted content is that you would expect.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.040
And then here's more of the open procedural planet experience.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.760
So your long answer, I don't know if I answered your question.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.800
There's no questions is stupid and the answers are brilliant.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.440
So that's how this works.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.600
So this is the world's most immense simulator of, um, the human

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.520
condition of loneliness, because I can't imagine a more lonely experience.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.600
I mean, you put it that way.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.360
I don't know.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.000
That was the goal.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:14.840
But just on a planet alone, I just, that must be, I mean, a deep embodiment

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.480
of what loneliness is like.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.520
I mean, it's the, um, both on like when you hike alone, there's a, there's

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.320
a deep loneliness to that.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:30.760
It's like, uh, it's humbling that this thing will last much longer than you.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.480
It's been here way before you.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.920
Is it the line from the moon landing?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.320
Beautiful desolation.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.320
Buzz Aldrin, is it beautiful desolation?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:40.840
Is that what you said?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.280
I think so.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.440
Beautiful desolation.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.240
Well, something like that, but that's just words.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.440
There's a feeling to it and you want that feeling to be real.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.760
You're just here.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.240
There's some resources here.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.120
I just feel like it will hit people at a certain moment.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.480
Like it does for me with Skyro.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.880
I'm like, Holy shit, I'm here alone.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.560
And then, and whatever cruel nature that's out there.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.840
It doesn't really care about me.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.240
Exactly.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.240
That's the experience.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.960
So you, you want to create the whole planet and you want to have many of them.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:18.120
We have, we do have many, but once you build that system, I think the numbers

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.640
become, I mean, honestly, a little bit.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.840
We, we wrap it in so we can name them all and have a finite set, even though

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.400
it's a very, very large number, but a set that we can, you know, validate and

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400
know about, even though it's a huge number.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.400
But once you, once you're building a system that can build a planet, I mean,

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.080
a planet is sort of infinite space.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.520
We go back to the Daggerfall analogy, right?

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.000
If you have systems to build that much space, doing a hundred planets or a

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.720
thousand or 10,000 or a million planets is not, it's just, you just press, you

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.600
just change the number and press the button, but you can't, you can't name

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.400
them all, you can't control like when you're getting in really big numbers.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.080
Hey, what is, what does the system way out here feel like if you take your

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.240
ship and jump that far, we do level the systems.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.440
When you go to system, you'll see, Oh, this is like a level 40 system.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.360
And us being able to at least control that scale is how we kind of ended

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.440
up with the hundred ish systems we have.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.960
What are the, what are the levelings?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.240
What do you mean by level?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:21.720
We level.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.440
It'll be like when you look at a map in a game and says, this is the area

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.360
for low level players, this is level one.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.120
Yeah.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:27.400
Yeah.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.600
So we do that on a system basis, star system.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.040
I read that space travel is considered dangerous in this game.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.120
Can you explain?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.880
That's more of that goes back to a tone thing, right?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.480
When you actually play the game, cause it's a game where we don't really kill

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:51.440
you when you fly out in space, but it has a tone of there's some effort involved.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.320
And we've dialed it back as we've been making the game, whereas we used to run

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.720
out of fuel, you jump and get stranded, which on paper was a great, like it's a

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.320
great moment when you get stranded and you have to press this beacon and you

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.280
don't know who's going to come.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.600
Um, turns out that's not like, it just stops your game.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.960
We found you'd be playing the game and I ran out of fuel.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:11.960
Okay.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.200
I guess I'll just wander these planets, trying to mine for fuel so I can get

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.720
back to what I was doing and just, you know, it's a fun killer.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.480
That's too realistic of a simulation of the human condition.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:24.840
Yeah.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.000
I know the idea was, well, it's for, you know, games do that.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.440
If you had like a hardcore, you're right, a hardcore survival mode,

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.560
that's the kind of thing you would do.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.720
Maybe we'll do it in the future.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.960
Um, but it's more of like a tone, how they build their ships.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.760
Do they have all the right things for safety?

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:44.360
Um, we do get into environmental things on the planets, you know, in your

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.520
spacesuit, obviously a lot of different spacesuits and buffs for, you know, the

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.640
gases or the toxicity or the temperature on, on various planets.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.240
Are there robots?

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:54.720
Yeah.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.560
So those companions, are they robots by chance?

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.600
Can you, can you say?

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.240
One of the companions, the robot Vosco.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.520
Yeah.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:01.400
Okay.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.280
So they have, they have a, they have a name and a personality and so on.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.360
And Vosco does.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.040
And then there's a whole bunch of, I call them generic robots.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.400
Are you like, we use them for utility, you know, okay.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.640
People, we actually dialed them back.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.240
Cause if you think about, well, you know a lot about this more than, uh, me

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.600
in terms of, I'm offended right now.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.560
Are you calling robots generic and no, no, no, the ones we use, the ones we, we

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.920
use, we made them more generic.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:31.640
We didn't, we didn't say actually, I understand, um, if you were to chart

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.560
the future, you would say robots would have a much bigger role in our future

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.200
than we are presenting.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.040
Um, but that was the tone thing.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.960
So we, most of our robots are there as utility robots and there are some combat

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.200
ones as well as enemies, as well as, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.120
so it's the deeply human world very much in terms of tone.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:01.320
Uh, so have you talked to Elon about this, about this game of their, a little

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.720
bit, how much of reality, like the work of SpaceX is an inspiration for the

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.160
decisions made in this game?

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:15.320
I wouldn't say it's for the decisions we made, but you know, visiting

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:21.560
SpaceX and walking in there, it was, it's like the Avengers meets NASA.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.440
It's like the most amazing and here we're building the next gen, like see

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.240
the, the dragon stuff before it was, uh, you know, other people saw it, like

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:40.200
just, I was really in awe, you know, just giant machine that looks for

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:47.600
imperfections on the surface of these giant, you know, fuselage, just, you

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.920
know, whenever, and cause we're, you know, we're in DC, go to the air and

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.080
space museum a lot.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.080
And so whenever I look at those kinds of things, or, you know, you'll visit

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.640
the space shuttle sort of overcome with how big it is and I go stand back by

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.680
the engines and think about that thing, leaving orbit, you know, and one of

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.320
the things that Elon really impresses, like we're reaching the edge of physics

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:17.400
on a lot of the stuff where how hard it is to leave orbit, the gravitational

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:23.080
pole and like, so the engineering that has gone into that, our space program,

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:28.520
what he's doing now, um, I just marvel at, I don't understand, right.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:34.280
I'm not at that level, but I marvel at the kind of human ingenuity and scale.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:42.720
I was on the Delaware coast last month and I went, I was outside, I was outside

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.160
for some reason, it was dark and I saw this crazy light in the sky and I

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.560
thought it was like a helicopter and then it didn't go away.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.240
And I'm like, is someone, what is that?

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.320
I call my, we had some friends, Hey, does everybody see this?

01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.400
What is that?

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.200
And we just stood dumbfounded looking at this thing in the sky.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:09.760
And like, that is a UFO, nobody takes their phone out, everyone, I'm with like four

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.880
people, everyone is too dumbstruck, you would think, why don't you take a picture

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.960
of this thing and the next day we found out it was in the news, it was the SpaceX

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:26.000
launch in Florida and I'm seeing it from Delaware, Maryland area, it was one of the

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.920
most, it was incredible, it's just even just that, I am in complete awe of it.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.360
Is there some aspect of that that you can replicate the majestic

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.520
nature of that in the video game?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.160
Um, I wish I had the answer to that.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.400
You know, I think some of it we were doing when you're standing on a

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.520
planet and you see, you see the other moons go by and then you realize I

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.200
could get my ship blast off and land there and build myself a home.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.320
I think that's pretty cool.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.600
There's a minor thing we do, which is we, um, we have other ships come and go

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.280
from the starports when you're there.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.560
So you'll be in a city and then you hear this, you hear the engine, you look

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.360
up on a ship that's taken off or coming out, like there's nothing for you to do.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.720
But it's, I think it's awesome.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.200
Yeah.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:14.680
Yeah.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.320
So then that's all about creating the soundscape to feel seeing it and like,

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.040
oh, that's real.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.560
That's a ship that, or you jump into a system and you see these freighters

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.760
sometimes they contact you.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.760
Like, um, it's not all just like jump in and combat.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:38.120
Do you ever think about the fact that science fiction seems to make, uh, it

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:45.720
has a way of creating reality, not just kind of predicting it or imagining it.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.840
It's almost like the thing you put out there with a video game like this, like

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:58.080
starfield that you anticipate it kind of fuels people's imagination of what is

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.680
possible.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.200
Maybe, I don't know.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:02.680
I don't know.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.760
I can't, I can't say you're making me think now about other science fiction

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.480
that movie.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.760
I love minority report.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.680
It's more of like a, not a space movie, but more like looking at the future.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.440
If you look at a lot of the things in that movie, it's almost like, I think

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.560
those are coming true.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.320
Yeah.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.360
I mean, uh, is, is that the one that you do interface?

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.600
Doesn't like, uh,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.360
it's the interfaces and then the, you know, the way he looks as a child is more

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:37.880
like a holographic, almost AR VR kind of thing or digital billboards, or trying

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.760
to predict human behavior.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.960
Um, there's a, there's just a lot of future stuff in that movie as it comes

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.520
to sci-fi to your other question.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:45.960
I don't know.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.600
I, I, I don't know.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.760
Well, I think it does.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.720
And it's interesting.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.800
I mean, I suppose you're trying to create the most realistic, sticking to the tone,

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.480
the most immersive, realistic world.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.320
And almost by accident, you create the thing that is possible because you

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.760
want it to be realistic in some deep sense.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.000
So accidentally it can become the possible.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.960
And then that places that idea in people's heads.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:19.840
I mean, if humans are ever to become a multi-planetary species, we need, we

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:25.040
need to play games, we need to read sci-fi to help imagine that that's

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.240
possible to look outside of earth, to look outside, look up on the stars.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.680
Then we can actually travel out there.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:32.760
I don't know.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.520
There's power to sci-fi to do that.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.120
I guess you shouldn't feel the pressure of that.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.440
I don't know if I'd make the leap now.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.440
That's all that what we're doing might now maybe, you know, one of our, you

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.880
hopefully it might inspire some young people who are headed in that direction.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.000
I'm like, Oh, I thought about getting into space and space exploration and being

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.600
an engineer or doing these things.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.840
And I played this game and, you know, it really sparked that interest in me.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.520
So I'm going to go take that as a field.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.120
And maybe that's the person who goes and does some of these things.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:10.760
Yeah.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:16.320
Because of the next couple of decades, likely a human being will step foot on

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.240
Mars, which are the first steps towards us becoming multi-smile planetary.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.120
And then if you read some of the stuff they're doing with the James Webb

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.280
telescope and them being able to look for signs of life on other planets.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.120
It's quite fascinating.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.040
And you know, recent stuff I read say they think in 20 years, they will.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.720
So it's actually quite encouraging to think.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.280
I suppose the dream of mine, like in our lifetimes that we discover life on another planet.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.480
Yeah.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.840
Especially if it's intelligent life.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.000
I've been talking to a lot of biologists and a lot of folks.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.080
I imagine there's life everywhere out there.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.400
The numbers are, would say so.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:13:59.640
Yes.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.120
The challenging question is what it looks like and how much of it is intelligent.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.880
So a lot of biologists tell me the big, the big difficult leap is from the prokaryotes

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.960
to the eukaryotes.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.720
So like the complex life, it could be that a lot of our universe is just filled with bacteria.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.920
I believe if I'm understanding it right, that there's two ways they're going to look at

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.080
planets when they can look at, you know, they can read, Hey, this planet has this kind of gas.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.080
They can now look at the ones that are created by potential life forms.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.600
And then the ones that are created, the byproducts of industry, there's only certain

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.920
ones that are created if you have a society there.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.480
And that they can start looking on these types of, in these types of star systems and these

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.400
planets, but it takes a lot of time because you have to book time in that telescope.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.360
You have to like look at that planet over a long period of time.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:15:00.320
But in theory, given enough time, given the amount of space out there, we would find one.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:06.400
That would be a cool thing in this short life of ours to find out definitively that there is an

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.800
an industrial intelligence civilization out there before you contact them.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:20.400
So like die, end your life, not knowing the rest of the story, but just know that it's out there.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.120
That's a cool.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.600
And then if you have kids be like, well, this one's on you.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.480
F this, I'm out.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.160
And I'm fascinated by what it would do to the way, I think in a positive way, the way

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.520
humanity thinks about itself here.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.320
Like, no, there's, there is a definitively other life out there.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.600
I mean, both things.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.800
If there isn't life out there, that's also a huge responsibility.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.000
Both are super exciting.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.040
If we're alone, it's super exciting because there's a responsibility to preserve whatever

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.640
special thing we have going on here.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.760
Whether you call it the flame of consciousness or whether it's consciousness or intelligence,

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.120
that's a special thing.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.840
Preserve it, have it expand.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.880
But if there's others out there, I mean, that like that sparks that drive for exploration

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.080
of reaching out into the stars and meeting them.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.720
Most of them probably want to kill us.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:28.640
So, but luckily we have the military industrial complex on earth that builds bigger and better

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.680
weapons all the time.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.480
Space force.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.600
Space force.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.480
It will both protect us and destroy all our enemies.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.480
This is 100% a video game we're living in.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.040
Okay, back to dragons.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.960
So blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls 6 is coming out, but are not going to tell me.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.040
I have a vague idea.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.000
Okay, vague idea.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.320
So like if you have the quantum mechanical interpretation that allows for multiple

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.360
universes, in the universe where you didn't blink, what would that, Todd, tell me about

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.720
the year it's coming out?

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.000
Would it be 2025?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.520
That's a trick question.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.320
Or 26.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.920
I've been asked that question many ways, but never like that.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.840
Yeah, I thought I would try to sneak it up.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.640
I mean, there is, of course, no answer because-

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:33.200
I wish it was soon, you know, like we don't, we want them out too, you know, and I wish

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.480
they didn't take as long as they did, but they do.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.960
And look, I mean, if I could go back in time, would never have been my plan to wait as long

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.600
as it's taken for it.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.800
So you love that world, the Elder Scrolls world?

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.760
Look, it's part of why I've spent more time there than anything else in my life probably,

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.160
right?

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.120
So I deeply love it.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:17:59.760
We all do.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.800
It's a part of us.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.320
And, you know, when you aren't doing it for a while, you really do miss it.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.720
And when I look at what we're doing, have planned for that game, and that was in a meeting

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.120
yesterday, I was like, I just want to play all this right now.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.480
But it, you know, we're going to make sure we do it right for everybody.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.880
And we do have to approach it.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.280
People are playing games for a long time.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:35.440
You know, Skyrim's 11 years old, still probably our most played game.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.200
And so we don't see it slowing down.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.960
And people will probably be playing it 10 years from now also.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.960
So you have to think about, okay, people are going to play the next Elder Scrolls game

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.680
for a decade, two decades.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:58.160
And that does change the way you think about how you architect it from the get-go.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.240
What are some elements that changed the way, like, how do you make a game that's playable

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.120
for 20 years?

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.920
Well, we're trying to figure that out.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.800
But there are some elements I should pause on that.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.880
You know, part of me, I'm of course asking jokingly, I'm excited for it.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.280
But I think Skyrim is an amazing game.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.080
Still, you know, I really enjoy it still.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.240
Yeah.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:20.880
And you know what?

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:26.560
The content, even if you step away from it for a while, then play what I'll put, say,

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.240
the vanilla version without mods.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.200
If you go and haven't played in a while, there's always a new way to play it.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.960
But then if you look at the mods and what creators are doing to it,

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.880
we think that is just awesome.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.680
It's something that we've always supported.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.120
We're going to keep supporting.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.480
We've hired a large number of modders that are now professionals.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.280
We want to support the people who are doing on their own so they can be professionals

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.920
on their own.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.320
How do you create a world that's moddable?

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:03.040
So you think of designing the game from the start as that enables mods?

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.240
Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.760
So it starts with us, like everything we're doing.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.400
Okay, a modder, a content creator is going to have to do it, use our tools.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.080
Now, we do clean them up for release.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.640
Because if you're like a developer in-house, you can deal with some kludginess

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.760
when you're putting stuff together.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.120
When you put it out for people, we do clean a lot of it up.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.760
And there's still a lot, obviously, a learning curve there.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.200
But look, we have people who have been doing it for 20 years with us.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.760
What's involved with modding?

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.160
I'm actually quite newbish at this.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:34.400
Okay.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.000
I'm almost afraid to ask because now that you explained to me, I fear I will spend

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.480
a very large amount of time creating mods.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.960
Well, we have an editor you can download on Steam, the creation kit for our games.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.640
And then it loads up the world and you could do something really, really small,

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.640
like change the color of the weather.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.640
And it creates a little plug-in file, we call it, a modification of the game.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.880
And then you can run your game with that.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.960
It's on console now, the mods, not the editing.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.480
And it's just been incredible.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.040
Our community there has been amazing what they do with the games.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.360
So a lot of it is the visuals.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.360
A lot of people do visual things because it's the easiest thing to do first,

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.880
or they'll build a new space.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.800
There's some great things with like, I love the Khajiit follower mod for Skyrim.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.600
It's awesome.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.760
There have been quest lines.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.720
Those things just take a really, really long time.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.600
And so someone who's going to do that, that's almost like, it takes them a long time.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.720
It's more than a hobby.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.600
And we're always looking at ways that we can make it like, hey,

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.360
they can turn a career into it because it's just awesome.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:56.000
What about, is there any possibility in doing a mod for some of the AI stuff?

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.920
There is, and I've seen some, but to really move it along,

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.000
if they're using the tools that we already put out there,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.880
so to really move the AI along, you'd have to get in the code,

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.720
which some people have figured out ways to hack in and do things with script extenders.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.240
But for the most part, like really pushing it, it does take us,

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.360
which is why you see when we have a new game come along,

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:23.520
the palette that they have is there's so many more things they can do.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.480
Well, I've built bots that play the driving games,

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:35.280
but they do that by just reading the screen and doing basic, not basic,

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.920
it's actually pretty complicated, but computer vision and doing the control.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.160
But you're basically assimilating the human player to do that for Skyrim

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.400
or for some of the open world games.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.240
That's literally, you have to create AGI to be able to play those open.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:50.960
Well, maybe not.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.560
Maybe you can create a super dumb, like just a two handed sword

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.720
and just keep swinging until everybody's dead.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.560
Look, there's some bot stuff out there that does it.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.360
We have some very, very dumb bots that we use to run through the world to test it

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.080
that we'll deploy on a whole bunch of servers just to, we do it every day.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.680
We run through every space.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.720
We're doing Starfield.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.120
And then just running, they're all out there.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.560
Well, it does it very quickly.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.840
It loads up every place in the game and runs around a little bit

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.760
and then loads the next place and runs around a little bit.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.520
We're just testing, like did it crash?

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.400
What's the memory growth?

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:25.840
Get a report.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.080
Here are all the places where the frame rate wasn't up to snuff.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.840
And then we do have one that will play on its own.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.000
It's heavily scripted, but it lets us test.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.920
Every time we make a build, there's a bot that runs through

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:40.720
the first one or two main quests.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.520
It'll just play it.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.840
That way we know, did we break anything?

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.040
Because you don't want to waste QA's time.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.960
You guys broke it again within five minutes.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.800
Yeah, so that's for like broken stuff.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.160
I wonder if you can build a bot

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.600
that estimates the quality of the experience.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.160
Oh my gosh.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.960
Okay, can you do that?

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.760
But just like the number, like how boring or not boring,

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.960
the boring meter.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.920
How many times you die?

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.680
How many times you die?

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.520
Is death boring or exciting?

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.160
That's the question.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.840
I mean, I feel like there's a balance to be struck there

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.920
because you always want to be in fear of death.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.480
Yeah, we always, we have this chart at work we use,

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.120
which is like, if you think about any game that you've played

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.080
that you've put down, it's either about a frustration

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.040
slash confusion or boredom.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.600
You got to put the player right in the middle of that.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.800
But I've sometimes put down games from frustration

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.360
only to return again, stronger.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.160
Dark Souls.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:42.660
Yeah.

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:48.020
Yeah, so I mean, the challenge, that's part of it.

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:49.460
Well, I don't know.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.380
Actually, Skyrim, I'm one of those.

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.220
I mean, I'm sure there's all kinds of humans

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.500
that you've interacted with about what they enjoy.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:01.860
But to me, I could enjoy Skyrim on any difficulty level.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.140
It doesn't all of it.

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:04.740
So it depends.

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.100
The open world nature of it is what's really compelling.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.700
Not necessarily the challenge of the particular quest

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.200
and so on.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.300
But I'm not sure if that's the same experience for everybody.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.740
Do you play the survival mode?

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.580
There's a survival mode in Skyrim.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.020
It was a creation club thing.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.180
It does some hunger.

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.380
It does hot and cold.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.340
It does some other systems that make it,

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.580
you know, in our minds, more believable.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:35.460
It was actually a creation club thing made by an external creator

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.140
who is now full time with us.

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:42.340
So can we actually, thinking about Starfield,

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.940
thinking about Elder Scrolls 6,

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:50.180
go through the full life of a video game you've created?

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:54.260
So what's it take to take a game from the idea

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.620
to find the final product?

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.420
What are the different steps along the way?

01:25:59.220 --> 01:25:59.860
Great question.

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.140
Well, usually it starts with, I mean, honestly,

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.940
lunchtime conversations with a number of us.

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.700
Hey, we think we want to do this.

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:10.900
This is what it's going to be like.

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.540
I mean, look, with an Elder Scrolls, you know you're going to do it.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.700
It's a matter of when.

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.580
You say, okay, what's the tone we're going for, right?

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.380
Where's it set?

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.860
So we usually start with the world.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.020
And then we're always overlapping.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.820
So while we're making one game,

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:33.140
as we're getting in the throes of it or wrapping it,

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.420
probably by the midpoint of one game,

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:41.460
we've had enough conversations to understand

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.980
what the next one's going to be.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.060
What are the big ticket?

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.260
Like, where's it set?

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:46.980
What's the tone?

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:50.820
Is there a big ticket feature or two that make it really unique?

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.060
And then when we're finishing one game,

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.900
we start prototyping.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.980
Sorry, before that, we start concepting.

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.500
So we'll do concept art.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.860
And for one reason or another,

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:09.300
I usually have the beginning of the game worked out.

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.460
I like to think about, okay, how's the game start?

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:12.580
What's the player do first?

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.100
We do music early, you know?

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.140
So take Elder Scrolls VI.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.180
We forgot where it's set.

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:18.900
What's the tone?

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.260
What are the big features?

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:22.100
We discussed the beginning of the game,

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.620
which we've had for a very long time.

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:25.060
Where's it set again?

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.280
Yep.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.420
In Tamriel.

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:29.560
And—

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.100
All right, damn it.

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:34.020
Well, at least we know we narrowed it down.

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.660
That would be epic if it was like a portal into another dimension.

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.300
Anyway.

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.420
Then I like to do music.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:46.740
So we've already done a take on the music for Elder Scrolls VI.

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:50.740
So you can sit there with the concept art and the music and you can feel it.

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.140
No, the music, we put in the teaser for it.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.660
This was 2018.

01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.340
We've taken that further, obviously.

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.060
And again, we're working on the world.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.860
You're then doing concepting and design for the world.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:08.340
And then once we're wrapping up one game,

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.380
we can really start prototyping the new one.

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.260
And you're usually building kind of your initial spaces.

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:16.340
And so we do like to do like a first playable,

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:21.300
a smaller section of the game that we can sort of prove out and show to people,

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:22.900
hey, this is how it feels different.

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:23.780
This is what it looks like.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.300
This is what's unique about it.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.140
Then we turn that into a larger chunk.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.540
When more of the team comes on, when the other game is done.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.660
And that's still what we call a VS vertical slice.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.420
So you still don't have the full team on it.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.500
And it's a larger chunk of the game that you can play.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:45.380
And then once you feel good about that, you're going to bring on the rest of the team.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.900
And we're fortunate that the other games we've done are popular enough

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.780
that we can be doing DLC and content and those kind of things

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.060
while we're getting the one going.

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:57.220
And then we're at full production where we're sort of at maximum size.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.540
We just call that production.

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.220
That's like the full production period.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:08.500
And that depending on the game, you know, can run a year or two years, maybe more.

01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:15.220
And then you kind of have a finalizing final six months to a year on a game,

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:17.300
which is okay, we've built everything now.

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:22.740
And usually it needs a lot of glue, where we have a lot of very different elements

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:26.340
that maybe aren't clicking together the way you want outside of the regular polish

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.540
for levels and features.

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.300
And we're shaving and gluing and sticking things together

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:36.660
so that it's not the schizophrenic game experience that things flow from one into another.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:39.060
In terms of story, like on that level?

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.420
It's really, no, usually the story, the designers have done a really good job.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.180
It's more about game features.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:48.820
And then how they interact with the story or, hey, I went from this experience to this experience,

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:54.260
or picking flowers and alchemy feels like a different game than,

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.740
and then how is another character referencing that?

01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:02.660
And how is that intersecting with the skill system and the interface?

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:07.300
Like the skill system and the interface is the party host.

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.820
If you think about a game, it's like, oh, I'm going to play this game.

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:16.980
If you think about a game, most games, particularly what I like to do,

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:22.500
is that's your person who says, welcome, do this, go here, check this out.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:27.940
And the skill system and the way it reacts on the HUD, the interface of the game,

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.820
is sort of leading you to the next thing.

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:39.540
And once you get that flow down and the rate at which the game is giving you activities,

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.900
then you're in what we describe as a game flow.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.620
And it's not till really that last year.

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:49.780
Before that, the game flow was just, it doesn't even exist

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.540
in the way that you see it in the final game.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.060
And that's what we were working on a lot that last year.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.540
So at which point is the set of skills, the skill tree,

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.060
the characteristics of the role-playing aspect of it, when is that set, the ideas?

01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:10.500
We usually have it in the beginning, but it's just, we know it won't be done

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:11.940
until that last year.

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:14.420
We'll have one, but we know it's going to get honed

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:20.340
because it's not until you really see, okay, how impactful is that one?

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.380
How much are you doing it?

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.140
And the main combat ones, they always win.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:28.740
You always know the players will drift toward the combat type skills

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:31.220
because every character needs some amount of that.

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:34.100
But okay, well, how important is cooking?

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.300
How important is alchemy?

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.900
How important is these other type of activities?

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:42.420
And then how do you balance them where when you load up the skill menu,

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.460
it isn't automatically, give me plus 10 damage.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.900
How do you get the, what about the combat system?

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.780
That does seem to be an important part of a lot of games.

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:54.500
Started in the beginning.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.460
Yeah. Every time.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.060
Yep. So usually we're making that first playable.

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:02.900
It's an area you can go through some amount of dialogue, some amount of combat.

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.020
How do you get the combat right?

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:09.300
What's the secret to a great combat system?

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:14.420
Well, first on a control side, helping the player when they don't realize it.

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.780
There's a lot of tricks you can do with magnetism

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.100
in terms of the controller and where the attacks go.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.700
So it has to feel the minute to minute has to feel really good in your hand.

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.340
So there's a lot of animation time, right?

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:28.500
And changing animation so they're impactful

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.860
and they happen at a rate that the player feels.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:34.420
Like they're really doing it.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:39.940
And then ultimately it's the illusion that the enemies are smart,

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:45.940
but they really are there for you to kill them, right?

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:51.380
So they do a lot of things to just let themselves get killed.

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:54.740
They're not near as smart, near as smart as we can make them.

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.420
Because it turns out that is not fun.

01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.900
Right. So there's a balance between, but there's a,

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.700
that is, I guess, a kind of AI.

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:09.220
And it's a very intimate interaction with an AI

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.220
because it's like, there's a lot of stuff going on.

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:15.460
It's not just very kind of shallow, like a dialogue or something like that.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:19.380
It's like, there's a time critical nature of it.

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.820
A lot of stuff is happening.

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.140
And if anything feels off, it's going to feel wrong.

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.660
Yep. All the games do it.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:31.700
You know, it's not unique to what we do in terms of how they handle combat scenarios.

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.700
And there's some games that just do it extremely well in terms of,

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.340
even in multiplayer where you're playing bots and most people don't know it,

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:48.820
or how a multiple enemy scenario is really, you know, they don't all shoot you.

01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.420
They trade off. They're going to wait.

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.140
And I was like, all right, I'll just wait my turn because we don't want to overwhelm them.

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.580
But he feels like you feel like you're overwhelmed when there's six enemies,

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.220
but, you know, a good game will.

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.540
No, they're going to take their time.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:05.780
Is there a science to it? Is it art? Is it like?

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.900
Yes. Yes. I mean, it's all of that.

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.460
So it's like an iterative process where you try different things.

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.580
You have different ideas.

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.020
There's a lot of animation.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.580
There's a lot of timing, animation work, HUD work also.

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:22.100
How does the reticule change?

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.780
What are the little sound effects?

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:29.460
What about like the gamify like that is fun?

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.220
Again, that goes back to the winning, you know.

01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.100
So winning is fun.

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.060
Yes.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.020
Death is not.

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.060
Yes. Let the Wookie win.

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:42.660
I like how you have to dumb down the AI to make it fun for humans.

01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:49.540
Because if you didn't, it would just be just slaughter nonstop for all humans.

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.220
That's good to know.

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:58.580
What about things like you said cooking, like crafting,

01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:05.060
making potions and poisons and smithing weapons and armor cooking?

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.460
How do you get that right?

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.820
What's interesting there?

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:14.260
It's such an interesting like, you know, a lot of games don't have that kind of thing.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.500
So what role does that play in the game?

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:21.860
I think we really cracked it in a way I liked with Fallout 4, actually,

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.540
where we're doing Elder Scrolls.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:27.060
We have like the flowers and things and you have alchemy.

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.220
And we took this to, okay, if it's post-apocalyptic,

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:36.420
what if everything in the world was an alchemical ingredient in some kind?

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:38.260
So breaking it down to their components.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:41.780
So when you walk around a world like that, again, we like the simulation.

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.700
We like the forks and spoons and the cups and all that.

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:46.180
Okay, how can I use those to create?

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:52.580
I love how it starts working in Fallout 4 where, okay, all these things I find,

01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:58.500
they have some value in creating or crafting outside of

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.940
a cup is worth one gold piece or one cap.

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.500
By the way, I have to be honest, I haven't played Fallout 4.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.700
I played Fallout 3.

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.140
I thought that was a legendary game.

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:15.620
Can you make a case for Fallout 4 that I should or should I just wait till Fallout 5?

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.380
I think you should play Fallout 4.

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.260
Love to hear your thoughts.

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:18.740
All right.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.780
It's a different game.

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:20.740
Skyrim is too.

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.220
I mean, it's...

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.220
We try to make them all different.

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.140
They are fundamentally different.

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.340
They all have their own tone.

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:29.300
Yeah, so Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are intentionally a very different tone.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.020
Oh, really?

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:30.580
Interesting.

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.620
So what's that world like?

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:37.620
What's the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout?

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.380
If you could just briefly take a stroll into that world tone-wise.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:44.820
Well, look, in entertainment, there's a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff.

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:51.380
And what makes Fallout tick is the world that was left behind.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.220
The world that blew itself up.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:57.300
This utopian world of nuclear energy and it all goes wrong.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:00.740
So I love the American dream of that.

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.380
How they visioned the future in the 50s and that blowing itself up.

01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.420
I think that's a super interesting place to explore,

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.220
which is why we always wanted to play in that world.

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:21.300
And it does an amazing job of weaving the drama and darkness of a post-apocalyptic world with

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:23.700
B-movie humor.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:30.820
It winks at the camera sometimes, often actually.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:40.900
And that when you're in that world, it just has its own unique flow and vibe.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.100
Outside of anything else kind of in that genre.

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.420
So Elder Scrolls has, or at least Skyrim has some humor.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.100
Has a little bit.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:52.420
But Fallout leans into it a little more.

01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:54.020
A little bit more, a little bit more.

01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.540
Yeah, yeah, it does.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.820
It's like ironic humor.

01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.700
It's the duck and cover.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.820
It's get under your desk if the bomb comes and everything will be fine.

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:02.740
It's that type of humor.

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:07.460
So the funny thing is I do think Fallout 3 is one of the greatest games ever.

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:14.900
You've said that quote, when we started Fallout 3 in 2004, we obviously had big ideas of what

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:15.940
we could do with it.

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:20.900
And I talked to a lot of people from ex-developers to press folks, to fans.

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:22.100
What made it special?

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.460
What are the key things you'd want out in a new one?

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:30.020
The opinions, and I'll put this mildly, varied a lot.

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:35.700
But they would all end the same like a stern father pausing for effect.

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.940
But do not screw it up.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.140
How do you not screw up a game?

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.860
You have not screwed up many games yet.

01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:46.420
I mean, back to the Fallout one.

01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:55.140
Yeah, that was, look, that I remember that we were met with a lot of skepticism in terms of,

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.660
oh, what are they going to do with this?

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.180
It was a beloved kind of isometric turn-based role-playing game.

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.780
You know, awesome for when it came out.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.140
And actually it was announced.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.540
We had finished Morrowind, but not announced Oblivion.

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.540
But because we'd acquired the rights, we had to announce it.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.860
Because I think Interplay was a public company.

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:14.500
I don't remember.

01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.060
I just remember we had to announce it, and we're thinking there, well, you're going to,

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.740
we're going to piss off all the Elder Scrolls fans because we're announcing a Fallout game.

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.620
We're probably going to piss off the hardcore Fallout fans because

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:29.780
we didn't make the original and clearly we'll probably make a different kind of game.

01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:36.420
So I do remember, you know, there was a lot of concern with all of our fans

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.380
and fans of Fallout at the time.

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:44.180
And so I think it was pretty rewarding for us

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:48.980
that that game found the audience and success that it did.

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.020
It's one of my favorite projects that I've ever worked on.

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:59.540
And because it was so fresh for us and we had a very clear, like,

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.580
even before we had the rights, like, this is the game we're going to make.

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.580
Like, this is the kind of thing we're going to do.

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.300
And we had done Morrowind, then we were working on Oblivion.

01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:13.140
And it was kind of a breath of fresh air to do it.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.140
And what's kind of remarkable is Fallout 3 comes out just, you know,

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.980
two and a half years after Oblivion.

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.540
And we did all this DLC for Oblivion.

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:27.540
So we were really, really kind of prolific in how our development, how it was going.

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:34.580
So I just remember enjoying making that game so much

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.660
because everything we were doing was new.

01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.260
Which as to the world creation,

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.220
was there some innovation, like, technically that was happening?

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.660
The world creation, like, it was, you know, obviously a different look,

01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:50.100
even though some of us, very few of us had worked on the Terminator things.

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:53.380
The VAT system, the skill system.

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.460
And we loved the original game so much,

01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:00.340
so you felt this responsibility to bring it back in a big way

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.620
and reintroduce it in a way that, you know,

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.900
as much as we could scratch the same itch

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:11.060
when you played the original game that had the same tone.

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.780
Are there some favorite things to you about that world

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.020
that just kind of connect you to the humor?

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:19.220
Fallout 3, I love, again, I usually start with the beginning.

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.580
I love the beginning. I love the character generation.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:26.100
If you go, if you played it a lot or you're developing it,

01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.700
it starts to feel really long.

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:33.460
But the first time you play it or second, I just think it's awesome.

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:38.100
And this idea, it's a hard thing to say, okay,

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:42.260
we want you to feel like your character on the screen.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:44.260
Even when you play like a Skyrim,

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.020
you don't know what you were doing before that.

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:50.740
But Fallout 3, you were born in the vault

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.900
and you raised in the vault and you lived in the vault,

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:55.140
but you experience a part of that.

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.540
So it's a very different, when you step out,

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:02.740
I think you're really, I mean, the visuals are the visuals,

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.380
but the emotional moment of stepping out of the vault,

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:07.300
you feel like you lived your whole life in the vault.

01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.340
And you feel like you have a sense of your past.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.620
Right. And I need to find my father.

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:20.260
We should, isn't it possible to have that sense

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.460
with like Elder Scrolls, like a life story,

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.140
like childhood trauma and stuff?

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:27.140
Back to the human.

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.780
I mean, you'd have to like, look, you do some of that stuff,

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.860
but they go through menus, you know, pick your background.

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:32.900
We're doing that in Starfield.

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:33.620
Hey, pick your background.

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.140
What were you doing before this moment?

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.500
Can you pick your traumas and stuff?

01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:42.420
Say hey, if you want to make a mod, go for that.

01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.260
And then also make a mod for like a therapist.

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.380
But a lot of it is in your head.

01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.260
So you're going to do that.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.940
You're going to pick this background and do these things.

01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:49.300
And you're sort of like, this is who I was.

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:49.620
Yeah.

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.220
And we intentionally with Elder Scrolls

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.260
kind of make it as much of a blank slate.

01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.380
You know, Elder Scrolls is a little bit more

01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.300
of a blank slate game to who you are,

01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.940
which has a lot of positives.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.180
And Fallout for us has been more of a,

01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.340
this was your life before.

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:05.940
Here's who you were.

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:06.980
Go be who you want to be.

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.420
But this is the background.

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:09.940
It's a little more strict.

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:13.300
Now this might reveal something about me.

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:17.940
And speaking of childhood trauma,

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:23.220
but I feel like there's a lot of,

01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.820
a lot of the meaningful experience of a role-playing game

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.820
is not just the development of the character

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:31.540
throughout the game, but the initial character creation.

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.660
Like you said, is there something to that process

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.340
that you found to be powerful?

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.900
Like the design of that process,

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.900
because you think so much about that beginning.

01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.860
What, how much should be controlled?

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.100
How much should be defined?

01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:49.940
The interface itself,

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:52.420
the visual appearance of the character too.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.860
Because I feel like that you're loading in,

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.620
you start to load in the world

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.340
that you're about to enter by creating that character, right?

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.380
Yeah, we think about it a lot.

01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.740
It's a really, really good comment and question.

01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:09.060
And it's more than,

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.260
it has to set the whole stage.

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.380
It has to peak your interest for the world you're going to enter.

01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:21.300
And we've done it so many different ways

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:26.580
in terms of when you actually go to make your character,

01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.260
when you're making the choice.

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:35.460
And one of the things over time that we've wanted to avoid

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.180
is people starting over.

01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:44.180
So there's a lot of intentionality around the types of choices you have

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:46.180
that can be undone or not undone.

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.460
Because what you, what game players want to is I'll play it

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.060
and then I'll make a new character.

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.740
But sometimes they do that because they realize

01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:56.500
they made the wrong type of character.

01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:00.580
And as a designer, you don't want that to happen.

01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.340
So some people, and we get this comment in Elder Scrolls,

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.740
oh, you simplified it.

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.540
No, no, no, no.

01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:12.180
We move those choices into the gameplay

01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:17.060
so that you don't make this character in the beginning

01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:21.380
and then eight hours later realize you make a horrible mistake.

01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:24.100
And so, okay, I'm going to start out like that.

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.020
To me is a really, really bad experience.

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:30.100
Also like life itself, but yes, go ahead.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.380
But like life is, okay, so you can then...

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:34.660
Fix it in game.

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:35.460
Right.

01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:38.260
I wish I had learned archery.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.020
Well, I'm going to start tomorrow.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:41.940
So you can do that.

01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.180
Like the Skyrim character system is really designed around that.

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.020
All you pick is like, what's your race?

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.540
And that gives you some things,

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:51.860
but there's nothing you can't get then on your own.

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:54.660
It mostly, it sounds weird,

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:59.700
but you mostly want that beginning character generation to be visual,

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.660
which you then can also change in the game.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:10.260
And some starting skills that get you off to the type of play that you want.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:14.100
But if you discover you don't like that type of play as you play,

01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:16.500
you can move your character along.

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:23.220
So we have moved away post-oblivion to a classless,

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.980
meaning you don't have a strict character class,

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:30.100
warrior, mage, thief, whatever in our games.

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.580
And that's continuing for the...

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:36.420
Are you like thinking of Elder Scrolls 6?

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.900
You're already thinking about that kind of stuff.

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:42.420
So you think of early on, like you said,

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.180
the first few experiences in the game,

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.380
you're already thinking through them.

01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.020
Yep.

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:46.660
Yeah.

01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.340
We know what the first few hours are like.

01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:53.700
We know what the character system is basically like.

01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:57.220
So tonally, what's the difference to you

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:03.460
between Oblivion, Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Elder Scrolls 6?

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.260
Good to me, stuff blends together.

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:13.700
But Oblivion, that's when you can make spells and stuff.

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.420
You can do it in Morrowind as well.

01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:18.500
Oblivion has some more guardrails on it.

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.740
Morrowind is where you can really go.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.460
And Daggerfall.

01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.380
I don't remember if you can make spells in Arena.

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:26.260
I think you can.

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:27.940
Someone will correct me.

01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.140
You definitely can in Daggerfall.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.260
It gets crazy in Morrowind.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:32.420
You can somewhat.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:34.420
And then we start putting guardrails on it

01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.700
because people started breaking the game in certain ways.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:37.940
Yeah.

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:39.300
Why is it about to break the game?

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.060
Like you always want it to be...

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.700
Well, there's like one people love in Morrowind

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.260
where you can make these recall stones

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:51.620
and you could teleport to different areas

01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:53.140
which you really need in that game.

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.900
They break so many quests.

01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:55.460
Yeah.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.580
And so as we...

01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:01.540
Any quests, we would do this exercise of designing a quest

01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.780
and then someone would say, and then I recall away.

01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.140
Okay, the quest is broken.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.860
And then one day someone says,

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:09.780
can we just get rid of that spell effect?

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:10.820
Everyone's like, yes, please.

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.980
That's what allowed us to make better content.

01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.380
Tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.700
How do you create a compelling quest?

01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.020
Because there's all kinds of personalities of humans

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:23.540
that play these games, right?

01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.660
Because I like the grind.

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:29.940
Well, look, there's multiple flavors of a compelling quest.

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:35.860
Some of them have very good upfront storytelling.

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.940
You just like the story and the NPC that's giving you this task

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.900
and you'll go through a more handcrafted experience

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:48.900
that the designers have done a really, really good job on the space.

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.740
It has some twister surprise in the middle

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:57.940
and then the ending has some multiple options

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:00.740
that the player feels like they got to do something.

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:01.780
They made an interesting choice.

01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.980
But the best ones for me are actually where

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.500
all of that was far more open-ended.

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:12.260
The how I am going to accomplish this task

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:18.100
is completely up to me

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:20.740
and I'm going to find some ingenious solution.

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:24.420
A silly, this sounds very basic.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.580
It's going to sound quite cliche and silly.

01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:30.740
Go find me five Daedric Hearts or whatever.

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.660
Find me X of something that's hard to get.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.460
You can give a simple story setup for that.

01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.580
And we're not telling the player where to get those.

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.180
And they think, now, where could I get those?

01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:48.340
And I actually find those to be just as rewarding

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:50.980
as the really handcrafted, well-done,

01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:54.820
a little bit more linear with an interesting choice at the end.

01:49:54.820 --> 01:50:00.420
If those objects are in the world in some believable way,

01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:03.700
that there's usually some challenge at getting them.

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:08.100
How do you place objects in a world in an interesting way?

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.780
Because it's a big part.

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:11.140
We have a level design.

01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:16.180
If they only knew how much we spend,

01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.500
we have a clutter group, a group of people who clutter.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:22.580
Clutter is all the stuff around.

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.980
It's like interior decorators for treasure and stuff and trash.

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:31.380
And they go through every space and they clutter it.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:34.340
Our level designers think about it a lot.

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.380
These also become landmarks for the player

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.420
when you're walking through a space and, oh, this is the place with this.

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:44.500
And there is a logic to making a good level.

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.700
Even if you walk by a little T-intersection,

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:52.340
that becomes a decision point in the player's head.

01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:53.620
Like, oh, I didn't go down that way.

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.500
But the more you do that, it looks easy on paper.

01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:00.420
But when you're playing a game, you actually want to limit those

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:05.060
because he's trying to keep track of all these decision points.

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.100
Then they get lost.

01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:07.940
And yes, we have maps.

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.820
But anytime the player is going to check a map in a place like that,

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:14.740
I feel that it's more of a backstop for certain players.

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.580
If they need to check the map, I feel like we've kind of failed.

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:20.820
Got it.

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.860
So there's a momentum to it.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.300
It just pulls them in.

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:26.980
And you know, look, you played a lot of games.

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.580
You played a lot of levels where you're just like,

01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.420
I'm a little confused or I don't know.

01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:34.020
And you play other levels where like, man, it was great.

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:34.820
I went through it.

01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.020
It was well-balanced.

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.300
I knew where I was going.

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:39.700
You don't want to ever be mazy.

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.220
As long as you know where you're going,

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.300
as long as you know you made those choices,

01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.260
then it feels fine.

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:48.980
But as far as the treasure and all of the loot,

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.580
it is really an art.

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.420
We will not do enough clutter and then we will over clutter.

01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.660
And then there's too much stuff everywhere.

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:01.140
And then we declutter every single game.

01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.660
I wish we got better at it.

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.340
It would save us a lot of time.

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:07.620
But you're constantly going by feel like this is not as too much.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:08.260
It's not enough.

01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:08.740
Right, right.

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:11.220
Because the other thing is, look, it creates...

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.540
People want to pick everything up.

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.580
They want to click everything.

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.460
So if you have too many things of importance in a room,

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:23.140
it actually makes you feel a little tight as a player.

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.780
You're like, well, I'm basically an idiot

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:27.060
if I don't pick all this stuff up.

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.220
You probably felt this way.

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:29.860
Yeah, for sure.

01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.260
And the moment where you decide,

01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.740
you're just like, I've clicked so many things in this room.

01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:38.260
I actually am going to leave that ammo canister there.

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.380
But you feel like a dope.

01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:41.540
You've probably experienced this.

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:46.180
Yes, but also you have a joy from if there's not many items

01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:48.020
and you found the one and you got it.

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.260
Right.

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:48.980
And you feel good.

01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:49.380
I got it.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.860
And then it's finding like, oh, I stuck my head in this corner

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.420
and I picked this lock and I opened this locker

01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:57.220
and there was this thing I've been waiting for.

01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:57.720
Yeah.

01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.220
What about rare and rare items?

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.540
That's an art, even more so of an art.

01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.700
I will say we have a ways to go there

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:13.220
in terms of finding the right drop rate for special items.

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.300
We call them your epic, rare, legendary.

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.340
You look at games like so many games do it.

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:22.820
And there are ones that you just play and love

01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:24.180
because they have it down.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:27.460
You know, Destiny 2 is great at it.

01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.820
Diablo, a series I love, you know, sort of famously Diablo 3,

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:33.780
which I think is great.

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.300
And they did an update.

01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.300
It mostly just changed the loot drops.

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.820
And it's like this whole new experience.

01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.940
And there's a really real art to it.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.420
I think that we're still learning.

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:46.180
We're still learning a lot and have to,

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:47.940
we're trying to get better at it

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.820
because it's one of those things

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.380
where it drives you through the game.

01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.060
It's fun to get the treasure.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.660
Diablo and Skyrim have this interesting quality

01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.780
of being extremely popular.

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:04.180
And there's a lore around like rare items.

01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:07.380
So it changes the dynamic of like

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:10.260
you could afford to have really rare items.

01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:10.900
Yes.

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:16.100
And then somebody finds it and that becomes like a thing.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.780
I mean, as you release a game,

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.660
a lot of people play and they start sharing stories and so on.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.060
It's so interesting because that's part of the game experience

01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.740
is the stories of others, right?

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.500
For us, a hundred percent.

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:31.700
Because we've been classically, with most of our stuff, single player,

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.140
that that water cooler shared experience,

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:36.420
we would have a thing like,

01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.100
we call them, did you know moments?

01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.220
Like we gotta have a bunch.

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:42.420
So you meet someone, they do, what are you doing?

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.420
And then they say, did you know?

01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:48.180
If you go here and do this, what did you know?

01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:53.620
And that to us is where of a lot of our community

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.500
has been sharing their stories.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.540
And here's what you can do.

01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.500
Has there ever been a temptation to create

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:05.540
not a single player game that's gigantic?

01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:07.300
That's what we did fall at 76.

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:11.140
We have Elder Scrolls online, not a game I created.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:14.340
But look, that started as more classic MMO.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.740
Know the folks, they're part of a company who made that game.

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.980
And it's insanely, insanely popular.

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:21.380
It is.

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:21.620
Okay.

01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.660
So I should try it out.

01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:24.900
They do some great storytelling quests,

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:27.380
like the actual mechanics aren't the same as Skyrim,

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:29.700
but the world is awesome.

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:31.140
They've just done an incredible job.

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.860
It's about to be 10 years for that game as well.

01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:39.620
And it's just great community around that.

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.820
Yeah, I haven't played,

01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:46.500
because there's a mobile Fallout game, right?

01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.380
I need to play that.

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.740
I was thinking of playing Diablo Mobile too.

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.500
I mean, you can debate the monetization,

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:55.700
but I would not, I think they did a, it's really fun.

01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:56.180
On Fallout?

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:57.460
Diablo.

01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.340
Oh, Diablo?

01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:00.100
Well, Fallout, I definitely recommend that one.

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.100
Fallout Shelter, completely different game.

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:02.340
Yeah.

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.620
Diablo Immortal is, I was very, very impressed with it.

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:06.100
I had a lot of fun.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:06.820
On the mobile?

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:07.060
Yep.

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:11.460
What's the challenge of designing a game for mobile versus the PC and console?

01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:15.060
Well, obviously the screen size, right?

01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:16.100
Is that what you feel first?

01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:22.660
What's the fundamental change in the philosophy of design?

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:26.180
Does it constrain, does it change the tone of the game?

01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:30.980
Well, we've done a few things and we have a new mobile game that we're working on

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.620
that we haven't announced yet that I'm in love with.

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:38.180
There are a couple of things that you approach on mobile.

01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:42.020
Now, I can give you sort of the classic mobile gaming thing and then what we do.

01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:50.980
A classic mobile gaming is really for short play sessions.

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:59.140
Because for the amount of people you're going to get, the number that have the amount of time

01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:03.940
to sit there for a long time and play it, like a console game or a PC game, is lower

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.340
because people are playing mobile games on the move or whatever.

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:10.980
And how it onboards you, because obviously most of them are free.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:16.340
So the tutorial, how the tutorial works, how it gets you into the game.

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:19.060
Because you haven't bought it, you haven't done this investment of buying it and then

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.660
saying, no, I'm going to learn it.

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:21.380
People don't care.

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.340
So really understanding how they get into the game.

01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:27.940
Those two things are really the magic to mobile gaming.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:30.900
We have found that with our games, particularly Fallout Shelter,

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.620
people will sit there for an hour or two.

01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:35.380
They will just sit there and play it.

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:38.260
Like large numbers of people will play it for hours a day.

01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:44.180
So there is a more, I don't know, addicting element to mobile?

01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.460
Because I guess you can spend more time with it.

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:51.220
If you look at kids these days, they can stare at their phone for hours.

01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:51.860
That's all they do.

01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:53.460
That's where they watch everything.

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:55.860
So it's also like a demographic thing.

01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:59.540
The younger audience, they would rather sit and stare at their phone

01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:02.740
than play it on a big screen.

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.900
I would just love to sort of list out throughout human history,

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:11.460
the evolution of sentences that began with, if you look at kids these days.

01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:13.380
It's true.

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.260
It's true.

01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:18.980
The kids of the kids these days will probably be talking while

01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:20.740
be doing like virtual reality.

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:22.820
I love mobile games though.

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:24.180
I play a ton of them.

01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.020
My favorite game this year is Marvel Snap.

01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:32.180
This card game from the folks who did Hearthstone.

01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.380
You should really play it.

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:34.740
If you like, do you like card games?

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:36.580
Do you like superheroes?

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:37.860
No.

01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:38.580
It's genius.

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:39.460
You don't like superheroes?

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:40.980
No, I don't like superheroes.

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:42.020
I never understood.

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:46.740
Listen, this is growing up in the Soviet Union.

01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:47.700
What?

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:49.220
I don't understand them at this.

01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:49.620
All right.

01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:50.900
Well, I don't understand.

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:52.420
You're wearing a costume.

01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:53.860
It's silly to me.

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:54.340
I can't.

01:58:54.340 --> 01:59:00.980
So you have to suspend like you have to be able to immerse yourself.

01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:03.540
And for some reason, there's something about costumes.

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:04.500
It doesn't get me.

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.580
But then again, I'm like into elves and dragons.

01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:07.940
So I don't understand.

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.580
And I'm fine.

01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:09.540
I get it.

01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:09.860
Yeah.

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.900
But the rest of the rest, at least the American,

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:14.340
the Western world disagrees with me.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:18.660
So even Batman, you have like little ears, but that's fine.

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.940
Well, back to Elder Scrolls Starfield.

01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:32.260
So one thing I didn't ask you about when you look at the timeline of five,

01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:34.660
six, seven, eight years, whatever it is to create a game,

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:38.100
what's the role of the deadline internally?

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:38.740
Not publicly.

01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:39.940
Keeps you honest.

01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:44.660
Do you try to keep in your own brain a deadline for the team a deadline?

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:45.220
Yeah.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:45.700
All the time.

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:49.460
And when you set that deadline early in the development,

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:54.900
do you try to set deadline like that's really tough to reach?

01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:58.180
No, we try to make it like, hey, this is our best guess.

01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:00.980
If you make it tough to reach, it's sort of, you know, you're going to miss it.

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:01.780
It's arbitrary.

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:07.540
We really try to keep ourselves honest because it will let you know where you're at.

02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:07.860
Right?

02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:08.820
We want to have first playable.

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:10.980
We want to be done with prototyping or design by this date.

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.260
We want to have a first playable this date.

02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:15.300
We want to have this, but look, you know, things happen.

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.100
Pandemic happens.

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:16.740
People go home.

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:21.460
It throws everything off or, you know, what you needed to do

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:24.100
because we're not just like making a game and then moving everybody on,

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:25.940
you know, what you needed to do.

02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.540
Like Skyrim was so popular.

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.460
We kept people on that game for longer.

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.780
So it delayed a little bit.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.740
We were doing with Fallout 4 at the time because we can't, you know, hey,

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.940
we really shouldn't move the people on Fallout yet

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.340
because we're doing these things in Skyrim and we should.

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:43.700
So it just sort of keeps you honest for where you're where you're at.

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.700
Does it get super stressful as you get closer?

02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:48.180
You tried to avoid announcing anything?

02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.460
Is there a temptation to announce?

02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.060
Well, I've done it always, right?

02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:55.780
I've announced, you know, Starfield were pretty, you know, loud with a release date

02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.700
that we then had to delay.

02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.660
So was that tough?

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:02.340
It was.

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:03.780
It was.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:04.820
But it was the right thing to do.

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:07.860
And how do you know it's the right thing?

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:11.940
Like when you when you sat down and looked at it, like this is not ready.

02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:15.780
It's not an exact science, but you can look at what needs to be done

02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:16.980
and the amount of time you have.

02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:21.620
And, you know, we've done it in the past where we can get it done.

02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:22.580
We believe we can.

02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:27.300
And so you're fighting that personal belief that you can get something done.

02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.180
But there's a lot of things that go into release date with marketing and publishing.

02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:39.380
And, you know, we've reached a point where on Starfield, where it was it was pretty

02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:45.460
clear to us, even though you want to say you can get it done, that the risk involved

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:49.460
with that to the to the fans of the game, to the team, to the company, we're part of

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:57.940
Xbox now to everybody was we should really we should really move it and give it the time it needs.

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:00.820
So you mentioned part of Xbox.

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:08.500
Microsoft bought Bethesda and Xanax for seven point five billion dollars.

02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.780
Well, what's it like joining the Xbox team?

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:16.660
You've you've I think written about it.

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:21.300
What's what are the what are the exciting aspects of that?

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:26.820
You know, when your company goes through a change like that, no matter what it is, even

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:30.980
if it's somebody that you've worked with for a long time, you never know what you're in for.

02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.460
You hope.

02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:39.220
And I had worked with them for since we started doing console stuff with Morrowind was, you know,

02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.580
they came to us, came to me and hey, you should make this game for the Xbox.

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:47.700
And so when they were making that console had a great experience with them.

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:50.660
And then on the 360 with Oblivion.

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:56.340
And so I guess the point is we felt that we had a very good relationship with everybody there.

02:02:57.060 --> 02:03:00.100
And we understood what their culture was.

02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:01.380
But you never really know.

02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:09.060
And and I mean this honestly, it's been awesome that the culture inside of Microsoft and Xbox

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:13.300
that that people see from the outside is the culture inside the way they talk about players.

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.020
The the way they'll invest in the players, the risks they'll take,

02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:26.100
the thoughtfulness from Phil Spencer on down has been, you know, feel really, really lucky.

02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.180
And then a game like Starfield where, look, we've had a lot of success with

02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:35.940
with the games that you talked about, but we've never been kind of the platform seller.

02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.500
You know, the game for a platform for a period of time.

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:43.220
And so, you know, there is a lot of pressure.

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:46.580
There's a lot of responsibility there to make sure we deliver for everybody.

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:51.460
Is there a chance that Starfield is exclusive to Xbox?

02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:52.660
It is. It is exclusive.

02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:53.780
It's officially already.

02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:54.580
Yep. Yes.

02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:58.740
So you're, I get it.

02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:01.380
So extra pressure also creating a new world.

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:07.220
Yeah, it's new, but keep in mind, for us, that exclusivity is not unique.

02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:11.460
Even though we've done PlayStation stuff and I think the PlayStation 5 is an insane machine.

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.660
They've done a great job and we've had great success on PlayStation.

02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.140
We were traditionally a PC developers in the beginning.

02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:23.700
We transitioned to Xbox, became our lead platform, like Morrowind's basically.

02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:29.060
Exclusive to Xbox, Oblivion was exclusive to Xbox for a long period of time.

02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:33.780
Skyrim DLC was, so we've done a lot of like our initial stuff is all Xbox.

02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:37.460
So we get into development and saying we're focused on Xbox and

02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.300
it's not abnormal for us in any way.

02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:42.500
It's been kind of the norm.

02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:48.020
And from a development side, I, you know, I like the ability to focus.

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:52.020
So our ability to focus and say, and have help from them,

02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:56.580
you know, the top engineers at Xbox to say, we are going to make this look incredible

02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:01.700
on the new systems is like from, from my standpoint, it's just awesome.

02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.540
What's the difference in creating the console versus the PC?

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:10.180
I also have to admit I've never, um, is this shameful?

02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:11.460
Actually, you should recommend to me.

02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:17.300
I've never played Skyrim or any, um, any of the games you've created on Xbox.

02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:18.100
Really?

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:18.500
Yeah.

02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:21.140
And on console, I played, I mean, I have to play very little.

02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:21.860
Yeah, sure.

02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:25.540
I mean, look, there's, there's the obvious interface part between mouse and keyboard

02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:26.500
and then a controller.

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:30.740
But when you're looking at hardware PCs, it's tough, right?

02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.780
Cause you're looking at, well, you know, what are their driver versions?

02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:37.460
What kind of monitor they have?

02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:40.420
What is the actual refresh rate of X, Y, and Z?

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.540
We're used to it, but if, you know, anyone will tell you,

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:48.740
give me the hardware that I know I'm writing it for, you know this.

02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:54.660
Um, and the, the series X is just a incredible machine.

02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:58.740
And now that you know what it is, you know what it is.

02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:02.660
And now that we're part of Xbox, getting, you know, the people who built it to show

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:06.900
you how to make it really, really dance is just awesome.

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.100
Is there a case to be made?

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:15.620
Did you get people that enjoy people that do both PC and Xbox that enjoy Xbox more?

02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:18.180
Like that, if they have a choice.

02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:18.420
Yeah.

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:19.620
They enjoy it.

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:24.980
I think that depends on, and look, now that you, you can kind of cross,

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:27.540
you can take your save and go between and all those things.

02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:28.340
You can?

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:28.840
Yeah.

02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.940
If you, it depends on, if-

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.060
For which games?

02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:34.180
So for the Skyrim?

02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:39.620
If you have the Game Pass PC version of it versus Steam.

02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:41.380
Not, not via Steam right now.

02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:42.020
Not via Steam.

02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:42.340
Got it.

02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.540
And so there's the Game Pass.

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:44.740
So I'm like learning about this.

02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:47.060
So there's a Microsoft, so this is going to be on Game Pass.

02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:51.220
And then you can, if, yeah, if you can take it from PC through Game Pass.

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:56.980
But I think it depends on like, like for me, like what's my physical mood?

02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.580
Do I want to lean back on a sofa?

02:06:58.580 --> 02:06:59.140
Exactly.

02:06:59.140 --> 02:06:59.380
Right?

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:04.340
Like the actual physicality of it is what determines where I want to play.

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.660
Do I want to be two feet from a thing right now?

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:08.900
And sometimes I like that.

02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:13.940
I am more of a console player just because I sit on my PC at work all day.

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:16.980
Like I play a lot of video games.

02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:22.100
So when I get home and I want to play something else, like I am a sofa screen controller person.

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:26.020
Let me ask you a ridiculous question.

02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.260
So you've created some of the greatest games ever.

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:32.820
I think there's, there's a, the question would be what's the best game of all time.

02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:33.220
All right.

02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:33.620
All right.

02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:34.580
Just give me a second.

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:35.700
Tetris?

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:36.580
All right.

02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:37.380
Yeah, that's interesting.

02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:38.580
Have you read the book on Tetris?

02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:39.060
No.

02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:39.700
You should read it.

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:41.300
Basically, someone who grew up in Russia.

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:42.580
Yep.

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:44.900
I'm sure there's an interesting story.

02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:47.540
The fact that there's a book about Tetris is fascinating.

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:48.820
Is there a book about Mario?

02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:56.420
I would love, I would love to find out more, but I think I would put personal, but Skyrim.

02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:57.860
I'll take that.

02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:58.500
Good answer.

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:03.940
At number one for me, which is tough.

02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:08.260
However you put it, because you could also make the case out of the Elder Scrolls series.

02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.700
Like, what do you actually value more?

02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:15.460
If you put Tetris and Super Mario up there, then like the credit goes to Morrowind maybe

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:16.260
over Skyrim.

02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:21.540
I don't, I don't know where the biggest leaps are, but overall I think it's Skyrim.

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:27.140
But for you, if you're not allowed to pick any of the games you were involved with,

02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.540
what are some interesting candidates for you?

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:37.620
There are just games that inspired the world, impacted the world, shook the world in terms

02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:39.220
of what video games are able to do.

02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:45.380
Well, first, I'm just sort of like hearing you say that you think Skyrim is the best

02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:48.420
game of all time is quite like, thank you.

02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.860
And it's, you know, incredible thing to hear.

02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:59.300
And, you know, when I think about, we'll have a couple of answers.

02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:00.900
There's ones that are like personal to me.

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.060
Ultima 7, it's probably.

02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.180
Can you talk about Ultima?

02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:06.340
Like you said that as an inspiration.

02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.820
I've never crossed that world.

02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:10.980
Well, it was.

02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.940
What kind of game is it?

02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:18.580
It's a role playing game, you know, circa 1992, 93, 94 and Ultima Online first, you

02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:22.020
know, really visual online world in that way.

02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:27.460
But for me, that was a virtual fantasy world where I had, you know, you could break bread,

02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:28.660
you could pick all this stuff up.

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:35.140
I mean, anyone who's played Ultimas and plays our stuff can see the kind of touchstones

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:37.300
and callbacks to that or inspirations.

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:45.540
And the other thing that I loved about Ultima was clearly the period that they were all

02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:47.540
different, right?

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:53.220
That they iterated and there weren't necessarily what I'll call a plus one sequel outside of

02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:58.020
Ultima 7 part two, clearly a plus one sequel, but they each had their own tone.

02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:03.620
I love like the boxes, you know, it's something that we get into as well.

02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:08.500
I love this idea that a game also is this tangible thing.

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:12.820
Oh, when you when you buy it, you know, the cardboard boxes and the way they were designed

02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.940
and Ultima 7 is black and Ultima 8 is the fiery gate and the paintings on them.

02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:23.620
And I just, you know, if you break your heart a little bit that that culture is a big gone.

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:25.140
A little bit, a little bit.

02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:31.460
And that's also why I like, you know, this goes to video gaming or any other digital

02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:34.900
things where digital ownership has great value to people.

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:41.380
So I like looking at my collections of games, even digitally, I want to see nice, you know,

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:46.260
in the same way you want to see nice album art, want to see nice cover art for our games.

02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:50.660
And we spend a lot of time in them so that you take a look at Elder Scrolls and Morrowind

02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:51.940
Oblivion and Skyrim.

02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:54.820
We want those boxes to look good next to each other.

02:10:55.620 --> 02:11:00.180
Going back to the video games, you know, I always mention Tetris because I think

02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:07.060
it's, you know, obviously I love virtual worlds and those kind of things, but for the time

02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:11.220
and what an interactive like video game, sort of the simplest form,

02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:20.820
I sort of think you can put Tetris in front of just about anybody and they'll enjoy it.

02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:27.780
And it's got some moment of challenge and it's just so elegant.

02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:34.020
It's like, to me, this very pure game that only works because it's a video game.

02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:40.340
And I think mobile games figured out some of the magic of Tetris, the simple.

02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:42.500
Some of them have, yeah.

02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:46.020
But Tetris did it a long, long time ago.

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:49.860
You can really create that immersive experience without.

02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:52.420
But for me, you know, the ultimate civilization.

02:11:53.220 --> 02:12:02.660
Yeah, as far as, you know, a grand strategy game, Pac-Man, I mentioned in terms of bringing

02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:08.020
games into the mainstream in a way that captured people that nothing before it had.

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:10.500
Super Mario, Donkey Kong, everything.

02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:13.460
Nintendo, probably the best game makers in the world still.

02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.540
They know who they are.

02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.500
They know what they want to do.

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.620
Always in awe of what they create.

02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:27.140
I've got to ask you about a game I haven't played, but people put up there as one of

02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:29.380
the greats, Zelda, Breath of the Wild.

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:31.300
Have you got any chance to play a lot of it?

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:31.860
Yes, yes.

02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:32.740
It's fantastic.

02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:33.460
It's fantastic.

02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:34.580
What do you think about?

02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:36.100
I mean, it's a very different experience.

02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:40.660
I played other Zeldas than the open walls you've created, but it is also an open world.

02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:46.500
It is at it's my favorite Zelda because obviously like open world stuff and.

02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:50.500
The one thing that they do really, really well is they don't constrain you.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:53.860
Some people, you know, even some of the things we do constrain you a little bit more.

02:12:53.860 --> 02:13:00.420
Zelda says, here's the whole thing and you are constrained by the actual

02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:07.380
player abilities you haven't earned yet, not some arbitrary barriers.

02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:10.420
And so I think they just did a phenomenal job.

02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:11.300
It's a magical game.

02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:13.300
It really feels open.

02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:14.980
It's because it truly is.

02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:15.460
Yes.

02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:22.180
What about, I mean, I just like asking you about some open world, a very different one

02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:27.540
is the world of either Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption.

02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:28.580
Both love.

02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:34.580
I would put GTA three, Grand Theft Auto three up there with the landmark kind of usher in

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:39.540
the open world when that comes out on the PlayStation two, even though there was GTA

02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:45.780
one and two, this was an all new thing with the mobster storytelling.

02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:49.380
Is that the first 3D version I guess?

02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:55.300
It was, then Vice City is kind of a fast follow, which could be my favorite one.

02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:58.660
I loved all the Grand Theft Autos.

02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:01.780
I think they're really phenomenally well-made games.

02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:02.980
Same with Red Dead.

02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:08.660
I think Red Dead Redemption one could be my favorite story.

02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:13.860
Like highly recommend finishing that game.

02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:15.380
So you like both the story.

02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:20.260
You like the grittiness of that because they have a bit of the, like, I guess if you like

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.100
the fallout, there's the humor.

02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:24.260
I don't know.

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.140
I don't know what it is.

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:30.900
It's the lighthearted humor of it, but also the brutality of human nature is in there too.

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:37.060
But it's like, and also some of the fun they create with the music when you drive and stuff

02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:39.380
like that, they create a world.

02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:39.860
There's a tone.

02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:40.100
They do.

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:40.900
There's a very strong tone.

02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.100
There is a very strong tone.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:47.780
The satire on the world is just so well done.

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:48.420
The satire is a good one.

02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:49.460
The gameplay is great.

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:54.260
I think they've just done a phenomenal job.

02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:57.220
Is there any others that pop to mind?

02:14:57.220 --> 02:14:57.620
Portal.

02:14:58.420 --> 02:14:58.980
Portal.

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:03.460
Yeah, that's another weird creation.

02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:06.180
I could just sit here and list games forever.

02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:07.700
First of all, I'm enjoying this.

02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.100
Hearthstone's a game I love.

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:11.380
I love all types, like sports.

02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:12.340
College football.

02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.020
NCAA football was my favorite.

02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.540
It's like, I would say this is a great role-playing game.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.460
Oh, you would actually keep getting role-playing.

02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:19.780
It's a role-playing game because I have all these characters.

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:24.900
I have like, you know, 60 characters and they're all leveling up and then I have to play them.

02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:27.540
And then the college one, because I like college football, they'd graduate.

02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:29.700
So you lose your players and then they stop making the series.

02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:33.060
And I know the folks at EA and they will say, I have bugged them.

02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:33.620
When is this going?

02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:34.180
And they're doing it.

02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:35.540
So it's finally coming back.

02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:40.580
Nice. What would you say is the greatest sports game of all time?

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:45.380
Well, it's NCAA football.

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:46.340
I have to pick the year.

02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.780
Versus Madden?

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:50.740
Oh yeah.

02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.340
Yeah, but there's more teams.

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:55.380
You get the college, you know, fight songs.

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:58.660
There's more pageantry and the players turn over.

02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:00.420
They're only there for four seasons.

02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:05.140
So you have to, so, you know, it's more dynamic.

02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:07.300
So you like variety versus...

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:08.580
So what was the last one?

02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.180
2014, maybe it was.

02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:15.060
And you don't like FIFA and...

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.540
I like, look, FIFA's incredible.

02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.060
Just look, I'm a college football fan.

02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:20.900
They give you that fantasy.

02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:24.900
If you like European football slash soccer, FIFA is incredible.

02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:25.860
Yeah, I love that game too.

02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:32.100
Have you been paying attention to the game design of that world, of those worlds?

02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:34.900
Yeah, and the thing people, I think, with those kinds of games,

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:39.380
it is really like, or racing games, Forza put up there.

02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:42.180
I love Forza, played them all.

02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:45.620
When you have to recreate something that's real in the real world,

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:48.420
say it's cars or sports games, everybody knows how it should work.

02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:53.700
That's a really difficult task when people know how it should work.

02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:56.340
Then you're going to balance it for single player.

02:16:56.340 --> 02:17:00.180
The multiplayer parts of it, they get very, very competitive.

02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:04.420
And, you know, in many respects, you're forced to put out a new version every year.

02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:10.420
And I say forced in quotes because they're, you know, you count them as big updates.

02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:15.300
But it's a very, it's a much more difficult development process than I think

02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:22.420
people understand and how hard those teams work and know a lot of people who do it.

02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:23.860
And I think they just do.

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:25.780
I've enjoyed them all.

02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:26.900
I buy Madden every year.

02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:29.300
Yeah, every single year.

02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:30.980
Yeah, they do refresh it.

02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:32.260
There's a feeling of freshness.

02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:33.140
I don't know what that is.

02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:36.660
Yeah, look, there have been years where it feels like less was done and more was done,

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.580
but I enjoy it every year.

02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.700
Yeah, yeah.

02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:45.060
What does a perfectly productive day in the life of Todd Howard look like?

02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:51.540
So, maybe not perfectly, but just like a perfectly average production day.

02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:55.300
Are you a morning person, evening person?

02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:56.900
Is it chaos?

02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:58.100
Is it pretty regular?

02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:02.180
I'm in a good flow right now.

02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:03.940
I'm still doing a lot of stuff.

02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:09.780
So there's things I'm like executive producing and then, you know, Starfield I'm directing.

02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:11.940
So I sort of view that as that's an everyday thing.

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:18.820
Fortunately, I get to do a lot of stuff from look at the TV show we're making and

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:22.820
this Indiana Jones game that's being developed, that machine game.

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:23.620
So we have to look at that.

02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:30.420
But, you know, the best really day or where I feel it's fulfilling is

02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:37.700
get to play some of a game, the game, we'll say Starfield, get to play some of Starfield,

02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:41.380
look at the problem set of what it is doing.

02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:47.700
And then get in a room with the other developers that I work closely with and we

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:50.020
solve that problem together.

02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:55.460
So that's the most rewarding thing when you can say, okay, what do we want this to do?

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:58.020
What's the real player experience we want?

02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:00.740
What are all the pieces in front of us?

02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:04.260
You know the actual tangible pieces as opposed to the beginning.

02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:09.700
The pie in the sky part is always fun, but it's like anything is possible.

02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:15.300
That's fun, but it's not rewarding in the same way because you haven't solved something.

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:17.780
Whereas these are the elements you have to play with.

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:20.580
How do we make this all work together?

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:24.260
And you come out of it at the end of the day like now that feels great.

02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:33.940
So brainstorming about specific big picture, both big picture and very specific detail

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:37.300
of a game that's not working, something's not working, you want to fix it, that kind of stuff.

02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:42.820
Because you feel like, okay, you've made tangible progress on the actual build of the game.

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.460
Or something you played in the beginning of the day didn't feel great.

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:50.580
You've figured out a solution with a group of people, like it's always with a group.

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:55.060
And then the next day you're like, yeah, that worked out.

02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:56.020
Who's on the team?

02:19:56.020 --> 02:20:01.540
Is it designers, engineers, artists, voiceover folks?

02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:06.260
So internal to the studio, it's a lot of programming, a lot of art.

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:11.140
You have design, which breaks into some quest design, writing, systems design,

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:14.980
who are doing all the treasure and the loot and the skill systems.

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:19.620
And then level design is making the spaces like those that you'll play through.

02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:21.780
Production is a big part of it.

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.540
The producers who organize everything.

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.420
I can't remember if I mentioned art, a lot of artists.

02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:28.340
QA staff as well.

02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:32.500
They're hugely valuable in saying, hey, we broke your game in these magical ways.

02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.460
What are you going to do about it?

02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:36.500
Is the loot design team still hiring?

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.220
And how do I apply?

02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.020
That seems like the most fun job.

02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:40.580
Always.

02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:43.220
I mean, all of this seems like a super fun job.

02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:43.540
You know what?

02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:44.020
It's the best.

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:51.780
Then you have audio and it by far is the greatest job you could possibly have.

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:54.740
If you're into like technology, it's great.

02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:57.300
If you're into storytelling, creativity and art, it's great.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:00.820
And it's really the gaming, the combination of that.

02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:04.900
And like, like I mentioned to you offline, I think a video games is,

02:21:04.900 --> 02:21:09.380
I mean, to me has brought thousands of hours of happiness.

02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:12.340
And so when you're designing the game, whatever you're doing,

02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:18.340
you have a part to play in a thing that's going to bring like millions,

02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:22.260
hundreds of millions of hours of happiness to people.

02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:24.340
And you know, crazy, right?

02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:24.740
It is.

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:28.580
And I'm going to, I'm going to play, play you saying that back to our team.

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.420
Because, you know, people forget your head's down.

02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:36.260
You're trying to solve these problems and then you do forget how many people it touches.

02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:40.740
Like even tiny decisions, you may have tiny little things you create.

02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:42.180
Yeah, it's weird.

02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:43.620
I wish there was a way to like,

02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:48.500
I would notice things in a video game and it's like, huh, okay.

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:52.020
Like it feels good, but you don't get that signal.

02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:55.140
The creator doesn't get that signal.

02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:55.940
I wish they did.

02:21:56.900 --> 02:22:00.420
I guess you could get that signal by, you know,

02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:01.940
why is Lex stuck in this room?

02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:03.940
Like digging through the loop.

02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:08.260
We do get, we do now get a lot of good data on what the players are doing.

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.460
Enjoying and not that.

02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.860
Well, we know where they've been and where they've died

02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:13.700
and how long they play in certain sections.

02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:17.140
And we can sort of tell outside of people just telling us on forums

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:20.740
or calling or other things, we can tell for some data where

02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:24.340
people are dropping off or having a, you know,

02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:26.980
we can tell if there's a key frustration point.

02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:35.300
Do you ever think about making people feel like human feelings when they play?

02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:44.740
Like designing, like make them feel fear or excitement, anger, longing, loneliness.

02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:47.060
Yeah, of course.

02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:51.300
The big one I like to say is the video games give you is pride

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:56.580
outside of other, you know, if you watch movies or things like that,

02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:58.980
like, yeah, but you never think like, look what I did.

02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:06.180
And that feeling of like accomplishment and pride in what you did or you overcame,

02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:09.220
you talked about going back to a game that like,

02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:17.700
those are real feelings of like accomplishment that I've felt in games that I've played.

02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:25.700
And when we get to see a player feel that, it's really, really special.

02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:31.380
The other one is there is a, you know, there is an escape

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:38.500
or to be someone else that's more powerful in our games that you are in real life

02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:40.900
that gives you a confidence or a perspective.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:47.220
We're doing one next week, but we've done a number of make-a-wish visits,

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:49.380
kids who could wish for anything.

02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:54.580
And they want to come and I want to see the next game and meet the creators

02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:55.700
and see how you do it.

02:23:55.700 --> 02:24:01.700
And they come with their family and it is like the greatest thing that we do.

02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:06.980
And it reminds you of like how important it is.

02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:13.460
And the other really awesome thing is that you can see like the family change

02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:16.980
by the end of the day, like they don't, they didn't even realize what it meant.

02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:19.860
To their child or what went into it.

02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:26.740
And it's just that to me is like been involved with that foundation for a number of years.

02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:32.340
And it's been really good, you know, reminder of how lucky we are.

02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:37.300
And in general for young people, that sense of accomplishment is hard to find.

02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.900
I mean, yeah, where they, they don't, not everybody has it in the outlets that

02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:46.580
real life provides.

02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:47.860
Well, that's the thing.

02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:50.980
I mean, the world is cruel to when you're young.

02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:53.700
Nobody takes you seriously.

02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:57.540
You don't get like, that's why you, everybody always wants to grow up

02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:59.140
and get old as quickly as possible.

02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:02.180
It's the hardest, it's hard.

02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:06.340
And then video games allow you, I mean, to build that sense of confidence,

02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.260
a sense of pride in something.

02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:12.260
That's why when people talk down to video games, like it's a culture and so on,

02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:17.380
it's not, it misses out on that really deeply meaningful thing,

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:20.180
especially with like single player.

02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.020
There's some darker aspects to multiplayer that people create communities and, you know,

02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:28.100
it can go off the rails a bit, but the actual experience of the game,

02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:33.300
especially one where you stick with for a while, that's really beautiful.

02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:38.260
Do you have advice for those same young folks?

02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:43.220
Given that your life is an interesting one, given what kind of degree you got

02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:48.100
and being a legendary game designer, do you have advice for young folks in high school,

02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:52.900
maybe college, how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?

02:25:54.900 --> 02:26:02.100
Well, you have to find something that you love so much that it's never going to feel like a job.

02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:05.380
And don't do it for money.

02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:07.060
And don't do it for money.

02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:08.740
Don't do it for find something you love and

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:13.380
the rest of it will come.

02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:15.380
It won't be a straight path.

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:21.220
And do not ever underestimate yourself.

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:28.260
It's going to take hard work, but the worst thing that young people do

02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:32.180
is think they can't accomplish something or they underestimate themselves.

02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:40.260
And maybe those first few times through where they do fail, if they love it enough,

02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:43.140
they're going to be resilient and push past that.

02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:48.740
Anyone who's had success or gotten somewhere, they've had those times, right?

02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:55.860
And they've stayed resilient because they love it so much that this is what they want to do.

02:26:56.580 --> 02:27:00.900
When you do it for other reasons, I just don't think it's going to work out the same.

02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:06.180
Did you have low points in your life?

02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:12.180
Dark points or your mind went to a dark place, whether it's struggling to get a job

02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:20.020
but as the soft works or maybe with a red guard flop or

02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.420
where you kind of started to doubt yourself or any of that?

02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:31.860
I think what's weird looking back, I was always so in love with doing this

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:38.340
that I didn't view them as dark per se.

02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:44.900
Looking back, I just wanted to, okay, let me find a way to make this work.

02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:48.100
Even when it's hard and it's failing and all that kind of stuff,

02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:51.300
you just kind of like, it's a problem before you to solve.

02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:57.860
When I started at Bethesda, my father had moved nearby to the office.

02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:03.700
I was moving and I slept on a sofa. I didn't care. I don't need a bedroom.

02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:06.740
I'll sleep on the sofa and work there. That's all I want to do.

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:11.540
When the company almost went out of business, it was, well, I hope it doesn't.

02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:19.940
I feel somewhat responsible, but hey, that's a learning lesson. Let's go.

02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:23.060
I think I was pretty resilient to it all.

02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:29.140
Fallout 76, like really bad launch and okay, what did we do wrong?

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:32.660
What can we learn? Let's go at it. Now it's a success.

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:37.380
But those kind of ups and downs for the length of developments that we have,

02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:42.100
people don't see them, but we have them all the time.

02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:49.620
It's that sort of belief that with the team having done it time and time again to know that

02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:55.060
now we're going to make it as good as we possibly can and whatever we're experiencing now,

02:28:55.860 --> 02:29:01.140
when we solve it and we get it out and we see the millions of people who love it, it's all worth it.

02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:07.540
You're getting into new spaces. First of all, new worlds with Starfield, but also new.

02:29:07.540 --> 02:29:16.820
I saw the TV show you're working on on Fallout with Amazon. What's that like?

02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:22.980
Worlds that you created in the digital realm becoming going on the screen?

02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:27.940
Yeah, people asked. I can remember 10 years ago after Fallout 3 was a hit,

02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:31.220
movie producers coming and, hey, we think this will make a great movie,

02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:36.420
and taking a lot of meetings and I think most people would jump at that, like, sweet.

02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:42.820
I sort of paused and like, I don't know, what is this going to do?

02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:48.580
I feel like they're going to synthesize. I met great people, well-known creatives. It's

02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:55.620
going to get synthesized into this two-hour. I don't know. I'm not seeing the great thing here

02:29:55.620 --> 02:30:05.540
yet. I think the advent of television in terms of what it's become nowadays with big-budget

02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:10.980
TV series, it kind of came up again and met with people. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy who do West

02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:18.340
World. I always love the work he did writing Interstellar and the Dark Knight movies.

02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:20.580
Wait, Jonathan Nolan is involved with this?

02:30:20.580 --> 02:30:22.900
Yeah, he's the EP.

02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:25.380
That's epic. Westworld is incredible.

02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:25.620
Yeah.

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:26.420
This is awesome.

02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:34.740
And he's the EP. He's directed the first few episodes. And when I connected with him,

02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:43.540
Jonah was like, hey, you're the person I want to do this. So I met with people, kept saying like,

02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:49.380
let me see if he wants to do it. And to my joy, he was like, oh yeah,

02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:52.740
fall three is one of my, yeah, sign me up. It was like, no, how do we get this done?

02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:59.140
And at that time he was sort of, he was at HBO and it was, we were trying to figure out,

02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:07.940
put a little pause on it. And got to visit the sets, reading scripts and things like that. It's

02:31:07.940 --> 02:31:14.900
all new to me. But they're doing such an incredible job. I think if you like this world,

02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:19.780
you are going to be just blown away. Keep in mind, I've never made a TV show.

02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:27.460
No one ever does it wanting it to not be great, but they've just done their attention to detail

02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:34.180
and they're just obsessive with what's on the screen and the storytelling and how it looks,

02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:41.700
the whole thing. Yeah, I think obsession is really a prerequisite for greatness. What they did,

02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:48.420
HBO did with Chernobyl, like the attention to detail is just incredible. And he's doing

02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:55.620
The Last of Us now, that showrunner. If you really care and you really put a lot of effort into the

02:31:55.620 --> 02:32:03.220
details, you can grace it. I was stunned. I don't want to spoil it, but when people see it,

02:32:03.220 --> 02:32:08.820
I think you'll just be like, wow. The other thing we're approaching it is very different where

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:12.740
when it was, people would say they want to make a movie, they wanted to tell the story of Fallout

02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:18.660
3 or then tell the story of Fallout 4. And for this it was, hey, let's do something that exists

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:25.540
in the world of Fallout. It's not retelling a game story. It's basically an area of

02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:32.580
the map and like, let's tell a story here that fits in the world that we have built, doesn't

02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:39.460
break any of the rules, can reference things in the games, but isn't a retelling of the games.

02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:45.860
It exists in the same world, but is its own unique thing. So it adds to it while also people who don't

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:52.020
haven't played the games, who can't experience like how crazy cool Fallout is, can watch the

02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:58.820
series and so. Are there some similarities or interesting differences between the creation

02:32:58.820 --> 02:33:04.580
of a game and a TV show that you notice from the sort of story perspective? Well, for them,

02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:09.140
it's much more character driven. You can do all these things with the world and stuff that we

02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:15.940
already have. It's the main characters, who they are, what their motivations are that

02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:23.380
really is the engine. Finding the right actors to do those, yeah.

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:30.980
Because there's no interaction. You don't get to enter that world. They have to do the work for

02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:36.740
you. The NPCs are on the show. Yeah, I can't wait to see how it turns out. You also mentioned

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:42.500
Indiana Jones. That's a weird, that's a different one. How do you work with a famous

02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:48.900
protagonist, like when the character is known, how do you work with that?

02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:58.580
Well, it's different. Indiana Jones is different where like the name, it is like it's Indiana

02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:02.500
Jones. It's him, right? You can talk about the world of Indiana Jones, but at the end of the day,

02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:10.020
it's about this character. Raiders, still my favorite movie of all time, no debate. It's

02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:16.180
the best movie ever. Best movie ever. Ever. On a tangent, what do you love about it?

02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:22.500
Well, you know, I saw it obviously when I was younger and I believed it. I believed this

02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:28.180
happened. And when they found the Ark, I literally, I could not believe that they found it. So,

02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:37.460
and I have found over my life, it's still really watchable every time. I enjoy it every single

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:44.500
time. Love the character, love the story. The opening is the greatest movie opening ever.

02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:51.060
And I just love everything. I love everything about it. What was the opening? Is this one?

02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:54.980
What? It's the temple and then the ball rolls and tries to crush it. Oh, that's the opening.

02:34:54.980 --> 02:35:01.220
That's the opening of Raiders. Yeah, he steals the idol. I think you're deeply offended.

02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:06.260
What's the opening of Raiders? So, I've always wanted to, it's one of those things like what's

02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:11.220
on your bucket list? Like, oh, I want to make an Indiana Jones game. And I had pitched Lucas,

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:17.300
I met some people there and pitched them back in 09, this Indiana Jones game concept.

02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:24.180
And they wanted to publish, kind of the deal fell apart. They wanted to publish it and we were a

02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:29.300
publisher and so we didn't do it. And I didn't really have the team to do it. I just was going

02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:34.500
to figure that out after we agreed to a deal. And well, you know, we made Skyrim, so it worked out.

02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:41.700
And then, you know, fast forward 10 years plus and, you know, Lucas now part of Disney and they're

02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:45.700
doing a lot more of licensing and working with people. And so I knew some folks there and said,

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:55.220
I have this idea that I pitched a long time ago and they loved it. And again, the internal team

02:35:55.220 --> 02:36:01.620
that I had not only didn't have the time, they probably weren't as good a fit as Machine Games,

02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:07.220
who's done the Wolfenstein series, who is the perfect fit for this game with storytelling and

02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:13.380
how they record it. And they are, it's awesome. They're just doing an incredible job with that

02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:19.380
game. People are going to be, if you like Indiana Jones, it is a definite love letter

02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:26.500
to Indiana Jones and everything with it. Can you say if it's more on the action adventure side,

02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:33.940
like the actual experience of the game? I could go back. I would just say it is a mashup. It is a

02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:43.620
unique, it isn't one thing intentionally. So it does a lot of different things that, you know,

02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:48.020
we've myself and, and, and Yerrick and the folks at Machine Games have wanted to,

02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:52.660
to do in a game. So it's, it's a, it's a unique thing.

02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:59.300
Before I forget, who do I, how many humans do I have to kill? I mean, dragons do I have to kill

02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:06.260
to get myself somehow into Elder Scrolls 6. It's a mod. If anyone wants to create mods of me,

02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:14.260
is that possible? Yeah, it's possible. While maintaining realism somehow. You don't want,

02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:17.540
you don't want a person in a suit and tie. It doesn't make sense.

02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.500
You put you in both, put you in Fallout. You can wear Eagle, you can wear that.

02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:26.580
Yeah, exactly. Please put me, so Fallout, there's also a culture of...

02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:29.940
You do a mod where you replace the mysterious stranger.

02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:35.700
There you go. That's a to-do task. Top mod, right there.

02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:41.060
And you will have my deep gratitude and more, dear stranger, for doing so.

02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.620
What's the programming language for mods? Is it mostly...

02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:48.740
Their use our internal scripting language that's built into the tool.

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:55.140
Okay. I'm almost afraid to explore that world because you will never, never, never turn back.

02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:05.300
How long... You've created so many incredible games. Is there... What does the future hold?

02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:11.220
Is there... Going through this process, do you still have the energy, the passion, the drive

02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:14.420
to keep creating? I do. I cannot imagine

02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:22.100
doing anything else. I'd like to do it as long as possible. I will say though, as I've done it,

02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:32.340
soon it'll be 30 years at Bethesda. I've learned that to appreciate the developments a little bit

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:43.700
more, that the time it takes, I should prioritize all of us enjoying the development process

02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:49.940
more than I did in the past. It was like, just wanted to... The end, that's all that mattered.

02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:55.300
And the more you do it, you realize, no, I'm spending the majority of my life

02:38:55.300 --> 02:39:01.940
in Tamriel and the Wasteland and Fallout. So the moments that we're all doing this together,

02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:07.540
we need to enjoy it. It's a lot of work finishing Starfield, but hey, we got to enjoy this. This is

02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:14.180
incredible. We don't get that many shots. So the actual process of creating the struggles

02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:19.540
along the way of stuff not working, like you said, at this point, Starfield probably creating some

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:24.820
of the glue of how stuff feels and going back again and again and again to try to make the

02:39:24.820 --> 02:39:28.500
beginning better, all that kind of stuff. And I would say it for anybody's vocation,

02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:33.460
whatever you're doing. Whatever people do, you're going to have harder times.

02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:39.940
And sometimes people, you have to maybe recalibrate yourself to like, okay,

02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:45.220
how can we make this more enjoyable for all of us, no matter what you're doing and rewarding?

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:51.380
So if life is a video game, which it most likely is, what do you think is the meaning of life?

02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:57.780
From having created so many games, more of the character has to try to figure out.

02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:03.380
I mean, there's bigger questions than just solving the quest. You're asking the big questions of why

02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:08.980
am I here? I feel like that's good practice for answering the same question for this video game

02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:12.180
we're in. What do you think is the meaning of life, Todd Howard?

02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:26.820
I can say what motivates me.

02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:30.820
That's a good start.

02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:38.580
Having a curiosity. The ability to not assume a lot

02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:47.860
and be curious about the world around you. It's not the same as just wanting to learn everything,

02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:55.220
but what makes other humans tick? How do they feel? How do they love? It might be cliche to say

02:40:55.220 --> 02:41:04.660
the meaning of life is to love, right? So that curiosity is about noticing the world.

02:41:04.660 --> 02:41:10.820
Noticing the world around you. Look, there's so much an anecdote someone says. Everybody has two

02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:19.540
lives, and the second one starts when you realize there's only one. I usually preach to my children

02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:24.660
and everything else, like have a curiosity to the world around you, and you'll have the most

02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:31.300
fulfilling days. Are you able to be inside the worlds that you've created and be able to notice

02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:37.620
them? Like really enjoy them? It takes time. So like Skyrim had its 10th anniversary,

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:43.700
so when I went back into it, I think I got to see it for what it is. My younger son got really into

02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:50.820
it a few years back on the Switch. That's what we noticed, people age up into it. So one of the

02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:58.580
reasons it's so popular is people come into, they're now becoming teenagers and they're

02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:06.980
now becoming teenagers and, oh, okay, I'll finally play Skyrim. And he got obsessed with it.

02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:11.940
He wasn't, usually I say, hey, check out my games. And he's like, ah, shut up, Dad. We're

02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:17.220
playing some other stuff. And he got obsessed with Skyrim. We're having deep Elder Scrolls lore

02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:25.220
conversations at dinner. And I saw it through his eyes, and that was pretty special. And then the

02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:30.500
mods he was downloading, the YouTubers he was following, talking about stuff. So the people who

02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:34.340
are like the Elder Scrolls people don't realize how much of that I have watched with my son.

02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:39.140
And then I kind of, when the 10th anniversary came out, like, oh, I'm going to check out a build.

02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:42.500
I have to check out the build out, but I hadn't played it in so long. And it was like,

02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:51.140
it does, it has this flow. We're like, oh my God, I just played for four hours. I need to turn it off.

02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:57.780
Yeah. I mean, there's something about enjoying, enjoying video games with the people you love to,

02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:04.980
or the water cooler discussion and with kids. So I actually, I would love to have kids and hopefully

02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:12.020
soon in the future. So I guess the thing I need your advice on is how do I time in such a way

02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:18.580
when they're old enough, right at the age they're old enough. Like I want to know when to have them

02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:24.820
so that when they're old enough, that's exactly when Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. So I want to,

02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:27.700
can you give me a hint when I should have kids? All right. Nevermind.

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:30.180
You are a genius at how to ask that question.

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:35.940
The number of times. Yeah. You told the anecdote that your son asked you the same question,

02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:43.380
but of course it's all for good fun. Take as much time as is needed. Skyrim is still an incredible

02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:50.180
game. It has an impact on millions of people as, as do all of your games. It's thank you for

02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:53.620
everything you've done for the world. It's a huge honor that you would talk with me.

02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:59.700
This has been an honor and you know, it has to be said, like it's, I have a huge team of people I've

02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:07.380
worked with for some of them for 20 years. And it's really all of us together.

02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:13.220
Keep doing a great job. Guys and gals, I can't wait to see what you create next. They

02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:19.620
really, really does have an impact on silly kids like me and millions of silly kids like me. So

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:24.900
I really appreciate everything. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks for listening to this conversation with

02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:30.500

02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:38.180
me leave you with some words from Tolkien. So come snow after fire and even dragons have their end.

02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:42.180
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
