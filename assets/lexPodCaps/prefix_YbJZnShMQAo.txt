00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
I hate affirmative action.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.480
I don't just disagree with it.

00:03.480 --> 00:06.360
I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.920
I hate it.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.880
The hatred comes from an understanding

00:09.880 --> 00:12.400
that it is a band-aid, that it is a substitute

00:12.400 --> 00:14.760
for the actual development of the capacities

00:14.760 --> 00:16.520
of our people to compete.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.400
They wanna tell African-Americans to pat us on the head.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.200
We're gonna have a separate program for you.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.000
We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.280
That doesn't make us any smarter.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.120
It doesn't make us any more creative.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.960
And it doesn't make us any more fit

00:33.960 --> 00:37.280
for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.040
The following is a conversation with Glenn Lowry,

00:42.040 --> 00:44.120
professor of economics and social sciences

00:44.120 --> 00:45.400
at Brown University.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.480
He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,

00:49.480 --> 00:53.400
writing and speaking about race and inequality.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.800
I highly encourage you to listen to his show on YouTube

00:56.800 --> 01:00.040
and Substack, simply called The Glenn Show.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.840
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.880
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.880 --> 01:06.000
in the description.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.320
And now, dear friends, here's Glenn Lowry.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.880
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech

01:12.880 --> 01:15.400
I think is the greatest speech in American history.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.680
If I may, I'd like to read a few words of it.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.520
Sure.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.080
And ask you a question about this dream.

01:22.360 --> 01:26.200
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up

01:26.280 --> 01:29.000
and live out the true meaning of its creed.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.640
We hold these truths to be self-evident

01:31.640 --> 01:33.480
that all men are created equal.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.920
I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.720
the sons of former slaves

01:40.720 --> 01:43.040
and the sons of former slave owners

01:43.040 --> 01:47.040
will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.840
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,

01:50.840 --> 01:54.160
a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.600
sweltering with the heat of oppression

01:56.600 --> 02:00.840
will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.320
I have a dream that my four little children

02:04.320 --> 02:06.520
will one day live in a nation

02:06.520 --> 02:09.760
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin

02:09.760 --> 02:12.560
but by the content of their character.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.720
I have a dream today.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.360
First of all, damn, I mentioned to you offline,

02:17.360 --> 02:20.920
I immigrated to America and this is why I love this country.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.280
This is one of the great speeches

02:22.280 --> 02:25.040
that represents what this country is about.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.200
So what is this ideal of equality

02:29.200 --> 02:31.360
that we should strive for as a nation,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.440
that all men are created equal?

02:33.440 --> 02:35.720
What does that mean to you, this equality?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.800
Well, if we put this in historical context,

02:43.080 --> 02:47.280
King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.280
It's exactly 100 years

02:50.280 --> 02:55.280
after Abraham Lincoln signs the Emancipation Proclamation

02:55.600 --> 03:00.600
declaring the enslaved people to be free.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.960
They're not yet citizens in 1863,

03:07.040 --> 03:10.480
but the end of slavery has become the position

03:10.480 --> 03:11.640
of the federal government

03:11.640 --> 03:15.400
when Lincoln issues that Emancipation Proclamation.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.920
So putting it in context, enslaved people,

03:21.920 --> 03:26.920
four million or so African-descended enslaved people,

03:28.240 --> 03:31.280
how do they become citizens?

03:31.280 --> 03:36.280
How do they become in this status of subjugation

03:38.200 --> 03:42.160
and domination and stigma and exclusion?

03:42.160 --> 03:44.280
How do they become citizens?

03:44.360 --> 03:48.800
It seems to me that that's the heart of it.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.080
The equality that King is talking about

03:53.080 --> 03:58.080
is an equality of status as members of the nation

03:59.200 --> 04:03.560
as free and equal citizens within the Republic.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.480
Now, I think it's really important to understand

04:07.480 --> 04:12.480
that slavery was not merely a legal order,

04:13.480 --> 04:17.880
but it was also a social system

04:17.880 --> 04:22.400
that had the symbolism attached to it.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.200
They had a big journey to make

04:25.200 --> 04:28.960
from their subjugated status as serfs,

04:28.960 --> 04:31.640
as landless people, as uneducated,

04:31.640 --> 04:35.200
unfit for citizenship really in the minds of many.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.200
So I think that's what in 1963, 100 years later,

04:41.200 --> 04:45.040
that King is appealing to this idea

04:45.040 --> 04:50.040
that when Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence

04:50.840 --> 04:54.480
writes these words, all men are created equal

04:54.480 --> 04:56.040
and endowed by their creator

04:56.040 --> 04:59.000
with certain inalienable rights.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.080
He didn't, Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner,

05:04.480 --> 05:07.480
didn't have in mind when he wrote those words,

05:07.480 --> 05:09.240
the people who were slaves.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.400
But by the time you get to 1963,

05:13.400 --> 05:18.400
King is invoking this idea, all men,

05:19.120 --> 05:20.520
and of course he means all persons,

05:20.520 --> 05:23.240
he doesn't only mean men,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.520
he means men and women are created equal.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.880
He wants this idea to be embraced by the country

05:30.880 --> 05:35.080
in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.200
That's his dream, that's his idea.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.000
That the legacy of slavery would be erased,

05:41.120 --> 05:45.240
that the position of African Americans

05:45.240 --> 05:48.960
would be equalized within the political community,

05:48.960 --> 05:51.760
which is the United States of America.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.680
That's my sense of it in any case.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.520
So on a very basic level,

05:56.520 --> 05:59.120
the worth of a human being is equal.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.600
It's just literally the worth of a human being.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.880
So I mentioned to you offline

06:03.880 --> 06:06.800
that I came from the Soviet Union,

06:06.880 --> 06:10.960
my grandfather fought in World War II,

06:10.960 --> 06:15.960
and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person

06:17.680 --> 06:21.120
as they were captured, there's different numbers,

06:21.120 --> 06:24.040
but it's in the hundreds to one German,

06:24.040 --> 06:29.040
in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.080
So he wanted Germany to expand

06:32.080 --> 06:34.440
and conquer a large part of the world,

06:34.480 --> 06:37.720
and within that future world, that Third Reich,

06:37.720 --> 06:41.920
the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person

06:41.920 --> 06:45.960
is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.720
of a pure German person.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.160
So that has to do with not some kind of public policy

06:51.160 --> 06:53.440
or politics or all that kind of stuff,

06:53.440 --> 06:56.520
it has to do with the basic worth of a human being.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.800
And that's what Dr. King is speaking to,

06:58.800 --> 07:03.800
that all people on some kind of deep level,

07:04.440 --> 07:05.600
worth the same.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.800
If you're somehow weighing the value of a person,

07:10.800 --> 07:14.760
we're equal in that's basic fundamental worth.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.480
Yeah, I think that's correct.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.480
I think that's very well said.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.000
I don't know that he had in mind

07:20.000 --> 07:23.600
the position of Slavic people in Central Europe

07:23.600 --> 07:25.280
in the middle of the 20th century,

07:25.280 --> 07:27.880
or the first part of the 20th century, King.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.400
I don't know that he had that in mind,

07:29.400 --> 07:34.120
he might well have done, but certainly that's the idea.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.000
So you don't think he was really thinking

07:36.000 --> 07:40.520
about this particular civil rights struggle

07:40.520 --> 07:45.520
and the particular struggle against the backdrop

07:46.120 --> 07:47.880
of the history of slavery in America

07:47.880 --> 07:49.600
and thinking about African Americans.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.200
He wasn't thinking about the basic,

07:52.200 --> 07:55.160
he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.880
No, I don't mean to say that.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.360
The speech in Washington.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.000
The dream.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
In 1963 at that march was within the context

08:07.320 --> 08:10.240
of the United States and it was within the context

08:10.240 --> 08:12.360
of the civil rights movement.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.280
There was a movement that was going on.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.760
He was an actor in a political drama that was American,

08:21.640 --> 08:26.400
that had to do with the fight over equal rights

08:26.400 --> 08:30.960
for voting, for housing, for employment,

08:31.040 --> 08:34.720
for citizenship of blacks in America.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.680
But King was informed, I think,

08:37.680 --> 08:41.440
by a much broader Christian ethic

08:41.440 --> 08:44.480
of the equality of all persons.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.080
I mean, he gets killed in 1968.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.560
The five years after that speech in Washington,

08:51.560 --> 08:56.560
he spends developing his worldview

08:57.280 --> 09:00.480
and the things that he had to say,

09:00.480 --> 09:03.080
for example, about the war in Southeast Asia

09:03.080 --> 09:04.880
that was going on at that time,

09:05.760 --> 09:10.760
made appeals to universal principles of equality.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.680
He was a pacifist to some degree.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.600
He was against war.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.600
He was a socialist to some degree.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.920
He might not have worn that label publicly,

09:21.920 --> 09:25.000
but he believed in a decent society

09:25.000 --> 09:27.680
where the poor would not go untended,

09:27.680 --> 09:29.680
where healthcare would be available

09:29.720 --> 09:32.600
to people who needed it and this kind of thing.

09:32.600 --> 09:37.000
A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life

09:37.000 --> 09:40.240
was not dependent upon the color of the skin,

09:40.240 --> 09:43.840
upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.880
upon whether male or female.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.360
All persons are created equal.

09:50.360 --> 09:55.200
This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King

09:55.200 --> 09:56.840
on my understanding.

09:56.840 --> 10:01.440
Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature

10:01.440 --> 10:05.360
by looking at the history of slavery in America?

10:07.600 --> 10:08.420
Oh my.

10:08.420 --> 10:10.680
So what does that tell you about people?

10:10.680 --> 10:14.160
Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.

10:15.120 --> 10:20.120
One is about the capacity of people

10:20.920 --> 10:25.920
for looking the other way in the face of unethical

10:31.440 --> 10:36.440
and morally profoundly problematic practice.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.960
So, I mean, slavery was controversial.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.640
It was controversial going all the way back

10:42.640 --> 10:44.680
to the founding of the United States of America.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.800
The country was founded on a compromise

10:47.800 --> 10:52.800
where half of the country thought that slavery was abhorrent

10:54.680 --> 10:59.280
and would not have had it countenanced in the constitution.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.120
The other half of the country were steeped

11:02.120 --> 11:07.160
in the dependence on the labor of these African captives

11:07.160 --> 11:08.740
and their descendants.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.440
The economy depended upon it.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.780
They owned them as property.

11:11.780 --> 11:12.760
That was their wealth.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.660
Their wealth was invested to some degree

11:14.660 --> 11:17.680
in the value of these human beings.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.480
And in order for the United States to come together

11:20.480 --> 11:24.260
as a confederation of the several colonies,

11:24.260 --> 11:26.000
there had to be a compromise made.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.320
And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist

11:31.520 --> 11:35.520
and the people who were against it

11:35.520 --> 11:38.920
or who thought it morally problematic

11:38.920 --> 11:42.160
were able to countenance the practice

11:42.160 --> 11:45.580
in the Southern States where slavery flourished.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.540
And that went on for 75 years

11:47.540 --> 11:49.660
after the founding of the country

11:49.660 --> 11:53.340
until the crisis of the late 1850s

11:53.340 --> 11:55.220
that led to the Civil War

11:55.220 --> 11:56.900
and ultimately to the Emancipation.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.220
So one thing I think about human nature

12:00.220 --> 12:05.220
from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people

12:05.660 --> 12:10.660
to live with terrible, morally questionable practices

12:11.420 --> 12:14.360
and have that as a part of their institutions.

12:14.360 --> 12:19.360
It took a massive movement of abolitionists

12:20.360 --> 12:24.880
struggling against slavery for the better part of a century

12:24.880 --> 12:29.880
before that practice could be eradicated.

12:29.880 --> 12:34.400
But the other thing about human nature that I see

12:34.400 --> 12:39.280
is the ability of people to sustain their humanity

12:39.280 --> 12:43.400
under the most awful oppressive conditions.

12:44.880 --> 12:49.800
The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.480
I mean, they were chattel,

12:51.480 --> 12:55.180
they were bought and sold like horses or cattle.

12:56.320 --> 13:01.320
And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that.

13:01.920 --> 13:06.920
And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree

13:08.640 --> 13:12.700
in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,

13:12.700 --> 13:15.540
the freedmen and women,

13:15.540 --> 13:20.100
the persons who had been enslaved and who were set free

13:20.100 --> 13:25.100
were able to over the following decades

13:27.460 --> 13:32.460
build a foundation for the development of African-Americans

13:32.620 --> 13:35.660
within the context of American society

13:35.660 --> 13:39.420
that eventually culminated in the civil rights movement

13:39.420 --> 13:41.940
of the middle of the 20th century.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.860
And it has led us into the present day.

13:45.780 --> 13:50.780
So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil,

13:53.380 --> 13:55.580
but human nature can also survive

13:55.580 --> 13:58.300
in the face of terrible evil.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.340
That's what I take from slavery.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.500
That survival, that flame can burn

14:03.500 --> 14:07.980
even when the world around it tries to put it out.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.660
There's still a little flame of human consciousness,

14:11.660 --> 14:16.580
of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is

14:16.580 --> 14:18.140
that makes humans flourish

14:18.140 --> 14:21.100
and makes humans beautiful that lives on.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.020
That's very well said.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.980
Yeah, I think you put it very well.

14:23.980 --> 14:28.060
There's gotta be some poetic way of expressing that.

14:29.780 --> 14:30.900
Leave it to the poets.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.500
What about the people that look the other way?

14:34.500 --> 14:38.060
How many people do you think, just regular people,

14:38.060 --> 14:40.820
knew that something is, this is wrong?

14:40.820 --> 14:43.340
Or do people, through generations,

14:43.340 --> 14:46.900
convince themselves, most people, most regular people,

14:46.900 --> 14:49.620
convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?

14:51.300 --> 14:53.660
All right, yeah.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.780
I ask this question because I wonder

14:55.780 --> 14:59.820
what we're looking the other way on today, also.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.700
Because, I mean, you have to kinda,

15:02.700 --> 15:05.300
if we're, you have to ask yourself these difficult questions

15:05.300 --> 15:10.300
of assuming we're the same people we were back then.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.220
Then we can be flawed in that same kind of way.

15:14.220 --> 15:18.500
We can look the other way just as others have in history.

15:20.140 --> 15:24.100
Yeah, and you spoke of the European context

15:24.100 --> 15:28.820
and of the Nazis, and certainly a lot of people

15:28.820 --> 15:31.140
had to be looking the other way

15:31.140 --> 15:33.780
when the massive crimes that were committed

15:33.780 --> 15:36.060
by that regime were being undertaken.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.980
I mean, railroad cars full of human beings

15:40.020 --> 15:41.620
being taken off to be slaughtered

15:41.620 --> 15:45.380
or to be worked to death in labor camps

15:45.380 --> 15:48.220
or to be gassed, et cetera.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.820
A lot of people had to know about what was going on

15:50.820 --> 15:54.060
and look the other way

15:54.060 --> 15:57.740
or enthusiastically supported the persecution

15:57.740 --> 16:00.900
of the Jews and the gypsies and so on.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.860
And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.180
My sense of the matter is that,

16:08.180 --> 16:10.860
like many practices that are unjust,

16:10.860 --> 16:14.060
most people thought that's just the way it is.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.740
I mean, that's the world that they inherited.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.260
They were not moralists, they were not revolutionaries.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.980
They just wanted to go along.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.660
Some people might have been troubled by it

16:24.660 --> 16:26.460
but thought there's nothing that can be done.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.460
Some people might have thought,

16:27.460 --> 16:30.460
well, they're these black Africans,

16:30.460 --> 16:32.780
they're not really like us

16:32.780 --> 16:35.140
and they are lucky to be here.

16:35.140 --> 16:38.500
If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.820
Some people might've thought that.

16:40.820 --> 16:42.220
Some people might've been disturbed

16:42.220 --> 16:44.940
but not been able to see what it is

16:44.940 --> 16:46.340
that they could do about it.

16:47.860 --> 16:51.460
They might've thought, oh, this is disgusting.

16:51.460 --> 16:55.580
This is not something I would wanna have anything

16:55.580 --> 16:59.500
to do with, but not knowing whether

16:59.500 --> 17:02.980
there's any practical way of opposing it.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.540
That's why you need a movement.

17:05.540 --> 17:10.540
You need for the people who are troubled by the practice

17:10.620 --> 17:12.980
to know that there are others like themselves

17:12.980 --> 17:17.580
equally troubled and as they gather together collectively,

17:17.580 --> 17:20.700
they can exert their influence.

17:20.700 --> 17:24.580
I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery,

17:24.580 --> 17:26.220
as I say, go all the way back

17:26.220 --> 17:28.580
to the founding of the country.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.740
There were abolitionists and there were people

17:31.140 --> 17:36.140
who opposed the compromise that led to the framing documents

17:36.900 --> 17:40.740
and institutions that created the United States of America,

17:40.740 --> 17:45.740
opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation.

17:47.540 --> 17:52.260
But it took a while before that could come to a head

17:52.260 --> 17:56.660
and produce the crisis which ultimately led

17:56.660 --> 17:59.460
to the eradication of slavery.

17:59.460 --> 18:03.460
I would note that slavery is not unique

18:03.460 --> 18:05.340
to the United States.

18:05.340 --> 18:08.540
It's not unique to the Western hemisphere.

18:08.540 --> 18:13.180
That enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel

18:14.340 --> 18:18.060
is something that one sees on a global basis.

18:18.060 --> 18:22.180
One sees it going all the way back to antiquity.

18:22.180 --> 18:26.820
So we might ask, how is it that people finally came

18:26.860 --> 18:30.260
to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?

18:30.260 --> 18:33.860
That might be the thing worth really trying to understand

18:33.860 --> 18:36.980
because the practice itself is, you know,

18:36.980 --> 18:40.540
there's a wonderful book by the sociologist

18:40.540 --> 18:45.540
Orlando Patterson called Slavery and Social Death

18:46.100 --> 18:51.100
that was published in 1982 which is a comprehensive history

18:51.980 --> 18:55.740
and social analysis of the institution of slavery

18:55.740 --> 19:00.740
over 2,500 years, going back to the classical Greek

19:01.940 --> 19:06.540
and Roman civilizations, finding slavery in Africa

19:06.540 --> 19:09.980
amongst Africans, finding slavery in the Middle East,

19:09.980 --> 19:11.820
finding slavery in the Far East,

19:11.820 --> 19:16.580
finding slavery in South Asia, the enslavement of people,

19:16.580 --> 19:19.660
the practice of taking someone as a captive in war

19:19.660 --> 19:22.500
and then instead of killing them, which you could do,

19:22.500 --> 19:27.500
making them into your property was very, very widespread

19:28.220 --> 19:29.580
in human culture.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.380
So I mean, I like to make this point sometimes

19:33.380 --> 19:36.460
when people are talking about how wrong slavery was

19:36.460 --> 19:38.740
and I agree without any question

19:40.060 --> 19:44.460
that the practice was profoundly morally problematic.

19:46.420 --> 19:50.440
But I like to make the point that given how wrong it was,

19:50.440 --> 19:55.440
think about how impressive was the accomplishment

19:55.640 --> 19:58.320
of the eradication of slavery.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.760
That was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead

20:01.760 --> 20:06.400
in the war between the states 1861 to 1865

20:06.400 --> 20:08.520
in a country of 30 million people.

20:08.520 --> 20:13.520
That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives

20:14.160 --> 20:17.000
not to eradicate slavery in every instance,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.440
probably most of them were just fighting

20:19.440 --> 20:24.440
for they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces

20:25.480 --> 20:27.160
and they fought and they died.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.520
But the net effect of their having fought and died

20:30.520 --> 20:33.480
was to push along a process that led

20:33.480 --> 20:34.880
to the eradication of slavery.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.840
That's an amazing achievement.

20:37.800 --> 20:42.800
The slaves themselves were largely uneducated

20:43.840 --> 20:47.680
and backward in their, of course,

20:47.680 --> 20:48.800
what else could they have been?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.800
They were kept in captivity.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.040
They were prevented from developing their human potential

20:55.040 --> 20:58.720
and yet after the end of slavery,

20:58.720 --> 21:01.680
that population, that four million plus

21:01.680 --> 21:06.000
African descended people became the foundation

21:06.000 --> 21:09.460
for what a century later leads to Martin Luther King

21:09.460 --> 21:12.600
standing in the Washington Mall

21:12.600 --> 21:14.440
and giving that great speech.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.300
And now here we are 150 years down the road

21:18.300 --> 21:21.580
and Barack Obama is president of the United States.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.260
Now he did not descend from slaves.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.660
I think we must not lose track of that,

21:25.660 --> 21:29.300
but he identified as an African American

21:29.300 --> 21:33.980
and was a part of the population that consisted largely

21:33.980 --> 21:35.940
of people who descended from slaves.

21:36.900 --> 21:40.900
And we are, we African Americans are

21:40.900 --> 21:45.020
for all practical purposes, fully equal citizens

21:45.020 --> 21:46.740
of this great Republic.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.420
That has happened within a century and a half

21:49.420 --> 21:52.220
and I don't know that you can find any parallel

21:52.220 --> 21:55.860
to that kind of transformation in the status of people

21:56.780 --> 22:01.780
from human chattel to full citizens of the Republic

22:01.780 --> 22:02.900
anywhere in human history.

22:02.900 --> 22:07.260
It's certainly worth celebrating the achievement

22:07.260 --> 22:10.180
of the eradication of slavery, I would say.

22:10.180 --> 22:13.340
And it probably started with a few people

22:14.220 --> 22:18.880
that inside their mind dared to rebel.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.340
You know, it's interesting to think

22:20.340 --> 22:25.340
about how it all started, how in the state of injustice

22:26.940 --> 22:31.940
the revolution percolates, like where it starts.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.560
You said people that see something as wrong find each other.

22:39.180 --> 22:42.980
It's in the ideas of charismatic individuals

22:42.980 --> 22:44.900
that not only know that something is wrong,

22:44.900 --> 22:48.980
but they're able to tell others about it

22:48.980 --> 22:53.980
and be convincing and then together gather and rise up.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.380
It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress

22:58.380 --> 23:00.480
from slavery to where we are today,

23:00.480 --> 23:04.340
to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.780
The power of individual,

23:07.780 --> 23:10.060
cause I don't know what you think about it,

23:10.060 --> 23:14.620
but I tend to think that a few small individuals

23:14.620 --> 23:16.780
probably originated this.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.300
It's the power of the individual.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.380
Cause sometimes we think there's injustice in the world.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.220
What can I possibly do?

23:22.220 --> 23:26.440
I tend to think one person can be the seed

23:26.440 --> 23:29.260
of starting to fix the injustice.

23:29.260 --> 23:30.100
Sure.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.340
One person here, one person there.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.240
Yeah.

23:36.100 --> 23:39.020
One thinks of course of Frederick Douglass,

23:39.900 --> 23:44.900
massively significant figure who was born in slavery,

23:46.180 --> 23:48.700
who stole his freedom

23:51.340 --> 23:52.260
because he was property

23:52.260 --> 23:54.720
and he decided he was not gonna be property anymore.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.100
And he took it unto himself

23:56.100 --> 23:59.060
to emancipate himself personally

23:59.060 --> 24:04.060
and who became an educated, powerfully articulate,

24:04.820 --> 24:09.380
massively influential person in the United States

24:09.380 --> 24:14.380
and in England going around presenting himself

24:14.860 --> 24:18.780
as an embodiment of human dignity

24:18.780 --> 24:23.780
and commitment to ideals of equality.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.660
And I mean, he's just one person,

24:27.660 --> 24:30.140
but there were others like him.

24:30.140 --> 24:31.960
Just one person.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.580
All it takes is just one person.

24:33.580 --> 24:38.580
So here we are on this topic of equality

24:39.620 --> 24:43.020
in the 21st century.

24:43.020 --> 24:45.420
So what does equality mean today?

24:45.420 --> 24:50.420
If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome

24:53.540 --> 24:56.740
or the injustice of inequality,

24:56.740 --> 25:01.060
at which point does equality of outcome is just?

25:01.060 --> 25:02.780
At which point is it unjust?

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
Sort of looking at our world today

25:05.660 --> 25:07.720
and looking at inequality,

25:08.860 --> 25:13.860
how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice

25:14.380 --> 25:16.580
and some is the way of life?

25:16.580 --> 25:18.020
So what does equality mean

25:18.020 --> 25:19.660
when we look at the world today?

25:19.660 --> 25:23.340
Different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.620
I don't think King's speech,

25:27.140 --> 25:29.280
I have a dream that one day my four little children

25:29.280 --> 25:31.420
will be judged not by the color of their skin

25:31.500 --> 25:33.340
but by the content of their character

25:34.420 --> 25:37.420
requires equality of outcome.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.020
He says his children will be judged

25:42.020 --> 25:44.580
by the content of their character.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.540
That's a conditional statement.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.940
That is the judgment will depend

25:48.940 --> 25:50.900
upon the content of their character,

25:52.380 --> 25:53.980
not the color of their skin,

25:53.980 --> 25:56.780
but it doesn't follow from that,

25:56.780 --> 26:01.380
that the outcomes, whatever outcomes we consider wealth

26:02.300 --> 26:03.140
and economic power,

26:05.220 --> 26:06.860
position within the society,

26:06.860 --> 26:10.180
representation in the various professions,

26:10.180 --> 26:12.940
the various measures of social achievement

26:12.940 --> 26:17.260
doesn't follow from judging by the content of character

26:17.260 --> 26:18.980
and that color of skin

26:18.980 --> 26:21.300
that when we look at the end of the day

26:21.300 --> 26:22.660
at the social outcomes,

26:22.660 --> 26:26.060
that they will be equal across the different groups.

26:26.940 --> 26:29.580
In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea

26:29.580 --> 26:31.740
that groups will be equal

26:31.740 --> 26:33.940
in all of the various social outcomes,

26:33.940 --> 26:36.860
that they will be equally successful in business,

26:36.860 --> 26:40.660
that they will be proportionately represented

26:40.660 --> 26:42.140
in the various professions,

26:42.140 --> 26:45.660
that they will have the same educational achievement,

26:45.660 --> 26:49.660
that the occupational profiles will look the same.

26:51.020 --> 26:54.660
If they are in fact distinct groups

26:54.660 --> 26:58.860
with their own cultural traditions and practices,

26:59.820 --> 27:02.060
with their own ideals and norms,

27:03.500 --> 27:06.060
various immigrant populations,

27:06.060 --> 27:08.260
people coming to the United States of America

27:08.260 --> 27:10.820
from all corners of the world,

27:11.860 --> 27:14.700
the descendants of the African slaves,

27:14.700 --> 27:17.340
the black Americans here today,

27:17.340 --> 27:21.940
who are ourselves various with different origins and so on,

27:21.940 --> 27:25.300
the different religious practices and commitments

27:25.300 --> 27:30.300
that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,

27:32.740 --> 27:37.580
however we parcel up the total population

27:37.580 --> 27:38.740
into the various groups,

27:38.740 --> 27:42.780
these groups are themselves different from one another.

27:42.780 --> 27:45.220
They have different norms

27:45.220 --> 27:48.500
within their own cultural practice.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.460
How would we expect if in fact we recognize

27:51.460 --> 27:54.340
that the groups are different from one another,

27:54.380 --> 27:56.740
that in a world that is fair,

27:56.740 --> 28:00.020
they would all come out equally represented

28:00.020 --> 28:00.980
in every undertaking.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.340
They're not equally represented.

28:03.340 --> 28:08.340
And that fact I'm arguing is in and of itself insufficient

28:08.980 --> 28:11.380
to justify the conclusion

28:11.380 --> 28:15.260
that they're not somehow being fairly treated.

28:15.260 --> 28:18.660
Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes

28:18.660 --> 28:21.580
in a world in which the populations in question

28:21.580 --> 28:24.700
are themselves different with respect to their culture,

28:24.700 --> 28:27.700
their practices, their norms, their traditions,

28:27.700 --> 28:31.420
their beliefs, their ideals and so on.

28:31.420 --> 28:35.260
The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs,

28:35.260 --> 28:40.060
cultural orientations and ideals will have consequences

28:40.060 --> 28:44.060
in terms of their different social outcomes.

28:44.060 --> 28:47.820
So I just think it's a mistake that people are making

28:47.820 --> 28:51.980
when they think fairness of treatment

28:53.540 --> 28:56.020
implies equality of outcomes.

28:56.020 --> 28:57.540
It does not.

28:57.540 --> 29:01.260
Is the process by which we're speaking now

29:02.620 --> 29:06.340
in the midst of the National Basketball Association's

29:06.340 --> 29:10.500
playoffs, I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.580
I mean, I'm just, it's a very good team

29:13.580 --> 29:16.060
and I'm excited about my Celtics.

29:16.060 --> 29:21.060
We defeated the Brooklyn Nets.

29:22.460 --> 29:27.220
I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving

29:27.220 --> 29:31.020
and company, okay, in a playoff series.

29:31.020 --> 29:35.820
We whipped them and we're on our way to, you know,

29:35.820 --> 29:37.860
the Eastern Conference Finals

29:37.860 --> 29:39.820
and we're on our way to the NBA Finals.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.540
And I'm, you know, if I were a betting man,

29:42.540 --> 29:45.740
I'd put down a few bucks that the Boston Celtics

29:46.420 --> 29:48.540
underrated as we are, have a very good chance

29:48.540 --> 29:50.660
of winning the NBA Finals.

29:50.660 --> 29:51.820
Okay, so that's the NBA.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.580
That's the National Basketball Association.

29:53.580 --> 29:54.420
I'm a sports fan.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.240
I like basketball.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.620
Slightly biased prediction, but yes.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.620
Yeah, it is somewhat biased.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.860
All I'm saying is, if you take a look at

30:02.860 --> 30:04.500
who the star players are

30:04.500 --> 30:06.140
in the National Basketball Association,

30:06.140 --> 30:09.460
you're gonna find that there's some Eastern Europeans.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.820
You know, there's some really good basketball players

30:11.820 --> 30:13.780
coming out of Eastern Europe.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.020
You know, and more power to them.

30:17.020 --> 30:19.700
And there are a lot of African-Americans.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.800
We're overrepresented.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.420
They're not that many Jews, as far as I know.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.440
No offense intended there, Lex.

30:26.440 --> 30:31.440
But I mean, the NBA is not equally representative

30:34.060 --> 30:37.460
of all of the different populations in the United States.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.080
Now, we could go into the reasons why,

30:39.080 --> 30:41.380
but I'm just saying the process

30:41.380 --> 30:44.620
by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.340
If you can play, you can get on the court.

30:48.540 --> 30:51.220
All they're looking for is people who can play.

30:51.220 --> 30:53.020
I think something like that is true

30:54.300 --> 30:56.060
in many different venues.

30:56.060 --> 31:01.060
I expect, if you're a really good technical engineer,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.220
companies are gonna employ you.

31:04.180 --> 31:07.320
And if you can make money, they're gonna advance you.

31:07.480 --> 31:12.240
And you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.400
I expect that the people who are engaged

31:15.400 --> 31:17.040
in financial transactions,

31:17.040 --> 31:20.120
who are actually making bets on the market,

31:20.120 --> 31:24.200
by and large, are the people who are good at that activity.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.200
And if you're good at that activity in this world,

31:26.200 --> 31:31.200
in this modern world, you're gonna rise to the top.

31:32.080 --> 31:37.080
I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.520
Of course, there are of many different sorts,

31:40.520 --> 31:43.560
but I'm saying that to expect that there would be,

31:43.560 --> 31:46.240
okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.440
Let's look at who's actually trading bonds.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.940
Let's look at who's actually starting businesses

31:52.940 --> 31:57.120
and so on to say that in a fair world,

31:57.120 --> 31:59.960
I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population,

31:59.960 --> 32:02.400
they'd be 10% of every one of those things,

32:02.400 --> 32:06.680
is to ignore the reality that the differences

32:06.680 --> 32:09.880
in the culture and practices and norms

32:09.880 --> 32:11.640
of the various population groups

32:11.640 --> 32:14.880
will lead to differences in their representation

32:14.880 --> 32:17.120
amongst people who are outstanding performers

32:17.120 --> 32:20.120
in one or another activity.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.080
How do you know if the difference in culture

32:24.080 --> 32:26.960
accounts for the difference in outcomes,

32:26.960 --> 32:30.160
or it's the existence of barriers,

32:30.160 --> 32:33.000
especially barriers early on in life

32:33.000 --> 32:35.320
of discrimination that are racially based?

32:35.320 --> 32:38.560
So if you think about affirmative action,

32:38.560 --> 32:43.560
is in which ways is affirmative action empowering,

32:44.880 --> 32:47.520
in which way is it limiting

32:47.520 --> 32:50.840
for these early development of the different groups?

32:50.840 --> 32:53.100
But let's just speak to African Americans.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.760
We should say that you went to some

32:55.760 --> 32:57.720
no-name Northwestern University at first,

32:57.720 --> 33:00.420
but then you ended up with the great University of MIT.

33:01.420 --> 33:05.820
So that's your, not early, but middle development.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.040
So speaking of the development,

33:09.040 --> 33:13.240
the opportunities, the equality of opportunity,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.680
how do we know we got that equality right?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.620
We were talking about results,

33:20.620 --> 33:22.120
now we're talking about opportunity.

33:22.120 --> 33:26.960
I was taking the position that when King says,

33:26.960 --> 33:29.520
I have a dream and he envisions a world

33:29.520 --> 33:32.280
where his children will not be barred

33:32.280 --> 33:34.880
from the good things in life

33:34.880 --> 33:37.000
because of the color of their skin,

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
we're talking about opportunity, not about results.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.320
But opportunity is not just something

33:45.320 --> 33:48.640
that depends upon what the law is

33:48.640 --> 33:49.920
and what public policies are.

33:49.920 --> 33:54.680
Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions

33:54.680 --> 33:56.760
in which people are raised,

33:56.760 --> 33:58.240
the social and economic conditions.

33:58.240 --> 34:03.240
So the child of a poor family that has no resources,

34:04.560 --> 34:06.320
it doesn't have the same opportunity

34:06.320 --> 34:08.560
as a child of a wealthy family

34:08.560 --> 34:11.640
to realize their full human potential.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.120
You asked me, how can we tell whether or not

34:14.120 --> 34:18.960
a difference in outcomes is a reflection

34:18.960 --> 34:22.080
of unequal opportunity or it's a reflection

34:22.080 --> 34:26.640
of differences in culture and interest and practice?

34:26.640 --> 34:29.560
And I don't know that there's a single answer

34:29.560 --> 34:33.720
to that question, but I think one wants to look at the data.

34:33.720 --> 34:38.720
One wants to try to measure, as a social scientist,

34:38.960 --> 34:41.760
I would say what you wanna do is you wanna estimate

34:44.600 --> 34:47.200
the significance of various factors

34:47.200 --> 34:48.440
for determining the outcome.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.800
If the outcome is how much money does a person make

34:51.800 --> 34:53.720
when they work in the labor market?

34:53.720 --> 34:56.600
So you look at their wages and you think,

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
well, that depends upon a number of things.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.880
It depends upon how educated they are,

35:00.880 --> 35:02.880
what kind of skills they have,

35:02.880 --> 35:06.920
what kind of work experience they have and so on.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.840
And those things are all legitimate factors

35:11.200 --> 35:13.800
that might determine how much they end up making

35:13.800 --> 35:15.640
in the labor market.

35:15.640 --> 35:19.640
But you also wanna perhaps controlling for those things,

35:19.640 --> 35:23.240
see whether or not the fact that they are black

35:23.240 --> 35:25.680
or they are Latino or whatever,

35:25.680 --> 35:29.280
fact that they are male or that they are female,

35:29.280 --> 35:31.840
the fact that they do or do not speak English

35:31.840 --> 35:34.440
as their native language, this kind of thing,

35:34.440 --> 35:38.640
whether those factors also are implicated

35:38.640 --> 35:41.520
in determining how successful they are

35:41.520 --> 35:42.360
in the labor market.

35:42.360 --> 35:46.400
And if you find that after you have controlled

35:46.400 --> 35:51.400
for the things that are legitimately determining success

35:51.840 --> 35:52.960
and failure in the labor market,

35:52.960 --> 35:56.520
like skills and education and experience,

35:56.520 --> 35:58.720
having controlled for those things,

35:58.720 --> 36:01.680
the fact that a person is black or is a woman

36:01.680 --> 36:06.680
or is an immigrant or is of Latino background

36:09.480 --> 36:11.760
also affects their earnings,

36:11.840 --> 36:14.440
and you might conclude that to that extent,

36:14.440 --> 36:16.760
they're not getting equal opportunity in the labor market,

36:16.760 --> 36:17.800
that kind of idea.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.160
But I wanna focus a little bit more here

36:22.160 --> 36:23.760
on what we mean by opportunity

36:23.760 --> 36:28.760
because it's not just whether employers treat the worker

36:29.840 --> 36:33.160
on a fair and even basis,

36:33.160 --> 36:36.760
irregardless of the worker's racial or ethnic background.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.560
That's one opportunity issue,

36:39.560 --> 36:43.720
but that's at the end of the development process.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.800
They are now presenting themselves to the market,

36:46.800 --> 36:50.880
trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.760
That's the end of the line.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.960
What about the developmental opportunity,

36:54.960 --> 36:58.760
the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.200
That goes all the way back.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.560
That goes all the way back to birth.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.480
It even goes back to before birth.

37:04.480 --> 37:09.320
The mother carrying the infant in the womb,

37:10.520 --> 37:15.320
she has certain nutritional practices

37:15.320 --> 37:18.360
and she might be smoking or drinking alcohol

37:18.360 --> 37:19.200
or something like that.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.840
I'm not saying she is, I'm not saying she isn't.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.640
I'm just saying whether she is

37:22.640 --> 37:27.080
so she isn't affect the development of the fetus.

37:27.080 --> 37:32.040
The newborn, now there's a question of environment.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.720
There's a question of the development

37:33.720 --> 37:37.840
of their neurological potential.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.320
Do they learn how to read?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.440
Are they stimulated verbally?

37:42.440 --> 37:44.400
How many words have they heard spoken?

37:45.360 --> 37:49.720
Are they being nurtured in a home environment

37:49.720 --> 37:52.800
so as to maximize the possibility

37:52.800 --> 37:55.200
of them achieving their human potential?

37:55.200 --> 37:57.960
What about the peer group influences?

37:57.960 --> 38:00.840
What about the values and norms

38:00.840 --> 38:04.440
of the surrounding human communities

38:04.440 --> 38:05.880
in which they're embedded?

38:05.880 --> 38:10.200
Do they encourage the young person to apply themselves

38:11.120 --> 38:14.320
in a systematic way to their studies

38:14.320 --> 38:18.840
and to their focus on their acquisition of language command

38:18.840 --> 38:21.440
and of their educational potential?

38:22.480 --> 38:25.520
So development is not only something

38:25.520 --> 38:29.720
that is controlled by the society's practices,

38:29.760 --> 38:32.280
it's also something that is influenced

38:32.280 --> 38:37.000
by the cultural background of the individual.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.360
And those things are not equal.

38:40.360 --> 38:45.360
Those things vary across groups in a very significant way.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.240
And that too will be a factor

38:50.240 --> 38:53.480
determining disparities of outcome.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.040
So when I see outcomes that are different,

38:56.040 --> 38:58.760
I see wealth holding that's different.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.040
I see educational achievement that's different.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.760
I see representation in the professional schools

39:03.760 --> 39:05.080
and law school and medical school

39:05.080 --> 39:06.840
that's different between groups.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.840
One question is, are the institutions

39:09.840 --> 39:11.040
treating people fairly?

39:11.040 --> 39:15.280
But another question is, do the background

39:15.280 --> 39:17.280
in social and cultural influences

39:17.280 --> 39:20.680
equip people in the same way?

39:20.680 --> 39:22.440
And we know that the answer to that,

39:22.440 --> 39:25.880
not in every instance do they equip people in the same way.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.560
And so it makes the judgment,

39:27.600 --> 39:28.760
the moral judgment that we make

39:28.760 --> 39:32.640
when we see inequality of outcome complicated.

39:34.080 --> 39:39.080
Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree,

39:39.120 --> 39:43.920
but it is also a cultural factor to some degree,

39:43.920 --> 39:46.800
I wanna say, and that's controversial, I know.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.200
A lot of people, they think of themselves

39:50.200 --> 39:51.400
as being progressive.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.240
They wanna point a finger at society

39:55.240 --> 39:57.080
whenever they see a disparity.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.040
But I think that that's a mistake.

40:00.040 --> 40:05.040
I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.520
You think that if you get the right law,

40:08.520 --> 40:11.000
if you have the right public policy,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.400
if the right politicians are elected to office,

40:13.400 --> 40:16.000
suddenly those disparities will go away.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.680
And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope.

40:22.160 --> 40:26.120
And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.640
but I mean, we could go into that.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.200
You were talking about affirmative action,

40:30.200 --> 40:33.280
which is something else altogether.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.560
And you were talking about me and my education,

40:35.560 --> 40:39.000
which is also something that's a little bit different.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.760
And I'm happy to talk about those things.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.880
Northwestern University, by the way,

40:42.880 --> 40:44.240
was a great university.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.080
I'm just joking.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.800
It's one of the great universities of the world, yes.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.840
And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University,

40:50.840 --> 40:53.720
which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.080
And I got a very good technical training in mathematics

40:58.080 --> 41:00.000
when I was at Northwestern, so.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.560
You love both mathematics and human nature.

41:03.560 --> 41:08.320
And so, which is why you ended up going into economics

41:08.320 --> 41:10.400
at one of the great economics programs

41:10.400 --> 41:13.040
in the world at MIT and getting your PhD there.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.280
So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,

41:16.280 --> 41:19.880
which allows you to think systematically and rigorously

41:19.880 --> 41:23.000
about the way the world and the way humans work at scale.

41:24.720 --> 41:28.600
Trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans,

41:28.600 --> 41:32.280
like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.680
Well, economics is one of the social sciences.

41:35.680 --> 41:39.200
I think there's value in psychology and in sociology.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.880
There's a lot to know that doesn't come up

41:41.880 --> 41:43.920
within the study of economics.

41:43.920 --> 41:48.920
We study markets and the dynamics of economic development

41:49.200 --> 41:54.200
and trade and so on.

41:54.320 --> 41:59.120
But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along,

41:59.120 --> 42:01.080
I was fascinated by mathematics.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.520
I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern

42:04.520 --> 42:09.520
and took a lot of courses there in functional analysis

42:09.880 --> 42:14.440
and logic and mathematics and dynamical systems

42:14.480 --> 42:18.280
and stuff that I ended up employing

42:18.280 --> 42:20.920
in my graduate studies in economics.

42:20.920 --> 42:25.680
But you're right, I was not satisfied simply

42:25.680 --> 42:27.560
to be proving theorems.

42:27.560 --> 42:32.160
I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance

42:32.160 --> 42:37.160
and economics, I discovered to my delight,

42:37.160 --> 42:39.120
was a field of study that allowed me both

42:39.120 --> 42:44.120
to develop rigorous analytical framework

42:45.320 --> 42:50.320
modeling and precision of logical deduction and inference.

42:54.800 --> 42:59.800
On the one hand, satisfying my mathematical interests,

43:00.440 --> 43:02.400
but on the other hand, could address questions

43:02.400 --> 43:04.640
of social significance like,

43:04.640 --> 43:07.800
why does racial inequality persist?

43:07.800 --> 43:10.360
Why are some countries prospering and growing

43:10.360 --> 43:12.920
and others less so?

43:12.960 --> 43:16.080
Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate

43:16.080 --> 43:19.320
in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?

43:19.320 --> 43:24.320
And I ended up falling in love with the application

43:24.320 --> 43:29.320
of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.120
What to you is beautiful about mathematics,

43:32.120 --> 43:35.640
about mathematical puzzles, about logic,

43:35.640 --> 43:39.440
all those kinds of things, because it's still there.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.200
The love for math is still there for you.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.320
So is there something you could speak to?

43:43.320 --> 43:46.640
What is the kernel, the flame of that love?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.120
It's like magic.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.840
I mean, being able to prove something

43:52.840 --> 43:57.840
and I think of offhand, there's no largest prime number.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.560
How would somebody know that?

44:02.560 --> 44:03.520
Okay, what's a prime number?

44:03.520 --> 44:05.960
So a prime number is a whole number

44:05.960 --> 44:08.760
that has no divisor other than one.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.160
I know divisors of the number that makes it a prime number,

44:12.160 --> 44:17.160
like 13 or 19 or 37, whatever, okay.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.600
So they're prime numbers.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.800
There's no largest prime number.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.200
There are infinite number of prime numbers.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.960
There's no largest prime number.

44:23.960 --> 44:24.800
That's an idea.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.760
You can get your mind around it in an instant.

44:26.760 --> 44:31.760
It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.280
There's no largest prime number.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.200
I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.760
Oh, they don't show up in economics,

44:37.760 --> 44:39.560
except cryptography, I understand,

44:39.560 --> 44:44.560
they're important for code, in coding stuff.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.960
And that shows up in economics.

44:45.960 --> 44:50.280
But in terms of models, probably not.

44:50.280 --> 44:55.280
So prime numbers are little, in abstract algebra,

44:58.800 --> 45:00.920
it's like they show up in all these places

45:00.920 --> 45:04.240
that are just like beautiful mathematical puzzles

45:04.240 --> 45:06.000
that don't immediately have an application,

45:06.000 --> 45:09.080
but somehow maybe challenge you

45:09.080 --> 45:11.480
and as a result, push mathematics forward,

45:11.480 --> 45:12.960
like Fermat's Last Theorem.

45:14.200 --> 45:18.240
As far as I know, no obvious real-world application,

45:18.240 --> 45:20.000
but it has challenged mathematicians

45:20.000 --> 45:21.120
throughout the centuries.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.160
Indeed.

45:22.160 --> 45:27.160
And somehow indirectly progressed the field.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.800
But-

45:28.800 --> 45:31.960
That the rational numbers are countable.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.840
They can be put in one-to-one relationship

45:34.840 --> 45:37.040
with the integers and, you know,

45:37.040 --> 45:38.840
but that the real numbers are not countable

45:38.840 --> 45:41.120
and there's a lot more real, quote unquote,

45:41.120 --> 45:41.960
more real numbers.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.400
These are orders of infinity.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.080
This is Cantor, Georg Cantor,

45:46.080 --> 45:48.920
and all that kind of stuff.

45:48.920 --> 45:53.120
Or Gödel's Theorem, I studied this as an undergraduate,

45:53.120 --> 45:56.120
the incompleteness theorem that there are propositions

45:56.120 --> 45:59.240
within any logical system that's rich enough

45:59.240 --> 46:02.640
to accommodate arithmetic.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.560
There are going to be propositions

46:04.560 --> 46:06.600
that you can formulate that are true,

46:06.600 --> 46:09.480
but that you cannot prove to be true.

46:10.640 --> 46:14.720
So the idea that you could systematically develop

46:14.720 --> 46:18.240
a logical framework for mathematical inquiry

46:19.120 --> 46:21.840
that could demonstrate the truth or falsity

46:21.840 --> 46:26.840
of any proposition is not a feasible goal.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.640
This was Hilbert's project, as I understand it,

46:30.640 --> 46:35.320
and Gödel showed that there was no hope ever

46:35.320 --> 46:39.160
of being able to demonstrate the closure

46:39.160 --> 46:41.520
of logical systems that were rich enough

46:41.520 --> 46:43.920
to accommodate the real numbers.

46:43.920 --> 46:48.000
They gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians

46:48.000 --> 46:50.800
and scientists alike, and humans,

46:50.800 --> 46:52.520
because maybe you can't prove everything.

46:52.520 --> 46:56.960
I remember, you know, when I was a junior college,

46:56.960 --> 46:58.200
a community college student

46:58.200 --> 47:00.080
before I transferred to Northwestern,

47:00.080 --> 47:04.560
and I took a calculus course, and it was a lot of fun.

47:04.560 --> 47:09.480
And it was differentiating algebraic expressions

47:09.480 --> 47:12.800
and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions.

47:12.800 --> 47:16.120
And it was a lot of simple problem solving.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.480
I get to Northwestern,

47:17.480 --> 47:19.960
I take a course in differential equations.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.640
And again, it was a lot of formulaic, you know,

47:22.640 --> 47:24.680
applying if you get a differential equation

47:24.680 --> 47:26.280
of this structure, like if it's linear,

47:26.280 --> 47:29.840
you've got exponentials, et cetera, you can solve it.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.840
And then I took a course that showed me, you know,

47:32.840 --> 47:35.640
where the question was not how to solve

47:35.640 --> 47:38.560
any particular functional expression,

47:38.560 --> 47:41.800
but it was proving the existence of a solution

47:41.800 --> 47:43.600
to a differential equation,

47:43.600 --> 47:46.600
where it was like X dot equals F of X and T,

47:46.600 --> 47:49.280
and F is just some arbitrary function.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.440
What do I have to assume about the function F

47:52.440 --> 47:54.720
in order to know that there exists a solution

47:54.720 --> 47:57.000
to the differential equation,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.840
dx dt equals F of X and T.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.920
And it's basically, they called it a Lipschitz condition.

48:03.920 --> 48:08.240
It's a condition about the bounding of the slope

48:08.240 --> 48:11.520
of the function F as a function of X

48:11.520 --> 48:15.600
that it doesn't, that you can sort of uniformly bound

48:15.600 --> 48:17.200
the slope on that function.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.280
And then you can use a iterative process

48:20.280 --> 48:23.880
to show that the sequence of, you know,

48:23.880 --> 48:26.080
partial solutions to the thing converges to something

48:26.080 --> 48:27.160
that's a solution to the real thing.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.520
Anyway, again, I'm not gonna bore you

48:29.520 --> 48:32.120
or pretend that I'm a mathematician.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
I'm not, but what I'm saying is the difference

48:34.120 --> 48:38.560
between a specific algebraic formula

48:38.560 --> 48:42.520
that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand,

48:42.520 --> 48:45.360
and the abstract question of whether there exists

48:45.360 --> 48:48.520
a solution in the general case

48:48.520 --> 48:53.400
is like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics.

48:53.400 --> 48:56.480
And the techniques that you have to employ

48:56.480 --> 48:59.720
to address these larger questions and so on.

48:59.720 --> 49:03.600
So I, you know, when I was an undergraduate,

49:03.600 --> 49:08.520
I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis

49:08.520 --> 49:11.960
at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician

49:11.960 --> 49:16.880
named Avner Fridman and learned about measure theory.

49:16.880 --> 49:21.880
And, you know, learned about some early functional laws

49:23.400 --> 49:25.200
and some early functional analysis ideas.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.400
And when I saw that those ideas were being applied

49:28.400 --> 49:32.120
by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.360
I found an intellectual home.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.840
So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics

49:38.840 --> 49:43.840
is to think, which echoes the challenge of economics,

49:45.880 --> 49:48.520
what are the properties of an equation

49:48.520 --> 49:52.160
that allow you to say something profound

49:52.160 --> 49:53.640
and say it simply?

49:53.640 --> 49:56.080
And so the question of economics is,

49:56.080 --> 49:59.280
how do you construct a model where you can generalize

49:59.280 --> 50:03.520
nicely and say something profound and say it simply?

50:03.520 --> 50:07.760
So one of the questions, one of the challenges of economics

50:07.760 --> 50:12.760
is macro versus microeconomics is, you know,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.320
the world is made up of individuals.

50:16.320 --> 50:20.200
So there's a connection to this, our discussion of race

50:20.200 --> 50:22.000
and discrimination and outcomes

50:22.000 --> 50:24.280
and all those kinds of things.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.600
The world is made up of individuals,

50:26.600 --> 50:29.840
but in order to say something general,

50:29.840 --> 50:34.840
we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.960
We have to aggregate that data somehow.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.520
We have to make an average over some set of people.

50:41.520 --> 50:46.120
So what are the pros and cons of looking at things

50:46.120 --> 50:50.160
like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome

50:51.160 --> 50:53.600
based on groups versus based on individuals?

50:53.600 --> 50:58.600
And what are the groups if there's any pros

50:58.800 --> 51:01.560
to looking at groups that we should be looking at?

51:02.480 --> 51:04.320
Okay, well, those are big questions.

51:04.320 --> 51:06.880
I mean, in economics, you're right.

51:06.880 --> 51:10.400
I mean, micro, you have an account of how individuals

51:10.400 --> 51:13.160
make decisions about spending their money

51:13.160 --> 51:16.040
on the consumption side and about how enterprises

51:16.040 --> 51:19.640
make decisions about what to produce,

51:19.640 --> 51:21.720
how much of it, what inputs to use,

51:21.720 --> 51:24.400
what techniques of production and so on,

51:24.400 --> 51:27.920
individual firms, individual consumers,

51:27.920 --> 51:29.120
and then you wanna aggregate.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.840
So there's a theory of so-called theory

51:30.840 --> 51:33.680
of general equilibrium where, you know,

51:33.680 --> 51:38.120
you think supply and demand in a bunch of markets,

51:38.120 --> 51:40.880
you think prices that move to equilibrate,

51:40.880 --> 51:42.960
but you recognize that the price in one market

51:42.960 --> 51:44.800
affects people's behavior in another,

51:44.800 --> 51:46.960
the markets interacting with each other.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.080
You realize that the behavior of one individual

51:49.080 --> 51:53.840
affects the supplies and available resources

51:53.840 --> 51:56.800
and for other individuals, so they're knitted together

51:56.800 --> 51:59.920
in some kind of systematic way.

51:59.920 --> 52:04.560
And you wanna try to demonstrate the fact

52:04.560 --> 52:07.400
that notwithstanding all these interdependencies,

52:07.400 --> 52:12.080
there exists a solution to the system of equations

52:12.080 --> 52:13.920
that equates demand and supply

52:13.920 --> 52:15.280
across all the different markets.

52:15.280 --> 52:19.000
This is the existence of general equilibrium.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.200
Then you wanna try to say something about

52:21.200 --> 52:24.480
the properties of an equilibrium if it exists.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.440
Is it efficient?

52:25.440 --> 52:27.600
Well, what do you mean by efficiency?

52:27.600 --> 52:32.000
Well, the idea of so-called Pareto-efficient outcomes.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.320
These are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.880
Everybody can't be made better off

52:36.880 --> 52:39.160
by an alternative outcome.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.240
You wanna demonstrate the efficiency

52:41.240 --> 52:43.880
of competitive equilibrium.

52:43.880 --> 52:45.240
What do you mean by competition?

52:45.240 --> 52:46.920
You mean that people take their actions

52:46.960 --> 52:51.760
to do the best for themselves that they can.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.400
Profits of firms, wellbeing of consumers,

52:54.400 --> 52:57.640
they try to do the best for themselves that they can.

52:59.080 --> 53:02.000
But they do so in reference to a set of prices

53:02.000 --> 53:03.600
that they believe they cannot control.

53:03.600 --> 53:08.320
That's the criterion of competitive market circumstance.

53:08.320 --> 53:11.280
So does a competitive equilibrium exist?

53:11.280 --> 53:12.760
Do there exist a set of prices

53:12.760 --> 53:15.840
which if everybody recognizes them as given

53:15.880 --> 53:20.840
and responds to those prices on behalf of their own interest,

53:20.840 --> 53:24.400
the outcome will be supply, equaling demand

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
in all the markets where people are interacting

53:26.400 --> 53:27.800
with one another.

53:27.800 --> 53:32.800
And that requires the use of some concepts in topology,

53:32.800 --> 53:34.240
fixed point theorems and whatnot

53:34.240 --> 53:36.080
that are familiar to mathematics.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.320
Not very deep mathematical results,

53:38.320 --> 53:40.560
but important to economics.

53:40.560 --> 53:43.200
That's all about general equilibrium and whatnot.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.120
But you ask about groups.

53:45.160 --> 53:49.280
By the way, amazing world win summary of all of economics.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.720
But yes, go ahead.

53:50.720 --> 53:51.800
That was great.

53:51.800 --> 53:56.800
Markets, of competition, of operator efficiency.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.080
Anyway, but yes, groups.

53:59.080 --> 53:59.920
And prices.

53:59.920 --> 54:00.760
And prices.

54:01.880 --> 54:05.120
And by the way, there are some very beautiful

54:07.520 --> 54:10.320
formalizations of everything that I'm saying here.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.760
You end up in vector spaces.

54:12.120 --> 54:15.840
You end up with sets of bundles of consumption

54:15.840 --> 54:16.680
and production.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.880
You end up with convexity.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.880
You end up with hyperplanes,

54:19.880 --> 54:23.880
which are in this finite dimensional vector space,

54:23.880 --> 54:28.880
which are all of the bundles that have the same value

54:29.880 --> 54:30.720
at a certain price.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.200
You end up with inner products.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.360
It's very pretty.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.800
Yeah, but you almost forget that it's just a bunch

54:38.800 --> 54:41.360
of humans transacting with each other.

54:43.760 --> 54:47.120
That markets are made up of individuals.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.040
Markets are made up of individuals.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.480
And in order to carry out this formalization,

54:51.480 --> 54:54.600
you have to make assumptions about the individuals.

54:54.600 --> 54:59.000
And the end result is true in a formal sense,

54:59.000 --> 55:03.160
but may not be true as a representation of the reality,

55:03.160 --> 55:04.640
because it depends upon assumptions

55:04.640 --> 55:06.640
that themselves may not hold.

55:07.640 --> 55:10.720
But at least you know what it is that has to be true

55:10.720 --> 55:15.640
in order for your formal framework to be relevant,

55:15.640 --> 55:18.600
which is already a step in the right direction, I think.

55:18.600 --> 55:22.280
I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition,

55:22.280 --> 55:24.480
the armchair intuition where we sit back

55:24.480 --> 55:28.200
and we don't really know exactly what we're talking about

55:28.200 --> 55:32.720
because we haven't pinned it down in a precise way.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.720
I'm in favor of the formalization.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.680
People, they think, what is mathematics

55:37.680 --> 55:39.120
and the social sciences?

55:39.120 --> 55:40.440
After all, we're dealing with people.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.120
People are not automata.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.560
I agree with that.

55:43.560 --> 55:48.200
But the analysis of the interaction of people,

55:48.200 --> 55:53.200
I think, to be rigorous requires us to be specific

55:53.200 --> 55:55.080
about what we're talking about, about markets,

55:55.080 --> 55:57.880
about consumers, about firms, about profits,

55:57.880 --> 56:00.760
about technology, about preferences.

56:00.760 --> 56:04.480
And that's the language of economics.

56:06.320 --> 56:11.320
But people's behavior depends upon what they seek in life.

56:11.920 --> 56:15.080
Depends upon their goals and their objectives.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.520
Those things are at play.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.000
They can be pushed this way or that.

56:22.520 --> 56:25.480
Nationalism, fighting and dying for your country.

56:26.480 --> 56:31.000
Religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
of the good or of what is the human situation

56:35.000 --> 56:36.400
and what is the meaning of life.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.800
Economists have to assume that these things

56:39.800 --> 56:43.400
are some particular thing before they can turn the crank

56:43.400 --> 56:46.240
on their machine to analyze the outcomes

56:46.240 --> 56:48.040
of human interaction.

56:48.040 --> 56:53.040
And yet these things, belief in my identity,

56:54.040 --> 56:57.440
but the things that I'm willing to sacrifice and die for,

56:57.440 --> 57:01.880
purposes of life that I affirm and pass on to my children,

57:01.880 --> 57:05.400
are important preconditions for actually carrying out

57:05.400 --> 57:06.960
any economic analysis.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.800
And they are subject to manipulation

57:08.800 --> 57:11.120
and to change over time.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.480
And that's not something that economics

57:13.480 --> 57:15.400
has a whole lot to say about.

57:15.400 --> 57:17.840
Well, is there some general things

57:17.840 --> 57:19.920
that are really powerful in terms of,

57:20.000 --> 57:24.400
you said nation, religion, those are groups.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.840
Can you group people nicely

57:26.840 --> 57:29.400
in helping you understand human nature?

57:29.400 --> 57:34.080
So group them into nations based on their citizenry.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.480
That's geography, right?

57:36.720 --> 57:39.320
The geographic location of your birth

57:39.320 --> 57:44.320
or your long-term residence or maybe religious belief.

57:44.520 --> 57:48.520
What religion you believe over time.

57:48.520 --> 57:49.680
Is there groups like that?

57:50.440 --> 57:51.600
And then race.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.720
Is that useful?

57:56.040 --> 57:59.560
What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes

57:59.560 --> 58:02.480
based on these kinds of groups?

58:02.480 --> 58:03.880
Race in particular.

58:07.240 --> 58:09.080
I think they're pros and I think they're cons.

58:09.080 --> 58:13.400
I mean, I am myself, Glenn Lowry sits before you right now,

58:14.480 --> 58:16.720
a black American, an African American,

58:17.160 --> 58:19.200
quote unquote, I identify as,

58:19.200 --> 58:21.280
that's the way they talk about it nowadays.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.920
I identify as a black American.

58:22.920 --> 58:24.680
My skin is brown.

58:24.680 --> 58:26.360
My hair is coarse.

58:26.360 --> 58:29.440
My nose is broad relative to the way

58:29.440 --> 58:31.000
other people's noses look.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.680
My lips are thicker.

58:32.680 --> 58:37.680
That's a consequence of my ancestral descent

58:37.760 --> 58:41.720
from the human population resident

58:41.720 --> 58:45.600
in the African continent in millennia past.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.760
My race.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.760
Here in the United States,

58:50.760 --> 58:53.720
we have various quote unquote races

58:54.920 --> 58:58.920
defined crudely in the way that I just tried to define myself.

58:59.880 --> 59:03.520
You could say, and I think there is a very powerful argument

59:03.520 --> 59:07.520
that these are superficial differences.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.240
I mean, really?

59:09.240 --> 59:12.000
Why should it matter that your eye color

59:12.000 --> 59:16.520
or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face

59:17.400 --> 59:19.240
or the color, the tone of your skin,

59:19.240 --> 59:20.720
the amount of melanin and how it is

59:20.720 --> 59:23.160
that you react to ultraviolet radiation

59:23.160 --> 59:25.600
in terms of your skin?

59:26.880 --> 59:30.760
What is that to be the basis of anything?

59:30.760 --> 59:32.320
I mean, that's arbitrary.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.360
That's not meaningful.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.720
Could there really be meaning

59:34.720 --> 59:38.040
in these superficial differences among human beings?

59:38.040 --> 59:41.000
Isn't that a archaic or barbaric way

59:41.000 --> 59:42.200
of thinking about ourselves

59:42.200 --> 59:46.040
to look at each other's skin color or hair texture

59:46.040 --> 59:49.520
and then to decide, oh, that's a black or that's a white

59:49.520 --> 59:53.240
or that's a Latin or that's an Asian or that's a whatever.

59:54.320 --> 59:57.560
That's something that we should outgrow,

59:57.560 --> 59:59.360
a person might say.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.360
That's a relic of a kind of tribal society,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.920
of a kind of pre-modern society

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:11.400
where we built real structure

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.880
on the basis of such superficial difference.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.080
A person could say that.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.640
On the other hand, I am a black American.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.960
I mean, that's part of my identity.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.560
That's part of my heritage.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.440
It's part of the stories that I tell myself

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.040
about who my people are.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.320
Why do I need a people?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.400
Why do I need a narrative of dissent

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.400
in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.480
Do I really need that?

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.560
I mean, I think that's an important question.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.240
I, in fact, this is a confession, think of myself as black.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.880
I could think of myself as simply human.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.840
I could not identify specifically as black.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.920
I could say, oh, my eyes are brown too, so what?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.240
I'm a brown eye?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.920
I mean, I'm gonna invent a group based on my eye color.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.000
I weigh 290 pounds.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.320
I'm gonna have a body size group.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.880
Body size group, I'm a plus 200,

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.400
and that's quote, who I am, close quote.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.800
I don't do that.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.000
I came from Chicago.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.720
Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.840
I'm a Chicago born person, but frankly,

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.760
I haven't lived in Chicago since 1979.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.120
That's a long time.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.600
I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.120
I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.960
or St. Louis and fight to the death

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.800
with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.680
based upon the fact that we come from different cities.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.080
And you have even abandoned in your heart

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.560
the Chicago Bulls.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.960
There's some Chicago that's still in me, I suppose,

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.600
but it's not very deep.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.360
It's not quote, who I am anymore,

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.840
and I'm wondering, here I'm trying to pose the question,

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.040
why is it that being a descendant of African slaves

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.880
should be who I am?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.080
So there's some answers.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.840
One answer is people will look at me

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.520
and deal with me differently based upon what they see.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.120
I don't have control over that.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.400
I'm going to be perceived as a member of a group,

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.960
whether or not I elect to affiliate myself

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.840
with that group or not.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.640
Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.640
that regardless of what my internal orientation is,

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.400
the world will perceive me in a particular way

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.480
and will perceive me differently

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.120
based upon the color of my skin.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.960
So a police officer who stops me at two o'clock

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.440
in the morning because my tail light is out

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.120
and ask me for my automobile registration,

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.040
and I reach quickly to the glove compartment

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.120
to get my registration.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.760
And the police officer says, show me your hands.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.880
And I don't quite hear what he says

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.040
or I ignore what he says

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.760
because I'm getting my document out of my glove compartment.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.920
But the police officer thinks

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.680
because I have not responded to his demand

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.640
to show my hands that I might be reaching for a weapon.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.440
And the police officer sees that I'm black

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.080
and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.040
is higher because in that town at that time,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.800
a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.760
in their car happen to be black and male and so on.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.000
And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.240
and I'm bleeding out there and I'm dead now.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.720
And all of that is a possibility that's very real

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.120
and it's based upon the color of my skin.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.640
And therefore, when he stops me,

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.480
I keep my hands on the steering wheel

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.560
and I don't go to the glove compartment

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.280
and I'm fearful of the fact that he might mistake me

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.360
for a criminal, et cetera.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.920
Or I walk into a high-end store, clothing store,

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.000
I see you're nicely dressed there, Lex.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.640
I'm not, but that's okay.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.920
I do have some good clothes at home.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.040
I just didn't wear them here today.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.880
But you know what I mean?

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.880
And the salesman in the clothing store either treats me

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.920
like an old friend and is warm and welcoming

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.520
and what can I do for you, sir?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.000
And let me show you this and that

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.360
and what are you looking for?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.680
Because he thinks I'm gonna spend $1,000 there that day

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.520
and he's gonna get a 5% commission or whatever it is.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.240
And he either does that or he ignores me

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.520
and looks at me with suspicion

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.480
and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.360
or thinks I'm only gonna spend $50 and not $500

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.440
and therefore I'm not worth his time.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.000
And I'm aware of the fact that when I go

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
into the clothing store, especially the high-end places

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.880
where I can buy a good suit or buy some really good

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.200
dress shirts or slacks that fit me well and so on,

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.480
I'm aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.200
by the salesman based upon the fact

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.160
that he's looking at me and he sees a black person.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:08.120
And therefore I dress up before I go out to buy clothes

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.520
to get, you know, cause I wanna present myself

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.200
as not someone who's just walked in off the street

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.280
but as one of those black people who is really prepared

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.400
to spend some money in the store

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.880
so that I can be treated with respect.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.800
And I have to carry the burden such as it is

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.800
of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.640
by overcoming the suppositions that people may have

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.600
about me based upon the color of my skin,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.320
something like that.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:43.760
Or I ask myself, what am I gonna teach my children

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.360
about who they are and where they come from?

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.440
What stories am I gonna tell them about their ancestors?

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.320
Who are their ancestors?

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.840
Every African-American has European ancestors.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.440
Every black person in the United States of America,

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.600
I think that I can say that almost without exception.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.840
We could go to 23andMe and look at the DNA.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.640
They have European ancestors, they're not purely African.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.520
That's a fact and that's a consequence of the experience

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.880
of African-descended people because it's a mixed population.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.800
My name is Lowry, spelled L-O-U-R-Y

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.240
but pronounced as if it were L-O-W-E-R-Y.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.000
And I gather, if you trace the history of that name,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.680
that it's Scottish.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.440
So somewhere back then-

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.920
So you could identify as a Scot.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.440
Well, or I could claim some Scottish descent, but I don't.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.200
I don't know who those ancestors are.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.080
And frankly, I don't know who my enslaved ancestors are.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.120
I can't trace my family history back very far

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.200
into the 19th century.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.440
But so what stories do I tell my children about who we are,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.840
about who their ancestors are?

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.400
I mean, I wanna tell my children some story

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.840
and that story is gonna be colored, quote unquote,

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.640
by my race.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.160
So even though it is superficial,

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.880
and in an ideal world, you might think,

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.480
why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.960
So there's this Chinese writer, Chixin Liu is his name.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.480
I might not pronounce it exactly right.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.440
C-I-X-I-N-L-I-U, Chixin Liu.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.320
He has a trilogy, The Three-Body Problem,

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.840
The Dark Forest, and Death's End.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.800
Those are the three books of Chixin Liu's trilogy

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.920
about how Trisolaris, which is another star system

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.560
within a few light years of the solar system,

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.520
and Earth get into a conflict.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.440
And when the Trisolarans come down to dominate Earth,

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.400
suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.400
and the North Americans and the Europeans

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.680
and the Africans and the South Asians

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.120
become kind of insignificant because after all,

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.280
the Trisolarans with their advanced civilization

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.080
whose star system is dying,

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.920
have their eyes on the solar system,

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.000
which has a planet, the third rock from the sun,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.520
that is pretty habitable and the difference between us

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.520
become pretty insignificant.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.120
So we shouldn't need for an invasion

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.120
by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.120
before we would recognize the common humanity

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.120
that we all share that is profound and is deep.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.320
We all descend in effect from the same ancestral population

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.160
of Homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.840
and has survived amongst all of the different possible

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.800
variations of species and whatnot of humanoid population.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.960
The Homo sapiens have flourished, the others have died out

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.480
and here we are and we can just look at the genetic

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.560
endowments that characterize our biological essence

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.560
and we can see that we are quote unquote

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.320
the same beneath the skin and yet we end up

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.520
freighting so much weight onto these superficial differences.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.640
So I can see both sides of the issue is what I'm saying.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.080
I can see the argument race is an irrelevancy

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.520
because at the end of the day, deep down it is,

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.440
but I can also see the argument that I hold on

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.800
to racial identity because A, my racial presentation

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.440
colors how other people deal with me,

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.000
but B, because everybody needs a story.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.560
Everybody needs an account.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.600
You tell me you're Jewish.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.400
I mean, I don't know how deep that is.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.760
I don't know how genetically profound that is.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.760
I do know that it's a culturally profound identity

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.120
for a lot of people based upon maybe some of the same

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.680
kind of forces that I'm talking about.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.880
A, they won't let you not be Jewish.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.280
You could say you're not Jewish,

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.800
but when Hitler's rounding people up,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.640
what you say doesn't have a whole lot to do

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.080
with what the Gestapo is about.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.360
And B, you need to tell your children a story.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.320
That's the fascinating thing about this tribalism

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.320
that you spoke about that we form tribes as humans

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.280
throughout human history, form tribes and have directed

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.600
hate toward other tribes and sometimes violence

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.640
and destruction, and yet tribalism allows you

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.200
to tell a story to your children,

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.400
allows you to grow a culture.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.080
There's something about defining yourself

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.680
within a particular tribe that allows you

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.840
to have a tradition.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.480
You have an article that you wrote called

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.800
The Case for Black Patriotism.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.760
So I should also say it's so interesting

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.760
because for me personally, I feel, identify as,

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.840
believe I am an American, and yet within

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.720
the American umbrella, it feels that there's a longing

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.120
for other tribes.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.560
You mentioned Jewish, but what I honestly feel is,

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.440
I mean a lot of it is humor and culture and so on,

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.960
is Russian and Ukrainian, because that's where I come from.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.600
That's where my family's from.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.080
There's stereotypical things that are funny,

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.920
humorous type of thing about Russians showing no emotion,

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.200
good at chess and math, into wrestling, drinking vodka.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.680
I mean there's literally every single stereotype

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.440
I'm in the embodiment of that.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.200
So you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.280
There's a tradition there within the American umbrella,

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.280
and some of it is humor, some of it is little quirks

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.120
of culture, but now with the war in Russia and Ukraine,

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.640
interestingly enough, even that little thing

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.960
becomes also a source of negative tribalism.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.960
But anyway, that context aside, what is black patriotism?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.800
And why do you feel?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.320
I mean, I'm speaking in an article called

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.920
The Case for Black Patriotism in a Particular Context.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.440
And what I'm saying basically is very simple.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.720
I'm saying we are African-Americans,

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.360
and the emphasis should be on the American.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.280
I actually don't even much care

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.560
for the framing African-American,

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.920
but I'm not gonna fight with people about it.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.840
It's, you know, I don't think it's worth fighting about.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.400
That's not, I would just say we're Americans,

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.040
or if you want, we're black Americans.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.600
We're certainly not African.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.360
That is, the African-American population

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.640
is a population of people who come into existence

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.740
here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.840
There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa,

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.920
immigrants from West Africa,

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.000
immigrants from Southern Africa,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.920
immigrants from the Caribbean,

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.120
who descend from an ancestral population, which is African.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.800
We, you know, the history of the world since 1500

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.640
is a history in which people of African descent

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.440
are scattered because of slavery

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.320
throughout the Western hemisphere.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.360
And so here we are.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.320
But the institution of slavery ended

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.320
in 1863 in the United States.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.840
The struggle that we started out talking about,

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.440
which gave rise to Martin Luther King giving that speech

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.880
that you say is the greatest speech in American history,

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.560
and I'm not gonna argue with you about that,

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.360
happened right here in the United States.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.280
We are, what is the United States?

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.440
The United States is a nation of immigrants.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.200
The population of the North American continent

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.840
was sparsely populated by an indigenous population,

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.280
which was destroyed in conquest

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.520
by a European population that settled here in North America

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.000
and appropriated the land

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.640
and have built a civilization here,

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.600
which has been people by large influx of individuals

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:57.600
from Europe, Irish and Italian and Greek and Slavic

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.760
and Jewish, Russian Jews coming in large numbers and so on

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.400
in wave after wave after wave of immigration,

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.120
Asian, Latin American population of people who have come

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.640
to reside here in the United States

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.240
and we black Americans who descend from slaves.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.080
We African-Americans who descend from slaves.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.600
So here we are.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.480
This is a great nation.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.480
I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.360
which is the United States of America founded in 1776, 1787,

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.080
fought a war of independence from the British,

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.560
established a republic which is a confederation

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.360
of these independent colonies,

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.680
which has grown into now the 50 states

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.040
of the United States of America, continental nation.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.720
The richest and most powerful nation on the planet

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.520
with massive influence throughout the world

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.680
for good and for ill.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.840
That's who we are, I wanna say to black people.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.680
There is no other home for us.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.720
This fantasy of we being a people apart back in the day

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.080
when I was coming along in the 1960s,

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.400
there was something called the Republic

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.800
of New Africa movement.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.320
And they wanted some states in the South

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.520
given over to black people

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.520
and we were gonna have our own country.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.600
And that's a joke, it's a fantasy.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.600
It's a mythic, unbalanced idea.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.760
Unrealistic, fanciful politics.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.160
It's not a serious politics.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.840
We're Americans, we're not going anywhere here.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.520
The idea that, and I wanna say this

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.800
in a number of different registers.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.760
I wanna say, first of all,

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.520
we need to make peace with the fact

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.240
that that's who we are and that's where we are.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.360
So nobody is coming.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.240
The world court is not gonna litigate our disputes.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.120
The United Nations is not gonna set up a desk

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.280
for people of African descent who reside in North America.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.240
We have to work out whatever our concerns are

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.280
with our fellow Americans right here

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:25.280
within the context of American politics.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.360
That means compromise.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.360
That means looking for a framework for political expression

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.440
which is broader than our racial identity, et cetera.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.280
So I wanna say that.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.560
But I also wanna say there's no reason to apologize

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.000
for this, there's something positive to affirm.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.520
I take on this question about slavery, in brief,

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.680
because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.920
and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.320
and it had consequences that endured,

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.120
that have endured long after the termination of the thing.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.040
But I also wanna say, look at what has happened

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.080
in the last 150 years for African-Americans.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.680
And I wanna say, look at the vitality of the institutions

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.920
here in the United States of America,

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.640
of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.640
Again, not perfect.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.760
Which are malleable enough, these institutions,

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.480
to allow for the transformation of the status

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.320
of African-Americans such as has occurred

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.120
since the end of slavery.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.000
And I wanna say there's a lot to celebrate in that.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.320
So this is our country.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:44.200
We are full members of the polity.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.360
We have burdens and responsibilities as well as privileges

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.880
that are associated with our membership in this Republic.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.840
That does not mean that we should not fight

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.480
for what we believe to be right,

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.720
although we are not one voice here, we black Americans.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.320
It does not mean that we should not protest things

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.240
that we think are deserving of protest.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.520
But I wanna say, it does mean that we should not reject

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.640
the framework that we're operating in

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.320
because we basically don't have any alternative

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.720
and because when viewed in full context,

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.080
a noble and profoundly significant achievement

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.760
the United States of America

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.960
and a beacon to the rest of the world.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.280
I don't wanna go off in some starry eyed kind

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.320
of jingoistic celebration of America

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.160
as the greatest civilization, et cetera, et cetera.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.160
But this great nation is our nation.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.760
And I think we do best by beginning,

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.800
we black Americans do best by beginning,

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.520
this is my argument in the piece,

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.520
by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.080
and then builds on it.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.960
So black patriotism is not exactly the same rhymes,

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.160
echoes American patriotism.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.000
So a black American is first and foremost an American.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.160
Yeah, a black American is first and foremost an American

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.600
and it's a good thing too.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.080
Hmm.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.480
Let me return to the question of Dr. King

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:35.160
and another powerful impact for individual Malcolm X

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.800
to ask you the question.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:42.800
Well, first people often perhaps inaccurately portray them

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:48.560
as representing two different ideals approaches

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.760
to the fight for civil rights.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.080
So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach,

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.080
the peacemaker and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.080
What do you think about this distinction

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.200
and broadly speaking in black patriotism

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.320
in the future of black Americans in the 21st century,

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.840
what is the role of anger?

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.040
What is the role of protests?

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.160
Even violence encompasses a lot of things

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.760
but just aggression and the fuck the man

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.920
we're going to have to make change, force change.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.920
Okay, I think you put your finger on something

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.840
really important in the context of we were just discussing

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.840
my black patriotism essay and it's not the only story.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.520
There is another story and Malcolm X

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.520
is someone you identify and his memory lives on

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.680
and is powerfully influential.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.520
And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.000
and I think you see it in the protest and rioting

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.920
and so forth that has broken out periodically

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.040
going all the way back to the 1960s and before

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.000
but especially since the 1960s.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.640
He saw it in Los Angeles in 1992

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.240
and the Rodney King civil disturbances that broke out there

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:23.200
and the balled up fist, the radical

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.560
Afro-centric rejection of the American story

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.440
that Martin Luther King, he believed in.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.360
He believed in a magnificent promissory note

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.960
and a lot of people are rolling their eyes

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.520
and saying, as you say, fuck the man,

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.240
magnificent promissory note.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:46.120
I mean, just get your knee off my neck.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.200
That's what you can do for me.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.240
Don't ask me to believe in your BS

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.200
about some magnificent promissory note,

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.640
some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.560
I mean, just get your knee off my neck.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.840
Now, I can relate to that.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:05.080
As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.200
and the 1960s.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.160
I remember Malcolm X, I mean, literally in real time.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.280
I remember when he was murdered in 1965

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.280
in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem in Manhattan

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.160
in New York City.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.280
I remember my uncle, I was raised in a house

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.800
where my aunt and uncle were the master of the house

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.640
and my mother and my sister and I lived

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.240
in a small apartment upstairs in the back

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.840
of this big house that my successful aunt and uncle owned.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.640
And my uncle was a small businessman,

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.960
a barber and a tradesman.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.560
He was a hustler.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.720
I mean, legally, I mean, he did what he had to do

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.560
to make money.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.400
He was very enterprising.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.800
Not especially well-educated,

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.360
but a very intelligent and disciplined

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.600
and resourceful provider for his family,

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.200
which included myself, my sister and my mother

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.040
in their household.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.480
And we called him Uncle Mooney

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.680
because he had moon-shaped eyes that protruded

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.520
and were round.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.520
Uncle Mooney, James Ellis was his name, Uncle Mooney.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.680
James Ellis Lee was my Uncle Mooney.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.320
But I'm saying all that to say this.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.040
He admired the nation of Islam.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.840
I mean, King and Malcolm X,

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.640
Martin King and Malcolm X differed

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.000
along a number of different dimensions.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.320
Malcolm X was a Muslim

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.920
and Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.920
My Uncle Mooney didn't have any time

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.080
for these Christian ministers.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.920
He thought that was the white man's religion.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.000
He, you know, and back in that day,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.640
you'd go into a black church

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.280
and you'd see a portrait of Jesus

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.280
and he'd be a blonde haired, blue-eyed.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.240
He didn't even look like a Mediterranean.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.640
He didn't look like somebody who came from Palestine.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.680
I mean, he looked like somebody who came

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.200
from Northern Europe or something like that,

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.040
the picture of Jesus.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.040
And my Uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.000
He would be damned if he was gonna bend his knee

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.400
to some white Jesus.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.680
But he was not a Muslim either.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.080
But he respected the Muslims.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.120
He brought home their newspaper.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.520
It was called Muhammad Speaks.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.080
It's the Nation of Islam,

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.680
which is the black Muslim movement

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.680
founded in American cities in Detroit and in Chicago,

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.360
going back to the early middle 20th century

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.760
and growing into a very significant movement

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.960
that had a lot of influence.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.680
Louis Farrakhan, a controversial figure,

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.960
descends from this movement.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.960
It has fractured now and has the major part

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.920
of the legacy of the black Muslims,

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.240
has assimilated itself into Islam proper.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.800
Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.200
and came back with a very different vision

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.880
about what it meant to be a Muslim

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.680
and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.600
and religious culture of Islam that has a global reach.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.920
And he had a different vision when he came back from that.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.280
Some people say that's why he was killed and so on.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.480
I don't know.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.320
I certainly find that to be plausible

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.200
that he became the constitutive threat to the sect,

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.200
which was the black Muslims and had to be dealt with.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.240
I don't know if we'll ever know the full story on that.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.600
But anyway, what I'm trying to say is

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.760
the black Muslims were there, Malcolm X was there.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.760
And in my experience, they constituted a counterpoint

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.320
to the position of king, which depended on a kind of respect

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.680
for the best of the tradition of American democracy,

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.360
appealing to the better nature of our oppressors,

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.720
live up to the full meaning of our creed.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.960
I mean, these are words that he would use.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.520
A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.280
as the Declaration of Independence

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.960
and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, unfulfilled ideal.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.720
And the black Muslims were like, fuck that.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.400
We're gonna take care of our own.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.000
We're gonna build our own schools.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.920
We're gonna build our own businesses.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.280
We're not waiting for the white man to do anything.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.280
Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.240
and let me take care of my own.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.520
And my uncle respected that.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.920
He respected the straight back,

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.600
stand up straight with your shoulders back.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.480
That's a Jordan Peterson.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.160
But I mean, that was way before Jordan Peterson,

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.360
but that was his philosophy.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.280
Stand up straight with your, raise your children.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.360
Don't be depending upon welfare.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.000
You take in welfare from the white man.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
You need to get busy.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.680
You need to educate yourself.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.720
You need to clean up your act.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.040
Put down the fried chicken because it's gonna kill you.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.600
My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad,

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.400
they called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad,

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.520
who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.840
He had a book and all the book said was,

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.960
be smart, eat green vegetables.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.320
Don't eat fried food.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.760
Don't eat pork, they're Muslims.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.400
Don't eat pork and take responsibility for your diet

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.800
and be healthy.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.400
And don't be putting a whole lot of pills into your body.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400
You don't need to do that if you just get control

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.800
of your diet and you eat properly.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.800
My uncle loves this idea of responsibility for self

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.480
and determination to build.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.040
He respected that in the Muslims,

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.880
even if he didn't buy the religious part of it.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.720
And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983,

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.000
he left me a bequest.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.040
It wasn't money, unfortunately.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.520
It was his complete collection of the recorded speeches

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.640
of Malcolm X.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.160
And I have these albums.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.120
These are 33 and a third LPs.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.240
There's six of them.

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.680
And I have a complete collection,

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.120
as best as my uncle could assemble,

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.560
of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.200
Now, why did he do that?

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.240
He did that because he did not want me to forget,

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.920
don't be dependent upon the white man.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.000
Build your own, stand up straight with your shoulders back,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.480
proud black man, take care of your business.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.480
Take care of your children.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.320
Pick up the trash in front of your house.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.440
Get busy.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.440
This was this philosophy.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.560
So violence now, that's another story.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.400
I mean, Malcolm X would say,

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.720
we're gonna defend ourselves.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:13.760
Are you gonna mess with us, you racist Ku Klux Klan

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.240
or whatever, we're gonna arm ourselves

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.400
and we're gonna fight you back.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400
You racist police who are

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.520
oppressing and persecuting and abusing our people,

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.960
well, you better be ready

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.760
because we're gonna fight you back.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:33.320
And that too was the spirit that my uncle,

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:36.120
that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.640
My uncle was not a radical, he was a businessman,

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.760
but he respected this idea.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.880
You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.480
because we're prepared to defend ourselves.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.280
So that blood runs in you too.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.440
That threat is, when you write about black patriotism,

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.400
that threat is there too.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:00.440
It's like you embody both the ideal that we're all American

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:05.400
but also that there is this oppressive history.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.400
There is the powerful that are manipulating you,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.280
that are oppressing you and you can't just wait around

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.400
for things to fix themselves.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.960
You have to take action.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.840
You have to take things into your own hands

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.640
and sometimes that means being angry.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.800
Sometimes that means being violent.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.960
That's there too.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.280
Yeah, it's there but here and the but is,

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.600
I don't me today, Glenn Lowry in 2022

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.480
think that that is the answer.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.120
I don't think that violent rebellion

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.680
gets us anywhere at the end of the day.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.880
I think we're past that.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.880
There aren't Knight Rider Ku Klux Klan,

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.720
people breaking down your door and dragging you away.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:00.720
There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.600
where you hang somebody from the tree

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.440
because they whistled at a white woman

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.000
or they got too much property in your community

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.280
and you became, they were uppity Negroes

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.120
and whatnot like that.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.880
That is a thing of the past in America

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.400
that the situation is no longer the one

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.160
that requires that kind of violent reaction

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.680
and that there is, if we look at the net effect

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.680
of the so-called rebellions in American cities,

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.880
they're negative.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.880
The George Floyd protests which became violent

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.160
and arsonists in the aftermath of civil disturbance

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.120
and whatnot in the summer of 2020,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:50.920
I think set back the program for African-Americans.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.360
I don't think it advanced it.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.960
I think there are things to be concerned about,

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.200
schools that are not working,

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.600
police that are not respecting citizens and so forth,

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.920
but I think that those are things

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.600
that affect white Americans as well

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:12.600
and that the way to ultimately correct those things

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.600
is to make alliance and associate oneself with Americans

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.240
who are concerned to change these things.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.760
And I don't think it's properly framed

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.680
as a racial problem and I certainly don't think

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.680
that violent rebellion gets us anywhere.

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:41.320
I get the historical salience of that posture

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.040
and it made a lot of sense in the early

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.280
and the mid-20th century.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.080
I don't think it makes very much sense at all

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.680
in the early 21st century.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.920
Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.080
to try to channel your Uncle Mooney

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.560
and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.520
as we look forward to the 21st century.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.680
You mentioned that you were a member of the U.S.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.360
You mentioned that in part,

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.000
you're troubled by the term African American.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So words are funny things until they're not.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.840
So let me ask you about what I think

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.880
is one of the most powerful and controversial words

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.560
in the English language, the N-word.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.800
So this is a word that I can't say,

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.880
that only certain people have the right to say.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.920
I have a friend, Joe Rogan, who has,

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.000
what would you say, there was mass pushback

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.200
or highlighting of the fact that he didn't just say N-word

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.000
but said the full word many times

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.520
throughout his conversations when referring to,

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.560
in a meta way, about the power of words,

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.520
especially when related to certain comedians

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.720
using those words.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.320
Yeah.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.360
What do you think about this word?

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.760
Is it empowering?

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.360
Is it destructive?

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.640
What is it?

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.760
What does it mean for race in America?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.560
What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.560
were essentially, there's an attack to cancel him

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.200
for using the word.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.840
Just as a scholar of human nature,

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.200
what do you think about this whole thing?

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:40.600
This is a phenomenon that interests me, okay?

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.880
The N-word, nigger, I can say it because I'm black.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.080
But I mean, I can also say it because I like hip hop.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.600
And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.720
These niggers ain't dead, you know,

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.320
watch out for these, et cetera.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.080
I heard the word constantly as I was growing up,

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.720
as a boy and a young man in Chicago.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.400
Niggas ain't shit.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.840
That was it.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.080
That was, you know, and that could be a reflection

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.680
of some kind of pathology within the African-American

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.200
community of self-hatred and so forth.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.480
It could be, or it could just be a colloquial

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.360
linguistic way.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:23.200
I mean, I assume other groups also have their various,

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.520
I don't know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.760
and you know, whatever.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.680
I don't know how the Jews talk about the Jewish brothers

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.240
and whatever.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.760
But black people, when talking about other black people,

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.160
use the N-word all the time.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.160
My nigger, N-I-G-G-A, you know, my nigger.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.000
That is a term of endearment.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.960
My friend, Randall Kennedy,

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.200
the law professor at Harvard University

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.440
has a book called Nigger.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.240
And he uses the word in the title of the book.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.840
The history of a, strange history of a provocative word

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.040
at some point, there's a subtitle.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.040
But the title of the book is N-I-G-G-E-R, colon,

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.320
and then he has a subtitle.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.680
I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.680
and an insult, which is a part of the history

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.120
of black people in the United States,

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.080
the use of the word by the Southern racist segregationist.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.600
We don't want no niggas up in here.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.360
Y'all, you know, niggas have no place in my restaurant,

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.200
in my store, et cetera.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.400
That's meant to be an insult.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.440
It's an insult to people, it's a fighting word.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.200
It's a way that you say that to somebody.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.200
It's an invitation for conflict.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.040
That said, what is it that about this particular word

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.440
and also the asymmetry of it

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.160
that do you think it's empowering to the black community

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.640
to own a word?

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.320
My honest answer to you is I don't know.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.440
I don't fully understand it.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.160
It has become symbolic in a way.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.600
And the policing of the use of the word,

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.680
I can say it, but white people can't say it.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.320
I can say it, I'm not a racist.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.720
I'm not a self-hating black.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.600
I'm just speaking the language of colloquial English

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.920
that has emerged amongst African-Americans

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.440
in which that word plays a big role.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.360
But the prohibition on its use by others,

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.960
and of course, in the Joe Rogan case,

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.920
it wasn't as if he was calling anybody an n-word.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.400
He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.160
in which the n-word was a part of what they said.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.040
Now, he did make the statement about,

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.800
how did he put it, the planet of the apes,

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.000
that one of the offensive things that he said had,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.120
you know, he walked into a room,

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.520
there was a bunch of black guys standing around,

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.440
he says, like, planet of the apes.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.880
He said this, like, Africa, planet of the apes.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.680
Yeah, he should have, and he did apologize for that.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.400
He should have been a little bit more careful.

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.520
That was an insult.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.520
That was, you know, something that, you know,

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.320
if you say that and people are offended,

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.440
they have a right to be offended.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.680
And if you didn't mean to offend them, you can apologize.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.200
And he did apologize, I accept his apology.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.720
Joe's okay with me, as far as that goes.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.280
In fact, McWhorter and I, John McWhorter and I,

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.200
at the podcast that I do, The Glenn Show,

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.040
I had a conversation, part of which touched

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.560
on the Joe Rogan phenomenon, and we concluded

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.800
he didn't really do anything wrong.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.920
I mean, you can like R.M.O., you can hate him or whatever,

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.200
but the idea that he's a racist, it's kind of ridiculous.

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.920
So frankly, I mean, Joe, you know.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.800
If that's your test of what constitutes a racist,

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.200
the utterance of the word,

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.720
then, you know, it's kind of silly, as far as I'm concerned.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.360
What do you think about the rigorous testing of people

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.080
to the degree they're racist or not?

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:06.080
The accusation of racism being a way to attack,

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:09.960
to bully, to divide.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.360
So what are the pros and cons of that, once again?

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.280
Because it does reveal the assholes and the racists,

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.600
but it can hurt people who are not.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.600
Well, I think we have a history here in the United States

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.840
of blatant racism that goes back a long way

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.120
and that has present day echoes.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.040
So there are racists.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.520
I mean, there are people who will look and see,

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.400
oh, those are black people, they're patronizing

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.800
this business, I don't want to patronize

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.320
this business anymore, who if their daughter

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.760
or their son is dating somebody that is black,

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.120
they will say, I really wish you wouldn't do that.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.800
I mean, why are you hanging out with those people?

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.640
Don't you know who they are?

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.920
There are people, there are racists, okay?

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.080
There are black racists, that is black people

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.760
who see somebody who's white and who then invoke

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.440
a whole lot of stereotypes or whatever,

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.440
or have a visceral dislike based upon nothing

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.240
other than the color of the person's skin.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.200
Such people exist, racism is a real thing, et cetera.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.720
On the other hand, I think this throwing around

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.120
the accusation of racism, a college professor

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.920
is teaching a course.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.240
He says in the context of teaching the course

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.040
that the underrepresentation of blacks

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.280
in physics program at this university

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.760
is because they score lower on the test

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.560
than other groups and they're not qualified.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.960
So say the professor gives a lecture and he says,

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.880
we don't have more blacks in the physics department

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.520
at this university because there are not enough

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.400
qualified blacks.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.360
Somebody in the classroom who hears that,

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.040
a black student, objects, he's a racist, okay?

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.720
That's a power move.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.240
It's a move to try to control the conversation.

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.920
It's not an argument, it's an epithet.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.720
You've said that a person who has a particular idea

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.680
that you don't like, maybe that idea is,

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.440
I'm against affirmative action, I think it's unfair.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.840
I was just with Dorian Abbott.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.840
Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.080
who published a piece in Newsweek Magazine

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.840
in which he said that he thought affirmative action

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:41.240
and racial balancing was unethical.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.840
He was invited to give a lecture at MIT,

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.600
a very distinguished lecture in his field

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.360
based on planetary science.

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.520
I don't know exactly what it is.

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.880
I'm not a scientist, but in any case,

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.960
because he had said that he didn't like affirmative action

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.760
and he thought affirmative action was racist,

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.880
that's basically what he said.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.280
Why are we looking at people based upon their race

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.440
and decide we should just do it on their merit?

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.120
That was his position.

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.320
Now, people protesting at the university

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.080
where he was invited, MIT, saying that he's a racist

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.640
because he had that opinion.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.160
He gets disinvited.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.400
Charles Murray is a popular social science writer

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.040
who is famous for his book about IQ, The Bell Curve,

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.720
one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.480
between black and white in performance

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.800
on mental ability tests and speculates about the extent

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.320
to which such differences may be connected

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.320
with the genetic inheritance

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.080
of these racially distinct populations.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.880
Now, he could be wrong about everything that he's saying.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:59.760
The Southern Poverty Law Center calls him a white supremacist

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.760
because he observes that there are racial differences

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.680
in measured intellectual ability amongst Americans

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.400
of different racial descent.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.760
He could be wrong.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.200
Let me stipulate that he is wrong.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.600
I mean, I don't wanna argue about whether he's right

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.560
or about whether he's wrong.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.680
He's addressing himself to a factual issue

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:27.800
and now the issue becomes instead of grappling

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.960
with the factual questions at hand

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.200
and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.800
about those questions, the issue becomes his character.

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:37.040
He's a racist.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.200
That's in my mind a lot like calling him a witch.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:48.160
The use of that word now, I think,

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:53.160
has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.960
because they have views about substantive questions

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.160
that bear on racial inequality or racial difference

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.160
that a person finds unacceptable

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.480
or that a person disagrees with

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.560
and you think you can shut somebody up.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.920
Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis,

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.000
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
is out of control, some person might say.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.680
Murder rate is high.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.040
Who's committing those crimes?

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.440
They're mostly black young men

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.400
who are doing the carjackings

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:29.520
and who are doing the shootings.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.760
They're killing each other.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.280
They're making our city unlivable.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.960
Now, that's a hypothetical statement that I offer.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.640
It might be correct.

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.640
It might be incorrect.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.200
It might be appropriate.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.400
It might be inappropriate.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.920
It may be true, but something that we would be better off

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.320
if people didn't focus on, I don't know.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.920
Responding to someone making that statement,

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.000
have you seen what has happened to my city?

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.800
It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.760
and you could find one after another

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.000
after another high-end shop.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.400
This is in Chicago, my hometown.

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.000
And tourists would come and they'd go to the theater

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.920
and there were restaurants and they'd go out.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.080
They don't do it anymore.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.040
You know what, half of those stores are boarded up now.

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.200
You know why?

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.400
Because when George Floyd was killed,

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:21.920
black people mobbed in the city and they burnt

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.520
and they rioted and they looted.

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.320
And it hasn't been the same ever since.

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.120
And I'm moving to the suburbs.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.160
I'll be damned if I'm gonna send my children

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.000
to those schools.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.560
A person could say that.

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.400
They might be right.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.560
They might be wrong to say it.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:37.800
Calling them a racist is exactly not a rebuttal

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:39.120
of what they said.

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.040
It's a move.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.640
It's a move to try to take control of the conversation

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.880
by accusing someone of having bad character

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.400
because they said something that made you uncomfortable,

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.760
which you can't deal with.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:52.920
So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.200
You might as well be calling them a witch.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.280
You might as well be calling for their head on a platter

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.280
because they believe that Satan is Lord

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.080
because that's the kind of quote argument,

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.480
close quote, which is precisely not an argument

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.960
that people who invoke that term are using.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.320
And here's what I have to say about that.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:17.320
It's a fool's errand to try to refute somebody

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.720
by calling them a witch.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.320
Likewise, it's a fool's errand to try to rebut

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.400
the contrary forces in American politics

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.520
that are a reaction often to real things

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.680
that are going on on the ground in black communities

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.600
in the cities across this country

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.560
by calling people a racist.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.320
You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds.

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.160
And you know what?

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.880
At the end of the day, they're gonna go to the ballot box

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.200
and they're gonna vote.

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.560
They're gonna pick up their store

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.720
and they're gonna move it to the other side of town

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.840
or to another town altogether.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:52.080
They're gonna keep their children away

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.960
from places where they think the influences

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.080
are harmful to those children.

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.720
They may not even talk about it in public.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:00.240
You can believe that in private

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.600
that they're talking about it with each other.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.480
You had better find a more effective way

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.680
of dealing with the conflicts in this country

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.920
that fall along racial fault lines

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.760
than calling people witches,

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.080
which is what this anti-racist,

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.480
you're a racist because you think

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.360
that the out of wedlock birth rate amongst black Americans

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.760
is seven babies out of 10

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.760
are born to a woman without a husband.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.320
Their families are falling apart.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:26.560
Now, no one says that in public

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:29.160
because they'd be called a racist if they said it in public.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.520
But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.960
You didn't change that in the least

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.040
by telling people to shut up about it.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.800
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist in the 1960s.

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.000
The late New York Senator who was a federal employee

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.680
and an intellectual writing reports.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.600
And he writes a report about the Negro family,

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.080
he called it in those years.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.200
If I use the word Negro,

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.320
now they're gonna call me a racist if I'm a white person.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320
I can't even use the word Negro,

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.680
which is a historically legitimate reference

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.840
to the descendants of the enslaved people,

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:05.560
which we were as black Americans proud to use until yesterday.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.560
So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness.

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.480
It's false black power.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.120
People will seat you the ground.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.360
Okay, you don't want me to use that word?

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.400
I won't use that word anymore.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.240
Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public?

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.560
All right, I won't talk about it in public anymore.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.720
I don't wanna be called a racist?

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.760
Okay, so I won't express my opinion.

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.520
You haven't changed anybody's mind.

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.440
And you've also mentioned that for that,

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.120
you haven't changed anybody's mind,

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.360
but also for things like in universities and institutions,

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.840
there's diversity inclusion and equity kind of meetings

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.840
and education and so on.

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.000
And I believe I've read somewhere I've been,

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.120
like I mentioned to you offline,

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.120
big fan of your Glenn show,

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.200
people should listen to it.

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.040
It's amazing.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.760
There's also just interviews of you that I've listened to.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.840
I believe you mentioned somewhere

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.720
that even those kinds of meetings,

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.960
people might sit through and nod along,

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:09.800
but that doesn't necessarily mean that's making progress,

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.800
that they may actually be bottling up a frustration.

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.720
The fear is that that's going to result

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.720
in a pendulum sort of push back towards this idea

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.360
of forced appreciation,

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.000
like forced anti-racism kind of thing.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.920
I talk about this often in my pockets,

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.240
that's the Glenn show.

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.440
And you can find the Glenn show,

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.880
my YouTube channel and also at Substack.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.640
Yeah, you have a great Substack.

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.840
You and your friend do Q and A's

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.120
and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.520
So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.360
It's brilliant conversation.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.360
But yeah, I mean, one concern is that the policing

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.720
of the superficial policing,

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.520
this is a part of political correctness.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.800
So the insistence that you only use certain words,

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.000
that you only talk in a certain way is a phony kind of power

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.760
because it doesn't actually persuade people

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.840
about the issues that are at hand.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.440
Instead, it forces them underground

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:15.560
in their talk about these issues.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.280
And that's problematic.

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:23.560
Much better that we have overt and explicit

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.520
and honest disagreement to the extent

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.280
that there are disagreement about things that are going on,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
that we have a superficial kind of conversation

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.040
that is perished of any real biting,

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:48.720
discomforting confrontation with the realities

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.920
of the situation at hand.

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.240
And for black Americans, I think one big part

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.120
of the reality of the situation at hand is violent crime.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.880
Violent crime, a police officer is afraid

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.240
when he stops the car

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.240
because it's an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.560
He's got dreadlocks.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.880
He's a black person.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.400
The car doesn't have the right license plate.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.360
He's afraid to deal with that person.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.960
And one of the reasons he's afraid to deal with them

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.360
is because a few who look like him are behaving violently.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.680
Their violence is usually perpetrated against others

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.680
who look like themselves, but not always.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.240
And that reality doesn't get changed by,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.560
telling a newspaper writer who writes about it

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.360
that they are racist or enforcing within a newsroom,

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360
you can't cover that story in that way

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.480
because to do so would be racist.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.800
I think it's a monumental mistake

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:52.080
to enforce a closure on public discussion

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.000
based upon a calculation that if we allow people,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.800
if Twitter allows this kind of post,

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.760
if the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera,

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.760
you end up with a superficial politeness,

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.400
but a subterranean seething resentment

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.600
that only makes matters worse.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.520
If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.560
because it does seem that this kind of attack

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.800
works of being called a racist,

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:38.800
being called maybe not sexist,

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.440
but somebody, like we're going through

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.240
a Johnny Depp trial now, right?

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.280
It's a defamation trial.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:47.720
And the reason it's a defamation trial

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.720
is because all it took is a single accusation

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.320
of Johnny Depp being somebody who sexually

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.760
and physically abused Amber Heard.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.520
And all it took is just a single article.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:04.520
No proof was given except the accusation itself

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.800
and the world believed it.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.640
So it's effective.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:13.200
So how do you fight back if it's so damn effective

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.040
that you can just call anybody racist and it works?

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.320
It's hard to wash off.

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.320
It's, you're not proven in the court of law

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.080
or anything like that, but we get those articles,

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.040
we get that label, and then the world moves on

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.360
and just assumes that person is racist.

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.040
So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.280
No, I don't, frankly.

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.640
Just highlighting the fact.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.760
Listen, Rosanne Barr, who made the statement

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:49.720
about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape-like

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.440
reference to the whatever, and her show got canceled

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.800
and she's a racist.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.920
So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose,

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.360
is one of the most powerful things,

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.960
that this, the hypocrisy of it, the.

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:06.760
You say it works, I guess you're right.

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.000
It used to be that calling someone a communist worked.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.880
I mean, going back to the late 40s, early 50s,

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:18.120
Red Scare, McCarthyism, and whatnot,

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.920
and the person might've belonged to a club

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.840
that was pro-Soviet Union in the 1930s

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.000
when they were in college.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.200
They might've voted for the socialist candidate,

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:32.000
Henry Wallace, in the presidential election of 1948.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
They might belong to the Communist Party.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.320
They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.640
of stuff about capitalism and whatnot,

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.400
and they got called a communist or a Marxist,

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.960
and it could've ruined their career,

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.360
could've ruined their lives.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.640
And a lot of people shut up about it,

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.960
and it went on for a long time.

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.920
And in a way, it kind of still is going on.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.760
I mean, you call somebody a Marxist,

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.560
if you can make that stick,

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.360
they're certainly not gonna get elected president

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.600
of the United States.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.360
But I don't know about this.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.760
I think, you know, I once read this book

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.840
by a German political scientist

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.800
called Elisabeth Neule Neumann.

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.800
That was the writer's name, Elisabeth Neule Neumann.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.560
The book was called The Spiral of Silence.

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:30.080
And the argument was there can be some views,

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.160
some issues in society that get defined

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.360
in such a way that it's inappropriate to hold those views.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.960
And as a result, people who don't wanna be shamed,

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.960
who don't wanna be ostracized, don't express those views.

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.480
And when they don't express them,

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.720
anybody holding the view,

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.840
because they don't hear it said by others,

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.200
think that they're the only one or one of the few

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:55.720
who hold the view, and so they don't wanna be

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.080
the only one out there saying something,

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.240
so they keep it to themselves.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.760
So now, this view, this attitude in society

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:06.560
could be held by a large number of people,

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:11.600
but because of the fear that if they were to express it,

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.000
they'd be ostracized, no one says it.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.760
And since no one is saying it,

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.920
the others who hold the view don't know

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.160
that they're not alone,

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.400
that they are not the only ones who hold the view,

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.680
and hence, they keep silent.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:26.720
That could be an equilibrium.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:29.520
It could be a relatively stable situation

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:32.000
in which the emperor has no clothes,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.920
everybody can see that this dude is naked.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.160
But everybody thinks that, you know,

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:41.040
I don't wanna be the only one to say it.

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.680
And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.240
of keeping the view to ourselves.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.520
Then along comes an event that somebody decides

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.600
to defy the consensus and to speak out.

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.440
It could be a little kid who,

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.240
in the story about the emperor has no clothes,

01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:05.920
doesn't realize that he's not supposed to say

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
that the emperor is naked.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.040
The thing about the kid in the story

01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.360
who says that the emperor is naked

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.840
is not that he's saying it.

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.560
It's not even that other people hear him saying it.

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.240
It's that everybody knows

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.080
that everybody else heard him say it, okay?

01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:27.160
The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:30.160
creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.360
that the emperor has no clothes.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:34.040
Now, common knowledge does not just mean knowledge.

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.520
It does not even mean widespread knowledge.

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.520
It means comprehensive knowledge

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.560
of other person's knowledge of the thing, okay?

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:46.040
So the spiral of silence is a equilibrium

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:48.760
that is susceptible to being undermined

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.840
by a process of a kind of cumulative process,

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.280
a snowballing process of revelation

01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:00.280
that you're not the only one who thinks this way, okay?

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.280
It's fascinating to think that there's an ocean

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:05.640
of common knowledge that we're waiting for the little kid

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:09.040
to wake us up to, different little parts of it.

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.800
That's correct, and the little kid, by the way,

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.640
could be somebody like Donald Trump,

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.280
only more effective than Donald Trump,

01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.320
somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump,

01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:20.200
somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump,

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:25.720
somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:29.160
takes a knee at a football game and says,

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.400
I'm not gonna stand for this president allegiance,

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:36.400
that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.200
Somebody who understands that when a Black Lives Matter

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:45.040
activist stands up with his bald fist and says,

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.440
burn this bitch down about a city

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.720
in the United States of America,

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.560
that a lot of people are upset about that, a lot of them.

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.800
A person, a shrewd politician,

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:59.680
a shrewd manager of a public image

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.920
could build on and create a circumstance

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:06.560
in which more and more people will feel safe

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:10.200
to express that view, and the more who express it,

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.440
the safer those who have yet to express it but who hold it

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.000
will feel in expressing it.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.080
And to the extent that the view is very widespread

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:22.040
but is kept under wraps, an explosion could happen.

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.040
And you can look up at tomorrow

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:26.360
and have a very different country than you had today

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:31.360
because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.840
ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:39.240
away from the consensus, dares to take the slings and arrows

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.800
of exposing themselves as a naysayer

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.880
but taps into a sentiment that's very widespread.

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.560
And I fear that with respect to many racial issues,

02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:53.960
this is the situation that we actually confront,

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:57.240
that it could unravel in a very ugly way.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.160
But it could also unravel in a beautiful way,

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.320
so it's depending.

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.320
There is a spiral of silence, you're saying,

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.880
and it could be, because speaking of children,

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.000
charismatic children, there's a guy named Elon Musk

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.880
who might be a candidate for such an unraveling, right?

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:20.120
You mentioned the person that speaks up

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:23.440
could be Donald Trump, but in this current situation

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.880
that we live in, like as this week,

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.280
Elon has purchased Twitter.

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.480
That's what I hear.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:34.360
And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways,

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.520
the increase of free speech on Twitter.

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.520
And speaking about some of the issues

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.560
that we've been speaking about here with you,

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:48.000
but maybe in broader strokes about just the fact

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.680
that you have to, it's okay to point out

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:54.440
that the emperor wears no clothes and to do so

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.720
from all sides in a way that everybody's

02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.880
a little bit pissed off but not too much.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.640
What do you think about this whole effort of free speech

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:06.040
in these public platforms?

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.320
Elon in particular, Twitter, your avid Twitter user,

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.360
but just public platforms for discourse

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.840
and for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.560
Yeah, well, the people on the left are very upset

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.560
about the possibility that Elon Musk and Twitter

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.560
will be more open to provocative public speech

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.280
that has heretofore been banned or suppressed.

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.480
And I think they might be right to be concerned

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.960
that that could happen.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.280
I don't know enough about the technology

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.720
and about the market to really,

02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:50.440
I mean, social media and whatnot,

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.720
it seems like it's a complicated system

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.400
of interactions between people and who the users are

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.560
and so forth and so on.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:02.520
I do know that that New York Post story

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:06.320
about Hunter Biden's laptop was real news

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.920
and could have affected the outcome of the election

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.560
and it was suppressed.

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:14.400
And that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.760
I do know that the question

02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.160
of where the COVID-19 virus originated

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:23.000
and the role that a lab leak account could have played

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.880
in the public processing of that event was real news

02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:29.840
and that it was suppressed by people

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:32.520
who were trying to control misinformation,

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:36.160
disinformation, Russian disinformation campaigns

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:36.980
and whatnot.

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:40.060
So Twitter has users.

02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.140
I'm one of them and it has a lot of users.

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.820
It's not as big as Facebook, I gather.

02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:46.780
It's not, but it's important.

02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:51.780
The ability to construct counter platforms

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:53.660
or people moving around and whatnot.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.460
It's a kind of network dynamic

02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:58.500
that maybe I should understand it better than I do

02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.260
being a social scientist, but.

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.860
I don't think anyone understands it.

02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:05.460
Even people inside Twitter, which is fascinating.

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.460
It's a monster because of just the bandwidth of messaging

02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.660
and you don't know who is a bot and who is a human.

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:14.340
That's a fascinating dynamic.

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:19.140
And the viral nature of negativity.

02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.820
All of those dynamics, of course,

02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.740
you are probably the right person to understand it

02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:28.140
from a social scientist perspective,

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:30.020
from an economics perspective,

02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.900
but nobody really understands.

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.820
And it's fascinating, within that domain,

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:38.900
how do you allow for free speech,

02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.300
not allow for free speech,

02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:43.380
encourage free speech, defend free speech,

02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:45.300
and at the same time,

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.260
manage millions of ongoing conversations

02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:54.260
from just becoming insanely chaotic.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.660
So from a Twitter perspective,

02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:02.020
they want people to be happy, to grow,

02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:05.420
to actually have difficult, critical conversations.

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.580
And the problem with humans

02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:09.900
is they think they know what that is

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:14.620
and they think they can label things as misinformation,

02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:18.780
as counterproductive for healthy conversations, in quotes.

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.100
And the problem is, as we are learning,

02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:25.300
humans are not able to do that effectively.

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:27.780
First of all, power corrupts.

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.260
There's something delicious

02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:30.940
about having the power

02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:33.220
to label something as misinformation.

02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.820
You do that once for something

02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:37.900
that might be obviously misinformation.

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:39.820
And then you start getting greedy.

02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:40.980
You start getting excited.

02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:41.940
It feels good.

02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:46.020
It feels good to label something as misinformation,

02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.900
disinformation that you just don't like.

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:51.060
And over time, especially if there's a culture

02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:55.140
inside of a company that leans a certain political direction

02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:57.580
or leans, in all the groups that we talked about,

02:05:57.580 --> 02:05:59.340
leans a certain way,

02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:02.140
they'll start to label as misinformation

02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:03.700
things they just don't like.

02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:07.580
And that power is delicious and it corrupts.

02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.020
You have to construct mechanisms,

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:10.620
like the founding fathers did,

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:13.340
for somehow preventing you

02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:15.900
from allowing that power to get too delicious.

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.700
At least that's my perspective on what's going on.

02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.300
Well, I'll just tell you personally,

02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.380
I'm excited about the prospect.

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.900
I'm glad to see Musk making the move that he's making

02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:29.140
and we'll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:33.220
You're looking forward for the, what did he say?

02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:35.180
Let's make Twitter more fun.

02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:38.220
I'm looking forward to the fun.

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:43.220
You've talked about, you are at a prestigious university.

02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:44.260
Brown University.

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:45.420
Brown University.

02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:50.260
And you've mentioned that universities might be in trouble.

02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.620
I think it's with Jordan,

02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:55.020
but everywhere else that barbarians are at the gate.

02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:59.740
Who are the barbarians at the gate of the university?

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:03.540
So first of all, what is to you beautiful

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.540
about the ideal of the university in America of academia

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:12.140
and what is a threat?

02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:17.140
Well, a university is dedicated to the pursuit of truth

02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:23.420
and to the education and nurturing of young people

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:26.580
as they enter into the pursuit of truth,

02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:28.820
to doing research and to teaching

02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:34.700
in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.

02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:40.860
So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence

02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:43.540
and your imagination may lead you.

02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:46.500
And civil discourse means that you exchange arguments

02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.140
with people when you don't agree with them

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:50.740
on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.

02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:56.580
I think the university is a magnificent institution.

02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:00.460
It is a relatively modern institution.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.780
I mean, last 500 years or so,

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:04.700
I mean, there are universities that are older than that,

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:08.580
but the great research universities of the world,

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.940
not only here in the United States,

02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:15.620
are places where human ingenuity is nurtured,

02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:17.820
where new knowledge is created

02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:22.980
and where young people are equipped to answer questions

02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:26.300
that are open questions about our existence

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.980
in the world that we live in.

02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.980
You can trace to the university much,

02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:34.940
if not most of the advances in technology

02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.740
and resourcefulness and our understanding

02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:38.540
of the origins of the species,

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.540
of the nature of the universe, cosmology, et cetera,

02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:45.620
the science of the pursuit of humanistic understanding,

02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:48.660
the nurturing of traditions of inquisitiveness,

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.460
that's the university.

02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:51.820
Barbarians are at the gates.

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:56.140
The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry

02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:59.180
at the university on behalf of their particular view

02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:04.180
about things are a threat to what the university stands for

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.420
and they should be resisted.

02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:11.420
So if I'm inquiring about the nature of human intelligence

02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:14.860
and I wanna study differences

02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:18.140
between human populations and their acquisition of

02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:22.060
or their expression of cognitive ability,

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.620
that's fair game, it's an open question.

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:27.300
If I wanna know something about the nature

02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:31.300
of gender affiliation and identity

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:34.620
and gender dysphoria and whatnot,

02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.500
that's fair game to study in a university.

02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:40.020
You can't shut that down, you shouldn't be able to,

02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:44.060
by saying, I have a particular position here,

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:45.820
I'm a member of a particular identity group,

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.900
suppose I wanna study the history of colonialism.

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:53.500
And there's a narrative on the progressive side,

02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.540
which is colonialism is about Europeans dominating

02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:57.940
and stealing or whatever, whatever.

02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.500
And I happen to think, well, there's another aspect

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.060
to the story about colonialism too,

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:05.100
which is that it's a mechanism for the diffusion

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.700
of the best in human civilization to populations

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:10.420
that were significantly lagging behind

02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:11.260
with respect to that.

02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:15.380
We brought literacy to the southern hemispheric populations

02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:19.100
that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing.

02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:22.260
It's complicated, I'm not taking that position by the way,

02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.780
I'm just saying somebody at a university

02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:28.580
should be able to take it up and pursue it

02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:30.340
and engage in argument with people about it.

02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:31.900
I'm talking about race and ethnicity,

02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:34.660
but this extends to a wide range of things.

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.700
Suppose we're talking about climate

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:38.780
and one person says the earth is endangered

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:42.580
because carbon in global warming, et cetera, et cetera.

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.780
And another person says, no wait, no wait,

02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:48.180
look at where we stand in the 21st century.

02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:51.420
We're vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago.

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.260
We have much more knowledge about that

02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:54.100
and so forth and so on.

02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:59.100
250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:02.820
in ways that we can not even begin to anticipate

02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:07.780
all manner of technological means

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:09.060
for managing the problem.

02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:11.420
There's no reason that we should shut down

02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:14.340
industrial civilization today

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:16.940
because we fear the consequences of it

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:20.500
when in fact we are vastly richer than our ancestors

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.340
and those who come up two centuries after us

02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.860
will be vastly more effective at dealing with problems

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:28.620
than we are now, et cetera.

02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:30.820
I'm not actually making that argument,

02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:34.660
I'm just saying the tendency to try to say,

02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:36.940
oh no, that person is a climate denier,

02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:40.260
they can't pursue that area of inquiry

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:44.420
is against the spirit of the university.

02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:48.380
I think the barbarians at the gates has to do with

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.460
the people who think they know

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:52.100
what the right side of history is

02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:53.700
and try to make the university

02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:55.580
stand on the right side of history.

02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:58.660
My position is you don't know

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:01.180
what the right side of history is

02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:03.740
and the purpose of a university is to equip you

02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:05.060
to be able to think about

02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:07.740
what is the right side of history,

02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:11.900
what is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us

02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:14.500
as human beings living on this planet

02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:16.260
with the billions that we are,

02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:17.740
in the condition that we are.

02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:22.460
So the identitarians,

02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:25.820
the ones who wanna make the university kowtow

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:28.980
to their particular understandings

02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:30.420
about their own identity.

02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:36.060
We now have at Brown University and various other places,

02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:38.260
we don't do Columbus Day anymore,

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:40.540
we do Indigenous Peoples Day.

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:42.860
When that day comes up in October,

02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:44.260
we don't talk about Columbus,

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:45.900
they're taking down statues of Columbus

02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:48.580
all across the country and so forth and so on.

02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:50.860
I'm not arguing anything here other than

02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:56.100
that the latter day position

02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:00.660
of BIPOCs,

02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:03.460
Black, Indigenous and other people of color,

02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.500
the latter day position that the university has to reflect

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:11.900
a particular sensibility about these identity questions.

02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:14.780
I think it's a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.

02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:16.460
I don't think you're overstating it.

02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:21.460
I tend to be just for my limited knowledge of MIT

02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:25.260
but perhaps it applies broadly.

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:28.140
I think the beauty of the university,

02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:32.020
broadly speaking, is the faculty and the students.

02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:38.540
And the problem arises from the overreach

02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:43.980
of a overgrowing administration

02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:48.220
that gives, again,

02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:54.420
thinks that it knows enough to make rules and conclusions

02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.340
based on a set of beliefs.

02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.780
And then based on that empowers

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:01.740
a certain small selection of students

02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.860
to be the sort of voices of activism,

02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:07.100
of a particular idea.

02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.100
And not, I think activism is beautiful,

02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:11.300
but not just activism,

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:13.740
but anybody that disagrees is shut down.

02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:19.740
And that, I think, the blame lies with the administration.

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:23.220
So I think the solution is in lessening,

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:25.700
just like the solution with too big of a government,

02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:27.260
too big of a bureaucracy,

02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:32.100
is there needs to be a redistribution of power

02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:34.700
to what makes universities beautiful,

02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:38.860
which is the old students and the young students,

02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:42.260
old students being professors.

02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:45.940
So the scholars, the curious minds,

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.180
the people that are in this whole thing

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.220
to explore the world, to be curious about it

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.380
on a salary that's probably way too low

02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:55.060
for the thing they're doing.

02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:57.140
That's the whole point.

02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:01.140
And then the administration just gets in the way

02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:05.820
and is the source of this kind of,

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.020
I would say that, in your beautiful phrasing,

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:10.500
I would say the administration

02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.220
is the barbarians at the gate.

02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:15.460
So the solution is smaller bureaucracy,

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:16.900
smaller administrations.

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:18.940
I have to, on this point, you had this conversation,

02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:23.180
you put on your self-stack with Jordan Peterson

02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:25.380
about cognitive inequality.

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:28.340
I think it's titled Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality.

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:33.340
This particular topic of just IQ differences

02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:36.180
between groups, why is this,

02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:39.220
why is it so dangerous to talk about?

02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:42.900
Why this particular topic?

02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.060
Well, it's like you're calling black people inferior.

02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.900
It's like you're saying they're genetically inferior.

02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:48.540
That's what people are saying.

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.820
It's like you're rationalizing the disparity of outcomes

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:55.940
by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.

02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.940
If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes,

02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:03.660
if you say cognitive ability exists,

02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.700
people really are different

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:07.220
in terms of their intellectual functioning.

02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:09.940
And if you say cognitive ability differences

02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:14.940
are substantial between racially defined populations,

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.220
the sum of that, there is cognitive ability,

02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:19.300
it matters in the difference by race,

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:22.740
is the conclusion that outcome differences by race

02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:26.260
are in part due to natural differences

02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:28.020
between the populations.

02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:30.860
People find that to be completely offensive

02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:32.220
and unacceptable.

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:34.100
So that's what I think is going on.

02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:38.940
Can you still man that case that we should be careful

02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:40.620
doing that kind of research?

02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:46.540
So this has to do with research.

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:51.540
It's like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:58.500
White supremacists could use conclusions,

02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:04.900
cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.

02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:07.100
Can you still man the case that we should be careful?

02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:08.580
Yeah, I could do it at three levels.

02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:11.540
One is what do we mean by cognitive ability?

02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:13.700
So there's many different kinds of intelligence

02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:15.380
a person might say.

02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:19.060
How good are IQ tests at measuring other kinds

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.060
of human capacities that are pertinent to success in life,

02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:27.700
like temperament, like emotional intelligence and so on.

02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:31.020
So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing

02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:32.700
measured by G.

02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:36.060
The cognitive psychologists talk about G,

02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.500
the general intelligence factor,

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:41.460
which is a statistical construction.

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:44.620
It's a factor analytic resolution

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:48.340
of the correlation across individuals

02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:49.780
in their performance on a battery,

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.780
a different kind of test.

02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:54.260
And they use that to define

02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:56.300
a general factor of intelligence.

02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:59.940
And a person could say that is a very narrow view

02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.820
of what human mental capacities actually are.

02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:07.940
And that it's much better to think about

02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:12.580
multi-dimensional measures of human mental functioning

02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:15.420
rather than a single cognitive ability measure,

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:20.420
so-called IQ, which is a narrow construction

02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:26.220
that doesn't capture all of the subtle nuance

02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:28.380
of human difference in functioning.

02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:33.380
Functioning is not just the ability to recite backwards

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:34.860
a sequence of numbers.

02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:37.100
I say eight, seven, nine, five, three, two.

02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:40.100
You say two, three, five, seven, eight, nine.

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:41.060
It's not just that.

02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:46.060
Intelligence is a complex management

02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:49.620
of many different dimensions of human performance,

02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:54.620
including things like being able to stick with a task

02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:58.820
and not give up, things like being able to discipline

02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:02.060
and control your impulses so as to remain focused

02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:03.540
and so forth.

02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:04.620
That could be one dimension.

02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:07.580
I could start by questioning the very foundation

02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:10.620
of the argument for racial differences

02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:14.620
in cognitive ability by saying that your measure

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:18.340
of cognitive ability is flawed.

02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:19.860
I could go to a higher level.

02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.860
I could say what we're really interested in

02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:28.860
is social outcomes and the question of what factors

02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:32.580
influence social outcomes extends well beyond mental ability

02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.980
to many other things.

02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:35.440
So here's an example.

02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:41.980
Visual acuity, how well do you see?

02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:43.260
You're not wearing glasses.

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:44.100
I am.

02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:48.940
Visual acuity varies between human beings.

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:52.180
Some people see better than other people do.

02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:54.660
Visual acuity can be measured.

02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:57.820
I can put you at the chart and can you identify

02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:00.260
and read that bottom line in small print or not?

02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.060
So we can measure visual acuity

02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.020
and it varies between human beings.

02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:07.540
Visual acuity is partly genetic.

02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:09.900
I think that's undoubtedly true.

02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:12.260
We inherit genes that influence whether or not

02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:15.940
we are nearsighted or farsighted or astigmatic or whatever.

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:19.660
So visual acuity differs between people

02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:23.740
and can be measured and is under genetic control.

02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:28.100
On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:29.780
to level the playing field between people

02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:34.140
who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.

02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:37.180
Likewise, social outcomes are what we're really interested

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:41.620
in, employment, earnings, whether or not they're law-abiding,

02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:43.580
how do they conduct themselves and their families

02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:45.700
and so forth amongst individuals.

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:47.940
Yes, social outcomes are influenced

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:49.620
by so-called cognitive ability,

02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:52.340
but they're influenced by many other things as well.

02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:55.540
If there are interventions that can be undertaken

02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:58.220
in society that level the playing field

02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:00.500
between people who have different natural endowments

02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:03.940
of cognitive ability, the fact that people or groups

02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:07.580
differ in cognitive ability becomes less significant,

02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:10.180
just like it's less significant that people differ

02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:13.460
with respect to how well they see when corrective lenses

02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:16.980
allow for the leveling of that playing field.

02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:19.180
There are in fact, interventions,

02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:22.820
educational interventions, early childhood interventions

02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:25.300
that have been shown to level the playing field

02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.260
to create better life outcomes for people

02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:31.020
even if they happen to be endowed with low intelligence.

02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:35.380
So a second level of arguing against this whole program

02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:38.260
of research on human differences in intelligence

02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:40.380
is to observe that yes, human beings

02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:43.380
and perhaps racially defined groups may differ

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:46.620
on the average in intellectual endowment,

02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:49.180
but there well may be social interventions

02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:52.020
that level the playing field, whether it's in education

02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:55.220
or in other kinds of programmatic interventions,

02:21:55.220 --> 02:21:57.340
especially for the poor.

02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:59.940
A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to,

02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:02.140
which is that if you talk like this,

02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:04.300
you're gonna encourage a kind of politics

02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:09.300
which is very ugly and it's best to frame the discussion

02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:14.500
in ways that don't put emphasis on racially defined

02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:17.620
natural differences between populations.

02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:21.420
That's an argument that I am myself personally

02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:24.460
conflicted about.

02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:27.300
On the one hand, I think, you know,

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.420
those people are just stupid.

02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:32.980
It is racist, okay?

02:22:32.980 --> 02:22:36.540
On the other hand, I think the calculation,

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:38.220
we shouldn't do this kind of research.

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:40.700
Suppose I'm at the National Science Foundation.

02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:42.380
Research team submits a proposal.

02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:44.780
The proposal proposes to undertake a study.

02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:48.580
The study would explore the extent to which people

02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:50.540
and racial groups differ with respect

02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.540
to their intellectual performance

02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:55.060
and how that's influenced by their genetic

02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:56.900
and environmental interaction.

02:22:56.900 --> 02:22:59.140
And I decide not to fund the study

02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:01.860
based on a political calculation

02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:04.620
that the subject is too sensitive.

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:06.620
And if you explore that subject,

02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.300
you might get the wrong answer.

02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:09.940
And if you get the wrong answer,

02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:12.500
the white supremacist will be encouraged.

02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:17.500
Well, that is presuming before the research is done

02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:19.820
that I know the outcome of the research

02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:23.100
and that I can calculate what the political consequence

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.300
of the research outcome is gonna be.

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:27.700
That's assuming the thing before you even know

02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.980
what the thing actually is.

02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.420
It's a kind of omniscience.

02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:35.420
It presumes that you, as the master of the universe,

02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:37.220
can tell people what it is

02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:39.420
that people are being treated like children,

02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:41.580
what it is that they're capable of knowing

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:44.100
and what it is that they're not capable of knowing.

02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:47.500
It would be like someone saying to Einstein,

02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:49.780
I don't know about that special relativity theory.

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:53.140
It could well lead to the development of technologies

02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:54.420
that would allow nuclear weapons.

02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.780
Or someone saying to Oppenheimer,

02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.860
who is a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project

02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:02.180
where the US developed nuclear weapons capacity,

02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.180
don't carry out that project

02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:08.300
because the results of acquiring that knowledge

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:10.420
may be more than we can deal with.

02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:13.700
Or someone saying to someone doing biomedical research

02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:17.660
who's interested in exploring the nature

02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:20.940
of the human genome, don't carry out that experiment,

02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:22.780
that cloning undertaking, whatever,

02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:26.060
because the consequences could be deleterious.

02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:27.860
Well, the consequences could be deleterious.

02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:30.220
The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.

02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:32.540
The consequences could also be being able

02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:33.740
to generate electric power

02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:36.740
without producing carbon effluent.

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:40.660
So who are you to tell me, you being the person

02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:44.180
in the political position to control the research,

02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.140
what the consequence of doing the research is?

02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:50.820
I think I don't want to cede that kind of power

02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:55.820
to politicians over the course of human inquiry.

02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:59.740
So yes, I would want there to be regulations

02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:03.900
governing the use of biologically sensitive

02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:06.620
and potentially dangerous pathogens

02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:09.780
in a lab in Wuhan or any place else.

02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:13.260
I would not want to simply leave that to laissez faire.

02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:16.700
On the other hand, I think that the tendency

02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:20.460
to try to shut down inquiry on behalf

02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:24.300
of supposed adverse political consequences

02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:27.700
is the road to ignorance and impoverishment

02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:29.540
at the end of the day for humankind,

02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:31.660
denying ourselves the potential benefits

02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.140
of that kind of inquiry.

02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:35.700
I think we need to take our chances with inquiry

02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:37.100
rather than to try to control it.

02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:39.460
And I feel that way about the exploration

02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:42.860
of human intelligence as much as anything else.

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:46.660
So you've asked me to steel man the case against research

02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:49.340
on IQ of the sort that Charles Murray is famous

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:51.220
for popularizing.

02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:54.860
And I've said, A, your measure of intelligence

02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:58.420
is single dimensional and it ought to be multi-dimensional.

02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:02.100
I've said B, the consequences of people's differing

02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:05.420
in intelligence depends not only on the natural endowments

02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:08.820
of the people, but also on the environment

02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.340
and the potential for intervening in that environment

02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.380
through one or another kind of instrument

02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:18.420
as the metaphorical example of the use of corrective lenses

02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:20.700
to level the playing field between people

02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:25.100
with different visual acuity indicates.

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:29.620
But finally, I've said, yes, research on racial differences

02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:33.860
in IQ can foster political beliefs

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:38.380
that we would regard to be obnoxious.

02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:41.700
On the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet

02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:44.940
and might find out from the research is gonna be harmful

02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:48.300
is to assume a kind of presumption

02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:52.860
or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be,

02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:55.780
which we ought to be very slow to embrace

02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:57.860
because if we had done so in the past,

02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:00.020
we wouldn't have nuclear power.

02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:01.220
There's a lot of things that we wouldn't know.

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:03.380
I mean, what were people saying about Darwin

02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:07.980
and exploration of the evolution and origin of the species?

02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:10.380
They were afraid that it was gonna, in effect,

02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:14.580
disprove the religious-based accounts of,

02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:16.340
what were they saying about Copernicus,

02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:17.820
and et cetera, et cetera.

02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.780
So, you know.

02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:24.780
That was a masterful layering of, quote,

02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:26.860
wrestling with cognitive inequality.

02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.620
He dragged in nuclear research,

02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:32.780
Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics,

02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:37.140
even COVID and the lab leak.

02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:39.900
I mean, that was just fun to listen to.

02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:40.740
Okay.

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.580
Okay.

02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:44.900
Uh, let me ask you about your politics.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:48.460
So, you've recently said that you're a conservative leaning.

02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:51.100
I mean, maybe that's a day-to-day thing.

02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:52.140
Maybe you can push back,

02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:55.900
but so you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter,

02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:56.860
Yeah.

02:27:56.860 --> 02:28:00.420
who we could say is on your left.

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.260
Yeah.

02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:02.080
To the left of you.

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.700
And then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell,

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:09.460
who maybe is on to the right of you.

02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:14.060
And yet there's a lot of overlap between the three of you.

02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:17.580
So, to what degree does politics affect

02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:21.020
your view on race in America?

02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:25.340
And maybe to what degree does your view on race

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.700
affect your politics?

02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:29.380
Okay.

02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:31.500
And that, for people who don't know,

02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:33.820
has shifted over time.

02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:36.260
You've been on quite a roller coaster,

02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:38.760
as anybody who thinks about the world should be.

02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:44.740
Well, let's begin with the fact that I was trained

02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:48.100
as an economist in a tradition

02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:52.780
of what many people would call neoliberalism.

02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:55.100
I was trained at MIT,

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:58.880
which was not a right-wing place by any means,

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:04.740
but it was a place where you learned about markets

02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:08.980
and about the benefits of capitalism

02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:13.180
as a way of organizing society.

02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:16.220
The virtues of free enterprise.

02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:18.020
The fact that the pursuit of profit

02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:19.700
was not necessarily a bad thing,

02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.780
but it well might be the road to prosperity

02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:24.380
and to economic growth.

02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:26.060
The idea that private property

02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:28.440
and individuals seeking to acquire

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:33.300
and succeeding in acquiring wealth did create inequality,

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:35.060
but it also created opportunity,

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:38.100
and it also expanded our knowledge and our control

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:40.060
over the physical environment

02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:42.000
which we're embedded in, et cetera.

02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:47.140
So we were not Marxists at MIT,

02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:48.220
although we did read Marx.

02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:50.140
I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious,

02:29:50.140 --> 02:29:50.980
you read Marx.

02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:53.940
Marx was an important figure in the history of the West,

02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:55.580
and I think Marx should be read

02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:58.780
in capital three volumes, et cetera.

02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:01.740
Alienation of labor and whatnot.

02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:04.380
The implications of modernization

02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:08.980
of the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera.

02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:12.540
That kind of dynamic deserves to be studied

02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:15.020
and to come at it in a critical way

02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:21.420
informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.880
I think that's a part of a full education

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:28.380
in social philosophy and economic analysis

02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:32.380
that open-minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.220
But at the end of the day,

02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:38.220
I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.

02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:43.220
I think the story of the 20th century

02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:47.900
as far as economic development is concerned reflects that.

02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:49.300
I think that the experiments

02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:54.300
where centralized control over economic decisions

02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:57.700
was the order of the day failed.

02:30:57.700 --> 02:31:01.220
I think that the fact of the 21st century rise

02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:04.180
of China as a force has a lot to do

02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:06.740
with the spread of, in effect,

02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:11.460
capitalist-oriented modes of entering economic exchange,

02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:15.500
freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth.

02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:16.460
Although, obviously,

02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:19.260
it's a complicated political economic system.

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:21.340
We're talking about China.

02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:26.040
But I think that the story of the 20th century

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.240
and the hope for the 21st century

02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:31.640
is that prosperity is enhanced

02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:35.760
through the free exchange of goods

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:40.120
and the pursuit and acquisition of property

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:45.120
by people in a more or less capitalist-oriented system.

02:31:48.200 --> 02:31:49.840
That's the view that I hold.

02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.360
I guess that makes me a conservative.

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:52.320
I don't know.

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:56.560
I wanna say that's not to the exclusion

02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:58.400
of a social safety net.

02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:02.820
I'm not saying that old people in an ideal social system

02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:04.460
would be left to their own devices

02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:05.440
regardless of whether or not

02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:07.360
they had saved for their retirement.

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:11.080
I'm not saying that the ideal

02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:15.280
of extending decent access to healthcare to all people

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:18.000
regardless of whether or not they can afford it,

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.820
decent access to education to people

02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:22.940
regardless of whether or not they can afford it

02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:25.700
is standing in the way of prosperity.

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:26.980
I don't believe that.

02:32:26.980 --> 02:32:29.580
I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe

02:32:29.580 --> 02:32:34.580
and in North America are a balancing

02:32:35.020 --> 02:32:37.900
of the virtues of free enterprise property

02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:40.500
and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand

02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:44.220
against the needs to have a decent society

02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:47.680
in which people who fall between the cracks nevertheless

02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:51.600
are bolstered through a sense of social solidarity

02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:54.560
that is accommodated by our common membership

02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:56.880
within a single nation state,

02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:59.280
which is why I think nationalism is important.

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:02.160
And it's why I think borders are important

02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:06.480
because without a coherent polity

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:11.480
who can see themselves as in a common situation

02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:15.120
and agree through their politics

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.520
to support each other to some extent,

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:18.960
you can't sustain a safety net.

02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:23.080
You cannot have a social safety net for a global population.

02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:24.680
You can only have a social safety net

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:28.200
for a bounded population who have a sense

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:33.040
of common membership in an ongoing political enterprise

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:35.680
which they pay their dues through their taxes

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:36.920
in order to sustain it.

02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:38.920
There's a balancing that has to go on.

02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:42.180
So that's the first thing that I would say about my politics.

02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:44.000
I'm a neoliberal economist.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.120
I believe in markets.

02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:46.200
I believe in prices.

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:47.800
I believe in profit.

02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:51.040
Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.

02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:53.480
Corporations are a legal nexus

02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:56.600
through which production gets organized

02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:00.500
in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,

02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:02.360
of people who provide capital,

02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:04.080
of people who provide raw materials

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.760
and input of customers and so on.

02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:11.760
And that functionality allows for the production of goods

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:16.520
and their distribution and the earning of income

02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:20.440
and its distribution, which at the end of the day

02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:22.120
is the foundation of our prosperity.

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:23.400
Corporations are people too.

02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:26.600
Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.

02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:28.680
But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:32.080
The corporation is not a person as such,

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:35.040
but the nexus of contracts and relationships

02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.000
amongst the stakeholders who intersect

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.260
in the context of the corporation

02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:43.180
is the way in which we organize

02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:46.340
the massively complex set of activities

02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:50.940
that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits,

02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:52.020
in order to feed people,

02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:54.340
in order to have everybody with a cell phone

02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.660
in their pocket, in order to be able to travel

02:34:56.660 --> 02:34:58.380
from one side of a continent to another

02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:01.660
on a device that is with almost absolute certainty

02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:03.980
gonna safely take off and land,

02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:07.480
in order to be able to build cities and et cetera.

02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.600
But do the markets, the ideal of the market

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.960
collide with the ideal of all men are created equal?

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:17.760
The identity, the struggle that we've been talking about

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.360
of what it means to sort of empower humans

02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:23.320
that make up this great country.

02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:26.320
Do they collide and where do they collide?

02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:29.360
Well, markets are gonna produce inequality

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:32.280
and all men being equal is a statement

02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:34.460
about the intrinsic worth of people,

02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:37.000
not about the situation that will come about

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.360
when people interact with each other through markets

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.880
because people are actually different.

02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:43.140
And because there are factors

02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:44.640
that are beyond anybody's control

02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:49.280
called luck and chance that you and I both invest.

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.560
It looked a priori like your investment and my investment

02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:53.680
were equally likely to succeed.

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:55.680
But as a matter of fact, ex post facto,

02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:58.880
your investment succeeds, my investment doesn't succeed.

02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:01.040
I don't have wealth and you have wealth.

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.320
That is an inevitable consequence of a environment

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.680
in which both of us are free to make our investment choices

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.840
and where the consequences of investment

02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:12.640
depend in part upon random circumstances

02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:14.800
of which no one has control.

02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:16.400
But you asked me about my politics

02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:19.420
and I was just trying to lay down a foundation by saying,

02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:24.420
I begin as an economist in the tradition of liberalism,

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:28.480
Adam Smith and so forth, John Maynard Keynes for that matter

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:33.480
and so forth, that Milton Fridman and so forth

02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:39.400
that Paul Samuelson, Bob Solow, James Tobin and so forth,

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.280
Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.280
the virtues of free enterprise,

02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.320
the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,

02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.120
a rule of law, things of this kind.

02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.120
So that's one thing to say about my politics.

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:03.600
Another thing to say about my politics,

02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:06.160
and you're right, I've moved around,

02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:10.000
is that I began South Side of Chicago, black kid,

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.580
I was a liberal Democrat.

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.840
I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT

02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:19.860
and I became trained in economics

02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:21.960
in the tradition that I've just described.

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:27.520
And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.

02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:30.520
This is the late 70s and early 80s.

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.560
These are big debates about economic policy

02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.960
and so on, and I found a lot to admire

02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.360
in the supply-siders, the people who were saying,

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:45.240
let's get the government out of the way,

02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:47.440
the people who were worried about national debt,

02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:49.520
which is a lot more now than it was then,

02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:52.040
the people who were worried that the welfare state

02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.360
could be too big, that the incentives of transfer programs

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:58.400
could be counterproductive, that you had a war on poverty

02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:00.880
and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.

02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:04.440
And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty

02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:07.280
was lost by the people who were trying to, quote unquote,

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:09.040
eradicate poverty in our time.

02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:15.520
That incentives really do matter and that the state,

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:19.120
which is driven by politics, is often unresponsive

02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:20.680
to the dictates of incentives,

02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:24.360
whereas markets eliminate people who are inefficient

02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.200
and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives

02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.400
because they can't cover their bottom line

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.320
and they won't persist for very long

02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:32.600
if they can't cover their bottom line.

02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:35.760
They're forced to respond to the realities of differences

02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:37.440
in costs and benefits and so forth

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:39.520
in a way that governments can cover

02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:41.960
because they have their hand in our pocket.

02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:45.640
They can cover their losses and they can make accounts

02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:47.320
balanced, not withstanding their mistakes,

02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.000
because they can take my property by fiat,

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.160
by the power of the state.

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:53.880
The tax collector comes, if I don't pay,

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:58.880
he seizes my holdings, and they can carry on in that way.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.800
They need the corrective influence of markets

02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:05.560
in order to be responsive to the realities of life.

02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:10.560
I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.880
that something that I wanna do is infeasible.

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:15.720
I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me

02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:20.280
is that the costs of doing it exceed the benefits

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.040
to be derived from doing it.

02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:24.200
And if I persist in doing it, not withstanding that,

02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:26.920
I'm gonna run losses and those losses will accumulate

02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.840
and the net effect of that over an entire society

02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.520
is stagnation and ultimate attenuation

02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:36.840
of the economic benefits that might be available

02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:37.680
with people.

02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:40.600
Again, I think if you look at the developing world

02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:42.040
in the post-colonial period,

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.960
the second half of the 20th century,

02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:46.000
that's exactly what you see.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.200
Planning doesn't work, centralized control

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:50.680
over resource allocation doesn't work.

02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.840
Okay, so I became more conservative in that respect,

02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.240
but I also, and this has to do with race,

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:04.360
lost faith in the posture

02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:08.760
that what became of the civil rights movement.

02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:11.680
I mean, the civil rights movement, you quote King 1963,

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:13.720
the civil rights movement starts out as

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:17.880
we want equal membership in the polity,

02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:22.680
but it becomes a,

02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:29.920
systematized a cover, I'm going to argue,

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:35.360
for deficiencies that are discernible

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.720
within black American society,

02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:39.000
which only we could correct.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.800
That's a very controversial statement.

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:43.560
I make it with trepidation.

02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:47.360
I don't take any pleasure in saying it,

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.120
but here's what I'm talking about.

02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.360
So I'm talking about the family.

02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.320
So the family is a matter internal to the community

02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:03.320
about how men and women relate to each other

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.560
and engage in social reproduction, childbearing,

02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:09.800
the standing up of households,

02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:12.360
the context within which children are develop,

02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:14.680
are maturing and so forth and so on.

02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:17.760
So the African-American family is in trouble.

02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:20.960
I think I can demonstrate that by reference

02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.360
to high rates of marital dissolution,

02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:29.040
by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth.

02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:32.040
You can't even say that.

02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.760
The African-American family is in trouble.

02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:38.600
Violence, homicide is the order of magnitude

02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:40.480
more prevalent amongst African-Americans

02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:43.040
than it is in the society as a whole.

02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.520
This is behavior, it's behavior of our people.

02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:47.640
I speak of black people.

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:49.800
Of course, we're not the only people in society

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:51.640
for whom violence is an issue.

02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:54.440
It's an order of magnitude more prevalent

02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.840
in our communities.

02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.200
I'm talking about schooling and school failure.

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:02.840
So we have affirmative action as a cover.

02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:06.080
It's a bandaid on differences in the development

02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:08.000
of intellectual performance,

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.280
which is only partly a consequence

02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:12.840
of the natural intelligence of people

02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.760
and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.160
what they value, how they discipline themselves,

02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:23.760
what they do with their opportunities,

02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.920
how parents raise their children,

02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:28.560
what peer groups value and things of this kind.

02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:30.960
The Asian students who are scoring off the charts

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:33.240
on these exams are doing it,

02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:35.440
not because they're intrinsically more intelligent

02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:38.280
to other people, but because they work harder,

02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:39.880
because their parents are more insistent

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.240
on focusing on their intellectual performance,

02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:45.120
because they're disciplined,

02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:46.920
because of the way that they devote their time

02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:50.440
and their resources to equipping their children

02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.600
to function in the 21st century.

02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:53.480
This is what I believe.

02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:55.520
I think it's demonstrably the case.

02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:00.160
And it is a factor in racial disparity.

02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:03.040
The way that the civil rights movement has evolved

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:05.960
under the wing of the democratic party

02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:08.560
into an organized apologia

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:12.680
for the failures of African-Americans

02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:16.080
to seize the opportunities that exist for us now

02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:19.360
in the 21st century, but did not exist

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:21.160
in the first half of the 20th century.

02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:22.760
The way in which the civil rights movement

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:27.360
has become an avoidance mechanism

02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:30.000
for us not taking we African-Americans responsible.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.280
This is Glenn Lowry, not everybody's gonna agree with it,

02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:36.800
is part of what makes me a conservative.

02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:38.960
I am tired of the bellyaching.

02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:41.560
I'm tired of the, excuse me, white supremacy.

02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:44.960
It is, in my mind, a joke.

02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:49.280
I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric

02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:53.920
is so seductively attractive to African-Americans

02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.520
and so widely adopted by others.

02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:02.840
And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day,

02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:04.800
nobody is coming to save us.

02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:09.360
I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford,

02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:12.240
where the future is happening,

02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.920
that is about mastery over the achievements

02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:21.480
of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves

02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:22.320
in the 21st century.

02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:26.320
There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:27.360
over the material.

02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:30.240
There's no substitute for that.

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:34.840
To be patronized, to have the standards lowered,

02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:37.080
they wanna get rid of the test.

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:40.200
They wanna tell African-Americans to pat us on the head.

02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.000
We're gonna have a separate program for you.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.800
We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.

02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:48.080
That doesn't make us any smarter.

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.920
It doesn't make us any more creative.

02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:54.800
And it doesn't make us any more fit

02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:58.360
for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:01.440
Now, you wanna be 10% of the population

02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.960
that's carried along for the next 100 years.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:09.000
You wanna be a ward of the state in the late 21st century?

02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:12.200
You go ahead, because the Chinese are coming.

02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:13.760
You're not gonna hold them back.

02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:16.400
The world is being remade every decade

02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:19.680
by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.800
If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement

02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:26.240
of the civilization in which we are embedded,

02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:29.480
you're gonna end up being dependent on other people

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:31.400
to look kindly upon you.

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.040
In this story that you've got, this belly ache,

02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:39.400
this excuse, ancestors were slaves,

02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:45.160
is only gonna work for so long.

02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:49.200
So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:51.480
I hate affirmative action.

02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:52.640
I don't just disagree with it.

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:55.520
I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.

02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:57.080
I hate it.

02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:59.040
The hatred comes from an understanding

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:01.520
that it is a band-aid, that it is a substitute

02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:03.880
for the actual development of the capacities

02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:05.680
of our people to compete.

02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:08.440
I'd much rather be in the position

02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.840
of having them try to keep me out

02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:13.360
because I'm so damn good, like they're doing

02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:17.160
with the Asians, than having them have to beg

02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.600
the Supreme Court to allow for a special dispensation

02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:23.640
on my behalf because they need diversity

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.760
and inclusion and belonging.

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.160
It's not just diversity.

02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:28.640
It's not just diversity and inclusion.

02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:31.640
It's diversity and inclusion and belonging.

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:34.640
I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.

02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:37.520
That's a position of weakness.

02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:38.840
It's pathetic.

02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:42.240
And it's the only political correctness

02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:43.920
that keeps people who can see this,

02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:46.120
and believe me, a lot of people can see it,

02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:49.280
from saying so out loud.

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.280
So you want the black American community

02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:54.280
to represent strength.

02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:57.000
Correct, and I want us to deal with what it is

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.800
that we have to deal with in order to be able

02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:03.800
to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.

02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:06.480
Let me ask you,

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:10.560
I know you said you're angry

02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:14.160
or dislike affirmative action.

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:16.080
Let me ask you about something

02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:19.240
that even to my ear cut wrong.

02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:23.120
Now I'm relatively apolitical.

02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.240
So President Biden, when he was running for president,

02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:30.520
gave a campaign promise that he will nominate

02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:33.280
a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court,

02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:36.200
saying, quote, the person I will nominate

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.240
will be someone with extraordinary qualifications,

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:42.080
character, experience, and integrity.

02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.080
First sentence.

02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:44.440
Second sentence.

02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.000
And that person will be the first black woman

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.680
ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.

02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.160
Do you wish he only said the first sentence

02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:54.440
and not the second?

02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:58.760
Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,

02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:01.000
even if his intention was to do what he said

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.600
he was gonna do in the second sentence.

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:06.360
In other words, I wish that he had simply said,

02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:08.040
if I have the opportunity to nominate someone

02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:08.880
to the Supreme Court,

02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:11.240
it's gonna be a superbly qualified person

02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:13.120
to carry out that position.

02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:15.480
And he might have kept to himself his intention

02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:18.760
to name an African American woman to that position

02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:20.160
and then going ahead and named

02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:21.840
an African American woman to that position.

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:25.480
And I'm sure that Katanji Brown Jackson.

02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:27.240
I don't doubt that she's exceptionally qualified.

02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:28.720
She has a distinguished career.

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:31.760
She served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:33.120
She's a graduate at Harvard Law School.

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:34.760
She has a background.

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.760
You do not have to be a world-class constitutional

02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:43.760
legal scholar to get onto the United States Supreme Court.

02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.920
A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court

02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:48.640
have had different kinds of legal careers

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:51.600
before they were elevated to that position.

02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:56.600
Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s

02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.160
was a politician as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.

02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:03.240
I mean, many kinds of people in the US Supreme Court.

02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:07.040
I have no doubt that Judge Katanji Brown Jackson

02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:10.160
is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.

02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.840
I wish that Biden had not done what he did.

02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:16.240
He could have just appointed a black woman

02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:18.920
by saying that he was limiting his considerations

02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:19.760
to black women.

02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:21.280
And what are black women as a percentage

02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:25.040
of all potential appointees to the Supreme Court?

02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.520
3%, 4%, I don't know.

02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:31.360
We could look the number up by saying

02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:33.520
that he puts an asterisk on the appointment.

02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.320
But it's worse than that because she will live down

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:42.400
the asterisk if a person is inclined to do that.

02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:45.960
She will have the opportunity to show through her performance

02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:47.520
exactly what kind of jurist she is.

02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.840
Just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown

02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:52.760
through his performance that he was qualified

02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:54.000
and more than qualified to be on

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.280
the United States Supreme Court.

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.760
What I dislike was the pandering.

02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:06.280
He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us.

02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:09.040
And he's treating us like children.

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:12.160
Why should I care what color the person is

02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:14.440
who's on the United States Supreme Court?

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:16.120
What I should care about is what kind

02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:18.920
of opinions they're gonna write

02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:20.080
when they're on the United States.

02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.360
Do I suppose that being a black woman means

02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:23.480
that you're gonna write different kind

02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:24.360
of opinions than others?

02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.360
Well, perhaps, perhaps that kind of identity politics

02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:35.200
at the highest level of American legal establishment

02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:38.880
is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.

02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:42.760
What I should care about is the nature

02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:43.800
and the future of the law.

02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:45.720
I'm actually struck by this

02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:49.880
because the court is conservative.

02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:53.840
It has six conservative members on it

02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.440
and it has three liberal members on it.

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:02.760
And if I were and I'm not a liberal Democrat,

02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:04.920
the highest concern that I would have

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:07.600
about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,

02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:11.120
is this a person who is going to be effective

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:14.040
in advocating my liberal views

02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:17.040
within the highest council of American law?

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:20.000
Now, the fact that that person is a woman

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.200
or is a black person is way down the list

02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.360
of the things that I would think are important

02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:29.720
to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write.

02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:33.400
So, I mean, I think Joe Biden,

02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:39.480
this is just a piece of a larger political strategy

02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:41.640
to cobble together a coalition

02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:44.000
that will be successful at the polls

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:45.680
in sustaining Democrats.

02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:49.960
Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization

02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:54.720
of the conflict in the states about election security

02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:58.480
and voting rights is another part of that strategy.

02:51:58.480 --> 02:52:01.960
He is pandering to black voters.

02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:04.920
He is trying to frighten us,

02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:06.880
thinking that if the Republicans win,

02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:08.720
our rights will be taken away.

02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:14.720
And I think it is a infantilization

02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:16.360
of African-American politics.

02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:20.360
I think black people are not to be as concerned

02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.400
about the color of the skin of a person

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:23.960
who is serving in government

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:26.920
as they are about the content of their character

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:30.680
and the focus of their political

02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:32.800
and ideological orientation,

02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:37.360
which for me would be center or even center right,

02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:38.840
but that's me.

02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:41.440
And it should not have a significant impact.

02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:43.920
Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisks,

02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:46.320
but to me, it was deeply disrespectful

02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:51.320
that anyone would give an extra asterisk stuff to overcome.

02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:52.840
He didn't have to say it.

02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:54.040
All he had to do was do it.

02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:55.680
If he wanted to put a black woman on the court,

02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:57.480
then he could have gone ahead and done it.

02:52:57.480 --> 02:52:59.760
The reason he said it is because he wanted black people

02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:01.600
to vote for him by saying it.

02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:04.520
And I'm saying that treats us like we're children.

02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:05.760
It's not a political statement.

02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:06.840
I just thought as a leader,

02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:11.280
that was kind of disgusting.

02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:13.840
Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell.

02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:14.760
You mentioned him.

02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:18.880
He's a colleague and somebody who was an influence

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.600
in the space of ideas.

02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:27.600
So what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas

02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:33.040
and how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas

02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:35.160
in our culture in general?

02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:37.560
I think Thomas Sowell, he's in his 90s now.

02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:39.120
He's been around for a long time.

02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:40.320
He's still got it.

02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:41.400
He's still going at it.

02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:42.240
He's still going at it.

02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:43.200
Books continue to come out.

02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:44.400
I think he's a great man.

02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:49.800
I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race, he's black,

02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:55.840
is one of the 100 most significant economists

02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:57.840
of the 20th century.

02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:59.640
He has chosen as his subject,

02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:02.720
a substantial part of his subject to investigate

02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:08.040
the deep causes and consequences of racial disparity

02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:09.680
of one kind or another.

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:14.680
He's written fundamental books about that, many of them.

02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:17.720
He's a social philosopher.

02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:20.720
He is a economic historian.

02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:25.720
He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas

02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:27.760
around how to think about society

02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:30.200
and this beyond racial differences,

02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:31.440
although race has been a big part

02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:33.240
of what he's written about.

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:35.400
He's been critical of affirmative action

02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:37.920
and he didn't just stand back and wag his finger.

02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:39.800
He got busy looking at the consequences

02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:42.680
of affirmative action in societies all around the world

02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:44.600
and he's written books about that.

02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:48.960
He's been critical of the narrative about civil rights

02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:50.320
and racial inequality.

02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:51.800
He believes in small government.

02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:55.640
He doesn't think that efforts to redistribute income

02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:57.400
have proved to be the solution

02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:00.280
to the problem of racial disparity.

02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:02.720
Tom has not been honored by the committee

02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:06.800
that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science

02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:09.400
and probably won't be because he's controversial

02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.320
and I reckon that that committee would be loathe

02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.560
to encourage the blowback that they would be sure to receive

02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:20.520
if they were to take a controversial and politically

02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:25.280
focused and expressive black conservative

02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:26.520
and honor in that way.

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:29.080
So I think another reason is that Tom

02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:34.080
as a methodological matter is not especially quantitative.

02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:35.400
He pays attention to data

02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:37.920
but he doesn't do statistical analysis

02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:39.880
and he doesn't do modeling.

02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:41.760
So from a methodological point of view,

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.760
he's not a cutting edge kind of mathematically sophisticated

02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.720
kind of quantitatively statistically oriented

02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:53.120
but he does descriptive stuff.

02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:56.800
He writes in a style that is much more

02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:59.520
like a social historian than it is

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:04.160
like a mathematically trained analytical economist.

02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.120
On the other hand, he is an economist

02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:09.960
in the Chicago school, Milton Fridman and George Stickler

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.960
prominent amongst his teachers who takes price theory

02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:20.200
which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces,

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:25.880
mindful of incentives and so on

02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:30.880
to implement the basic insights from economic science.

02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:33.120
There is no free lunch.

02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:34.480
I mean, there's always gonna be a cost

02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:36.480
to anything that you do and so on.

02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:37.720
People respond to incentives,

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.260
demand curve slope downward.

02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:42.160
Competition tends to work best

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:45.040
when people are free to enter and not and so on.

02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:46.880
I mean, that kind of thing.

02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:51.800
But Tom is also a social historian and philosopher

02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.880
in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.

02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:57.920
One of Tom's books I've deeply admired

02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:01.000
Knowledge and Decisions is an extension

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:06.000
of the Hayekian arguments about the limits

02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.080
of central planning and whatnot.

02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:14.080
So I think Tom Sowell, Thomas Sowell, African-American

02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:17.560
born as I understand it in Louisiana,

02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:22.320
raised in New York City, a graduate of Harvard College,

02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:26.600
a military veteran, a PhD in economics

02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:29.200
from the University of Chicago,

02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:33.440
a black conservative social scientist of very high stature.

02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:34.560
I think he's a great man.

02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:37.840
And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century.

02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:42.840
And you're saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.

02:57:42.960 --> 02:57:45.520
Yeah, I do think so.

02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:49.960
I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee,

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.200
Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist

02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:54.480
wrote about economic development,

02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:56.560
wrote a famous two volume work,

02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:58.960
An American Dilemma about the status of blacks.

02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:03.960
I mean, I think Tom could be put in that company

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:06.120
very easily without any difficulty.

02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.160
I agree.

02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:09.920
Daniel Kahneman, them, so it doesn't have to be new.

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:12.000
Psychologists, he's not an economist.

02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:15.920
Eleanor Ostrom, the political scientist

02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:18.040
who was honored in a joint prize given to her

02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:21.880
and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so.

02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:24.680
He could be put in that company really quite easily.

02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:29.840
Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama in the very beginning

02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:31.240
that we were talking about.

02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:38.160
How did it feel that seems like forever ago

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:41.800
that in 2008 Barack Obama became president?

02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:45.800
Now at that time, perhaps you identify

02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:47.360
as conservative already.

02:58:48.920 --> 02:58:53.920
So politics aside, just in general,

02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:59.880
how did it feel that in 150 years

02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:01.520
where this country has come along?

02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:08.280
Well, yeah, I didn't identify in 2008 as a conservative

02:59:08.840 --> 02:59:10.760
to the same extent that I do today.

02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:15.960
I was kind of in transition yet again.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.400
I was excited by the Obama candidacy.

02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:23.160
At first I was skeptical because after all, he's not black.

02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:27.480
The man's father is a Kenyan

02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:31.840
and the man's mother is a white American

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:35.040
and he identifies as black.

02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:38.720
I find it interesting that the first black president

02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:41.160
of the United States and I could have put inverted commas

02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:44.080
around black and the first black vice president

02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:45.880
of the United States.

02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:48.400
Neither of them descend from American slaves.

02:59:49.640 --> 02:59:54.640
Kamala Harris's father is of African ancestry in part.

02:59:54.680 --> 02:59:55.960
He's a Jamaican immigrant

02:59:55.960 --> 03:00:00.320
and her mother is an Indian immigrant.

03:00:00.320 --> 03:00:05.320
She was Kamala Harris raised up largely in Canada

03:00:09.720 --> 03:00:11.320
though born in the United States.

03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:16.680
Barack Obama is, as I've said, of mixed ancestry

03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:20.160
and neither of his parents are the descendants

03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:25.160
of American descendants of African slaves.

03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:30.960
But blackness is flexible.

03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:35.440
It's something that you can put on

03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:38.560
or you can take off to a certain degree for some people

03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:40.760
and so be it.

03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:46.640
I was excited, our time has come, hope and change.

03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:51.160
We are the ones we've been waiting for.

03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:53.120
These are slogans from 2008.

03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:57.560
I can't believe I bought that crap.

03:00:57.560 --> 03:00:58.400
Oh, interesting.

03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:00.120
Let me push back here.

03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:04.160
You talked about, I mean, to me a Jew is a Jew.

03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:07.760
Skin color is skin color.

03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:08.800
Yeah.

03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:15.160
I mean, Barack Obama is black when it matters.

03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.800
When you're talking to a white supremacist,

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.800
when you're talking to, if you're a slave owner, he's black.

03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:30.680
Just like you said, when Hitler comes around,

03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:34.080
a Jew is a Jew, it doesn't matter how you identify,

03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:35.800
it doesn't matter what.

03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:40.240
So in that sense, don't you think that Barack Obama

03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:43.400
is black in the most powerful of ways,

03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:47.080
which is designating how far the MLK,

03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:49.200
the Dr. King vision.

03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:50.160
Oh, sure.

03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:52.720
And look, I said it a little bit tongue in cheek.

03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:54.120
Yes, yes, of course.

03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:57.160
But I think Obama has been very careful

03:01:57.160 --> 03:02:00.880
about manufacturing a kind of public persona

03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:03.040
that is intended to

03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:09.040
position him in the most effective way.

03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:10.800
You mean like every politician?

03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:12.600
Yeah, like every politician, sure.

03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:17.240
And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that.

03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:21.360
I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation

03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:24.200
because I have no facts about the personal history

03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:25.040
of Barack Obama.

03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.800
And I accept Barack Hussein Obama.

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:30.920
As Hillary Clinton once said, I take him at his word

03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:33.960
about whatever she was talking about.

03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:35.880
Well, was he a Christian?

03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:37.720
I think is what the question was.

03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:40.880
And there was some right-wing attack on Obama

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:45.600
for having been raised for some years in the Philippines

03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:48.440
and all of that, or Indonesia, I beg your pardon,

03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:51.600
in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that.

03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:54.880
But she took him at his word and I take him at his word

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.160
about his racial identity.

03:02:58.160 --> 03:02:59.000
No.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.720
But you were captivated by the power of his words

03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:04.400
and you regret to the degree you were captivated.

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:06.480
Well, I mean, I think in retrospect,

03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:09.960
that whole campaign looks like a pie in the sky

03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:13.160
kind of fairy tale.

03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:15.800
We are the ones we've been waiting for.

03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:18.360
I can't quote exactly that speech that he gave

03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:21.480
in Grant Park in Chicago when he was announced

03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:23.760
as the winner of the election.

03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:27.800
But today is the day that the rise of the ocean stopped,

03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:28.920
words to this effect.

03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:32.840
I mean, those who doubted that we could do it,

03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:35.440
that tonight is your answer, this was gonna be a new day,

03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:37.000
it was gonna be a new regime.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.120
Well, it wasn't a new day and it wasn't a new regime.

03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:43.160
It was American politics more or less as usual.

03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:46.400
Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah.

03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.440
Maybe there should be no surprise in that.

03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:52.680
Race relations got set back during Obama's tenure.

03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:57.960
My beef with Obama is that, okay, you're black.

03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:59.640
You say you're black, you're black.

03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:02.360
You got elected, now we have a black president.

03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:04.200
A black president.

03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:07.920
You can do stuff that nobody else could do.

03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:11.040
You're a black president.

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:13.880
You could tell the people burning down the city

03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:17.640
to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.

03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:23.040
You could tell the race hustlers,

03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:24.640
they all shopped into the world.

03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:27.480
Not only has our time come,

03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:30.000
for those who supported my campaign,

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:34.000
your time is over for those who wanna carry on

03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:39.520
a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.

03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.160
The election of myself to this highest office

03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:44.960
proves that the institution of this state

03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:48.360
are legitimate and open to all comers.

03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:54.160
I think Barack Obama, when the SHIT hit the fan,

03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:57.000
if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
I deeply regret that he said that.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.160
He's president of the United States.

03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:05.040
The color of his skin and the color of Trayvon's skin,

03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:06.840
the correlation between those two things.

03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:08.200
If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:11.080
Now he says, when he said it,

03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:14.400
he only meant to sympathize with the parents.

03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:15.600
But in fact, when he said it

03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:18.240
from the highest office in the land,

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:20.560
and then sent his Attorney General Eric Holder out

03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:24.520
to enforce this narrative,

03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:27.360
he doubled down on a racial narrative

03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:29.880
that I think is actually false.

03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:34.880
I think the story that systemic racism in America

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.200
as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people

03:05:38.200 --> 03:05:42.600
because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false.

03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:47.280
I think that the central threat to black lives

03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:52.400
is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people

03:05:52.840 --> 03:05:54.480
against other black people.

03:05:54.480 --> 03:05:56.320
I think there is such a thing as police brutality.

03:05:56.320 --> 03:05:58.880
And I think there are reasons to have regulations of police,

03:05:58.880 --> 03:06:02.280
but I think it is a second order issue

03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:07.040
in terms of the quality of life of African-Americans.

03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:08.840
I think Obama could have told the people

03:06:08.840 --> 03:06:12.040
who after Freddie Gray died in police custody

03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:14.080
in a van in Baltimore,

03:06:14.080 --> 03:06:16.760
and who undertook to burn that city down

03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:19.320
to get their asses off the street

03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:21.120
and go back to their apartments and stop it.

03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:22.840
I think he could have said in the aftermath

03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:26.600
of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson

03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:27.960
in Ferguson, Missouri,

03:06:27.960 --> 03:06:30.760
and there was a grand jury deliberation

03:06:30.760 --> 03:06:34.080
that elected not to indict Officer Wilson.

03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:35.720
And people took the streets in that city

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:39.280
and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.

03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.880
He could have told them,

03:06:40.880 --> 03:06:43.720
we don't mob around courthouses in this country.

03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:46.000
We respect the rule of law.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.480
Get your butts off the streets

03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:49.840
and back into your apartments.

03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:50.880
He didn't do that.

03:06:53.400 --> 03:06:54.680
To push back a little bit.

03:06:54.680 --> 03:06:56.720
Yeah, good, push back.

03:06:56.720 --> 03:06:59.600
I think you're asking Barack Obama,

03:06:59.600 --> 03:07:04.480
the first black president of the United States,

03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:07.240
to do the thing that I think should be done

03:07:07.240 --> 03:07:09.720
by the second black president of the United States.

03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:13.440
I think his very example, given the color of his skin,

03:07:15.480 --> 03:07:17.520
was the most powerful thing.

03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:22.400
And actually doing some of these hard Thomas Sowell type

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:26.960
of Glenn Lare type of strong words about race,

03:07:26.960 --> 03:07:28.800
it may be too much to ask,

03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:31.720
given the nature of modern day politics.

03:07:31.720 --> 03:07:33.280
He is a politician.

03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:34.200
He is a politician.

03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:35.200
He needed to get elected.

03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:36.880
He needed to get reelected.

03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:38.400
Yeah.

03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:39.640
It was in his second term

03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:41.320
where most of what I'm talking about happened.

03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:43.040
So he wasn't facing further election,

03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:48.040
but Obama was what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated.

03:07:48.680 --> 03:07:49.720
He served for eight years.

03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:52.120
So he's in his mid fifties.

03:07:52.120 --> 03:07:54.840
He's got another half century or 40 years of life,

03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:55.680
God willing.

03:07:56.520 --> 03:07:58.480
His post presidency,

03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:00.680
I think was what was primarily on his mind,

03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:03.120
not getting elected to anything,

03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:05.280
but being enshrined in a certain way.

03:08:05.280 --> 03:08:10.280
And the persona that he is now embodying,

03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:15.360
which depends upon a racial narrative that I

03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:18.120
and Thomas Sowell and others object to,

03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:21.320
I think was very much in the forefront of his mind

03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:23.680
when he made decisions as the chief executive officer

03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:28.680
of the country that we've all now have to live with.

03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:30.200
Yeah.

03:08:30.200 --> 03:08:34.360
But the fact is he opened the door

03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:36.000
in a way that hasn't been done

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.720
in the history of this, the United States,

03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:45.720
that I don't see there being even a significant discussion

03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:50.400
when an African American,

03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:53.200
a black man or a black woman runs for president,

03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:54.960
maybe a black man, let's say,

03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:57.000
because there still hasn't been a woman president.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.040
I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:02.600
That's not even a discussion.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.960
That example by itself, I mean, to me,

03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:08.760
the role of the president isn't just policy,

03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:11.760
it's to inspire, it's to do the Dr. King thing,

03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:16.760
which is I have a dream.

03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:19.480
And Barack Obama is an example of somebody

03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:21.240
that could give one hell of a speech.

03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:23.840
It got you to believe.

03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:26.880
Obama is a smooth operator without any question.

03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:28.400
He's a master of his craft.

03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:30.760
He did the impossible.

03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:33.400
I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight

03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:38.040
and he beat John McCain in that general election

03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:39.120
and hats off to him.

03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:43.960
And moreover, he remains a iconic figure in American culture.

03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:46.160
I don't think there's any doubt about that.

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:50.120
Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.

03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:56.040
Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring

03:09:56.320 --> 03:09:57.440
just like Obama's story.

03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:00.080
He overcome obstacles just like Obama did.

03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:02.680
I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.

03:10:02.680 --> 03:10:07.280
Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member

03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:09.440
of the United States Supreme Court.

03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:13.200
He is one of nine justices

03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:15.640
and it's three equal branches of government.

03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:18.400
So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic,

03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:22.560
personifies 1 27th of the American state.

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:28.720
He is an iconic figure.

03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:32.000
His example should be an inspiration

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:33.920
to Americans of all races,

03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:36.320
but especially a black American youngsters.

03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:38.920
He happens to be conservative.

03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:40.080
He's very conservative.

03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:42.480
So fucking what?

03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:46.560
He too deserves to be in that pantheon.

03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:50.840
He is not by the custodians of American education.

03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:53.200
Clarence Thomas' name is not on that many schools.

03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:55.280
Barack Obama's name will be on many of them.

03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:56.560
I'm not equating them.

03:10:56.560 --> 03:10:57.480
They're different people.

03:10:57.480 --> 03:10:59.520
The offices are very different,

03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:01.960
but the same logic that you just used

03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:06.960
to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:10.240
could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas,

03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:12.000
in my opinion.

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:15.440
Yes, but it's the office,

03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:20.440
but also there's a resume and there's accomplishments,

03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:23.640
but then there is oratory and charisma

03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:25.480
and a number of Twitter followers.

03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:31.040
So there's ability to captivate a large number of people.

03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:32.960
And that's a skill.

03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:35.680
That's a skill that correlates,

03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:38.600
but is not directly connected to

03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:40.640
with how impressive your resume is.

03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:41.480
I agree.

03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:42.960
And moreover, the judicial function,

03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:45.200
the judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort

03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:48.080
because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing.

03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:50.160
He's a custodian of the law

03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:54.560
and that's not a popular feature figure in American politics.

03:11:54.720 --> 03:11:57.720
He doesn't stand for election and it's a good thing too.

03:11:57.720 --> 03:11:59.720
So I take that point.

03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:02.320
Here, I wanna say something else though that's provocative.

03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:03.720
The next black president,

03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:05.320
you say the first black president

03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:06.960
shouldn't have been the one to do that.

03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.480
The second one should,

03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:10.920
is more likely than not gonna be a Republican.

03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:12.400
I don't have a particular person in mind.

03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:13.240
I'm just saying.

03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:16.320
I agree, I agree, I agree.

03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:19.520
And that's why it's gonna be super fun.

03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:25.320
Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:27.480
and give advice to young people.

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:28.880
So if you're talking to somebody

03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:31.040
who's in high school, in college,

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:34.240
what advice would you give them about their career,

03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:37.240
about life in general,

03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:39.280
how to live a life they can be proud of?

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:44.080
Well, I'd say the world is your oyster.

03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:45.920
I mean, first order of business, you're not a victim.

03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:47.240
I don't care what color you are, I don't care.

03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:49.360
You're male, female, you're gay, straight, whatever.

03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:51.240
The world is your oyster.

03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:52.320
You are so privileged.

03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:54.000
You sit here in the United States of America,

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:55.280
a free country, a rich country,

03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:56.800
everything is possible for you.

03:12:56.800 --> 03:12:58.680
Believe me, you can do anything.

03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:05.640
Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium

03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:11.760
in which we're embedded is the key to the future.

03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:15.400
So get educated, focus, work hard.

03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:19.320
You know, invest in your future

03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:21.720
by acquiring the skills that you need

03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:23.960
to be able to navigate the 21st century.

03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:28.520
I would say the Chinese are coming

03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:30.320
and I don't mean anything against China.

03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:32.200
I just mean to say the world's a small place

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:33.720
and it's getting smaller.

03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:43.160
You better get moving and you better get moving quickly.

03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:46.000
I'd say your identity, your coloration,

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:49.960
your orientation, your category

03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:52.960
is not the most important thing about you.

03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:57.960
That, you know, so the temptation to limit yourself,

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:03.080
I give this speech to my kids.

03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:08.080
I say, I quote James Joyce.

03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:14.080
He has a passage in portrait of an artist as a young man

03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:21.160
in which he says, do you know what Ireland is?

03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:27.000
Ireland is an old sow that eats her pharaoh.

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:28.920
This is Joyce.

03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:32.680
He says, Stephen Daedalus is the character

03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:35.280
that he has in mind in this chronicle.

03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:39.880
He says, your ethnic inheritance,

03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:41.960
he's talking about Irish nationalism,

03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:46.240
are like nets holding you back.

03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:49.720
That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets

03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:53.960
into wings and thereby to fly, okay?

03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:58.120
Flying into the open skies of modern society.

03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:02.480
Don't be your grandfather, don't be your father.

03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:04.360
Don't wear your things so heavily

03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:05.960
that it keeps you from being open

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:07.800
to everything that's new in the world.

03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:10.480
Wear it lightly.

03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:12.200
Yes, everybody comes from somewhere,

03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:14.360
but it doesn't have to be where you end up.

03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:18.480
So you're not your father, you're not your grandfather.

03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:24.920
You are this wonderfully blessed human being

03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:28.440
in the middle of, going into the middle of the 21st century.

03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:31.760
And don't miss it.

03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:37.440
Don't live blinkertly, don't live small, live big.

03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:46.080
Live big and wear your history lightly.

03:15:48.040 --> 03:15:51.320
Yeah, everybody's got a mother tongue,

03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:54.400
everybody's got a story, everybody has a people,

03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:56.720
but the world is a small place.

03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:01.560
I love that you're quoting an Irishman.

03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:05.360
One of the greatest writers of the 20th century,

03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:09.200
a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.

03:16:09.200 --> 03:16:14.200
The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.

03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:16.600
Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison,

03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:18.160
the African-American writer,

03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:23.160
Invisible Man is his masterpiece, embodied this spirit.

03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:26.400
Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere,

03:16:27.080 --> 03:16:29.760
that coming from somewhere is from slavery in America,

03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:32.840
that's our ancestral heritage.

03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:35.040
But that's not what we are.

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:40.040
Skin and bone, these are superficial things, the spirit.

03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:41.840
And if I were a more religious person,

03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:44.160
I could give a whole disposition about that.

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:46.600
But it's the spirit, it's that light that's inside,

03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:47.440
that's who we are.

03:16:47.440 --> 03:16:50.760
And our challenge is to live in the fullness of it,

03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:53.440
as opposed to this blinker thing.

03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:55.200
When we don't look left, we don't look right,

03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:59.960
we're just fitting within this template that we inherit.

03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:02.760
That is a travesty, really.

03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:07.400
Glenn, you've lived an incredible life, a productive one,

03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:11.600
but just representing some powerful ideas,

03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:13.240
some powerful ideals.

03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:15.920
But life comes to an end.

03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:18.440
Yeah.

03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:20.920
Do you think about your death?

03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:21.960
Are you afraid of it?

03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:27.960
Well, it is a really interesting coincidence

03:17:28.400 --> 03:17:30.400
that you'd pose me that question,

03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:34.000
because I'm coming from a funeral.

03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:39.080
Today is Sunday.

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:42.360
On the preceding Tuesday, five days ago,

03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:47.160
I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith,

03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:50.680
who was my brother-in-law.

03:17:51.160 --> 03:17:53.080
He was my sister's husband.

03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:59.600
My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:06.040
Her husband has died at the age of 68 in April of 2022,

03:18:09.280 --> 03:18:10.520
and I was at his funeral.

03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:13.600
He died suddenly of a heart attack

03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:15.120
that came completely out of the blue.

03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:16.880
He seemed to be in perfect health.

03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:19.920
He was a magnificent human being.

03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:24.080
I could go into the details, but take my word for it.

03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:28.640
He was a businessman, a steel trader, a metals trader.

03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:30.360
He would buy and sell.

03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:32.240
He worked mostly from his home office.

03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:34.760
He had clients, counter-parties,

03:18:34.760 --> 03:18:37.160
people he did business with all over the world.

03:18:38.960 --> 03:18:43.680
He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s,

03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:45.280
two of whom are in their late 30s.

03:18:45.280 --> 03:18:47.560
These are my sister's children.

03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:48.400
She's deceased.

03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:50.520
Now he's deceased.

03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:54.560
The older two sons are severely developmentally disabled,

03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:57.480
and although they're in their late 30s,

03:18:57.480 --> 03:18:59.880
they're not independently viable.

03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:02.040
They don't function effectively.

03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:03.360
They have to be cared for.

03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:08.280
That responsibility has now fallen to the family,

03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:10.960
but mainly to the surviving son

03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:14.000
who lives with his wife and his two young children

03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:17.120
and has assumed the responsibility.

03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:20.520
They've cared at home, my sister and her husband, Wesley,

03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:22.440
Eugene Wesley Smith,

03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:25.040
cared for their disabled sons at home.

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:26.760
They didn't wanna see them institutionalized.

03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:29.320
They had some help from programs at the state

03:19:29.320 --> 03:19:30.480
and social worker and so on,

03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:32.480
but they mainly took on the burden

03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:34.600
of caring for them at home.

03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:36.240
Anyway, I go on at length here,

03:19:36.240 --> 03:19:38.520
and I don't know how much of this you will choose

03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:41.320
to make use of, and it doesn't matter really.

03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:43.240
I'm just trying to respond to your question.

03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:47.240
I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral,

03:19:49.320 --> 03:19:51.000
and I offered them.

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:56.000
And I spoke well of this great man.

03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:57.040
He was a great man.

03:19:57.040 --> 03:19:59.040
He had a straight back.

03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:00.200
He was a standup guy.

03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:01.680
He could be counted on.

03:20:01.680 --> 03:20:02.720
His word was his bond.

03:20:02.720 --> 03:20:04.200
He had broad shoulders.

03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:06.480
He carried a lot of people with him,

03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:08.960
business associates, family members,

03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:10.600
and so forth and so on.

03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:12.120
He had a huge heart.

03:20:12.120 --> 03:20:14.000
He was a giving and kind person.

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:15.240
He had a great mind.

03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:18.360
He was an intellectual, even though as a businessman,

03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:23.360
much of his day was taken up with minutia of contracts

03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:27.560
and the details of the order being delivered

03:20:27.560 --> 03:20:30.160
and not being delivered, of the quality of the product,

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:32.080
of the financing, and so forth and so on.

03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:34.160
There was still a powerful mind there.

03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:36.560
Yeah, he was a powerful mind, and he studied.

03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:37.400
He read books.

03:20:37.400 --> 03:20:38.960
He was interested in music and art.

03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:42.240
He was, he's a spiritual seeker,

03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:46.200
had been ordained as a child minister in his youth.

03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:51.200
And while he remained a master of the Christian canon,

03:20:53.400 --> 03:20:58.400
he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths

03:20:58.680 --> 03:21:01.880
and kind of stood above any particular tradition

03:21:01.880 --> 03:21:03.720
as a man who believed in God,

03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:06.880
but thought that God manifest himself in many ways

03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:09.400
to human beings and that there was much to learn

03:21:09.400 --> 03:21:12.000
from other religious traditions as well.

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:13.200
This is Wesley.

03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:14.640
We called him Wesley by his middle name,

03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:15.800
Eugene Wesley Smith.

03:21:15.800 --> 03:21:17.000
May he rest in peace.

03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:20.960
68, that's five years younger than I am right now.

03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:23.200
He dropped dead without any warning.

03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:24.200
I could too.

03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:26.960
So.

03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:29.000
How did that make you feel?

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.640
What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it,

03:21:31.640 --> 03:21:34.360
having to give that speech in the days that followed?

03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:35.760
Well, first of all, I wondered, what would I say?

03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:36.640
What would I say?

03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:38.480
There was no way to prepare.

03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:42.240
And I decided, I rehearsed in my mind this,

03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:43.800
he had straight back, he had broad shoulders,

03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:46.080
he had a big heart, he had a great mind,

03:21:46.080 --> 03:21:49.520
he had a capacious spirit and whatnot.

03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:52.480
And I used that as a template for making my remarks.

03:21:52.480 --> 03:21:54.560
But my main thought was, my God,

03:21:54.560 --> 03:21:57.480
life is precious and life is fleeting.

03:21:57.480 --> 03:21:59.760
And death is a part of life.

03:22:00.840 --> 03:22:03.280
My death is a part of my life.

03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:07.200
And I thought, well, I wanna take better care of myself

03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:09.920
than I do, et cetera, et cetera.

03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:13.640
But I also thought a lot of this is not in my hands at all.

03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:16.840
I thought one should have his affairs in order.

03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:18.880
My brother did not have all of his affairs in order

03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:21.480
in the sense that there is a lot of,

03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:22.600
things are going to probate.

03:22:22.600 --> 03:22:25.920
There was no will, it's kind of unsettled.

03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:30.280
I don't want that to happen to my surviving family members.

03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:34.480
I wanna have my affairs such that should heaven forbid,

03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:37.120
I fall over one day and don't get up again.

03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:41.320
People don't have to scramble about how to take care

03:22:41.320 --> 03:22:43.440
of things from that point forward.

03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:45.400
But as a human, are you afraid?

03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:48.120
In your own heart?

03:22:48.120 --> 03:22:50.440
I'm afraid now, I read this wonderful book called

03:22:50.440 --> 03:22:53.840
The Swerve, it's about Lucretius.

03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:57.920
It's about the nature of things, which is this great

03:22:57.920 --> 03:23:02.920
classical work from the Roman period by this guy, Lucretius.

03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:05.520
And I'm trying to think of the name of the author,

03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:07.840
but you could look it up, The Swerve is the book.

03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:11.120
It won like a national book award or a Pulitzer Prize.

03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:13.680
And it's the history of the recovery of this book

03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:20.800
by one of these Italian, Renaissance Italian people

03:23:20.920 --> 03:23:24.480
who would go into the monasteries in central Europe

03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:27.200
and look through the scrolls and they discover

03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:29.560
these classical works from antiquity,

03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:31.840
which had been lost through the dark ages

03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:36.840
and they re-publish and read these works.

03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:41.080
And Lucretius's great work, On the Nature of Things

03:23:41.080 --> 03:23:45.360
was one of these books, Poggio Baccholini.

03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:47.000
I don't remember the Italian guy's name,

03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:48.560
but this all could be looked up.

03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:52.800
Yeah, Poggio Baccholini, 15th century.

03:23:53.640 --> 03:23:58.160
15th century and the name of the author

03:23:58.160 --> 03:23:59.880
is Stephen Greenblatt.

03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:02.400
Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book

03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:04.960
and a terrific story.

03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:09.880
Anyway, one of Lucretius's points, he was an atheist.

03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:11.640
I mean, he was a Roman.

03:24:11.640 --> 03:24:15.240
I mean, he didn't believe in mysticism

03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:20.240
and he argued it's irrational to be afraid of death.

03:24:20.320 --> 03:24:21.960
Why should I fear death?

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:23.440
Death is coming to all of us.

03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:25.480
The point of being afraid.

03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:27.800
I mean, I'm wasting my time fearing something

03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:30.200
that I have no ultimate control over.

03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:32.120
It's irrational to be afraid of death.

03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:38.360
Yeah, because you can't predict when it happens.

03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:41.560
You only know that it happens.

03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:43.160
So why be afraid?

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:44.000
How's that?

03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:45.200
And therefore live every day fully,

03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:50.200
live every day purposefully, you know, and so on.

03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:52.680
But these are all just words, you know,

03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:55.080
I don't wanna die.

03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:55.920
I wanna live forever.

03:24:55.920 --> 03:24:57.520
I'm not gonna live forever.

03:24:57.520 --> 03:24:59.720
I don't wanna suffer.

03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:01.080
I see people suffering.

03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:04.240
I saw my late wife, Linda Thatcher Lowry,

03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:06.800
Dr. Linda Thatcher Lowry,

03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:10.000
professor of economics at Tufts University

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.400
whom I met in graduate school at MIT,

03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:14.720
black woman from Baltimore.

03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:17.280
We married, we raised two sons together.

03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:22.200
She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer.

03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:24.360
And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

03:25:24.360 --> 03:25:25.480
And it took a while.

03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:30.440
And we care for her at home right up until the very end.

03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:35.080
She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her.

03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:38.360
And the dog curled up by the door,

03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.120
the porch door in the bedroom and she expired.

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.640
And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

03:25:45.640 --> 03:25:46.960
And I don't wanna suffer.

03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:48.440
Who does?

03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:50.160
I don't wanna die.

03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:53.200
I am likely to suffer before I die.

03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:58.120
I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.

03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:02.960
There's a book by Richard John Newhouse,

03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:07.400
the theologian called As I Laid Dying,

03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:10.280
As I Laid Dying, Richard John Newhouse.

03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:16.040
He had stomach cancer and he thought he was dying.

03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:18.840
And he wrote this book As He Laid Dying.

03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:19.880
And then he recovered.

03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:24.320
He went into remission and he had another couple of years.

03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:27.360
He thought he was dying and he had another couple of years.

03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:30.920
And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore

03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:34.320
in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.

03:26:34.320 --> 03:26:36.040
He was just a friend of mine,

03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:38.800
a theologian and a public intellectual.

03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:43.480
He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life

03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:45.960
in New York City, which still exists.

03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:49.400
And he's contemplating his own death

03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:51.320
from the point of view of a Christian minister.

03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:53.320
He was first a Lutheran pastor

03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:55.880
and then he converted to Catholicism

03:26:55.880 --> 03:26:58.280
or as he would have put it, I returned to the church

03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:00.840
because he thought the Renaissance was over.

03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:03.240
I mean, I'm sorry, the Reformation.

03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:04.080
Richard thought it was over.

03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:08.000
He says there's only one church, et cetera.

03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:11.160
Get into theology stuff here.

03:27:11.160 --> 03:27:14.160
But I'm saying all that to say,

03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:16.600
I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda,

03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:18.000
as she lay dying in that bed.

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:21.800
I read that book and it was filled with hope.

03:27:21.800 --> 03:27:25.360
I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.

03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:26.200
Yes.

03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:27.800
I lie, dying.

03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:29.360
I don't wanna die.

03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:30.720
I'm a Christian minister.

03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:32.520
Christ was raised from the dead.

03:27:32.520 --> 03:27:34.160
I'm supposed to believe in everlasting life,

03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:35.680
but the fact of the matter is this is me

03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:37.640
and I'm lying here and I'm dying.

03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:39.020
This is the end of me.

03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:41.440
How are you gonna do anything

03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:42.960
other than dread the end of me?

03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:45.520
So let's acknowledge that I don't wanna die, okay?

03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:47.880
I'm just gonna tell you that upfront.

03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:52.880
But that is not the end of,

03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:55.680
my death is not the end of life.

03:27:55.680 --> 03:27:58.160
I have lived well and fully.

03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:01.320
I will go and do my best right up until the end.

03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:04.640
I will accept what is inevitable

03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:06.960
and I will hold out this belief.

03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:08.080
And he's a Christian minister,

03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:09.320
so he holds out this belief.

03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:12.000
And he knows that the belief is not rational.

03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:16.840
It's not a reasoned deductive scientific conclusion.

03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:20.600
It's spiritual in the most fundamental way.

03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:24.160
It is something that people hold on to

03:28:24.160 --> 03:28:26.000
and they have hope and he had hope.

03:28:27.080 --> 03:28:29.320
I don't know if I have that hope.

03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:34.320
I used to be, but I'm no longer a Christian

03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:39.480
and I'm no longer a theist really.

03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:42.560
I'm with Lucretius there.

03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:46.640
I mean, there's no magic that's going on here.

03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:49.480
There's no unseen hand behind the scene

03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:51.160
that's arranging things.

03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:54.080
What I believe is that when I look at the natural world,

03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:56.800
I see the evolution of the species.

03:28:56.800 --> 03:28:59.840
I see the organic development of the planets.

03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:02.560
I mean, the earth is going to not exist

03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:04.540
in a finite number of years.

03:29:04.540 --> 03:29:06.360
I think with a very high probability,

03:29:06.360 --> 03:29:08.560
the sun is gonna die.

03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:10.600
It's gonna implode.

03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:13.280
It's gonna go supernova, whatever is gonna happen.

03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:16.840
And there's not gonna be any there, there.

03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:19.800
What's the meaning of life, Glenn Lowry?

03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:21.240
That's the meaning of life.

03:29:21.240 --> 03:29:24.000
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.120
What's the why?

03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:30.040
Or is that something economists and social scientists

03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:32.280
and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?

03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:34.360
Surely.

03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:38.120
I think we try to live well and meaningfully

03:29:38.120 --> 03:29:39.680
within our time.

03:29:39.680 --> 03:29:43.160
We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on,

03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:48.160
and we accept our limitations and our mortality.

03:29:48.240 --> 03:29:50.680
We try to contribute.

03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:57.840
And that's through our children and through our work.

03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:02.120
And we're in this together.

03:30:02.120 --> 03:30:03.680
We're not in this alone.

03:30:03.680 --> 03:30:06.520
We are connected to other people.

03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:11.160
I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.

03:30:11.160 --> 03:30:12.080
I'm a teacher.

03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:16.120
My students are gonna outlive me.

03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:18.360
They're gonna have students.

03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:19.760
I'm a writer.

03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:20.920
My writing is gonna outlive me.

03:30:20.920 --> 03:30:25.440
I don't wanna be self-important or pretentious here.

03:30:25.440 --> 03:30:27.240
I doubt that I'm gonna be the James Joyce

03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:29.120
of the 21st century.

03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:31.520
They may not be reading my stuff in 100 years,

03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:33.320
as people will certainly be reading

03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:37.360
Ulysses in 100 years.

03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:43.040
But I try to have an impact on the world that I'm a part of

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:46.120
and try to leave a legacy that's dignified.

03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:49.080
I could give some flowery words

03:30:49.080 --> 03:30:51.120
to truth-seeking and whatnot.

03:30:51.120 --> 03:30:52.240
What about love?

03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:53.080
Love.

03:30:55.320 --> 03:30:59.360
What role does love play in this life thing?

03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:01.320
Love makes the world go round.

03:31:01.320 --> 03:31:03.640
Without love, what have we got?

03:31:03.640 --> 03:31:08.280
We don't have family.

03:31:08.280 --> 03:31:13.280
And we certainly have missed out

03:31:15.240 --> 03:31:18.440
if love is not a central part of our existence.

03:31:18.440 --> 03:31:20.320
But stop asking me questions like that.

03:31:20.320 --> 03:31:21.160
Yeah.

03:31:22.120 --> 03:31:24.320
Glenn, thank you for doing everything you do,

03:31:24.320 --> 03:31:25.440
for thinking the way you do,

03:31:25.440 --> 03:31:30.440
for being fearless and bold in the Glenn show

03:31:30.440 --> 03:31:32.360
and your writing and your work

03:31:32.360 --> 03:31:33.360
and just being who you are.

03:31:34.200 --> 03:31:35.040
Thank you for being you

03:31:35.040 --> 03:31:37.160
and thank you for giving me the huge honor

03:31:37.160 --> 03:31:39.840
of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.

03:31:39.840 --> 03:31:40.880
This was awesome.

03:31:40.880 --> 03:31:42.200
It's been my pleasure, Lex.

03:31:42.200 --> 03:31:45.720
I mean, really, and it has been like four hours, man.

03:31:45.720 --> 03:31:46.560
You're wearing me out.

03:31:46.560 --> 03:31:47.800
Love for me.

03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:49.360
I love it.

03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:52.080
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Glenn Lowry.

03:31:52.080 --> 03:31:53.400

03:31:55.880 --> 03:31:57.920
And now let me leave you with some words

03:31:57.920 --> 03:32:00.480
from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:02.760
If you can't fly, then run.

03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:05.240
If you can't run, then walk.

03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:07.680
If you can't walk, then crawl.

03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:11.480
But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.

03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:15.440
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
