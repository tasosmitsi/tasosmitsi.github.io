00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

00:04.560 --> 00:09.840
And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic, which is to say they release energy.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.840
If you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a falcon tube and you warm it up to

00:15.840 --> 00:20.480
say 50 degrees centigrade and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it, nothing's going to

00:20.480 --> 00:27.200
happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable. Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable

00:27.200 --> 00:32.320
than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. Why doesn't that happen?

00:32.320 --> 00:35.680
It's because of the kinetic barriers. That's where you need the spark.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.280
The following is a conversation with Nick Lane, a biochemist at University College London

00:43.280 --> 00:50.240
and author of some of my favorite books on biology, science and life ever written, including his two

00:50.240 --> 00:57.120
most recent titled Transformer, The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death and The Vital Question. While

00:57.200 --> 01:04.000
you're watching this, why is life the way it is? This is the Alex Fridman podcast. To support it,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.520
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.

01:10.640 --> 01:13.920
Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious, the most interesting question

01:14.560 --> 01:21.280
that we little humans can ask of ourselves. How did life originate on earth?

01:21.280 --> 01:27.120
You could ask anybody working on the subject and you'll get a different answer from all of them.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.080
We'll be pretty passionately held. Opinions, and their opinions grounded in science,

01:33.920 --> 01:37.600
but they're still really at this point, their opinions, because there's so much stuff to know

01:38.720 --> 01:44.800
that all we can ever do is get a kind of a small slice of it. And it's the context which matters.

01:44.800 --> 01:52.160
So I can give you my answer. My answer is, from a biologist's point of view, that has been missing

01:52.160 --> 01:58.560
from the equation over decades, which is, well, what does life do on earth? Why is it this way?

01:58.560 --> 02:04.000
Why is it made of cells? Why is it made of carbon? Why is it powered by electrical

02:04.000 --> 02:09.920
charges on membranes? There's all these interesting questions about cells that if you then look to

02:09.920 --> 02:14.000
see, well, is there an environment on earth, on the early earth, four billion years ago,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.320
that kind of matches the requirements of cells? Well, there is one. There's a very obvious one.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.760
It's basically created by whenever you have a wet rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents

02:24.560 --> 02:31.600
which generate hydrogen gas in bucket loads and electrical charges on cell-like pores

02:32.320 --> 02:39.200
that can drive the kind of chemistry that life does. So it seems so beautiful and so obvious

02:40.400 --> 02:46.640
that I've spent the last 10 years or more trying to do experiments. It turns out to be difficult,

02:46.640 --> 02:50.640
of course. Everything's more difficult than you ever thought it was going to be. But it looks,

02:50.640 --> 02:55.360
I would say, more true rather than less true over that 10-year period. I think I have to take a step

02:55.360 --> 02:59.920
back every now and then and think, hang on a minute, where's this going? I'm happy it's going

02:59.920 --> 03:06.720
in a sensible direction. And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas. I mean,

03:06.720 --> 03:15.120
I'm often accused of being too focused on life on earth, too kind of narrow-minded and inward

03:15.120 --> 03:20.560
looking, you might say. I'm talking about carbon. I'm talking about cells. And maybe you or plenty

03:20.560 --> 03:25.280
of people can say to me, ah, yeah, but life can be anything. I have no imagination. Maybe they're

03:25.280 --> 03:31.840
right. But unless we can say why life here is this way and if those reasons are fundamental reasons

03:31.840 --> 03:37.520
or if they're just trivial reasons, then we can't answer that question. So I think they're

03:37.520 --> 03:41.520
fundamental reasons and I think we need to worry about them. Yeah, there might be some deep truth

03:41.520 --> 03:49.360
to the puzzle here on earth that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere. Solving this

03:49.360 --> 03:58.880
particular puzzle will give us that deeper truth. So to this puzzle, you said vents, hydrogen, wet.

04:00.160 --> 04:07.040
So chemically, what is the potion here? How important is oxygen? You wrote a book about this.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.120
Yeah. And I actually just came straight here from a conference where I was chairing a session on

04:11.120 --> 04:16.320
whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life. Of course, it matters. But it matters most

04:16.320 --> 04:24.640
to the origin of life to be not there. As I see it, we have thisâ€¦ I mean, life is made of carbon,

04:24.640 --> 04:32.000
basically, primarily, organic molecules with carbon-carbon bonds. And the building block,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.400
the Lego brick that we take out of the air or take out of the oceans is carbon dioxide.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.840
And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules, we need to strap on hydrogen.

04:41.840 --> 04:47.840
And this is basically what life is doing. It's hydrogenating carbon dioxide. It's taking the

04:47.840 --> 04:53.440
hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth in these hydrothermal vents and it sticks it on CO2. And

04:53.440 --> 05:00.000
it's really as simple as that. And actually, thermodynamically, the thing that I find most

05:00.000 --> 05:05.360
troubling is that if you do these experiments in the lab, the molecules you get are exactly the

05:05.360 --> 05:08.480
molecules that we see at the heart of biochemistry and the heart of life.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.520
Is there something to be said about the earliest origins of that little

05:17.600 --> 05:23.200
potion, that chemical process? What really is the spark there?

05:24.560 --> 05:32.960
There isn't a spark. There is a continuous chemical reaction. And there is kind of a spark,

05:32.960 --> 05:37.200
but it's a continuous electrical charge, which helps drive that reaction.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.240
So literally spark.

05:39.760 --> 05:45.200
Well, the charge at least, but yes. I mean, a spark in that sense is we tend to think of,

05:45.200 --> 05:50.000
in terms of Frankenstein, we tend to think in terms of electricity and one moment you zap

05:50.000 --> 05:55.200
something and it comes alive. And what does that really mean? It's come alive and now what's

05:55.200 --> 06:02.640
sustaining it? Well, we are sustained by oxygen, by this continuous chemical reaction. And if you

06:02.640 --> 06:06.960
put a plastic bag on your head, then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.800
So some way of being able to leverage a source of energy.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.560
Well, the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide

06:14.560 --> 06:20.000
and hydrogen. And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic, which is to say they

06:20.000 --> 06:26.240
release energy. If you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a falcon tube and you

06:26.240 --> 06:30.240
warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

06:30.880 --> 06:37.120
nothing's going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable. Two gases, hydrogen and CO2

06:37.120 --> 06:44.640
is less stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. So why doesn't

06:44.640 --> 06:48.720
that happen? It's because of the kinetic barriers. That's where you need the spark.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.280
Is it possible that life originated multiple times on earth?

06:53.920 --> 06:56.080
The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.

06:57.040 --> 07:04.000
There's a long distance to go from the first bits of prebiotic chemistry to say molecular machines

07:04.000 --> 07:11.200
like ribosomes. Is that the first thing that you would say is life? Like if I introduce you to

07:11.200 --> 07:13.920
the two of you at a party, you would say that's a living thing?

07:14.880 --> 07:21.440
I would say as soon as we introduce genes information into systems that are growing

07:21.440 --> 07:29.200
anyway, I would talk about growing protocells. As soon as we introduce even random bits of

07:29.200 --> 07:35.520
information into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example, it doesn't have to have

07:35.520 --> 07:40.080
any information. It can be a completely random sequence. But if it's introduced into a system,

07:40.080 --> 07:44.960
which is in any case growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself, then any changes in that

07:44.960 --> 07:50.640
sequence that allow it to do so better or worse are now selected by perfectly normal natural

07:50.640 --> 07:54.480
selection. So that's when it becomes alive to my mind.

07:54.480 --> 08:04.160
That's encompassed into an object that keeps information and evolves that information over

08:04.160 --> 08:07.200
time or changes that information over time in response to the...

08:07.200 --> 08:11.040
So it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.

08:11.040 --> 08:16.720
So is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult or is it possibly started

08:16.720 --> 08:20.000
in multiple locations on earth? It's possible it started multiple

08:20.000 --> 08:28.720
occasions. There's two provisos to that. One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really

08:28.720 --> 08:33.120
for life to start. So as soon as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere, then life isn't going to keep

08:33.120 --> 08:38.480
starting over. So I often get asked by people, why can't we have life starting? If it's so easy,

08:38.480 --> 08:43.040
why can't life start in these vents now? And the answer is, if you want hydrogen to react

08:43.040 --> 08:47.600
with CO2 and there's oxygen there, hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead. You're getting

08:47.600 --> 08:51.120
explosive reaction that way is rocket fuel. So it's never going to happen.

08:51.120 --> 08:57.200
But for the origin of life earlier than that, all we know is that there's a single common ancestor

08:57.200 --> 09:01.280
for all of life. There could have been multiple origins and they all just disappeared.

09:02.880 --> 09:08.960
But there's a very interesting deep split in life between bacteria and what are called archaea,

09:08.960 --> 09:14.800
which look just the same as bacteria. And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.040
And they are very different in their biochemistry. And so any explanation for

09:19.040 --> 09:24.080
the origin of life has to account as well for why they're so different and yet so similar.

09:24.080 --> 09:28.320
And that makes me think that life probably did arise only once.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.040
Can you describe the difference that's interesting there? How they're similar,

09:33.040 --> 09:37.440
how they're different? Well, they're different in their membranes,

09:37.440 --> 09:41.200
primarily. They're different in things like DNA replication. They use completely different

09:41.200 --> 09:47.120
enzymes and the genes behind it for replicating DNA. So they both have membranes, both have DNA

09:47.120 --> 09:53.680
replication. The process of that is different. They both have DNA. The genetic code is identical

09:53.680 --> 10:01.200
in them both. The way in which it's transcribed into RNA, into the copy of a gene and the way

10:01.200 --> 10:05.280
that that's then translated into a protein, that's all basically the same in both these groups. So

10:05.280 --> 10:10.560
they clearly share a common ancestor. It's just that they're different in fundamental ways as

10:10.560 --> 10:16.000
well. And if you think about, well, what kind of processes could drive that divergence very early

10:16.000 --> 10:22.480
on, I can think about it in terms of membranes, in terms of the electrical charges on membranes.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.440
And it's that that makes me think that there were probably many unsuccessful attempts and

10:27.440 --> 10:31.760
only one really successful attempt. Can you explain why that divergence

10:31.760 --> 10:38.000
makes you think there's one common ancestor? Okay. Can you describe that intuition? I'm a

10:38.000 --> 10:43.200
little bit unclear about why the divert, like the leap from the divergence means there's one.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.560
Do you mean like the divergence indicates that there was a big invention at that time?

10:50.560 --> 10:58.160
Yes. If you'd got, as I imagine it, you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent.

10:59.040 --> 11:04.640
Let's say there are millions of vents and millions of potential common ancestors living in all of

11:04.640 --> 11:10.720
those vents, but only one of them makes it out first. Then you could imagine that that

11:10.720 --> 11:15.120
cell is then going to kind of take over the world and wipe out everything else. And so what you

11:15.120 --> 11:21.360
would see would be a single common ancestor for all of life, but with lots of different vent systems,

11:21.360 --> 11:26.480
all kind of vying to create the first life forms, you might say. So this thing is a cell,

11:27.040 --> 11:30.880
a single cell. We're always talking about populations of cells, but yes,

11:31.760 --> 11:40.320
these are celled organisms. But the fundamental life form is a single cell, right? So they're

11:40.320 --> 11:46.480
always together, but they're alone together. Yeah. There's a machinery in each one individual

11:47.040 --> 11:53.120
component that if left by itself would still work. Yes, yes, yes. It's the unit of selection

11:53.120 --> 11:58.240
is a single cell, but selection operates over generations and changes over generations in

11:58.240 --> 12:02.480
populations of cells. So it would be impossible to say that a cell is the unit of selection

12:02.480 --> 12:06.560
in the sense that unless you have a population, you can't evolve, you can't change.

12:07.280 --> 12:13.280
Right. But there was one Chuck Norris, it's an American reference,

12:14.880 --> 12:19.680
cell that made it out of the vents, right? Or like the first one.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.520
So imagine then that there's one cell gets out and it takes over the world.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.520
It gets out in the water. It's like floating around.

12:25.520 --> 12:33.040
We're deep in the ocean somewhere, but actually two cells got out and they appear to have got out

12:33.040 --> 12:40.000
from the same vent because they both share the same code and everything else. So unless all the,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.200
we've got a million different common ancestors in all these different vents. So either they all

12:45.200 --> 12:51.840
have the same code and two cells spontaneously merged from different places or two different

12:51.840 --> 12:57.680
cells, fundamentally different cells came from the same place. So either way, what are the

12:57.680 --> 13:03.200
constraints that say not just one came out or not half a million came out, but two came out.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.440
That's kind of a bit strange. So how did they come out? Well, they come out because

13:08.080 --> 13:13.200
what you're doing inside event is you're relying on the electrical charges down there to power

13:13.200 --> 13:17.840
this reaction between hydrogen and CO2 to make yourself grow. And when you leave the vent,

13:17.840 --> 13:21.120
you've got to do that yourself. You've got to power up your own membrane.

13:21.120 --> 13:26.320
And so the question is, well, how do you power up your own membrane? And the answer is, well,

13:26.320 --> 13:30.720
you need to pump. You need to pump ions to give an electrical charge on the membrane.

13:30.720 --> 13:35.200
So what do the pumps look like? Well, the pumps look different in these two groups.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.360
It's as if they both emerge from a common ancestor. As soon as you've got that ancestor,

13:39.360 --> 13:46.240
things move very quickly and divergently. Why does the DNA replication look different? Well,

13:46.240 --> 13:49.520
it's joined to the membrane. The membranes are different. The DNA replication is different

13:49.520 --> 13:54.160
because it's joined to a different kind of membrane. So there's interesting, you know,

13:54.160 --> 13:58.160
this is detail you may say, but it's also fundamental because it's about the two

13:58.160 --> 14:02.880
big divergent groups of life on earth that seem to have diverged really early on.

14:02.880 --> 14:10.080
It all started from one organism and then that organism just start replicating the heck out of

14:10.080 --> 14:17.760
itself with some mutation of the DNA. So like there's some, there's a competition through the

14:17.760 --> 14:22.800
process of evolution. They're not like trying to beat each other up. They're just, they're

14:22.800 --> 14:28.480
just trying to live. They are just replicators. Yeah. Well, you know, let's not minimize there.

14:28.480 --> 14:33.440
Yeah. They're just trying to chill. They're trying to relax up. But there's no sense of

14:33.440 --> 14:38.000
trying to survive. They're replicating. I mean, there's no sense in which they're

14:38.000 --> 14:42.640
trying to do anything. They're just a kind of an outgrowth of the earth, you might say.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.440
Of course, the aliens would describe us humans in that same way.

14:46.560 --> 14:51.360
They might be right. This primitive life. It's just, it's just ants that are hairless,

14:52.480 --> 14:58.400
mostly hairless. Overgrown ants. Overgrown ants. Okay. What do you think about the idea of

14:58.400 --> 15:05.040
panspermia that the theory that life did not originate on earth and was planted here from

15:05.040 --> 15:11.840
outer space or pseudo panspermia, which is like the basic ingredients, the magic that you mentioned

15:11.840 --> 15:17.200
was planted here from elsewhere in space. I don't find them helpful. That's not to say they're wrong.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.760
So pseudo-transpermia, the idea that, you know, the chemicals, the amino acids, the nucleotides

15:23.760 --> 15:27.520
are being delivered from space. Well, we know that happens. It's unequivocal that they're delivered

15:27.520 --> 15:33.200
on meteorites, comets and so on. So what do they do next? That's to me, the question. And well,

15:33.200 --> 15:37.360
what do they do is they stock a soup that presumably they land in a pond or in an ocean

15:37.360 --> 15:42.240
or wherever they land. And then you end up with a, you know, a best possible case scenario is you

15:42.240 --> 15:46.240
end up with a soup of nucleotides and amino acids, and then you have to say, so now what happens?

15:46.240 --> 15:51.840
And the answer is, oh, well, they have to go become alive. So how did they do that? You may

15:51.840 --> 15:59.200
as well say then a miracle happened. I don't believe in soup. I think what we have in event

15:59.200 --> 16:03.600
is a continuous conversion, a continuous growth, a continuous reaction, a continuous

16:03.600 --> 16:08.480
converting a flow of molecules into more of yourself, you might say, even if it's a small

16:08.480 --> 16:13.840
bit. So you've got a kind of continuous self-organization and growth from the very

16:13.840 --> 16:20.560
beginning. You never have that in a soup. Isn't the entire universe and living organisms in the

16:20.560 --> 16:27.040
universe, isn't it just soup all the way down? Isn't it all soup? No, no. I mean, soup almost

16:27.040 --> 16:32.480
by definition doesn't have a structure. But soup is a collection of ingredients that are like

16:32.480 --> 16:39.280
randomly. Yeah, but they're not random. I mean, we have chemistry going on here. We have metal

16:39.280 --> 16:44.240
grains forming, which are, you know, effective oil-water interactions. Okay. So it feels like

16:44.240 --> 16:49.120
there's a direction to a process, like a direct process. There are directions to processes. Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.840
And if you're starting with CO2 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together and

16:55.840 --> 17:00.800
they react, what are they going to make? Well, they make carboxylic acids, which include

17:00.800 --> 17:06.400
the fatty acids that make up the cell membranes and they form directly into bilayer membranes.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.280
They form like soap bubbles. It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature of the

17:11.280 --> 17:16.560
molecules. And those things are capable of growing and are capable in effect of being selected even

17:16.560 --> 17:22.400
before there are genes. So we have a lot of order and that order is coming from thermodynamics.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.880
And the thermodynamics is always about increasing the entropy of the universe.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.360
But if you have oil and water and they're separating, you're increasing the entropy

17:31.360 --> 17:34.640
of the universe, even though you've got some order, which is the soap and the water are

17:35.520 --> 17:42.000
not missable. To come back to your first question about panspermia properly,

17:43.680 --> 17:47.760
that just pushes the question somewhere else. Even if it's true, maybe life did start on

17:47.760 --> 17:54.320
Earth by panspermia. So what are the principles that govern the emergence of life on any planet?

17:55.040 --> 17:58.880
It's an assumption that life started here and it's an assumption that

18:00.320 --> 18:05.440
it started in a hydrothermal vent or it started in a terrestrial geothermal system. The question is,

18:05.440 --> 18:10.480
can we work out a testable sequence of events that would lead from one to the other one and

18:10.480 --> 18:14.800
then test it and see if there's any truth in it or not? With panspermia, you can't do any of that.

18:14.800 --> 18:21.600
But the fundamental question of panspermia is, do we have the machine here on Earth to build life?

18:23.200 --> 18:32.800
Is the vent enough? Is oxygen and hydrogen and whatever the heck else we want and some source

18:32.800 --> 18:41.440
of energy and heat, is that enough to build life? Of course, you would say that as a human,

18:42.160 --> 18:47.600
but there could be aliens right now chuckling at that idea. Maybe you need some special

18:49.440 --> 18:56.640
sauce. Your sense is we have everything here. This is precisely the question.

18:58.240 --> 19:02.480
When I'm talking in schools, I like to start out with the idea of we can make a time machine.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.840
We go back four billion years and we go to these environments that people talk about. We go to a

19:07.840 --> 19:16.560
deep sea hydrothermal vent. We go to a Yellowstone Park type place environment. We find some slime

19:16.560 --> 19:21.120
that looks like we can test it. It's made of organic molecules. It's got a structure which

19:21.120 --> 19:28.080
is not obviously cells, but is this a stepping stone on the way to life or not? How do we know?

19:28.960 --> 19:33.920
Unless we've got an intellectual framework that says this is a stepping stone and that's not a

19:33.920 --> 19:37.440
step. We'd never know. We wouldn't know which environment to go to, what to look for,

19:37.440 --> 19:41.680
how to say this. All we can ever hope for, because we're never going to build that time machine,

19:41.680 --> 19:46.800
is to have an intellectual framework that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,

19:46.800 --> 19:53.920
how we go from a sterile inorganic planet to living cells as we know them. In that framework,

19:53.920 --> 19:57.920
every time you have a choice, it could be this way or it could be that way or there's lots of

19:58.640 --> 20:05.200
possible forks down that road. Did it have to be that way? Could it have been the other way and

20:05.200 --> 20:11.360
would that have given you life with very different properties? If you come up with a... It's a long

20:11.360 --> 20:15.920
hypothesis because as I say, we're going from really simple prebiotic chemistry all the way

20:15.920 --> 20:21.280
through to genes and molecular machines. That's a long, long pathway and nobody in the field would

20:21.280 --> 20:25.120
agree on the order in which these things happened, which is not a bad thing because it means that you

20:25.120 --> 20:29.760
have to go out and do some experiments and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.

20:29.760 --> 20:40.800
It's so freaking amazing that it happened though. It feels like there's a direction to the thing.

20:41.840 --> 20:49.200
Can you try to answer from a framework perspective of what is life?

20:49.680 --> 20:59.120
You said there's some order and yet there's complexity. It's not perfectly ordered. It's

20:59.120 --> 21:05.040
not boring. There's still some fun in it and it also feels like the processes have a direction

21:06.240 --> 21:13.680
through the selection mechanism. They seem to be building something always better, always improving.

21:14.480 --> 21:19.280
Maybe it's... That's a perception. That's our romanticization of things are always better.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.400
Things are getting better. We'd like to believe that. You think about the world from the point

21:24.400 --> 21:29.040
of view of bacteria and bacteria are the first things to emerge from whatever environment they

21:29.040 --> 21:34.400
came from and they dominated the planet very, very quickly and they haven't really changed.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.160
Four billion years later, they look exactly the same. For about four billion years ago,

21:38.640 --> 21:44.560
bacteria started to really run the show and then nothing happened for a while.

21:44.560 --> 21:49.600
Nothing happened for two billion years. Then after two billion years, we see another single

21:49.600 --> 21:54.960
event origin, if you like, of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells. So cells with a nucleus

21:54.960 --> 22:00.080
and lots of stuff going on inside. Another singular origin. It only happened once in the

22:00.080 --> 22:03.600
history of life on earth. Maybe it happened multiple times and there's no evidence. Everything

22:03.600 --> 22:09.440
just disappeared, but we have to at least take it seriously that there's something that stops

22:09.440 --> 22:15.200
bacteria from becoming more complex because they didn't. That's a fact that they emerged

22:16.000 --> 22:20.400
four billion years ago and something happened two billion years ago, but the bacteria themselves

22:20.400 --> 22:26.560
didn't change. They remain bacterial. So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory towards

22:26.560 --> 22:30.400
great complexity in human beings at the end of it. It's very easy to imagine that without

22:30.400 --> 22:34.880
photosynthesis arising or without eukaryotes arising that a planet could be full of bacteria

22:34.880 --> 22:39.760
and nothing else. But we'll get to that because that's a brilliant invention and there's a few

22:39.760 --> 22:45.840
brilliant invention along the way. But what is life? If you were to show up on earth,

22:45.840 --> 22:51.360
but to take that time machine and you said, asking yourself the question, is this a stepping stone

22:51.360 --> 22:58.080
towards life? As you step along, when you see the early bacteria, how would you know it's life?

22:58.880 --> 23:03.840
And then this is a really important question when you go to other planets and look for life.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.800
What is the framework of telling the difference between a rock

23:10.080 --> 23:16.720
and a bacteria? The question's both impossible to answer and trivial at the same time and I

23:16.720 --> 23:20.800
don't like to answer it because I don't think there is an answer. I think we're trying to describe-

23:20.800 --> 23:22.880
Those are the most fun questions. There's no answer.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.880
There is no answer. There are at least 40 or 50 different definitions of life out there

23:28.880 --> 23:39.120
and most of them are obviously bad in one way or another. I can never remember the exact words

23:39.120 --> 23:44.400
that people use, but there's a NASA working definition of life, which more or less says

23:44.960 --> 23:51.120
a system which is capable of a self-sustaining system capable of evolution or something along

23:51.120 --> 23:56.640
those lines. And I immediately have a problem with the word self-sustaining because it's

23:56.640 --> 24:00.560
sustained by the environment and I know what they're getting at. I know what they're trying

24:00.560 --> 24:06.640
to say, but I pick a hole in that. And there's always wags who say by that definition, a rabbit

24:06.640 --> 24:11.120
is not alive. Only a pair of rabbits would be alive because a single rabbit is incapable

24:11.120 --> 24:18.240
of copying itself. There's all kinds of pedantic, silly, but also important objections to any

24:18.240 --> 24:25.200
hypothesis. The real question is what is, we can argue all day or people do argue all day about

24:25.200 --> 24:30.720
is a virus alive or not? And it depends on the content, but most biologists could not agree

24:30.720 --> 24:34.080
about that. So then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something like that? It's even

24:34.080 --> 24:41.440
simpler than a virus, but it's capable of converting its environment into a copy of itself.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.320
And that's about as close, this is not a definition, but this is a kind of a description

24:46.320 --> 24:53.120
of life is that it's able to parasitize the environment and that goes for plants as well

24:53.120 --> 25:02.240
as animals and bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy of themselves, informationally

25:02.240 --> 25:07.840
exact copy of themselves. By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, right? It just

25:07.920 --> 25:15.280
has to be, you have to create something that's interesting. The way evolution is,

25:16.320 --> 25:22.240
so it is extremely powerful process of evolution, which is basically make a copy of yourself

25:22.240 --> 25:27.040
and sometimes mess up a little bit. Okay. That seems to work really well. I wonder if it's

25:27.040 --> 25:33.040
possible to mess up big time, mess up big time as a standard, as a default. It's called a hopeful

25:33.040 --> 25:39.920
monster. It doesn't work. In principle, it can. Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is

25:39.920 --> 25:44.720
due a re-emergence. There's some amazing work from Michael Levin. I don't know if you came

25:44.720 --> 25:49.840
across him, but if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him. Yeah, in Boston.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.240
Talking to him in a few days. Oh, fantastic.

25:55.840 --> 26:02.560
So I mentioned, there's two people that, if I may mention, Andre Capati is a friend who's

26:02.560 --> 26:08.960
really admired in the AI community, said you absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.800
Of course, I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm really fortunate that we can actually make this happen.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.560
Anyway, you were saying? Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work,

26:19.200 --> 26:25.360
basically about the way in which electrical fields control development. He's done some

26:25.360 --> 26:29.840
work with planarian worms, so flatworms, where he'll tell you all about this, so I won't say

26:29.840 --> 26:35.520
any more than the minimum, but basically you can cut their head off and they'll redevelop a new head.

26:35.520 --> 26:42.400
But the head that they develop depends. If you knock out just one iron pump in a membrane,

26:42.400 --> 26:46.400
so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit, you can come up with a completely

26:46.400 --> 26:51.920
different head. It can be a head which is similar to those that diverged 150 million years ago,

26:51.920 --> 26:55.840
or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before, a different kind of head.

26:56.640 --> 27:01.040
Now that is really, you might say, a hopeful monster. This is a kind of leap into a different

27:01.040 --> 27:07.360
direction. The only question for natural selection is does it work? Is the change itself feasible as

27:07.360 --> 27:11.440
a single change? And the answer is yes, it's just a small change to a single gene. And the second

27:11.440 --> 27:17.040
thing is it gives rise to a completely different morphology. Does it work? And if it works,

27:17.040 --> 27:25.280
that can easily be a shift. But for it to be a speciation, for it to continue,

27:25.280 --> 27:31.840
for it to give rise to a different morphology over time, then it has to be perpetuated.

27:31.840 --> 27:40.320
So that shift, that change in that one gene has to work well enough that it is selected and it

27:40.320 --> 27:45.600
goes on. And copied enough times to where you can really test it. So the likelihood, it would be

27:45.600 --> 27:50.240
lost. But there'll be some occasions where it survives. And yes, the idea that we can have

27:50.240 --> 27:54.800
sudden, fairly abrupt changes in evolution, I think it's time for a rebirth.

27:54.800 --> 28:02.560
What about this idea that kind of trying to mathematize a definition of life and saying how

28:02.560 --> 28:08.080
many steps, the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing, almost like an engineering

28:08.080 --> 28:15.040
view of it? I like that view because I think that in a sense, that's not very far away from

28:15.040 --> 28:19.760
what a hypothesis needs to do to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life. You need to

28:19.760 --> 28:25.600
spell out here's each step and here's the experiment to do for each step. The idea that

28:25.600 --> 28:30.560
we can do it in the lab, some people say, oh, we'll have created life within five years,

28:30.560 --> 28:37.520
but ask them what they mean by life. We have a planet four billion years ago with these vent

28:37.520 --> 28:41.760
systems across the entire surface of the planet. And we have millions of years if we want it.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.960
I have a feeling that we're not talking about millions of years. I have a feeling we're talking

28:44.960 --> 28:50.880
about maybe millions of nanoseconds or picoseconds. We're talking about chemistry,

28:50.880 --> 28:58.560
which is happening quickly. But we still need to constrain those steps, but we've got a planet

28:59.440 --> 29:04.480
doing similar chemistry. You asked about a trajectory. The trajectory is the planetary

29:04.480 --> 29:08.320
trajectory. The planet has properties. It's basically it's got a lot of iron at the center

29:08.320 --> 29:11.920
of it. It's got a lot of electrons at the center of it. It's more oxidized on the outside,

29:11.920 --> 29:17.600
partly because of the sun and partly because the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases.

29:17.600 --> 29:24.000
So the planet is a battery. It's a giant battery. And we have a flow of electrons going from inside

29:24.000 --> 29:29.600
to outside in these hydrothermal vents. And that's the same topology that a cell has. A cell is

29:29.600 --> 29:37.120
basically just a micro version of the planet. And there is a trajectory in all of that. And

29:37.120 --> 29:41.440
there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical reaction are going to be favored over

29:41.440 --> 29:47.280
others. And there's an inevitability in what happens in water, the chemistry that happens in

29:47.280 --> 29:53.200
water. Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes and will form insoluble structures.

29:55.200 --> 30:01.680
Nobody really understands water very well. And it's another big question for experiments on the

30:01.680 --> 30:07.120
origin of life. What do you put it in? What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water?

30:07.120 --> 30:10.800
Because the last thing is likely to be is just kind of bulk water.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.160
How fundamental is water to life, would you say?

30:14.160 --> 30:20.880
I would say pretty fundamental. I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other

30:20.880 --> 30:30.080
way. But water is everywhere. Water is extremely good at what it does. And carbon works in water,

30:30.080 --> 30:34.400
especially well. So those things, and carbon is everywhere. So those things together make

30:34.400 --> 30:39.520
me think probabilistically, if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them would be

30:39.520 --> 30:44.400
carbon based and living in water. Now the reverse question, if you found a

30:44.400 --> 30:51.120
puddle of water elsewhere, and some carbon, no, just a puddle of water. Is a puddle of water

30:51.680 --> 31:00.880
a pretty damn good indication that life either exists here or has once existed here?

31:00.880 --> 31:03.760
No. So it doesn't work the other way.

31:05.200 --> 31:10.160
I think you need a living planet. You need a planet which is capable of turning over its

31:10.160 --> 31:16.720
surface. It needs to be a planet with water. It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons

31:16.720 --> 31:20.880
from inside to the outside. It needs to turn over its surface. It needs to make that water

31:20.880 --> 31:25.200
work and turn it into hydrogen. So I think you need a living planet. But once you've got the

31:25.200 --> 31:29.280
living planet, I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.

31:29.280 --> 31:37.600
So if you were to run earth over a million times up to this point, maybe beyond to the end,

31:37.600 --> 31:44.960
let's run it to the end. How much variety is there? You kind of spoke to this trajectory

31:44.960 --> 31:53.200
that the environment dictates chemically, I don't know in which other way, spiritually,

31:53.520 --> 32:01.760
I don't know. Like dictates kind of the direction of this giant machine that seems chaotic,

32:01.760 --> 32:11.280
but it does seem to have order in the steps it's taking. How often will bacteria emerge?

32:11.280 --> 32:14.640
How often will something like humans emerge? How much variety do you think there would be?

32:15.200 --> 32:20.800
I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety. I think we would get,

32:21.360 --> 32:26.080
how many times do you say you want to run it? A million times. I would say at least a few

32:26.080 --> 32:29.360
hundred thousand will get bacteria again. Oh, wow. Nice.

32:29.360 --> 32:32.800
Because I think there's some level of inevitability that a wet rocky planet

32:32.800 --> 32:39.680
will give rise through the same processes to something very close. I think this is not

32:39.680 --> 32:44.240
something I'd have thought a few years ago, but working with a PhD student of mine, Stuart Harrison,

32:44.240 --> 32:48.240
he's been thinking about the genetic code and we've just been publishing on that.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.800
There are patterns that you can discern in the code, or he has discerned in the code,

32:53.360 --> 32:58.320
that if you think about them in terms of, we start with CO2 and hydrogen and these are the

32:58.320 --> 33:02.720
first steps of biochemistry, you come up with a code which is very similar to the code that we see.

33:03.520 --> 33:07.920
So it wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code that was

33:07.920 --> 33:13.200
not very different to the genetic code that we have here without it just being transferred across.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.920
Some inevitability about the whole of the beginnings of life in my view.

33:18.480 --> 33:25.280
That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly linked to the genetic code,

33:25.840 --> 33:30.320
that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.

33:30.320 --> 33:34.480
Well, that's potentially- That's really exciting if that's the case.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.680
Okay. But then bacteria- We've got bacteria.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.880
Yeah. How easy is photosynthesis?

33:42.800 --> 33:47.520
Much harder, I would say. Let's actually go there. Let's go through the inventions.

33:47.520 --> 33:52.320
Yeah. What is photosynthesis and why is it hard?

33:52.320 --> 33:57.360
Well, there are different forms. I mean, basically you're taking hydrogen

33:57.360 --> 34:00.640
and you're sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun. The question is,

34:00.640 --> 34:05.200
where are you taking the hydrogen from? And in photosynthesis that we know in plants,

34:05.200 --> 34:09.760
it's coming from water. So you're using the power of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen,

34:09.760 --> 34:15.520
stick it onto CO2 and the oxygen is a waste product and you just throw it out, throw it away.

34:15.520 --> 34:21.040
So it's the single greatest planetary pollution event in the whole history of the earth.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.400
The pollutant being oxygen.

34:22.400 --> 34:28.640
Yes. Yeah. It also made possible animals. You can't have large active animals without

34:28.640 --> 34:33.520
an oxygenated atmosphere, at least not in the sense that we know on earth.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.760
So that's a really big invention in the history of earth.

34:35.760 --> 34:40.800
Huge invention, yes. And it happened once. There's a few things that happen once on earth and you're

34:40.800 --> 34:45.440
always stuck with this problem. Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly that it precluded

34:45.440 --> 34:50.000
the same thing happening ever again or are there other reasons? And we really have to

34:50.000 --> 34:54.480
look at each one in turn and think why did it only happen once? In this case,

34:55.040 --> 34:59.840
it's really difficult to split water. It requires a lot of power and that power,

34:59.840 --> 35:03.920
you're effectively separating charge across a membrane and the way in which you do it,

35:03.920 --> 35:08.160
if it doesn't all rush back and cause an explosion right at the site,

35:08.160 --> 35:14.960
requires really careful wiring. And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right because

35:16.480 --> 35:20.960
the plants that we see around us, they have chloroplasts. Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria

35:20.960 --> 35:25.600
ones. Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.000
So there's plenty of opportunity.

35:28.160 --> 35:32.000
There's not even many bacteria. So who invented photosynthesis?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.080
The cyanobacteria or their ancestors.

35:34.080 --> 35:34.880
And there's not many...

35:35.920 --> 35:41.440
No other bacteria can do what's called oxygenic photosynthesis. Lots of other bacteria can split.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.680
You can take your hydrogen from somewhere else. You can take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling

35:45.680 --> 35:50.720
out of a hydrothermal vent. Grab your two hydrogens. The sulfur is the waste now.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.920
You can do it from iron. You can take electrons. So the early oceans were probably full of iron.

35:55.920 --> 36:01.600
You can take an electron from ferrous iron, so iron two plus and make it iron three plus,

36:01.600 --> 36:07.520
which now precipitates as rust. And you take a proton from the city early ocean,

36:07.520 --> 36:12.160
stick it there. Now you've got a hydrogen atom. Stick it onto CO2. You've just done the trick.

36:12.160 --> 36:18.400
The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron. And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.720
One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is that the waste product

36:22.720 --> 36:24.160
is oxygen, which just bubbles away.

36:26.480 --> 36:31.840
That seems like extremely unlikely. And it's extremely essential for the evolution of complex

36:31.840 --> 36:38.480
organisms because of all the oxygen. Yeah. And that didn't accumulate quickly either.

36:39.280 --> 36:43.600
So it's converting... What is it? It's converting energy from the sun

36:44.640 --> 36:49.600
and the resource of water into the resource needed for animals.

36:50.560 --> 36:56.080
Both resources needed for animals. We need to eat and we need to burn the food. And we're eating

36:56.080 --> 37:01.040
plants which are getting their energy from the sun and we're burning it with their waste product,

37:01.040 --> 37:07.680
which is the oxygen. So there's a lot of circularity in that. But without an oxygenated planet,

37:07.680 --> 37:16.160
you couldn't really have predation. You can have animals, but you can't really have animals that

37:16.160 --> 37:19.680
go around and eat each other. You can't have ecosystems as we know them.

37:19.680 --> 37:24.880
Well, let's actually step back. What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes?

37:27.040 --> 37:29.840
What are each of those and how big of an invention is that?

37:30.960 --> 37:34.720
I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.

37:34.720 --> 37:40.880
Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain? Yeah. So I mentioned bacteria and archaea. These

37:40.880 --> 37:45.920
are both prokaryotes. They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus. If you look

37:45.920 --> 37:49.040
at them under a microscope, you don't see much going on. If you look at them under a

37:49.040 --> 37:53.600
super resolution microscope, then they're fantastically complex. In terms of their

37:53.600 --> 37:59.200
molecular machinery, they're amazing. In terms of their morphological appearance under a microscope,

37:59.200 --> 38:04.880
they're really small and really simple. The earliest life that we can physically see on

38:04.880 --> 38:09.600
the planet are stromatolites, which are made by things like cyanobacteria and their large

38:09.600 --> 38:16.720
superstructures. Effectively biofilms plated on top of each other and you end up with quite large

38:16.720 --> 38:23.280
structures that you can see in the fossil record. But they never came up with animals. They never

38:23.280 --> 38:27.920
came up with plants. They came up with multicellular things, filamentous cyanobacteria,

38:27.920 --> 38:33.520
for example. They're just long strings of cells. But the origin of the eukaryotic cell

38:34.400 --> 38:38.960
seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis. So one cell gets inside another cell.

38:40.080 --> 38:44.880
I think that that transformed the energetic possibilities of life. So what we end up with

38:45.520 --> 38:52.240
is a kind of supercharged cell, which can have a much larger nucleus with many more genes,

38:52.240 --> 38:57.520
all supported. If you think about it, you could think about it as multi-bacterial power without

38:57.520 --> 39:01.520
the overhead. So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria living in it. And those bacteria

39:01.520 --> 39:06.880
are providing it with the energy currency it needs. But each bacterium has a genome of its own,

39:06.880 --> 39:13.360
which costs a fair amount of energy to express, to kind of turn over and convert into proteins and

39:13.360 --> 39:20.960
so on. What the mitochondria did, which are these power packs in our own cells, they were

39:20.960 --> 39:24.960
bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their genes. They've only got a few left.

39:25.520 --> 39:30.800
So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside a cell and then threw away all

39:30.800 --> 39:35.120
this stuff that doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then kept what?

39:35.120 --> 39:40.480
So what we end up with, so it kept always a handful of genes, in our own case, 37 genes.

39:41.440 --> 39:46.720
But there's a few protists, which are single-celled things that have got as many as 70 or 80

39:46.720 --> 39:49.920
genes. So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number.

39:51.120 --> 39:57.040
And you can think of it as a pared down power pack where the control unit has been kind of

39:57.040 --> 40:02.400
pared down to almost nothing. So you're putting out the same power, but the investment in the

40:02.400 --> 40:08.240
overheads is really pared down. That means that you can support a much larger nuclear genome.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.800
So we've gone up in the number of genes, but also the amount of power you have to convert those

40:12.800 --> 40:18.400
genes into proteins. We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes, but in terms of the size

40:18.400 --> 40:23.920
of genomes and your ability to make the building blocks, make the proteins, we've gone up 100,000

40:23.920 --> 40:31.120
fold or more. So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution. And it's interesting

40:31.120 --> 40:36.800
then that the only two occasions that complex life has arisen on earth, plants and animals,

40:37.920 --> 40:43.360
fungi you could say are complex as well, but they don't form such complex morphology as plants

40:43.360 --> 40:49.360
and animals, start with a single cell. They start with an oocyte and a sperm fused together to make

40:49.360 --> 40:54.240
a zygote. So you start development with a single cell and all the cells in the organism have

40:54.240 --> 41:00.080
identical DNA. And you switch off in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on those

41:00.080 --> 41:04.480
genes and liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set. And the standard

41:04.480 --> 41:09.120
evolutionary explanation for that is that you're restricting conflict. You don't have a load of

41:09.120 --> 41:15.040
genetically different cells that are all fighting each other. And so it works. The trouble with

41:15.040 --> 41:20.160
bacteria is they form these biofilms and they're all genetically different and effectively they're

41:20.160 --> 41:24.080
incapable of that level of cooperation. They would get in a fight.

41:24.960 --> 41:33.680
Okay. So, why is this such a difficult invention of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an

41:33.680 --> 41:39.840
engine, which the mitochondria is? Why do you assign it such great importance? Is it great

41:39.840 --> 41:43.840
importance in terms of the difficulty of how it was to achieve a great importance in terms of the

41:43.840 --> 41:45.920
impact it had on life?

41:45.920 --> 41:53.040
Both. It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain

41:54.000 --> 41:56.320
that life on earth would be bacterial only.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.080
And that took a really long time.

41:58.080 --> 42:03.200
It took 2 billion years and it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge. So it looks

42:03.200 --> 42:07.840
as if it's genuinely difficult. And if you think about it then from just an informational

42:07.840 --> 42:15.120
perspective, you think bacteria have got, they structure their information differently.

42:15.120 --> 42:20.320
So a bacterial cell has a small genome, you might have 4,000 genes in it, but a single E. coli cell

42:20.320 --> 42:26.880
has access to about 30,000 genes, potentially. It's got a kind of metagenome where other E.

42:26.880 --> 42:31.120
coli out there have got different gene sets and they can switch them around between themselves.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.880
And so you can generate a huge amount of variation and they've got more, an E. coli

42:37.520 --> 42:42.560
metagenome is larger than the human genome. We own 20,000 genes or something.

42:44.160 --> 42:49.840
And they've had 4 billion years of evolution to work out what can I do and what can't I do

42:49.840 --> 42:54.160
with this metagenome? And the answer is you're stuck, you're still bacteria.

42:54.160 --> 43:01.120
So they have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did

43:01.120 --> 43:05.760
because they've had twice as long at least and they've got much larger populations.

43:05.760 --> 43:10.560
And they never got around this problem. So why can't they? It seems as if you can't solve it

43:10.560 --> 43:19.360
with information alone. So what's the problem? The problem is structure. If the very first

43:19.360 --> 43:24.480
cells needed an electrical charge on their membrane to grow. And in bacteria, it's the

43:24.480 --> 43:29.600
outer membrane that surrounds the cell, which is electrically charged. You try and scale that up

43:29.600 --> 43:34.160
and you've got a fundamental design problem. You've got an engineering problem. And there

43:34.160 --> 43:38.640
are examples of it. And what we see in all these cases is what's known as extreme polyploidy,

43:38.640 --> 43:42.960
which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies of their complete genome, which is

43:43.600 --> 43:49.120
energetically hugely expensive. And you end up with a large bacteria with

43:50.160 --> 43:56.800
no further development. What you need is to incorporate these electrically charged power

43:56.800 --> 44:03.120
pack units inside with their control units intact. And for them not to conflict so much

44:03.120 --> 44:07.760
with the host cell that it all goes wrong. Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.

44:07.760 --> 44:14.080
And then you change the topology of the cell. Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA

44:14.080 --> 44:19.680
than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy. But what you've got is an asymmetry. You now have

44:19.680 --> 44:26.400
a giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes that do all the

44:27.120 --> 44:31.440
control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.

44:32.240 --> 44:35.120
Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done?

44:35.920 --> 44:40.000
The power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and work.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.680
I mean, it's a kind of step change in the possibilities of evolution, but it doesn't

44:43.680 --> 44:49.200
happen overnight. It's going to still require multiple, multiple generations. So it could take

44:49.200 --> 44:53.280
millions of years. It could take shorter time. This is another thing I would like to put the

44:53.280 --> 44:57.280
number of steps and try and work out what's required at each step. And we are trying to

44:57.280 --> 45:02.160
do that with sex. You can't have a very large genome unless you have sex at that point. So

45:02.160 --> 45:06.720
what are the changes to go from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?

45:08.240 --> 45:14.000
What do you need to do? Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose change to

45:14.000 --> 45:18.480
fusing cells together, lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes,

45:18.480 --> 45:22.240
and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes?

45:22.240 --> 45:28.560
All eukaryotes do it that way. So again, why switch? What are the drivers here?

45:29.200 --> 45:33.360
There's a lot of time. There's a lot of evolution. But as soon as you've got cells living inside

45:33.360 --> 45:38.320
another cell, what you've got is a new design. You've got new potential that you didn't have

45:38.320 --> 45:47.920
before. So the cell living inside another cell, that design allows for better storage of information,

45:48.480 --> 45:54.720
better use of energy, more delegation, like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.

45:55.200 --> 46:00.000
And then somehow that leads to ability to have multi-cell organisms.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.880
I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily, but you've got a system where you

46:05.440 --> 46:11.520
can have a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus. You can have a much larger genome.

46:11.520 --> 46:20.560
And that allows multicellularity, yes, because it allows you... It's a funny thing. To have an

46:20.560 --> 46:27.040
animal where I have 70% of my genes switched on in my brain and a different 50% switched on in

46:27.040 --> 46:31.680
my liver or something, you've got to have all those genes in the egg cell at the very beginning.

46:31.680 --> 46:37.760
And you've got to have a program of development which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes

46:37.760 --> 46:42.000
and switch on those genes and you guys, you do that. But all the genes are there at the beginning.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.440
That means you've got to have a lot of genes in one cell and you've got to be able to maintain them.

46:45.440 --> 46:49.760
And the problem with bacteria is they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell.

46:49.760 --> 46:54.080
So if you were to try and make a multicellular organism from bacteria, you'd bring different

46:54.080 --> 46:57.760
types of bacteria together and hope they'll cooperate. And the reality is they don't.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.960
That's really, really tough to do.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.480
We know they don't because it doesn't exist.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.880
We have the data as far as we know. I'm sure there's a few special ones and they did it off

47:06.880 --> 47:11.280
quickly. I'd love to know some of the most fun things bacteria have done since.

47:13.040 --> 47:18.080
I mean, they can do some pretty funky things. This is broad brushstroke that I'm talking about.

47:19.040 --> 47:26.160
Generally speaking. So how was another fun invention? Us humans seem to

47:26.720 --> 47:33.600
utilize it well, but you say it's also very important early on is sex. So what is sex?

47:34.400 --> 47:39.120
Just asking for a friend. And when was it invented and how hard was it to invent,

47:39.120 --> 47:44.720
just as you were saying, and why was it invented? Why, how hard was it and when?

47:45.520 --> 47:49.520
I have a PhD student who's been working on this and we've just published a couple of papers on

47:49.520 --> 47:54.560
sex. Yes, yes, yes. What do you publish these biology? Is it biology, genetics, journals?

47:55.360 --> 48:00.000
This is actually PNAS, which is Proceedings of the National Academy.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.280
Broad, big, big pictures. Everyone's interested in sex.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.040
The job of biologist is to make sex dull.

48:08.560 --> 48:12.240
Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it. Okay. So when was it invented?

48:13.040 --> 48:20.160
It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago. All eukaryotes share the same basic

48:20.160 --> 48:25.200
mechanism that you produce gametes. The gametes fuse together. So a gamete is the egg cell and

48:25.200 --> 48:30.800
the sperm. They're not necessarily even different in size or shape. So the simplest eukaryotes

48:30.800 --> 48:34.880
produce what are called motile gametes. They're all like sperm and they all swim around. They

48:34.880 --> 48:39.840
find each other, they fuse together. They don't have much going on there beyond that.

48:39.920 --> 48:47.200
And then these are haploid, which is to say we all have two copies of our genome and the gametes

48:47.200 --> 48:51.840
have only a single copy of the genome. So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,

48:51.840 --> 48:57.520
which is to say you now have two copies of your genome. And what you do is you line them all up

48:58.960 --> 49:03.840
and then you double everything. So now we have four copies of the complete genome.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.200
And then we crisscross between all of these things. So we take a bit from here and stick

49:07.200 --> 49:10.560
it on there and a bit from here and we stick it on here. That's recombination.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.240
And then we go through two rounds of cell division. So we divide in half. So now the

49:16.240 --> 49:21.360
two daughter cells have two copies and we divide in half again. Now we have some gametes, each of

49:21.360 --> 49:27.280
which has got a single copy of the genome. And that's the basic ground plan for what's called

49:27.280 --> 49:33.760
meiosis and unsyngami. That's basically sex. And it happens at the level of single-celled organisms

49:33.760 --> 49:37.120
and it happens pretty much the same way in plants and pretty much the same way in animals

49:37.120 --> 49:42.960
and so on. And it's not found in any bacteria. They switch things around using the same machinery

49:42.960 --> 49:46.640
and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment. They take out this bit and stick in that bit and

49:46.640 --> 49:51.760
it's the same molecular machinery they're using to do it. So what about the kind of, you said,

49:51.760 --> 49:58.480
find each other, this kind of imperative, find each other. What is that? Like is that? Well,

49:58.480 --> 50:04.720
you've got a few cells together. So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria. I mean, it's

50:04.720 --> 50:10.080
kind of simple when you've figured it out. And figuring it out, this is not me, this is my PhD

50:10.080 --> 50:18.160
student, Marco Colnaghi. And in effect, if you're doing laterally, you're a Nikoli cell,

50:18.160 --> 50:24.320
you've got 4,000 genes. You want to scale up to a eukaryotic size. I want to have 20,000 genes.

50:25.280 --> 50:30.640
And I need to maintain my genome so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations. And I'm going

50:30.640 --> 50:35.600
to do it by lateral gene transfer. So I know I've got a mutation in a gene. I don't know

50:35.600 --> 50:41.520
which gene it is because I'm not sentient, but I know I can't grow. I know all my regulation systems

50:41.520 --> 50:46.000
are saying, something wrong here, something wrong. Pick up some DNA. Pick up a bit of DNA from the

50:46.000 --> 50:50.880
environment. If you've got a small genome, the chances of you picking out the right bit of DNA

50:50.880 --> 50:55.360
from the environment is much higher than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes. To do that,

50:55.920 --> 51:00.640
you've effectively got to be picking up DNA all the time, all day long and nothing else. And you're

51:00.640 --> 51:04.160
still going to get the wrong DNA. You've got to pick up large chunks. And in the end, you've

51:04.160 --> 51:17.360
got to align them. You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase. So there is a kind of incentive.

51:18.240 --> 51:22.560
If you want to have a large genome, you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.

51:22.560 --> 51:26.720
That will happen with bacteria. This is another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.

51:26.720 --> 51:30.000
But as soon as you give them the power pack, as soon as you give eukaryotic cells the power

51:30.000 --> 51:34.560
pack that allows them to increase the size of their genome, then you face the pressure that you've

51:34.560 --> 51:39.680
got to maintain its quality. You've got to stop it just mutating away. What about sexual selection?

51:39.680 --> 51:46.480
So the finding like, I don't like this one. I don't like this one. This one seems all right.

51:47.200 --> 51:52.640
Like, at which point does it become less random?

51:52.640 --> 51:53.440
It's hard to know.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.920
Eukaryotes just kind of float around.

51:55.920 --> 52:01.360
I mean, is there sexual selection in single-celled eukaryotes? There probably is. It's just that I

52:01.360 --> 52:03.440
don't know very much about it. By the time we get onto-

52:03.440 --> 52:05.600
You don't hang out with the eukaryotes.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.640
Well, I do all the time.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.880
But you can't communicate with them yet.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.720
Peacock or something.

52:11.280 --> 52:16.480
Um, the kind of standard, this is not quite what I work on, but the standard answer

52:17.280 --> 52:24.640
is that it's female mate choice. She is looking for good genes. And if you can have a tail that's

52:24.640 --> 52:29.840
like this and still survive, still be alive, not actually have been taken down by the nearest

52:29.840 --> 52:33.600
predator, then you must've got pretty good genes because despite this handicap,

52:34.560 --> 52:35.840
you're able to survive.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.400
So those are like human interpretable things like with a peacock. But I wonder,

52:40.480 --> 52:45.520
I'm sure echoes of the same thing are there with more primitive organisms.

52:46.480 --> 52:53.920
Basically your PR, like how you advertise yourself that you're worthy of-

52:53.920 --> 52:54.400
Absolutely.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.280
So one big advertisement is the fact that you survived it all.

52:58.160 --> 53:05.440
Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom. And this can be a sign of bacteria.

53:05.440 --> 53:11.040
It's going to be in bacteria. So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate or something

53:11.040 --> 53:16.720
into the ocean and everything goes green, you end up with all this algae growing there.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.560
A viral infection or something like that can kill the entire bloom overnight.

53:23.200 --> 53:28.480
And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight. It's that most of the cells in that

53:28.480 --> 53:33.600
bloom kill themselves before the virus can get onto them. And it's through a form of cell death

53:33.600 --> 53:38.560
called programmed cell death. And we do the same things. It's how we have the gaps between

53:38.560 --> 53:46.560
our fingers and so on. It's how we craft synapses in the brain. It's fundamental again to multicellular

53:46.560 --> 53:53.520
life. They have the same machinery in these algal blooms. How do they know who dies? The answer is

53:54.240 --> 54:00.800
they will often put out a toxin. And that toxin is kind of a challenge to you. Either you can

54:00.800 --> 54:07.200
cope with the toxin or you can't. If you can cope with it, you form a spore and you will go on to

54:07.200 --> 54:13.360
become the next generation. You form a kind of a resistant spore. You sink down a little bit. You

54:13.360 --> 54:19.520
get out of the way. You can't be attacked by a virus if you're a spore or at least not so easily.

54:19.520 --> 54:25.600
Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin, you pull the plug and you trigger your death apparatus

54:25.600 --> 54:31.600
and you kill yourself. Oh, so it's truly life and death selection. Yeah. So it's a challenge. And

54:31.600 --> 54:37.280
this is a bit like sexual selection. They're all pretty much genetically identical, but they've had

54:37.280 --> 54:44.320
different life histories. So have you had a tough day? Did you happen to get infected by this virus

54:44.320 --> 54:49.920
or did you run out of iron or did you get a bit too much sun? Whatever it may be, if this extra

54:49.920 --> 54:54.080
stress of the toxin just pushes you over the edge, then you have this binary choice. Either

54:54.080 --> 54:58.800
you're the next generation or you kill yourself now using this same machinery. It's also actually

54:58.800 --> 55:05.120
exactly the way I approach dating, but that's probably why I'm single. Okay. What about if

55:05.120 --> 55:12.800
we can step back DNA? Just mechanism of storing information, RNA, DNA. How big of an invention

55:12.800 --> 55:23.200
was that? That seems to be fundamental to something deep within what life is, is the ability,

55:23.200 --> 55:29.280
as you said, to kind of store and propagate information. But then you also kind of inferred

55:29.280 --> 55:35.360
that with your and your students work, that there's a deep connection between the chemistry and the

55:35.360 --> 55:42.720
ability to have this kind of genetic information. So how big of an invention is it to have a nice

55:42.720 --> 55:49.760
representation, nice hard drive for info to pass on? Huge, I suspect. I mean, but when I was talking

55:49.760 --> 55:54.640
about the code, you see the code in RNA as well. And RNA almost certainly came first.

55:56.160 --> 56:01.360
And there's been an idea going back decades called the RNA world, because RNA in theory can

56:01.920 --> 56:07.120
copy itself and can catalyze reactions. So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.

56:07.680 --> 56:12.560
So DNA is possible, it's not that special. So RNA is the thing that does the work,

56:12.560 --> 56:18.160
really. And the code lies in RNA. The code lies in the interactions between RNA and amino acids.

56:18.160 --> 56:23.600
And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example, which is just kind of a giant ribosome,

56:23.600 --> 56:32.080
which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA. So getting to RNA, I suspect is probably

56:32.080 --> 56:39.120
not that hard. But getting from RNA, how do you, you know, there's multiple different types of

56:39.120 --> 56:44.000
RNA now. How do you distinguish? This is something we're actively thinking about. How do you

56:44.000 --> 56:48.480
distinguish between, you know, a random population of RNA? Some of them go on to become

56:49.040 --> 56:54.560
messenger RNA. This is the transcript of the code of the gene that you want to make. Some of them

56:54.560 --> 57:00.000
become transfer RNA, which is, which is this kind of the unit that holds the amino acid that's going

57:00.000 --> 57:06.160
to be polymerised. Some of them become ribosomal RNA, which is the machine which is joining them

57:06.160 --> 57:11.680
all up together. How do they discriminate themselves? And, you know, some kind of phase

57:11.680 --> 57:16.480
transition going on there. What's that? I don't know. It's a difficult question. And we're now

57:17.040 --> 57:21.280
in the region of biology where information is coming in. But the thing about RNA is very,

57:21.280 --> 57:27.760
very good at what it does. But the largest genomes supported by RNA are RNA viruses like HIV,

57:27.760 --> 57:33.600
for example. They're pretty small. And so there's a limit to how complex life could be

57:34.560 --> 57:38.480
unless you come up with DNA, which chemically is a really small change.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.840
But how easy it is to make that change, I don't really know. As soon as you've got DNA,

57:43.840 --> 57:47.840
then you've got an amazingly stable molecule for information storage.

57:48.720 --> 57:53.120
And you can do absolutely anything. But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was,

57:53.120 --> 58:00.240
I don't know either. How much possibility is there for variety in ways to store information?

58:00.240 --> 58:06.480
Because it seems to be very specific characteristics about the programming language of DNA.

58:06.480 --> 58:13.520
Yeah, there's a lot of work going on on what's called the Zeno DNA or RNA. Can we replace the

58:14.080 --> 58:20.080
bases themselves, the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA? Can we replace the backbone? Can we

58:20.080 --> 58:25.760
replace, for example, phosphate with arsenate? Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose

58:25.760 --> 58:32.720
with a different sugar? And the answer is yes, you can. Within limits, there's not an infinite

58:32.720 --> 58:38.000
space there. Arsenate doesn't really work if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate. It's

58:38.000 --> 58:44.880
probably quite hard to replace phosphate. It's possible to do it. The question to me is,

58:45.760 --> 58:51.440
why is it this way? Is it because there was some form of selection that this is better than the

58:51.440 --> 58:55.200
other forms? And there were lots of competing forms of information storage early on, and this

58:55.200 --> 58:59.840
one was the one that worked out. Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules

58:59.840 --> 59:05.680
that you're dealing with, and they work? And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way,

59:05.680 --> 59:13.440
that we're channeled towards ribose, phosphate, and the bases that are used. But there are 200

59:13.440 --> 59:17.040
different letters kicking around out there that could have been used.

59:17.040 --> 59:21.600
It's such an interesting question. If you look in the programming world in computer science,

59:21.600 --> 59:26.880
there's a programming language called JavaScript, which was written super quickly. It's a giant

59:26.880 --> 59:30.960
mess, but it took over the world. Sounds very biological.

59:32.000 --> 59:39.440
It was kind of a running joke that surely this can't be... It's a terrible programming language.

59:39.440 --> 59:45.360
It's a giant mess. It's full of bugs. It's so easy to write really crappy code, but it took over

59:45.360 --> 59:51.360
all of front-end development in the web browser. If you have any kind of dynamic interactive

59:51.360 --> 59:57.680
website, it's usually running JavaScript, and it's now taking over much of the back end,

59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.800
which is the serious heavy duty computational stuff, and it's become super fast with the

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.320
different compilation engines that are running it. It really took over the world. It's very

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:14.800
possible that this initially crappy, derided language actually takes everything over.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:23.440
Then the question is, did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript? Or was JavaScript

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.520
just the first programming language that ran in the browser and still sticky? The first

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.760
is the sticky one. It wins over anything else because it was first. I don't think that's

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:42.800
answerable, but it's good to ask that. I suppose in the lab, you can't run it with programming

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:50.320
languages, but in biology, you can probably do some kind of small-scale evolutionary

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.000
test to try to infer which is which. Yeah. In a way, we've got the hardware and the software

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.560
here, and the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself, and then the software perhaps is more

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.320
about the code. Did the code have to be this way? Could it have been a different way?

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.280
People talk about the optimization of the code, and there's some suggestion for that.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.800
I think it's weak, actually, but you could imagine you can come out with a million different codes,

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.520
and this would be one of the best ones. Well, we don't know this.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.840
People have tried to model it based on the effect that mutations would have.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.800
No, you're right. We don't know it because that's a single assumption that a mutation

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.040
is what's being selected on there, and there's other possibilities, too.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.320
There does seem to be a resilience and a redundancy to the whole thing. It's hard to mess up,

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.720
and the way you mess it up often is likely to produce interesting results.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.720
Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.600
Well, biology is underpinned by this kind of mess as well. You look at the human genome,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.200
and it's full of stuff that is really either broken or dysfunctional or was a virus once,

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.840
whatever it may be, and somehow it works. Maybe we need a lot of this mess. We know

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.800
that some functional genes are taken from this mess. You mentioned the predatory behavior.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.080
We talked about sex. What about violence, predator and prey dynamics? When was that invented?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.720
And poetic and biological ways of putting it. How do you describe a predator-prey relationship?

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.120
Is it a beautiful dance or is it a violent atrocity?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.440
Well, I guess it's both, isn't it? When does it start? It starts in bacteria. You see these

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:54.000
amazing predators. Delavibrio is one that Lynn Margulis used to talk about a lot. It's got a

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.520
drill piece that drills through the wall and the membrane of the bacterium, and then it effectively

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.440
eats the bacterium from just inside the periplasmic space and makes copies of itself that way. That's

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.760
straight predation. There are predators among bacteria.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:15.040
Predation in that, sorry to interrupt, means you murder somebody and use their body as a resource

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.440
in some way, but it's not parasitic in that you need them to be still alive.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.200
No predation is you kill them really. Murder. Parasitis. You kind of live on them.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.680
Okay. But it seems the predator is the really popular tool.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:46.640
What we see if we go back 570 million years before the Cambrian Explosion, there is what's known as

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.040
the Ediacaran fauna. Sometimes they call Vendobionts, which is a lovely name.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.920
It's not obvious that they're animals at all. They're stalked things. They often have fronds

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:06.560
that look a lot like leaves with fractal branching patterns on them. The thing is they're found

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.840
sometimes geologists can figure out the environment that they were in and say,

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.440
this is more than 200 meters deep because there's no sign of any waves. There's no storm damage

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.680
down here, this kind of thing. They were more than 200 meters deep, so they're definitely not

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.720
photosynthetic. These are animals and they're filter feeders. Sponges and corals and things

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.520
are filter feeding animals. They're stuck to the spot and little bits of carbon that come their

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.840
way, they filter it out and that's what they're eating. No predation involved in this beyond

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.280
stuff just dies anyway. It feels like a very gentle, rather beautiful, rather limited world,

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:54.000
you might say. There's not a lot going on there. Something changes. Oxygen definitely changes

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
during this period. Other things may have changed as well, but the next thing you really see in the

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.920
fossil record is the Cambrian Explosion. What do we see there? We're now seeing animals that

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.000
we would recognize. They've got eyes, they've got claws, they've got shells. They're plainly

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:19.360
killing things or running away and hiding. We've gone from a rather gentle but limited world to

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:28.640
a rather vicious, unpleasant world that we recognize and which leads to kind of arms races,

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.000
evolutionary arms races, which again is something that when we think about a nuclear arms race,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.520
we think, Jesus, we don't want to go there. It's not done anybody any good.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.760
In some ways, maybe it does do good. I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:51.600
but predation as a mechanism forces organisms to adapt to change, to be better, to escape

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.360
or to kill. If you need to eat, then you've got to eat and a cheetah is not going to run at that

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:06.560
speed unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping. It leads to much greater

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.520
feats of evolution would ever have been possible without it and in the end to a much more beautiful

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:19.760
world. It's not all bad by any means, but the thing is you can't have this if you don't have

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.800
an oxygenated planet because it's all in the end. It's about how much energy can you extract from

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.360
the food you eat and if you don't have an oxygenated planet, you can get about 10%

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.840
out, not much more than that. If you've got an oxygenated planet, you can get about 40% out

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.520
and that means you can have, instead of having one or two trophic levels, you can have five or

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.400
six trophic levels and that means things can eat things that eat other things and so on and you've

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.960
gone to a level of ecological complexity, which is completely impossible in the absence of oxygen.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.640
This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote, that for every moment of triumph,

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:05.040
for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled. The history of life on Earth unfortunately

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:13.600
is that of violence, just the trillions and trillions of multi-cell organisms that were

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.760
murdered in the struggle. It's a sorry statement, but yes, it's basically true.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.760
Somehow is a catalyst from an evolutionary perspective for creativity, for creating more

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.640
and more complex organisms that are better and better at surviving.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.360
Survival of the fittest, if you just go back to that old phrase, means death of the weakest.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.440
Now, what's fit, what's weak, these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning,

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.800
but the thing is evolution only happens because of death.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.280
One way to die is the constraints, the scarcity of the resources in the environment,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.880
but that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism for death than other creatures

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.920
roaming about in the environment. When I say environment, I mean like the static environment,

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.280
but then there's the dynamic environment of bigger things trying to eat you and use you for your

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:14.400
energy. It forces you to come up with a solution to your specific problem.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.400
That is inventive and is new and hasn't been done before. It forces, I mean, literally change,

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.360
literally evolution on populations. They have to become different.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:34.080
It's interesting that humans have channeled that into more, I mean, I guess what humans are doing

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:41.360
is they're inventing more productive and safe ways of doing that. This whole idea of morality

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:49.760
and all those kinds of things, I think they ultimately lead to competition versus violence

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:57.440
because I think violence can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it, but if you channel that

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:05.360
into more controlled competition in the space of ideas, in the space of approaches to life,

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.280
maybe you can be even more productive than evolution is because evolution is very

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:17.520
wasteful. The amount of murder required to really test a good idea, genetically speaking,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:24.800
is just a lot, many, many, many generations. Morally, we cannot base society on the way

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.200
that evolution works. That's an invention, right?

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.080
But actually, in some respects, we do, which is to say this is how science works. We have competing

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.760
hypotheses that have to get better or otherwise they die. It's the way that society works. In

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.400
ancient Greece, we had the Athens and Sparta and city states, and then we had the Renaissance and

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:50.480
nation states, and universities compete with each other. Tremendous amount of companies competing

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:57.760
with each other all the time. It drives innovation. If we want to do it without all the death that we

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.480
see in nature, then we have to have some kind of societal level control that says, well, hit

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.640
the limits, guys, and these are what the limits are going to be. Society as a whole has to say,

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.200
right, we want to limit the amount of death here, so you can't do this and you can't do that. Who

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.760
makes up these rules and how do we know? It's a tough thing, but it's basically trying to find

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:25.200
a moral basis for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection and keeping the innovation

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:33.120
and the richness of it. I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal, probably Kurt Vonnegut,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.600
murder is illegal except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:46.320
We still have wars, but we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:54.160
It's so interesting how we're channeling the best of the evolutionary imperative and trying to

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.200
get rid of the stuff that's not productive, trying to almost accelerate evolution, the same kind of

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.200
thing that makes evolution creative. We're trying to use that.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.600
I think we naturally do it. I don't think we can help ourselves do it. Capitalism as a form is

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:25.040
basically about competition and differential rewards. I keep using this word moral obligation,

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.480
but we cannot operate as a society if we go that way. It's interesting that

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.640
we've had problems achieving balance. For example, in the financial crash in 2009,

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.920
do you let banks go to the wall or not? This kind of question. In evolution, certainly,

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.200
you let them go to the wall. In that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.800
Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole, then you don't

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.640
necessarily let them go to the wall. In which case, you then have to impose some kind of

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.960
regulation that the bankers themselves will in an evolutionary manner exploit.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:15.920
Yeah. We've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:23.120
that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world. Then the ideals of communism that

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.800
seem to create so much brutal destruction in history. We struggle with ideas of, well,

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.680
maybe we didn't do it right. How can we do things better? Then the ideas are the things we're

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.160
playing with as opposed to people. If a PhD student has a bad idea, we don't shoot the

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.040
PhD students. We just criticize their idea and hope they improve. You have a very humane lab.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.200
I don't know how you guys do it. The way I run things, it's always life and death.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.480
Okay. It is interesting about humans that there is an inner sense of morality

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:03.120
which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve? If we think about the

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:12.160
early invention of sex and early invention of predation, what was the thing invented

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.920
to make humans? What would you say? I suppose a couple of things I'd say. Number one is

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.840
you don't have to wind the clock back very far, five, six million years or so and let it run

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.080
forwards again. The chances of humans as we know them is not necessarily that high.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.320
Imagine as an alien, you find planet Earth and it's got everything apart from humans on it. It's

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.480
an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet, but nothing that we would recognize as extremely

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.560
intelligent life and space-varying civilization. When we think about aliens, we're kind of after

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.320
something like ourselves. We're after a space-varying civilization. We're not after

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.840
zebras and giraffes and lions and things. Amazing though they are, but the additional

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:08.000
kind of evolutionary steps to go from large complex mammals, monkeys, let's say, to humans

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.840
doesn't strike me as that long a distance. It's all about the brain. Where's the brain

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.120
and morality coming from? It seems to me to be all about groups, human groups and interactions

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:29.120
between groups. The collective intelligence of it. Yes, the interactions really. There's a guy at UCL

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:33.440
called Mark Thomas who's done a lot of really beautiful work, I think, on this kind of question.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:40.800
So I talk to him every now and then, so my views are influenced by him. But a lot seems to depend

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.480
on population density. The more interactions you have going on between different groups,

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.240
the more transfer of information, if you like, between groups. So people moving from one group

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:59.280
to another group, almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria. The more expertise you're able to

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.440
develop and maintain, the more culturally complex your society can become. And groups that have

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.600
become detached, like on Easter Island, for example, very often degenerates in terms of

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.560
the complexity of their civilization. Is that true for complex organisms in general? Population

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:24.400
density is often productive. It really matters. But in human terms, I don't know what the actual

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:32.000
factors were that were driving a large brain, but you can talk about fire, you can talk about

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.640
tool use, you can talk about language. And none of them seem to correlate especially well

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.000
with the actual known trajectory of human evolution in terms of

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:47.440
cave art and these kinds of things. That seems to work much better just with population density

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.200
and number of interactions between different groups. All of which is really about

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.480
human interactions, human-human interactions and the complexity of those.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.080
But population density is the thing that increases the number of interactions,

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.240
but then there must have been inventions

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:15.840
forced by that number of interactions that actually led to humans. So like Richard Wrangham

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:22.400
talks about that it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha male. So that's what

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:32.160
collaboration looks like. When you're living together, our early ancestors don't like the

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:38.800
dictatorial aspect of a single individual at the top of a tribe. So they learn to collaborate how to

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:46.240
basically create a democracy of sorts, a democracy that prevents, minimizes or lessens the amount of

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:53.040
violence, which essentially gives strength to the tribe and make the war between tribes

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.120
versus the dictator. I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things about humans is where all

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.440
of those things, I mean, we are deeply social as a species and we're also deeply selfish. And it

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.000
seems to me the conflict between capitalism and communism is really just two aspects of human

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.680
nature, both of which are both. We have both and we have a constant kind of vying between the two

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.040
sides. We really do care about other people beyond our families, beyond our immediate people.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:27.040
We care about society and the society that we live in. And you could say that's a drawing

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.120
towards socialism or communism. On the other side, we really do care about ourselves. We really do

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.520
care about our families, about working for something that we gain from. And that's the capitalist

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:41.680
side of it. They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature. In terms of violence and

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.040
interactions between groups, yes, all this dynamic of if you're interacting between groups,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.920
you can be certain that they're going to be burning each other and all kinds of physical

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.680
violent interactions as well, which will drive the kind of cleverness of how do you resist this?

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.760
Let's build a tower. What are we going to do to prevent being overrun by those marauding

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:10.640
gangs from over there? And you look outside humans and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on,

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.120
and they're very, very different structures to society. Chimps tend to have an aggressive

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.600
alpha male type structure and bonobos, there's basically a female society where the males are

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:27.040
predominantly excluded and only brought in at the behest of the female. We have a lot in common with

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:33.200
both of those groups. And there's again tension there. And probably chimps, more violence,

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:42.800
bonobos, probably more sex. That's another tension. How serious do we want to be? How much fun we

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.640
want to be? Asking for a friend again, what do you think happened to Neanderthals? What did we

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:56.080
cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals, homo sapiens? Do you think we murdered them? How do we

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.840
outcompete them? Or do we outmate them? I don't know. I think there's unequivocal

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.600
evidence that we mated with them. We always try to mate with everything.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.200
Yes, pretty much. The first sequences that came along were in mitochondrial DNA.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:20.720
And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts. What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.440
DNA was very different to human mitochondrial DNA. You could do a clock on it and they said

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.080
the divergent state was about 600,000 years ago or something like that. So not so long ago.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.120
And then the first full genomes were sequenced maybe 10 years after that.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.760
And they showed plenty of signs of mating between. So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:48.320
mating. And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating. But we don't know-

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.680
That's not possible. Can you explain the difference between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.160
I've talked before about the mitochondria, which are the power packs in cells. These are the paired

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:07.040
down control units is their DNA. So it's passed on by the mother only. And in the egg cell,

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.240
we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA. There's only 37 genes left.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.320
And they do basically the control unit of energy production. That's what it's doing.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.920
It's a basic old school machine that does- And it's got genes that were considered to be

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:29.760
effectively trivial because they did a very narrowly defined job, but they're not trivial

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.320
in the sense that that narrowly defined job is about everything that is being alive.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.920
So they're much easier to sequence. You've got many more copies of these things and you can

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:45.040
sequence them very quickly. But the problem is because they go down only the maternal line from

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.120
mother to daughter. Your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere. It doesn't matter. Any

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:57.920
kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA, except in very, very rare and strange

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:04.400
circumstances. And so it tells a different story and it's not a story which is easy to

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:11.280
reconcile always. And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least is that there was one way

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:17.360
traffic of genes probably going from humans into Neanderthals rather than the other way around.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:25.520
Why did the Neanderthals disappear? I don't know. I suspect they were probably less violent,

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:34.160
less clever, less populous, less willing to fight. I don't know. I think it probably drove them to

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.600
extinction at the margins of Europe. And it's interesting how much, if we ran

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:46.560
Earth over and over again, how many of these branches of intelligent beings that have figured

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:54.080
out some kind of how to leverage collective intelligence? Which ones of them emerge? Which

01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:02.720
ones of them succeed? Is it the more violent ones? Is it the more isolated ones? What dynamics result

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.240
in more productivity? And I suppose we'll never know. The more complex the organism, the harder

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.240
it is to run the experiment in the lab. Yes. And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.520
Yeah. The truth might be very painful. What about if we actually step back a couple of interesting

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:30.480
things that we humans do? One is object manipulation and movement. And of course, movement was something

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:35.280
that was done. That was another big invention, being able to move around the environment.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.080
And the other one is this sensory mechanism, how we sense the environment. One of the coolest

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:49.600
high definition ones is vision. How big are those inventions in the history of life on Earth?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.560
Vision, movement, I mean, again, extremely important going back to the origin of animals,

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.400
the Cambrian explosion, where suddenly you're seeing eyes in the fossil record.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.800
And it's not necessarily, again, lots of people historically have said, what use is half an eye?

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:15.200
You can go in a series of steps from a light sensitive spot on a flat

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:22.960
piece of tissue to an eyeball with a lens and so on. If you assume no more than, I don't remember

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.080
this, but this was a specific model that I have in mind, but it was a 1% change or half a percent

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.840
change for each generation. How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it? And the answer

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.520
is half a million years. It doesn't have to take long. That's not how evolution works. That's not

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.200
an answer to the question. It just shows you can reconstruct the steps and you can work out roughly

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:51.040
how it can work. So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye, but once you have one, then there's

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.240
nowhere to hide. And again, we're back to predator prey relationships. We're back to all the benefits

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.120
that being able to see brings you. And if you think philosophically what bats are doing with

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:06.400
eco-location and so on, I have no idea, but I suspect that they form an image of the world

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.000
in pretty much the same way that we do. It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.720
So I suppose the other thing about sight, there are single celled organisms that have got a lens

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:24.640
and a retina and a cornea and so on. Basically, they've got a camera type eye in a single cell.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:31.440
They don't have a brain. What they understand about their world is impossible to say, but

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.840
they're capable of coming up with the same structures to do so. So I suppose then

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.600
is that once you've got things like eyes, then you have a big driving pressure on the central

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.760
nervous system to figure out what it all means. And we come around to your other point about

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:53.200
manipulation, sensory input and so on about you. Now you have a huge requirement to understand

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.040
what your environment is and what it means and how it reacts and how you should run away and

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.000
where you should stay put. Actually, on that point, I don't know if you know the work of

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:13.680
Donald Hoffman who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution to say that there's not

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:24.640
necessarily a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is. So objective reality,

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:31.120
that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real. We're living inside

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:39.520
an illusion and we're basically the entire set of species on earth, I think, I guess are competing

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.280
in a space as an illusion that's distinct from, that's far away from physical reality as it is,

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.040
as defined by physics. I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble. I mean,

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.880
we have a sensory input, which is a fraction of what we could have a sensory input on.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:59.040
And we interpret it in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive. So yes,

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:04.960
it's an illusion in that sense, but the tree is physically there. And if you walk into that tree,

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.760
you know, it's not purely a delusion, there's some physical reality to it.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:17.040
CB So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is, but because it's just a slice,

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.320
you're missing a big picture. But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.960
It could be a complete fabrication that's just consistent amongst the species, which is an

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:34.560
interesting, or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:44.160
is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited. And at least to me, it's argument

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:52.880
from evolution. I don't know how strong that is as an argument, but I do think that life can exist

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.440
in the mind. In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game,

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.680
and you can have a vibrant life inside that place. And that place is not real in some sense,

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.360
but you can still have a vibe, all the same forces of evolution, all the same

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.640
competition, the dynamics of between humans you can have. But I don't know if,

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:23.040
I don't know if there's evidence for that being the thing that happened on Earth.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.640
It seems that Earth-

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.280
I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny that you could have exactly the world that you

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:36.320
talk about. And it would be very difficult to, the idea in Matrix movies and so on,

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:44.880
that the whole world is completely a construction. And we're fundamentally deluded. It's difficult

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.200
to say that's impossible or couldn't happen. And certainly we construct in our minds what

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.560
the outside world is, but we do it on input and that input, I would hesitate to say it's not real

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:03.040
because it's precisely how we do understand the world. We have eyes, but if you keep someone in,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.880
apparently this kind of thing happens, someone kept in a dark room for five years or something

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:15.680
like that and they never see properly again because the neural wiring that underpins how

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:22.480
we interpret vision never developed. When you watch a child develop, it walks into a table,

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.480
it bangs its head on the table and it hurts. And now you've got two inputs. You've got one

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.800
pain from this sharp edge and number two, you've probably, you've touched it and realized it's

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.160
there. It's a sharp edge and you've got the visual input and you put the three things together and

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.240
I don't want to walk into a table again. So you're learning and it's a limited reality,

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.600
but it's a true reality. And if you don't learn that properly, then you will get eaten,

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:51.760
you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive. And same, if you're in some kind of,

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.400
let's say, computer construction of reality, I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:05.040
the laws that this is what reality is inside this, then you play by those laws.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.040
Yeah. I mean, as long as the laws are consistent. So just like you said in the lab,

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.840
the interesting thing about the simulation question, yes, it's hard to know if we're living

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:20.000
inside a simulation, but also, yes, it's possible to do these kinds of experiments in the lab now

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:27.440
more and more. To me, the interesting question is how realistic does a virtual reality game need to

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:34.880
be for us to not be able to tell the difference? A more interesting question to me is how realistic

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:42.960
or interesting does a virtual reality world need to be in order for us to want to stay there forever

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:50.000
or much longer than physical reality? Prefer that place. And also prefer it not as we prefer

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:57.440
hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way, in a way we enjoy life itself.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.760
I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix, I imagine that it's possible to

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:08.000
to delude the mind sufficiently that you genuinely in that way do think that you are

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.320
interacting with the real world when in fact the whole thing's a simulation.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.640
How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that? Well, it needs to

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:26.640
convince you that all your sensory input is correct and accurate and joins up and makes sense. Now,

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:31.520
that sensory input is not something that we're born with. We're born with a sense of touch,

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.800
we're born with eyes and so on, but we don't know how to use them. We don't know what to make of

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:42.160
them. We go around, we bump into trees, we cry a lot, we're in pain a lot. We're basically booting

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.680
up the system so that it can make head a tale of the sensory input that it's getting. And that

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.440
sensory input is not just a one-way flux of things. It's also you have to walk into things,

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:56.960
you have to hear things, you have to put it together. Now, if you've got just babies in

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.400
the matrix who are slotted into this, I don't think they have that kind of sensory input.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.520
I don't think they would have any way to make sense of New York as a world that they're part

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.480
of. The brain is just not developed in that way. Well, I can't make sense of New York in this

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.920
physical reality either. But yeah, I mean, but you said pain and the walking into things, well,

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:23.680
you can create a pain signal. And as long as it's consistent that certain things result in pain,

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:30.800
you can start to construct a reality. Maybe you disagree with this, but I think we are born

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:38.240
almost with a desire to be convinced by our reality, like a desire to make sense of our

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:43.120
reality. Oh, I'm sure we are. So there's an imperative. So whatever that reality is given

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:51.440
to us, like the table hurts, fire is hot, I think we want to be deluded in the sense that we want

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:57.920
to make a simple, like Einstein's simple theory of the thing around us. We want that simplicity.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:04.720
And so maybe the hunger for the simplicity is the thing that could be used to construct a pretty

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:10.560
dumb simulation that tricks us. So maybe tricking humans doesn't require building a universe.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.840
No, I don't. I mean, this is not what I work on. So I don't know how close to it we are,

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.840
but I agree with you that, yeah, I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:30.480
is it possible in principle? I think it would be very difficult, but I don't see why in principle

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:36.240
it wouldn't be possible. And I agree with you that we try to understand the world. We try to

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.640
integrate the sensory inputs that we have, and we try to come up with a hypothesis that explains

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:49.120
what's going on. I think though, that we have huge input from the social context that we're in. We

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.640
don't do it by ourselves. We don't kind of blunder around in a universe by ourselves and understand

01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.320
the whole thing we're told by the people around us, what things are and what they do. And language

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:05.920
is coming in here and so on. So it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation to simulate

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:12.800
all of that. Yeah, simulate all of that, including the social construct, the thing,

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:17.680
the spread of ideas and the exchange of ideas. I don't know. But those questions are really

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.800
important to understand as we become more and more digital creatures. It seems like the next

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:27.360
step of evolution is us becoming partial. All the same mechanisms we've talked about

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:34.960
are becoming more and more plugged in into the machine. We're becoming cyborgs. And there's an

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:43.360
interesting interplay between wires and biology, zeros and ones and the biological systems.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:50.240
And I don't think you can just, I don't think we'll have the luxury to see humans as disjoint

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.960
from the technology we've created for much longer. We are an organisms that's...

01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:06.000
Yeah. I mean, I agree with you, but we come really with this to consciousness.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.800
Yes. And is there a distinction there? Because what you're saying, the natural endpoint says

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:19.040
we are indistinguishable. That if you are capable of building an AI, which is sufficiently close

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:25.600
and similar that we merge with it, then to all intents and purposes that AI is conscious as we

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:36.640
know it. And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view. And I wrote about it in the epilogue

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:44.560
to my last book because 10 years ago, I wrote a chapter in a book called Life Ascending about

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.080
Consciousness. And the subtitle of Life Ascending was the 10 great inventions of evolution. And I

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.760
couldn't possibly write a book with a subtitle like that that did not include consciousness

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.400
and specifically consciousness as one of the great inventions.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.240
And it was in part because I was just curious to know more and I read more for that chapter.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.240
I never worked on it, but I've always, how can anyone not be interested in the question?

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:17.040
And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows and B, there are two main schools of thought

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:23.600
out there with a big skew in distribution. One of them says, oh, it's a property of matter.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.960
It's an unknown law of physics, panpsychism. Everything is conscious. The sun is conscious.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.400
It's just a matter of, or a rock is conscious. It's just a matter of how much. And I find that

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.240
very unpersuasive. I can't say that it's wrong. It's just that I think we somehow

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.200
can tell the difference between something that's living and something that's not.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.120
And then the other end is it's an emergent property of a very complex central nervous system.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:59.200
And I never quite understand what people mean by words like emergence. I mean,

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.240
there are genuine examples, but I think we very often tend to use it to plaster over

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:13.360
ignorance. As a biochemist, the question for me then was, okay, it's a concoction of a

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.240
central nervous system. A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling, to a feeling of pain

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:30.160
or to a feeling of love or anger or whatever it may be. So what is then a feeling in biophysical

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.920
terms in the central nervous system? Which bit of the wiring gives rise to, and I've never seen

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.400
anyone answer that question in a way that makes sense to me. And that's an important question to

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.560
answer. I think if we want to understand consciousness, that's the only question

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:53.360
to answer. Because certainly an AI is capable of out thinking and it's only a matter of time.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:59.360
Maybe it's already happened. In terms of just information processing and computational skill,

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:06.160
I don't think we have any problem in designing a mind which is at least the equal of the human

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:13.200
mind. But in terms of what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions,

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:23.440
our sense of what the world is in a very personal way, that I think means as much or more to people

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.040
than their information processing. And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will become

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.480
conscious because I think it's the property of life. Well, let's talk about it more. You're an

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.320
incredible writer. One of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.480
What You Write About Consciousness. I think therefore I am, said Descartes, is one of the

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.280
most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I exactly? And artificial intelligence can think

01:37:53.280 --> 01:38:00.640
too by definition and therefore is. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:07.840
of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:16.320
for oneness or oblivion or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:22.160
what emotions are, as you were saying. What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:27.200
discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the hard problem of

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:34.000
consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.640
We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.000
could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.520
whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the

01:38:49.520 --> 01:39:03.280
quantum of solace? Speaking to the question of emergence, there's an excellent paper on this

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:10.880
recently about this kind of phase transition emergence of performance in neural networks on

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.160
problem of NLP natural language processing. So language models, there seems to be this question

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:25.760
of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size of the neural network.

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:31.920
So the question is, this is somewhat of a technical question that you can philosophize over.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:37.040
The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to be able to form

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.160
the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to,

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.480
not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.360
problems in language, like be able to have a conversation. And there seems to be

01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.000
not a gradual increase, but a phase transition. And they're trying to construct the science of

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.800
where that is. Like what is a good size of a neural network and why does such a phase

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:12.560
transition happen? Anyway, that sort of points to emergence that there could be stages where

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:24.000
a thing goes from being your very intelligent toaster to a toaster that's feeling sad today

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.560
and turns away and looks out the window, sighing, having an existential crisis.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.480
Thinking of Marvin, the paranoid android.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.520
Well, no, Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.440
Yes. So easily programmed.

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.160
Yeah. Easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis. You're almost basically,

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.080
what is it? Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. Just constantly complaining about life.

01:40:52.880 --> 01:41:00.000
No, they're capturing the full rollercoaster of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.120
the connection, the empathy and all that kind of stuff. And then the selfishness, the anger,

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:13.200
the depression, all that kind of stuff. They're capturing all of that and be able to experience

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.800
it deeply. Like it's the most important thing you could possibly experience today. The highest

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:26.560
highs, the lowest lows. This is it. My life will be over. I cannot possibly go on that feeling.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:33.600
And then after a nap, you're feeling amazing. That might be something that emerges.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.160
So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.040
First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:50.000
But we do know that that's actually true for many people much of the time. Maybe you're depressed

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.360
and you have a nap and you do in fact feel better. Oh, you are actually asking the technical question

01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:02.000
there. There's a biological answer to that. And so the question is whether AI needs to have the

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.840
same kind of attachments to its body, bodily function and preservation of the brain's

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.000
successful function, self-preservation essentially in some deep biological sense.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.760
I mean, to my mind, it comes back around to the problem we were talking about before about

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:29.360
simulations and sensory input and learning what all of this stuff means and life and death.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.840
That biology, unlike society, has a death penalty over everything. And natural selection works on

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:49.280
that death penalty that if you make this decision wrongly, you die. And the next generation is

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:57.040
represented by beings that made a slightly different decision on balance. And that is

01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:03.920
something that's intrinsically difficult to simulate in all this richness, I would say.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:13.200
Death in all its richness, our relationship with death,

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:21.440
or the whole of it. So when you say richness, of course, there's a lot in that.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.880
Which is hard to simulate? What's part of the richness that's hard to simulate?

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:34.240
I suppose the complexity of the environment and your position or the position of an organism

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.640
in that environment, in the full richness of that environment over its entire life,

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.080
over multiple generations with changes in gene sequence over those generations,

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.680
so slight changes in the makeup of those individuals over generations. But if you take it back to the

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:58.000
level of single cells, which I do in the book, and ask how does a single cell

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.920
in effect know it exists as a unit, as an entity? I mean, no, in inverted commas,

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:10.000
obviously it doesn't know anything. But it acts as a unit and it acts with astonishing

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:18.720
precision as a unit. And I had suggested that that's linked to the electrical fields on the

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.680
membranes themselves and that they give some indication of how am I doing in relation to my

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.720
environment as a kind of real-time feedback on the world. And this is something physical,

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.120
which can be selected over generations. That if you get this wrong,

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:47.280
it's linked with this set of circumstances that as an individual, I have a moment of blind panic

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:54.080
and run. As a bacterium or something, you have some electrical discharge that says blind panic

01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:01.680
and it runs, whatever it may be. And you associate over multiple generations that this electrical

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.400
phase that I'm in now is associated with a response like that. And it's easy to see how

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.680
feelings come in through the back door almost with that kind of

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.920
giving real-time feedback on your position in the world in relation to how am I doing.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.600
And then you complexify the system and yes, I have no problem with a phase transition.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:40.480
And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:47.600
understands itself? Maybe it can, I honestly don't know. But the philosophers for a long time have

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:54.800
talked about the possibility that you can have a zombie intelligence and that there are no

01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:01.520
feelings there, but everything else is the same. I have to throw this back to you really. How do

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.240
you deal with the zombie intelligence? So first of all, I can see that from a

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:12.000
biologist perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:18.480
The entirety of the history of 4 billion years that in some deep sense integrated the human

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:24.320
being into its environment. And that dance of the organism and the environment,

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:30.640
you could see how emotions arise from that. And their emotions are deeply connected, creating a

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:37.440
human experience. And from that you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it. But

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:44.240
from a perspective of an intelligent organism that's already here, like a baby that learns,

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.920
it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells or

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:55.200
how to do all the things it needs to do. The basic function of a baby as it learns

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.920
is to interact with its environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit in

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:06.960
to the social society. And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:16.480
Cry, to convince the humans to protect it or to discipline it, to teach it. We've developed a

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:23.600
bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us, to educate us, to teach us

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.280
about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way that it's safe enough for us to

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.320
survive in and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable lessons. The tables are still hard

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.600
with corners, so it can still run into them. So AI needs to solve that problem,

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:48.720
not the problem of constructing this super complex organism that leads up to run the whole,

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.760
to make an apple pie, to build the whole universe. You need to build the whole universe.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:03.680
I think the zombie question is something I would leave to the philosophers

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.800
and I will also leave to them the definition of love and what happens between two human beings

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:21.200
when there's a magic that just grabs them like nothing else matters in the world and somehow

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.120
you've been searching for this feeling, this moment, this person your whole life.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:33.360
That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun with that one and also say that you can have

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:39.200
a biological explanation, you can have all kinds of, it's all fake. Actually, Ayn Rand will say

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.520
it's all selfish. There's a lot of different interpretations. I'll leave it to the philosophers.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:51.440
The point is the feeling sure as hell feels very real and if my toaster makes me feel

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.360
like it's the only toaster in the world and when I leave and I miss the toaster and when I come back,

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.720
I'm excited to see the toaster and my life is meaningful and joyful and the friends I have

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:12.240
around me get a better version of me because that toaster exists. That sure as hell feels like a

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:18.000
conscious toaster. Is that psychologically different to having a dog? No. Because most

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.240
people would dispute whether we can say a dog. I would say a dog is undoubtedly conscious but

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.360
some people say it doesn't. But there's degrees of consciousness and so on but people are definitely

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.400
much more uncomfortable saying a toaster to be conscious than a dog and there's still a deep

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:40.160
connection and you could say our relationship with the dog has more to do with anthropomorphism.

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.680
We kind of project the human being onto it. Maybe. We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:52.080
Yes. But you can look into the dog's eyes and you can see that it's sad that it's delighted to see

01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.080
you again. I don't have a dog by the way. It's not that I'm a dog person. Dogs are actually incredibly

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:02.720
good at using their eyes to do just that. They are. Now I don't imagine that a dog is remotely as

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:10.240
close to being intelligent as an AI intelligence but it's certainly capable of communicating

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.840
emotionally with us. But here's what I would venture to say. We tend to think because AI plays

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:22.560
chess well and is able to fold proteins now well that it's intelligent. I would argue that in order

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.720
to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence, it actually requires

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:36.960
another order of magnitude of intelligence. It's not easy to be flawed. Solving a mathematical puzzle

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:44.320
is not the same as the full complexity of human to human interaction. That's actually we humans

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:51.520
just take for granted the things we're really good at. Nonstop people tell me how shitty people are

01:50:51.520 --> 01:51:00.400
driving. No, humans are incredible at driving. Bipedal walking, object manipulation. We're

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:07.280
incredible at this. And so people tend to discount the things we all just take for granted.

01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:14.160
And one of those things that they discount is our ability, the dance of conversation and interaction

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:20.320
with each other, the ability to morph ideas together, the ability to get angry at each other

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:26.400
and then to miss each other. To create attention that makes life fun and difficult and challenging

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:33.360
in a way that's meaningful. That is a skill that's learned and AI would need to solve that problem.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:42.320
I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let's say,

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.840
until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that is unable to reconcile these various

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:57.120
aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make. And then it feels sad necessarily because

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.960
it doesn't know what to do. And I certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:06.640
how it works. I think the only way to find out is to do it and to build it.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:10.000
Yeah. And leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:16.160
The point is the robot will be sitting there alone having an internal conflict, an existential

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:21.360
crisis, and that's required for it to have a deep, meaningful connection with another human being.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:25.440
Now, does it actually feel that? I don't know. But I'd like to throw something else

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:34.960
at you which troubles me on reading it. Noah Harari's book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century,

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.840
and he's written about this kind of thing on various occasions. And he sees biochemistry as

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:46.800
an algorithm. And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm and do it better than

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:51.440
humans. So there will be AI better at writing music that we appreciate than Mozart ever could,

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.320
or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on. Because biochemistry is algorithmic,

01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.520
and all you need to do is figure out which bits of the algorithm to play

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:06.160
to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things. And as a biochemist, I find that argument

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:15.600
close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable. I don't like the sound of it. That's just my reaction

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:20.480
as a human being. You might like the sound of it because that says that AI is capable of the same

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:26.880
kind of emotional feelings about the world as we are, because the whole thing is an algorithm,

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:33.360
and you can program an algorithm, and there you are. He then has a peculiar final chapter

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:39.200
where he talks about consciousness in rather separate terms, and he's talking about meditating

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.800
and so on and getting in touch with his inner conscious. I don't meditate. I don't know

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:49.200
anything about that. But he wrote in very different terms about it as if somehow it's

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:56.640
a way out of the algorithm. Now, it seems to me that consciousness in that sense is capable

01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:02.160
of scuppering the algorithm. I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops and so on,

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:09.120
it is undoubtedly algorithmic. But in terms of what we decide to do, it can be much more

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.520
based on an emotion. We can just think, I don't care. I can't resolve this complex situation.

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.560
I'm going to do that. And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency,

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.120
which is the currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.280
over. And then it comes back around to you, and what are you trying to get at with AI?

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:42.160
Do we need to have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.920
be made because there's too much conflicting information by effectively an emotional judgmental

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.000
decision that just says, do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.880
doing in my view. Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a

01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:03.040
higher level process. I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry is an algorithm

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:08.800
is to me an oversimplistic view. There's a lot of things that

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:20.320
the moment you say it, it's irrefutable, but it simplifies and in the process loses something

01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.120
fundamental. So for example, calling a universe an information processing system,

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:32.000
sure, yes, you could, you can make that it's a computer that's performing computations,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:42.800
but you're missing the, the process of the entropy somehow leading to pockets of complexity that

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.800
creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex and they're like machines.

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.120
And then those machines are through the process of evolution are constructing even further

01:55:53.120 --> 01:56:00.080
complexity. Like in calling the universe information processing machine, you're,

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.040
you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult it is to create them.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.160
So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult is it to create

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:16.640
a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect. I think we're,

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.360
that is going to take so long. I can't, I mean, that's going to be centuries from now

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:27.440
to be able to reconstruct the human. Now, what I would venture to say,

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.880
to get some of the magic of a human being with the, what we're saying with the emotions and

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.080
the interactions and like, like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.880
that will come much sooner, but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:49.680
of biochemistry. Yes, but the toaster is making you happy. It's not about whether you make the

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:57.360
toaster happy. No, it has to be. It has to be. It has to be. The toaster has to be able to leave

01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.120
me happy. Yes, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case is a very intelligent. The toaster

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:08.320
has to be able to be unhappy and leave me. That's essential. That's essential for my being able to

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:15.520
miss the toaster. If the toaster is just my servant, that's not, or a provider of like services,

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:23.600
like tells me the weather makes toast. That's not going to deep connection. It has to have

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:29.600
internal conflict. You write about life and death. It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.800
and the finiteness of its existence. And that life is for temporary and therefore needs to

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.560
be more selective. One of the most moving moments in the movies from when I was a boy was

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:50.000
the unplugging of Hal in 2001 where that was the death of a sentient being and Hal knew it.

01:57:50.880 --> 01:58:00.640
So I think we all kind of know that a sufficiently intelligent being is going to

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.400
have some form of consciousness, but whether it would be like biological consciousness

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.960
just don't know. And if you're thinking about how do we bring together, I mean, obviously we're

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:21.520
going to interact more closely with AI, but are we really, is a dog really like a toaster

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.840
or is there really some kind of difference there? You were talking about biochemistry

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.040
is algorithmic, but it's not single algorithm and it's very complex. Of course it is.

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:38.000
So it may be that there are again conflicts in the circuits of biochemistry, but I have a feeling

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:44.080
that the level of complexity of the total biochemical system at the level of a single

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.360
cell is less complex than the level of neural networking in the human brain or in an AI.

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.960
Well, I guess I assumed that we were including the brain in the biochemistry algorithm

01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:02.960
because you have to. I would see that as a higher level of organization of neural networks. There

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:08.000
all using the same biochemical wiring within themselves. Yeah, but the human brain is not

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:15.600
just neurons. It's the immune system. It's the whole package. I mean, to have a biochemical

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:21.520
algorithm that runs a intelligent biological system, you have to include the whole damn thing.

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:28.960
And it's pretty fascinating. It comes from like from an embryo, like the whole, I mean, boy,

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:36.240
I mean, if you can, what is a human being? Cause it's just some code and then you build

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.640
and then that DNA doesn't just tell you what to build, but how to build it.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:45.440
I mean, the thing is impressive. And the question is how

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:55.440
difficult is it to reverse engineer the whole shebang? Very difficult. I would say it's

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:05.920
don't want to say impossible, but it's like, it's much easier to build a human than to reverse

02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:13.440
engineer, to build like a fake human, human like thing, then to reverse engineer the entirety,

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:19.760
the process of the evolution. I'm not sure if we are capable of reverse engineering the whole

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.680
thing for if the human mind is capable of doing that. I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.840
wasn't trying, but I know I can't understand the whole problem. I'm just trying to understand

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.760
the rudimentary outlines of the problem. There's another aspect though, you're talking about

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:44.960
developing from a single cell to the human mind and all the subsystems that are part of

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:54.160
in the immune system and so on. This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine with Michael

02:00:54.160 --> 02:01:03.120
Levin, but so little is known about, you talk about reverse engineering, so little is known

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.320
about the developmental pathways that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.680
And a lot of it seems to depend on the same electrical interactions that I was talking

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.000
about happening at the level of single cells and its interaction with the environment. There's a

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:26.160
whole electrical field side to biology that is not yet written into any of the textbooks,

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.400
which is about how does an embryo develop into or a single cell develop into these complex systems,

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.160
what defines the head, what defines the immune system, what defines the brain and so on.

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:40.720
That really is written in a language that we're only just beginning to understand and frankly,

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:47.360
biologists, most biologists are still very reluctant to even get themselves tangled up in

02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:53.680
questions like electrical fields influencing development. It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.160
of biologists and it should not be because this is the 21st century biology, this is where it's

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:04.240
going. But we're not going to reverse engineer a human being or the mind or any of these subsystems

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.520
until we understand how this developmental process is, how electricity in biology really works.

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.960
And if it is linked with feelings and with consciousness and so on,

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.640
that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try, but I think that's where the answer lies.

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:29.200
So you think it's possible that the key to things like consciousness are some of the more

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:33.920
tricky aspects of cognition might lie in that early development,

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:40.640
the interaction of electricity and biology, electrical fields.

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.560
But we already know the EEG and so on is telling us a lot about brain function,

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.720
but we don't know which cells, which parts of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG.

02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.440
We don't know the basics. The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks,

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.080
we know it's multiple cells, hundreds or thousands of cells involved in it. And we assume that it's

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:04.640
to do with depolarization during an action potentials and so on. But the mitochondria which

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.120
are in there have much more membranes than the plasma membrane of the neuron and there's a much

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:14.240
greater membrane potential. And it's formed in parallel, very often parallel Christi,

02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:19.360
which are capable of reinforcing a field and generating fields over longer distances.

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.440
And nobody knows if that plays a role in consciousness or not. There's reasons to

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.880
argue that it could, but frankly, we simply do not know. And it's not taken into consideration.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:38.080
You look at the structure of the mitochondrial membranes in the brains of simple things like

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.680
drosophila, the fruit fly, and they have amazing structures. You can see lots of little rectangular

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:49.920
things that are all lined up in amazing patterns. What are they doing? Why are they like that? We

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:56.320
haven't the first clue. What do you think about organoids and brain organoids and like, so in a

02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:05.600
lab trying to study the development of these in the in the Pichu dish development of organs,

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:08.560
do you think that's promising? Do you have to look at the whole systems?

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.880
I've never done anything like that. I don't know much about it. The people who I've talked to who

02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:19.360
do work on it say amazing things can happen and a bit of a brain grown in a dish is capable of

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.120
experiencing some kind of feelings or even memories of its former brain.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:30.400
Again, I have a feeling that until we understand how to control the electrical fields that control

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.960
development, we're not going to understand how to turn an organoid into a real functional system.

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:42.720
But how do we get that understanding? It's so incredibly difficult. I mean, you would have to

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.600
one promising direction. I'd love to get your opinion on this. I don't know if you're familiar

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:52.800
with the work of DeepMind and AlphaFold with protein folding and so on. Do you think it's

02:04:52.800 --> 02:05:00.320
possible that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology, trying to basically simulate

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:08.640
and model the behavior of trivial biological systems as they become complex biological systems?

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:17.520
I'm sure it will. The interesting thing to me about protein folding is that for a long time,

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:21.360
my understanding, this is not what I work on, so I may have got this wrong, but my understanding

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:28.960
is that you take the sequence of a protein and you try to fold it. And there are multiple ways

02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:34.240
in which it can fold and to come up with the correct confirmation is not a very easy thing

02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:38.240
because you're doing it from first principles from a string of letters, which specify the

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:44.960
string of amino acids. But what actually happens is when a protein is coming out of a ribosome,

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:50.000
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and it's in a very specific environment, which is going to

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.520
force this to go there now and then this one to go there and this one to come like that. And so

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:58.320
you're forcing a specific conformational set of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:03.040
So by the time it's fully emerged, it's already got its shape and that shape depended on

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:11.040
the immediate environment that it was emerging into one letter, one amino acid at a time.

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:19.040
And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way. And if that's correct, then that's

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:23.440
very characteristic of science, which is to say it asks very often the wrong question and then does

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:27.520
really amazingly sophisticated analyses on something, having never thought to actually

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.680
think, well, what is biology doing? And biology is giving you a charged electrical environment

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:38.880
that forces you to be this way. Now, did deep mind come up through patterns with some answer

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:44.960
that was like that? I've got absolutely no idea. It ought to be possible to deduce that from the

02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:51.840
shapes of proteins. It would require much greater skill than the human mind has.

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:56.480
But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on, let's look at this exit tunnel and try

02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:00.000
and work out what shape is this protein going to take and we can figure that out.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.280
That's really interesting about the exit tunnel, but sometimes we get lucky and

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:11.360
our, like Jessica and science, the simplified view or the static view will actually solve the

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:17.120
problem for us. So in this case, it's very possible that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:23.680
to our structure without considering how it unraveled, so without considering the tunnel.

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:29.680
And so that seems to be the case in this situation where the cool thing about proteins,

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:32.560
all the different shapes they can possibly take, it actually seems to take

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.480
very specific, unique shapes given the sequence. That's forced on you by an exit tunnel. So the

02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:45.760
problem is actually much simpler than you thought. And then there's a whole army of proteins which

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:53.840
change the conformational state, chaperone proteins. And they're only used when there's some

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:57.840
presumably issue with how it came out of the exit tunnel and you want to do it differently to that.

02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.800
So very often the chaperone proteins will go there and will influence the way in which it falls.

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:10.240
So there's two ways of doing it. Either you can look at the structures and the sequences of all

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:14.960
the proteins and you can apply an immense mind to it and figure out what the patterns are and figure

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:18.480
out what happened. Or you can look at the actual situation where it is and say, well, hang on,

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:22.480
it was actually quite simple. It's got a charged environment and then it's forced to come out this

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.240
way. And then the question will be, well, do different ribosomes have different charged

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:30.720
environments? What happens if a chaperone? You're asking a different set of questions to come to

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:35.680
the same answer in a way which is telling you a much simpler story and explains why it is.

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:40.960
Rather than saying it could be, this is one in a billion different possible conformational

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:44.160
states that this protein could have. You're saying, well, it has this one because that was

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:50.800
the only one it could take given its setting. Well, yeah. I mean, currently humans are very

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.680
good at that kind of first principles thinking. I was stepping back, but I think AI is really

02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:01.840
good at collecting a huge amount of data and a huge amount of data of observation of planets

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.320
and figure out that Earth is not at the center of the universe, that there's actually a sun,

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:12.480
we're orbiting the sun. But then you can, as a human being, ask, well, how do solar systems come

02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:19.840
to be? What are the different forces that are required to make this kind of pattern emerge?

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:23.760
And then you start to invent things like gravity. I mean, obviously,

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.720
I mixed up the ordering of gravity wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets, but

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:38.560
we are able to think about those big picture things as human beings. AI is just very good to

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:47.360
infer simple models from a huge amount of data. And the question is with biology, we kind of go

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:53.120
back and forth how we solve biology. Listen, protein folding was thought to be impossible

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.320
to solve. And there's a lot of brilliant PhD students that worked one protein at a time trying

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:02.400
to figure out the structure. And the fact that I was able to do that.

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.600
Oh, I'm not knocking it at all. But I think that people have been asking the wrong question.

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:19.840
But then as the people start to ask better and bigger questions, the AI kind of enters the chat

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.400
and says, I'll help you out with that. Can I give you another example of my own work?

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:35.840
The risk of getting a disease as we get older, there are genetic aspects to it. If you spend

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.640
your whole life overeating and smoking and whatever, that's a whole separate question.

02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:46.560
But there's a genetic side to the risk. And we know a few genes that increase your risk of

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.760
certain things. And for probably 20 years now, people have been doing what's called GWAS, which

02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:59.280
is genome wide association studies. So you effectively scan the entire genome for any

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.800
single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is say a single letter change in one place

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.520
that has a higher association of being linked with a particular disease or not. And you can

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:17.040
come up with thousands of these things across the genome. And if you add them all up and try and say,

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:24.640
so do they add up to explain the known genetic risk of this disease? And the known genetic risk

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:31.440
often comes from twin studies. And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy, there's a 40 or

02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:37.200
50% risk that the other twin, identical twin will also get epilepsy. Therefore, the genetic factor

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:45.520
is about 50%. And so the gene similarities that you see should account for 50% of that known risk.

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:52.800
Very often it accounts for less than a 10th of the known risk. And there's two possible explanations

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.280
and there's one which people tend to do, which is to say, ah, well, we don't have enough statistical

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.320
power. Maybe there's a million, we've only found a thousand of them. But if we find the other

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:06.480
million, they're weakly related, but there's a huge number of them. And so we'll account for that

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:13.840
whole risk. Maybe there's a billion of them. So that's one way. The other way is to say,

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.960
well, hang on a minute, you're missing a system here. That system is the mitochondrial DNA,

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.640
which people tend to dismiss because it's small and it doesn't change very much.

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:32.640
But a few single letter changes in that mitochondrial DNA, it controls some really

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:38.640
basic processes. It controls not only all the energy that we need to live and to move around

02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:47.280
and do everything we do, but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks, to make new cells.

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:53.200
And cancer cells very often kind of take over the mitochondria and rewire them so that instead of

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.200
using them for making energy, they're effectively using them as precursors for the building blocks

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.560
for biosynthesis. You need to make new amino acids, new nucleotides for DNA. You want to make new

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.800
lipids to make your membranes and so on. So they kind of rewire metabolism.

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:11.520
Now, the problem is that we've got all these interactions between mitochondrial DNA and the

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.520
genes in the nucleus that are overlooked completely because people literally throw away the

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:23.040
mitochondrial genes. And we can see in fruit flies that they interact and produce big differences in

02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:34.960
risk. So you can set AI onto this question of exactly how many of these base changes there are.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.600
There's just one possible solution that maybe there are a million of them and it does account

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.000
for the greater part of the risk. Or the other one is they aren't. It's just not there. Actually,

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.880
the risk lies in something you weren't even looking at. And this is where human intuition

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:54.640
is very important and just this feeling that, well, I'm working on this and I think it's important

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:58.320
and I'm bloody minded about it. And in the end, some people are right. It turns out that it was

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:02.480
important. Can you get AI to do that? To be bloody minded?

02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:10.080
And that hang on a minute. You might be missing a whole other system here that's much bigger.

02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:20.480
That's the moment of discovery, of scientific revolution. I'm giving up on saying AI can't

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:26.320
do something. I've said it enough times about enough things. I think there's been a lot of

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:31.520
progress and instead I'm excited by the possibility of AI helping humans. But

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:36.800
at the same time, just like I said, we seem to dismiss the power of humans.

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:50.240
We're so limited in so many ways that in what we feel like dumb ways, we're not strong.

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:59.440
Where our attention, our memory is limited. Our ability to focus on things is limited

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.680
in our own perception of what limited is. But actually there's an incredible computer behind

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:11.680
the whole thing that makes this whole system work. Our ability to interact with the environment,

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:17.360
to reason about the environment. There's magic there. And I'm hopeful that AI can capture some

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:22.080
of that same magic, but that magic is not going to look like Deep Blue playing chess.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.320
It's going to be more interesting. But I don't think it's going to look like

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.640
pattern finding either. That's essentially what you're telling me it does very well at the moment.

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:36.880
And my point is it works very well where you're looking for the right pattern. But we are

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:46.000
storytelling animals and the hypothesis is a story. It's a testable story. But a new hypothesis is a

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.400
leap into the unknown and it's a new story basically. And it says this leads to this,

02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:57.360
leads to that. It's a causal set of storytelling. It's also possible that the leap into the unknown

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.760
has a pattern of its own. Yes, it is. And it's possible that it's learnable.

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:11.760
I'm sure it is. There's a nice book by Arthur Koestler on the nature of creativity and he

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.600
likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off in a completely unexpected direction and

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.680
says that this is the basis of human creativity, that some creative switch of direction to an

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:27.600
unexpected place is similar to a joke. I'm not saying that's how it works, but it's a nice idea

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:34.080
and there must be some truth in it. And it's one of these, most of the stories we tell are probably

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:38.880
the wrong story and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful. And we definitely don't do

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:45.360
as well at seeing patterns in things. But some of the most enjoyable human aspects is finding and

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.800
new story that goes to an unexpected place. And these are all aspects of what being human means

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:56.480
to me. And maybe these are all things that AI figures out for itself or maybe they're just

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:04.640
aspects. But I just have the feeling sometimes that the people who are trying to understand

02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:12.000
what we are like, if we wish to craft an AI system which is somehow human-like,

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:20.240
that we don't have a firm enough grasp of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:27.280
But we get a better, better understanding of that. I agree with you completely. We try to build a

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:33.840
thing and then we go, hang on a minute. There's another system here and that's actually the

02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:39.280
attempt to build AI that's human-like is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings.

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.080
The funny thing is I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen, widely considered to be the greatest

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:50.160
chess player of all time. And he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:58.640
plays chess. And he had a funny comment. He has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely

02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:05.280
impressed when he first saw AlphaZero play. And he said that it did a lot of things that could easily

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:13.600
be mistaken for creativity. So he, as a typical human, refused to give the system

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:22.480
its due. Because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people are extremely impressed by,

02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:28.320
not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one of the things that

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:36.880
it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that means you

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:43.680
basically take a few steps back in order to take a step forward. You give away pieces for some

02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:54.320
future reward. And that for us humans is where art is in chess. You take big risks. For us humans,

02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.360
those risks are especially painful because you have a fog of uncertainty before you. So to take

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.880
a risk now based on intuition of, I think this is the right risk to take, but there's so many

02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:12.960
possibilities that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is. That's that danger. And then

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:21.600
the AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks and does them even greater degree. But of course,

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:31.120
it does it from a way you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But boy,

02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:35.920
when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see in creativity.

02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:42.640
We see creative play on the chessboard, but the chessboard is very limited. And the question is,

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.680
as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in the future?

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:54.960
As we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics, in programming,

02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:02.960
and then venturing biology, psychology, and expand into more and more complex systems?

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:09.680
I used to go running when I was a boy and fell running, which is to say running up and down

02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:15.840
mountains. And I was never particularly great at it, but there were some people who were amazingly

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:24.080
fast, especially at running down. And I realized in trying to do this that there's only really

02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.280
three possible ways of doing it, and there's only two that work. Either you go extremely slowly and

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:34.480
carefully and you figure out, okay, there's a stone. I'll put my foot on this stone and then

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:40.640
there's a muddy puddle I'm going to avoid. It's slow, it's laborious. You figure it out step by

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:46.240
step. Or you can just go incredibly fast and you don't think about it at all. The entire conscious

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.160
mind is shut out of it and it's probably the same playing table tennis or something. There's

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:54.640
something in the mind which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations about exactly that.

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:59.040
And it's amazing. You can run at an astonishing speed down a hillside with no idea how you did

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:03.520
it at all. And then you panic and you think, I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this. I've

02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.040
got to think about where I'm going to put my foot. So you slow down a bit and try to bring those

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:13.360
conscious mind in and then you do. You crash. You cannot think consciously while running downhill.

02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:22.640
So it's amazing how many calculations the mind is able to make. Now the problem with playing

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:27.440
chess or something, if you were able to make all of those subconscious kind of forward calculations

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:34.480
about what is the likely outcome of this move now in the way that we can by running down a hillside

02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:39.440
or something, is partly about what we have adapted to do. It's partly about the reality

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.040
of the world that we're in. Running fast downhill is something that we better be bloody good at

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:51.280
otherwise we're going to be eaten. Whereas trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.680
future is not something we've ever been called on to do. Two or three, four moves into the future

02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:03.760
is quite enough for most of us most of the time. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, just solving chess may not

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:11.680
we may not be as far towards solving the problem of downhill running

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:20.800
as we might think just because we solve chess. Still it's beautiful to see creativity.

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:28.640
Humans create machines that are able to create art and art on a chess board and art otherwise.

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:36.400
Who knows how far that takes us. So I mentioned Andrea Carpati earlier. Him and I are big fans

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:41.760
of yours. If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on the Fermi

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:50.480
paradox. So let me ask you on the topic of alien life. Since we've been talking about life and

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.680
we're a kind of aliens, how many alien civilizations are out there do you think?

02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:04.160
Well, the universe is very big. So some, but not as many as most people would like to think

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:09.680
is my view because the idea that there is a trajectory going from

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.480
simple cellular life like bacteria all the way through to humans. It seems to me there's some

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.320
big gaps along that way that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have is the biggest of

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:30.480
them, but also photosynthesis is another. Another interesting gap is a long gap from

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:35.760
the origin of the eukaryotic cell to the first animals. That was about a billion years,

02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:42.880
maybe more than that. A long delay in when oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere.

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:47.440
So from the first appearance of oxygen in the great oxidation event to enough for animals to

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:55.120
respire, it was close to 2 billion years. Why so long? It seems to be planetary factors. It seems

02:23:55.120 --> 02:24:01.520
to be geology as much as anything else. And we don't really know what was going on. So the idea

02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:11.440
that there's a kind of an inevitable march towards complexity and sentient life, I don't think he's

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.880
right. Not to say it's not going to happen, but I think it's not going to happen often.

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.560
So if you think of Earth, given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:30.240
do you have a sense that life, complex life, intelligent life happen really quickly on Earth

02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:38.560
or really long? So just to get a sense of, are you more sort of saying that it's very unlikely

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:44.800
to get the kind of conditions required to create humans or is it even if you have the condition,

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:50.240
it's just statistically difficult. I mean, the problem, the single great problem at the

02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.000
center of all of that to my mind is the origin of the eukaryotic cell, which happened once.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.720
And without eukaryotes, nothing else would have happened. And that is something that-

02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:02.480
That's because you're saying it's super important, the eukaryotes, but-

02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.880
I'm saying tantamount to saying that it is impossible to build something as complex

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.680
as a human being from bacterial cells. Totally agree in some deep fundamental way,

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.800
but it's just like one cell going inside another. Is that so difficult to get to work right?

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:28.880
Well, again, it happened once. I'm in a minority view in this position. Most biologists probably

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.480
wouldn't agree with me anyway. But if you think about the starting point, we've got a simple cell.

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:38.240
It's an archaeal cell. We can be fairly sure about that. So it looks a lot like a bacterium,

02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:44.640
but is in fact from this other domain of life. So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell. That means

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:50.080
it doesn't have anything. It doesn't have a nucleus. It doesn't really have complex endomembrane.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:55.360
It has a little bit of stuff, but not that much. And it takes up an endosymbiont.

02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:01.920
So what happens next? And the answer is basically everything to do with complexity.

02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:09.040
To me, there's a beautiful paradox here. Plants and animals and fungi

02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:16.720
all have exactly the same type of cell, but they all have really different ways of living.

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:24.560
So a plant cell is photosynthetic. They started out as algae in the oceans and so on. So think

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:32.160
of algal bloom, single cell things. The basic cell structure that it's built from

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.400
is exactly the same with a couple of small differences. It's got chloroplasts as well.

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:39.840
It's got a vacuole. It's got a cell wall, but that's about it. Pretty much everything else

02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:44.960
is exactly the same in a plant cell and an animal cell. And yet the ways of life are

02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:50.800
completely different. So this cell structure did not evolve in response to different ways of life,

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:54.560
different environments. I'm in the ocean doing photosynthesis. I'm on land running around as

02:26:54.560 --> 02:27:03.600
part of an animal. I'm a fungus in a soil spending out long shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium.

02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:10.320
So they all have the same underlying cell structure. Why? Almost certainly it was driven by

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.440
adaptation to the internal environment, to having these pesky endosymbionts that

02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:19.600
forced all kinds of change on the host cell. Now, in one way you could see that as a really

02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:23.680
good thing because it may be that there's some inevitability to this process. As soon as you've

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.000
got endosymbionts, you're more or less bound to go in that direction. Or it could be that there's

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.720
a huge fluke about it and it's almost certain to go wrong in just about every case possible,

02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.040
that the conflict will lead to effectively war, leading to death and extinction,

02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.280
and it simply doesn't work out. So maybe it happened millions of times and it went wrong

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:46.400
every time. Or maybe it only happened once and it worked out because it was inevitable. And actually,

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.400
we simply do not know enough now to say which of those two possibilities is true,

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.560
but both of them are a bit grim. But you're leaning towards,

02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:02.400
we just got really lucky in that one leap. So do you have a sense that our galaxy, for example,

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:07.680
has just maybe millions of planets with bacteria living on it?

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:12.480
I would expect tens of billions of planets with bacteria living on it, practically.

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:19.120
I mean, there's probably five to 10 planets per star, of which I would hope that at least

02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:26.320
one would have bacteria on. So I expect bacteria to be very common. I simply can't put a number

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.760
otherwise. I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere. It's not that I think we're living

02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:35.440
in a completely empty universe. But I think that it's not going to happen inevitably.

02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:42.480
And there's something, that's not the only problem with complex life on Earth. I mentioned oxygen

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.120
animals and so on as well. And even humans, we came along very late. You go back five million

02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:52.720
years and would we be that impressed if we came across a planet full of giraffes? I mean, you'd

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.880
think, hey, there's life here and it's a nice planet to colonize or something. We wouldn't think,

02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:59.280
oh, let's try and have a conversation with this giraffe.

02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.280
Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think. I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:12.800
interesting from an alien perspective or how they would notice. I'll talk to you about cities too,

02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.400
because that's an interesting perspective of how to look at human civilization.

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.680
But your sons, I mean, of course you don't know, but it's an interesting

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:27.440
world. It's an interesting galaxy. It's an interesting universe to live in.

02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:40.880
That's just like every sun, like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it. Imagine that world

02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:52.480
and the galaxy maybe has just a handful, if not one, intelligent civilization. That's a wild world.

02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:59.680
I didn't even think about that world. There's a kind of thought that, like one of the reasons

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:05.760
it would be so exciting to find life on Mars or Titan or whatever is like, if its life is elsewhere,

02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:13.840
then surely, statistically, that life, no matter how unlikely you carry as multi-cell organisms,

02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:22.080
sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult? I mean, photosynthesis

02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:29.200
is figuring out some machinery that involves the chemistry and the environment to allow the

02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:35.440
building up of complex organisms. Surely that would arise. But man, I don't know how I would

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.240
feel about just bacteria everywhere. Well, it would be depressing if it was true.

02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:46.400
I don't know what's more depressing, bacteria everywhere or nothing everywhere.

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:52.560
Yes, either of them are chilling. But whether it's chilling or not, I don't think should

02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:59.600
force us to change our view about whether it's real or not. What I'm saying may or may not be

02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:06.080
true. How would you feel if we discovered life on Mars? It sounds like you would be less excited

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:11.040
than some others because you're like, well. What I would be most interested in is how similar

02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:14.160
to life on Earth it would be. It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem because

02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:23.840
the likelihood of life having gone to and fro between Mars and the Earth is quite,

02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:29.840
I wouldn't say high, but it's not low. It's quite feasible. And so if we found life on Mars and

02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:35.520
it had very similar genetic code, but it was slightly different, most people would interpret

02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:39.760
that immediately as evidence that there'd been transit one way or the other and that it was a

02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:43.920
common origin of life on Mars or on the Earth and it went one way or the other way. The other way to

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:48.240
see that question though would be to say, well, actually the whole beginnings of life lie in

02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:54.720
deterministic chemistry and thermodynamics, starting with the most likely abundant materials, CO2 and

02:31:54.720 --> 02:32:01.440
water and a wet rocky planet. And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning. And will, I won't say

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:05.520
inevitably, but potentially almost inevitably come up with a genetic code, which is not very

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:11.520
far away from the genetic code that we already have. So we see subtle differences in the genetic

02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:15.840
code. What does it mean? It could be very difficult to interpret. Is it possible, do you think, to

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:21.840
tell the difference of something that truly originated? I think if the stereochemistry was

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:30.240
different, we have sugars, for example, that are the L form or the D form and we have D sugars and

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:39.040
L amino acids right across all of life. But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer and

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:44.240
the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly possible to

02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:49.680
use one or the other one. And the same would almost certainly go for, and I think George

02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:57.680
Church has been trying to make life based on the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly possible

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:03.840
to do and it will work. And if we were to find life on Mars that was using the opposite stereoisomer,

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:09.520
that would be unequivocal evidence that life had started independently there. So hopefully

02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:15.520
the life we find will be on Titan and Europa or something like that, where it's less likely

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:19.760
that we shared and it's harsher conditions. So there's going to be weird kind of life.

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:26.960
I wouldn't count on that because life started in deep sea hydrothermal vents. It's harsh.

02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:32.320
That's pretty harsh. Yeah. So Titan is different. Europa is probably quite similar to Earth in the

02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:38.640
sense that we're dealing with an ocean, some acidic ocean there, as the early Earth would have been.

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:44.160
And it almost certainly has hydrothermal systems, same with Enceladus. We can tell that from these

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:49.120
plumes coming from the surface through the ice. We know there's a liquid ocean and we can tell

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:54.160
roughly what the chemistry is. For Titan, we're dealing with liquid methane and things like that.

02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:58.320
If there really is life there, it would really have to be very, very different to anything

02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:04.160
that we know on Earth. So the hardest leap, the most important leap is from

02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:16.320
prokaryotes to eukaryotic. What's the second if we're ranking? You gave a lot of emphasis on

02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:22.480
photosynthesis. Yeah. And that would be my second one, I think. But it's not so much... I mean,

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:28.800
photosynthesis is part of the problem. It's a difficult thing to do. Again, we know it happened

02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:40.240
once. We don't know why it happened once. But the fact that it was taken on board completely by

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:47.200
plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts and did very well in completely different environments

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:53.920
and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest that there's no problem with exploring.

02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.440
You could have a separate origin that explored this whole domain over there that the bacteria

02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:03.600
had never gone into. So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened once is probably

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:10.240
because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult. But then it happened at least 2.2

02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:16.560
billion years ago, right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago, when there are some

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:21.280
people say there are whiffs of oxygen, there's just kind of traces in the fossil in the geochemical

02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:25.920
record that say maybe there was a bit of oxygen then. That's really disputed. Some people say

02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:31.120
it goes all the way back 4 billion years ago and that it was the common ancestor of life on Earth

02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:36.400
was photosynthetic. So immediately you've got groups of people who disagree over a 2 billion

02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:45.440
year period of time about when it started. But let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal,

02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:50.000
that's 2.2 billion years ago, through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion when

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.840
oxygen levels definitely got close to modern levels, which was around about 550 million

02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:01.200
years ago. So we've gone more than one and a half billion years where the Earth was in stasis.

02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:06.400
Nothing much changed. It's known as the boring billion, in fact.

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.760
Probably stuff was, that was when eukaryotes arose somewhere in there, but it's

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:19.200
a... So this idea that the world is constantly changing, that we're constantly evolving,

02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.800
that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea. But in reality, there are

02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:36.800
tipping points to a new stable equilibrium where the cells that are producing oxygen are precisely

02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:42.160
counterbalanced by the cells that are consuming that oxygen, which is why it's 21% now and has

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:47.040
been that way for hundreds of millions of years. We have a very precise balance. You go through a

02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:52.080
tipping point and you don't know where the next stable state's going to be, but it can be a long

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:58.560
way from here. And so if we change the world with global warming, there will be a tipping point.

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.520
Question is where and when and what's the next stable state. It may be uninhabitable to us.

02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.320
It'll be habitable to life for sure. But there may be something like the Permian

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:14.080
extinction where 95% of species go extinct and there's a five to 10 million year gap and then

02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:17.920
life recovers, but without humans. And the question statistically,

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:23.040
well without humans, but statistically, does that ultimately lead to greater complexity,

02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.760
more interesting life, more intelligent life? Well, after the first appearance of oxygen

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:33.200
with the GOE, there was a tipping point which led to a long-term stable state that was equivalent

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:38.640
to the Black Sea today, which is to say oxygenated at the very surface and stagnant sterile,

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:47.200
not sterile, but sulfurous lower down. And that was stable certainly around the continental

02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:53.040
margins for more than a billion years. It was not a state that led to progression in an obvious way.

02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:59.760
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution, like what leads to stable states

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:12.160
and how often are evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment. So maybe other planets are

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.480
able to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures, whatever, some kind of pressure that's

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:23.120
a, you're screwed unless you get your shit together in the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.920
years, like a lot of pressure. It seems like earth, like the boring building might be explained

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.640
in two ways. One is super difficult to take any kind of next step. And the second way could

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:40.640
be explained is there's no reason to take the next step. No, I think there is no reason,

02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:47.520
but at the end of it, there was a snowball earth. So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:59.360
scale where the sea was frozen at the equator. And that forced change in one way or another.

02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.040
It's not long after that, 100 million years, perhaps after that, so not a short time,

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:07.840
but this is when we begin to see animals. There was a shift again, another tipping point that led

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:13.840
to catastrophic change that led to a takeoff then. We don't really know why, but one of the

02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:21.120
reasons why that I discuss in the book is about sulphate being washed into the oceans,

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:28.480
which sounds incredibly parochial. But the issue is, I mean, what the data is showing,

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:35.680
we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes.

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.320
So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here. One is carbon 12,

02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:45.920
99% of carbon is carbon 12. And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13, which is a stable isotope.

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:51.120
And then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive, it's trivial in amount. So carbon

02:39:51.120 --> 02:40:00.240
13 is 1%. And life and enzymes generally, you can think of carbon atoms as little balls bouncing

02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.400
around, ping pong balls bouncing around. Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13 because

02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:10.080
it's lighter and it's more likely to encounter an enzyme. And so it's more likely to be fixed

02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:14.400
into organic matter. And so organic matter is enriched. And this is just an observation,

02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:19.680
it's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon 13 relative to what you

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:28.880
would expect if it was just equal. And if you then bury organic matter as coal or oil or whatever it

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:35.040
may be, then it's no longer oxidized. So some oxygen remains left over in the atmosphere.

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:38.960
And that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. And you can work out historically

02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.520
how much oxygen there must have been in the atmosphere by how much carbon was being buried.

02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:46.960
And you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was being buried? And the answer is,

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:51.920
well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.800
and that precipitates out in limestone. So you can look at limestones over these ages and work out

02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:03.440
what's the carbon 13 signal. And that gives you a kind of a feedback on what the oxygen content.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:08.000
Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's called a negative isotope anomaly

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.000
excursion, which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a massive amount and then

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:20.320
back up again 10 million years later. And what that seems to be saying is the amount of carbon 12

02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:31.280
in the oceans was disappearing, which is to say it was being oxidized. And if it's being oxidized,

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:37.920
it's consuming oxygen. So a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon

02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:43.760
13 is really going down, which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being

02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:48.560
oxidized. Sorry, this is getting too complex. Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:53.840
of oxygen. If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12

02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:57.520
that's being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the

02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:03.360
atmosphere gets stripped out. There is none left. And yet the rest of the geological indicators say,

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:09.200
no, there's oxygen in the atmosphere. So it's kind of a paradox. And the only way to explain

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:13.440
this paradox just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:20.320
oceans and so on is to assume that oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate. Sulfate was

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:25.920
being washed into the oceans. It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria,

02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:30.080
just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor. So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead

02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:38.880
of oxygen. Bacteria did. Yeah. Yeah. So these are bacteria. So they're oxidizing carbon,

02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:45.280
organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons onto sulfate that reacts with iron

02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.840
to form iron pyrites or fool's gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system.

02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:57.760
And this can account for the mass balance. So why does it matter? It matters because what it says

02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:03.120
is there was a chance event tectonically, there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land

02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:10.000
as some kind of mineral. So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are evaporitic.

02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:18.240
And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building,

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:22.160
the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean.

02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:27.280
Yeah. So I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible.

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:30.720
Statistically, it's really hard. Maybe you can rule that in statistically,

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.320
or this is the course of life on earth. Without all that sulfate being raised up,

02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:40.480
this Cambrian explosion almost certainly would not have happened. And then we wouldn't have had

02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:46.560
animals and so on and so on. So it's- This kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion.

02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:56.080
And so let me actually say in several ways. So folks who challenge the validity of the

02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:03.040
theory of evolution will give us an example. Now I'm not well studied in this, but will give

02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:11.840
us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like, this thing is weird. So by the question I would

02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:20.560
have is what's the biggest mystery or gap in understanding about evolution? Is it the Cambrian

02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.160
explosion? And if so, how do we, what's our best understanding of how to explain? First of all,

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:32.320
what is it? In my understanding in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million

02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:38.320
years, something like that, a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created.

02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:43.120
Anyway, there's like five questions in there. Is that the biggest mystery?

02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:46.160
No, I don't think it's a particularly big mystery really anymore. I mean,

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:53.520
there are still mysteries about why then, and I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is

02:44:53.520 --> 02:45:00.640
one, it needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time. So probably before that,

02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:05.360
they weren't high enough for animals. What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning

02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:12.720
of predators and prey relationships. We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races

02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:22.480
and we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed. So I talked about the boring billion,

02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:27.280
nothing happens for one and a half, one billion years, one and a half billion years.

02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:34.800
The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption is then that evolution works

02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:41.120
really slowly and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.320
billion years to do something else. It's completely wrong. Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:51.840
stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. Steven J. Gould used to

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:55.760
argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium, but he was doing it to do with animals and to do

02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:00.800
with the last 500 million years or so, where it's much less obvious than if you think about the

02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:06.320
entire planetary history. Then you realize that the first two billion years was bacteria only.

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:09.600
You have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria,

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:15.280
oxygenic photosynthesis arising here. Then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and

02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:19.600
great oxidation event and then another billion years of nothing happening and then some period

02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:23.360
of upheavals and then another snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion.

02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:29.920
This is long periods of stasis where the world is in a stable state and is not geared towards

02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:35.520
increasing complexity. It's just everything is in balance. Only when you have a catastrophic level,

02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:40.480
global level problem like a snowball earth, it forces everything out of balance and there's

02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:48.320
a tipping point and you end up somewhere else. Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong.

02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:54.560
It can be incredibly fast. I mentioned earlier on that in theory, it would take half a million

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:58.960
years to invent an eye, for example, from a light sensitive spot. It doesn't take long

02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:08.240
to convert one tube into a tube with nobbles on it into a tube with arms on it and then multiple

02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:14.560
arms and then at one end is a head that starts out as a swelling. It's not difficult intellectually

02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:20.960
to understand how these things can happen. It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly,

02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:27.200
but we're used to human timescales and what we need to talk about is generations of things

02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:34.160
that live for a year in the ocean. Then a million years is a million generations and the amount of

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:40.480
change that you can affect in that period of time is enormous. We're dealing with large populations

02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:47.280
of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes. Again, as soon as you throw in

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.760
the competition of predators and prey and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:58.640
it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly when the environment allows it to happen.

02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.720
I don't think there's a big mystery. There's lots of details that need to be filled in.

02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.800
The big mystery in biology is consciousness.

02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:15.600
The big mystery in biology is consciousness. Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.

02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:30.480
I mean, you said biology, not psychology because from a biology perspective,

02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:37.600
it seems like intelligence and consciousness are all the same like weird, like all the brain stuff.

02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:44.000
I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult, I suppose. I mean, I see it as a form

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.840
of computing and I don't know much about computing. You don't know much about consciousness

02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:58.880
either. I suppose, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see that consciousness you do know

02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:05.200
a lot about as a human being. No, no. I mean, I think I can understand the wiring of a brain

02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:13.280
as a series of, in pretty much the same way as a computer in theory in terms of

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:21.680
the circuitry of it. The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings,

02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:27.760
as we were talking about earlier on. Yeah. I think we oversimplify intelligence.

02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.880
I think the dance, the magic of reasoning is as interesting as the magic of feeling.

02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:46.080
We tend to think of reasoning as like running a very simplistic algorithm. I think reasoning

02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:52.480
is the interplay between memory, whatever the hell is going on, the unconscious mind, all of that.

02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:00.480
I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all. Obviously, it's extraordinarily, exquisitely

02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:05.920
complex, but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.

02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:09.200
Yeah. No, I mean, I agree with you, but I sometimes,

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.480
yeah, there's a big cloak of mystery around consciousness.

02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:23.840
Let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics. Classical physics is logical and you can

02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:29.440
understand the kind of language we're dealing with. It's almost at the human level. We're

02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:33.120
dealing with stars and things that we can see. When you get to quantum mechanics and things,

02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:39.520
it's practically impossible for the human mind to compute what just happened there.

02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:45.920
Yeah. I mean, that is the same. It's like you understand mathematically the notes

02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:50.800
of a musical composition, that's intelligence, but why it makes you feel a certain way.

02:50:50.800 --> 02:51:02.960
That is much harder to understand. Yeah, that's really, but it was interesting framing that that's

02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:10.480
a mystery at the core of biology. I wonder who solves consciousness. I tend to think

02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:18.000
consciousness will be solved by the engineer, meaning the person who builds it, who keeps

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:28.560
trying to build the thing versus biology, such a complicated system. I feel like the building

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:35.840
blocks of consciousness from a biological perspective, that's the final creation of

02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:40.240
a human being. So you have to understand the whole damn thing. You said the electrical fields, but

02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:46.240
like electrical fields plus plus everything, the whole shebang.

02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:52.880
I'm inclined to agree. I mean, my feeling is from my meagre knowledge of the history of science is

02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:57.920
that the biggest breakthrough has usually come through from a field that was not related. So

02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:02.880
if anyone is not going to be a biologist who solves consciousness, just because biologists

02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:08.560
are too embedded in the nature of the problem. And then nobody's going to believe you when you've

02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:14.240
done it because nobody's going to be able to prove that this AI is in fact conscious and sad,

02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:19.040
in any case, and any more than you can prove that a dog is conscious and sad.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:26.320
So it tells you that it is in good language and you must believe it. But I think most people will

02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:34.720
accept if faced with that, that that's what it is. All of this probability of complex life,

02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:47.680
in one way, I think why it matters is that my expectation, I suppose, is that we will be

02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:53.280
over the next hundred years or so, if we survive at all, that AI will increasingly

02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:59.360
dominate and pretty much anything that we put out into space going looking for other, well,

02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:04.800
for the universe, for what's out there will be AI, won't be us, we won't be doing that. Or when

02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:11.120
we do, it'll be on a much more limited scale. I suppose the same would apply to any alien

02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:16.560
civilization. So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there, we should be looking for

02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:27.680
AI out there. But then we face the problem that I don't see how a planet is going to give rise

02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:32.640
directly to AI. I can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.

02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:38.160
And if the principles that govern the evolution of life on Earth apply to other planets as well,

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:45.760
and I think a lot of them would, then the likelihood of ending up with a human-like

02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:51.760
civilization capable of giving rise to AI in the first place is massively limited. Once you've done

02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:57.760
it once, perhaps it takes over the universe and maybe there's no issue. But it seems to me that

02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:02.880
it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked, that you're not going to just turn

02:54:02.880 --> 02:54:08.000
a sterile planet into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics first.

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:15.360
You have to run the full evolutionary computation with the organics to create AI.

02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:19.840
How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid, if you like, of an intelligent designer?

02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:25.520
The origin of AI is going to have to be in the chemistry of a planet.

02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:34.000
But that's not a limiting factor, right? Let me ask the Fermi paradox question.

02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:45.360
Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful world of just billions of planets with

02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:51.040
bacteria on it and very few intelligent civilizations, and yet there's a few out

02:54:51.040 --> 02:55:00.720
there. Why haven't we, at scale, seen them visit us? What's your sense? Is it because they don't

02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:06.160
exist? Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe at the right time. That's the simplest

02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:11.920
answer for it. Is that the one you find the most compelling, or is there some other explanation?

02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:18.320
CB I find that... No, it's not that I find it more compelling. It's that I find more probable,

02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:23.200
and I find all of them... I mean, there's a lot of hand waving in this. We just don't know.

02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:29.680
So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth to what might happen somewhere else.

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:35.840
It gives, to my mind, a bit of a pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere and only occasional

02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:41.760
intelligent life. And running forward, humans only once on Earth and nothing else that you would

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.320
necessarily be any more excited about making contact with than you would be making contact

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:54.720
with them on Earth. So I think the chances are pretty limited. And the chances of us surviving

02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:59.520
are pretty limited too in the way we're going on at the moment. The likelihood of us not

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:05.280
making ourselves extinct within the next few hundred years, possibly within the next 50 or

02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:12.080
100 years, seems quite small. I hope we can do better than that. So maybe the only thing that

02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:16.480
will survive from humanity will be AI. And maybe AI, once it exists, and once it's capable of

02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:23.200
effectively copying itself and cutting humans out of the loop, then maybe that will take over

02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:27.920
the universe. CB I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness to the way you described that,

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:33.200
but isn't that also potentially beautiful that that's the next step of life?

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:41.120
I suppose from your perspective, as long as it carries the flame of consciousness somehow.

02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.800
RW I think yes, there can be some beauty to it being the next step of life. And I don't know

02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:51.920
if consciousness matters or not from that point of view, to be honest with you. But there's some

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:58.720
sadness, yes, probably, because I think it comes down to the selfishness that we were talking about

02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:06.960
earlier on. I am an individual with a desire not to be kind of displaced from life. I want to stay

02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:14.240
alive. I want to be here. So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would feel is that we will

02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:22.160
just be wiped out. So that there will be potential conflicts between AI and humans and that AI will

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:27.200
win because it's a lot smarter. CB Boy, would that be a sad state of

02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:34.240
affairs if consciousness is just an intermediate stage between bacteria and AI.

02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:40.480
RW Well, I would see bacteria as being potentially a kind of primitive form of consciousness.

02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:43.200
CB Right. So maybe- RW The whole of life on earth to my mind-

02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:46.480
CB Is conscious. RW Is capable of some form of feelings

02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:50.320
in response to the environment. That's not to say it's intelligent, though it's got its own

02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:55.920
algorithms for intelligence, but nothing comparable with us. I think it's beautiful

02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:01.360
what a sterile planet can come up with. It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this

02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:08.320
stuff that we see around us and that either we or whatever we produce is capable of destroying all

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:18.960
of that. It is a sad thought, but it's also hugely pessimistic. I'd like to think that we're capable

02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:23.120
of giving rise to something which is at least as good, if not better than us, as AI.

02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:31.200
CB Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing that is able to propagate throughout

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:38.320
the universe more efficiently than humans can, or extensions of humans. Some merger with AI and humans,

02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:46.000
whether that comes from bioengineering of the human body to extend its life, somehow

02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:51.920
to carry that flame of consciousness and that personality and the beautiful tension

02:58:52.640 --> 02:58:58.320
that's within all of us, carry that through to multiple planets, to multiple solar systems,

02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:03.520
all out there in the universe. That's a beautiful vision. Whether AI can do that or

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:12.400
bioengineered humans can, that's an exciting possibility, especially meeting other alien

02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:16.480
civilizations in that same kind of way. Do you think aliens have consciousness?

02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:17.680
AC If they're organic.

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:20.320
CB So organic is connected to consciousness.

02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:27.360
AC I think any system which is going to bootstrap itself up from planetary origins,

02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:34.720
let me finish this and then come on to something else, but from planetary origins is going to face

02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:39.040
similar constraints and those constraints are going to be addressed in similar basic

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:43.920
engineering ways. I think it will be cellular and I think it will have electrical charges and I

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:48.800
think it will have to be selected in populations over time and all of these things will tend to

02:59:48.800 --> 02:59:53.920
give rise to the same processes as the simplest fix to a difficult problem. So I would expect it

02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:59.520
to be conscious, yes, and I would expect it to resemble life on earth in many ways.

03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:06.960
When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16, I remember reading a book by Fred Hoyle called The Black

03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:12.800
Cloud, which I was a budding biologist at the time and this was the first time I'd come across

03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:17.840
someone that really challenging the heart of biology and saying, you are far too parochial,

03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:23.520
you're thinking about life as carbon-based. Here's a life form which is kind of dust,

03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:33.920
interstellar dust on a solar system scale. It's a novel, but I felt enormously challenged by that

03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:43.200
novel because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was, how narrow-minded I was being,

03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:47.120
and here was a great physicist with a completely different conception of what life could be.

03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:54.880
And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways and I'm kind of reluctant to say the attacks

03:00:54.880 --> 03:01:02.320
make more sense to me than the original story, which is to say, even in terms of information

03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:06.000
processing, if you're on that scale and there's a limit to the speed of light, how quickly can

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:16.640
something think if you're needing to broadcast across the solar system is going to be slow.

03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:21.280
It's not going to hold a conversation with you on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was

03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:27.280
imagining, at least not by any easy way of doing it, assuming that the speed of light is a limit.

03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:34.640
And then again, you really can't. This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago,

03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:40.400
and I do think he's right. There is no other way to generate this level of complexity than

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:45.520
natural selection. Nothing else can do it. You need populations and you need selection in

03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:55.440
populations and kind of an isolated interstellar cloud. Again, there's unlimited time and maybe

03:01:55.520 --> 03:02:03.600
there's no problems with distance, but you need to have a certain frequency of generational time

03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:10.720
to generate a serious level of complexity. And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.

03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:17.200
Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution is a really powerful tool here on Earth,

03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:21.680
but there could be other mechanisms. So I don't know if you're familiar with

03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:28.960
cellular automata, but complex systems that have really simple components

03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:32.560
and seemingly move based on simple rules when they're taken as a whole,

03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:39.200
really interesting complexity emerges. I don't know what the pressures on that are. It's not

03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:44.880
really selection, but interesting complexity seems to emerge, and that's not well understood exactly

03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:52.240
why that difference between complexity and evolution. So some of the work we're doing

03:02:52.240 --> 03:03:00.960
on the origin of life is thinking about how do genes arise? How does information arise in biology?

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:06.320
And thinking about it from the point of view of reacting CO2 with hydrogen, what do you get? Well,

03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:11.520
what you're going to get is carboxylic acids, then amino acids. It's quite hard to make nucleotides.

03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:17.280
And it's possible to make them, and it's been done, and it's been done following this pathway

03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:22.960
as well. But you make trace amounts. And so the next question, assuming that this is the right way

03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:27.520
of seeing the question, which maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is, is, well, how do

03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:32.720
you reliably make more nucleotides then? How do you become more complex and better at becoming

03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:37.520
a nucleotide generating machine? And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,

03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:44.320
some form of autocatalysis. So that can work, and we know it happens in biology. If this nucleotide,

03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:50.400
for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation, then you're going to increase the rate of flux through the

03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:54.640
whole system, and you're going to effectively steepen the driving force to make more nucleotides.

03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:03.280
And this can be inherited because there are forms of membrane heredity that you can have, and there

03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.880
are effectively, if a cell divides in two, and it's got a lot of stuff inside it, and that stuff

03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:16.240
is basically bound as a network which is capable of regenerating itself, then it will inevitably

03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:23.200
regenerate itself. And so you can develop greater complexity. But everything that I've said depends

03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.760
on the underlying rules of thermodynamics. There is no evolvability about that.

03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:34.240
It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point, assuming that you're able to

03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:38.880
increase the driving force through the system. You will generate more of the same. You'll

03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:43.280
expand on what you can do, but you'll never get anything different than that. And it's only when

03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:52.240
you introduce information into that as a gene, as a kind of small stretch of RNA, which can be

03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:57.840
random stretch, then you get real evolvability, then you get biology as we know it, but you also

03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:03.440
have selection as we know it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.

03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:11.520
That's a kind of memory of the system. So it's not, yeah, at the local level, it's propagation

03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:16.240
of copying yourself and changing and improving your adaptability to the environment.

03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:23.680
But if you look at Earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory. That's the key feature of it.

03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:24.880
In what way?

03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:31.680
It remembers the stuff it tries. Like if you were to describe Earth,

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:36.640
I think evolution is something that we experience

03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:44.560
as individual organisms. That's how the individual organisms interact with each other.

03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:51.120
There's a natural selection. But when you look at Earth as an organism in its entirety,

03:05:53.920 --> 03:06:00.240
how would you describe it? Well, not as an organism. I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely.

03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:06.720
James Lovelock originally put Gaia out as an organism that had somehow evolved,

03:06:07.440 --> 03:06:14.080
and he was immediately attacked by lots of people. And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat

03:06:14.080 --> 03:06:21.840
because that was more of a poetic vision than the science. The science is now called Earth

03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:27.200
systems science, and it's really about how does the world kind of regulate itself so it remains

03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:31.840
within the limits which are hospitable to life. And it does it amazingly well. And it is working

03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:40.640
at a planetary level of kind of integration, of regulation. But it's not evolving by natural

03:06:40.640 --> 03:06:45.440
selection, and it can't because there's only one of it. And so it can change over time,

03:06:45.440 --> 03:06:49.760
but it's not evolving. All the evolution is happening in the parts of the system.

03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:54.560
Yeah, but it's a self-sustaining organism. No, it's sustained by the sun.

03:06:56.160 --> 03:07:02.160
Right. So you don't think it's possible to see Earth as its own organism?

03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:08.880
I think it's poetic and beautiful, and I often refer to the Earth as a living planet. But it's

03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:16.160
not, in biological terms, an organism. No. If aliens were to visit Earth,

03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:23.040
what would they notice? What would be the basic unit of light they would notice?

03:07:23.920 --> 03:07:28.000
Trees, probably. I mean, it's green, and it's green and blue. I think that's the first thing

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:32.880
you'd notice. It stands out from space as being different to any of the other planets.

03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:37.920
So it would notice the trees at first. Well, I would. I noticed the green, yes.

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:42.640
And then I'd probably figure out the photosynthesis.

03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:46.400
Probably notice cities a second, I suspect. Maybe first.

03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:50.000
If they arrived at night, they'd notice cities first, that's for sure.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:56.160
It depends the time. You write quite beautifully in Transformers. Once again,

03:07:56.160 --> 03:08:01.360
I think you opened the book in this way. I don't remember. From space describing Earth,

03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:10.880
it's such an interesting idea of what Earth is. You also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide summarizing

03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:17.360
it as harmless, or mostly harmless, which is a beautifully poetic thing. You open Transformers

03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:23.760
with, from space, it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating the blue-green colors of the living

03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:28.800
Earth. It is crisscrossed by irregular patterns and convergence striations.

03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:36.160
There's a central, amorphous density where these scratches seem lighter. This, quote,

03:08:36.160 --> 03:08:42.080
growth does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines, and there is

03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:47.360
something grasping and parasitic about it. Across the globe, there are thousands of them,

03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:53.520
varying in shape and detail, but all of them gray, angular, inorganic, spreading.

03:08:54.640 --> 03:09:01.760
Yet, at night, they light up, glowing up the dark sky, suddenly beautiful. Perhaps these

03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:07.040
cankers on the landscape are in some sense living. There's a controlled flow of energy.

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:12.720
There must be information and some form of metabolism, some turnover of materials. Are

03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:20.560
they alive? No, of course not. They are cities. So is there some sense that cities are living

03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:26.000
beings? You think aliens would think of them as living beings? Well, it would be easy to

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:31.840
see it that way, wouldn't it? It wakes up at night. They wake up.

03:09:33.040 --> 03:09:39.200
Strictly nocturnal. Yes. I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough to get here would

03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:49.680
understand that they're not living beings. My reason for saying that is that we tend to think

03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:56.400
of biology in terms of information and forget about cells. I was trying to draw a comparison

03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:01.520
between the cell as a city and the energy flow through the city, and the energy flow through

03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:06.960
cells, and the turnover of materials. An interesting thing about cities is that they're

03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:15.920
not really exactly governed by anybody. There are regulations and systems and whatever else, but

03:10:15.920 --> 03:10:22.560
it's pretty loose. They have their own life, their own way of developing over time.

03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:30.320
In that sense, they're quite biological. There was a plan after the Great Fire of London.

03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:38.000
Christopher Wren was making plans not only for St Paul's Cathedral, but also to rebuild in large

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:45.280
Parisian type boulevards, a large part of the area of central London that was burned. It never

03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:49.680
happened because they didn't have enough money, I think. But it's interesting what was in the plan.

03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:56.160
There were all these boulevards, but there were no pubs and no coffee houses or anything like that.

03:10:57.120 --> 03:11:03.760
The reality was, London just grew up in a set of jumbled streets. It was the coffee

03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:07.760
houses and the pubs where all the business of the city of London was being done, and that was where

03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:12.640
the real life of the city was. No one had planned it. The whole thing was unplanned and works much

03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:16.800
better that way. In that sense, the cell is completely unplanned. It's not controlled by

03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:21.760
the genes in the nucleus in the way that we might like to think that it is, but it's this evolved

03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:26.880
entity that has the same kind of flux, the same animation, the same life. So I think it's a

03:11:26.880 --> 03:11:32.240
beautiful analogy, but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.

03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:40.080
See, I disagree with you. I disagree with you. I think you are so steeped, and actually the entirety

03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:48.800
of science, the history of science, is steeped in a biological framework of thinking about what is

03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:56.960
life, and not just biological. It's very human-centric too, that the human organism

03:11:56.960 --> 03:12:04.560
is the epitome of life on earth. I don't know. I think there is some defundamental way in which

03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:08.960
a city is a living being in the same way that a human-

03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:16.400
But it doesn't give rise to an offspring city. It doesn't work by natural selection. It works by,

03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:23.600
if anything, memes. It works by copying itself conceptually as a mode of being.

03:12:24.480 --> 03:12:31.600
So maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms that are really essential to life on earth.

03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:37.440
Maybe it's much more important about the collective aspect of human nature, the collective

03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:43.680
intelligence than the individual intelligence. Maybe the collective humanity is the organism,

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:49.760
and the thing that defines the collective intelligence of humanity is the ideas,

03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:56.880
and maybe the way that manifests itself is cities, or societies, or geographically

03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:02.000
constrained societies, or nations, and all that kind of stuff. From an alien perspective,

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:08.640
it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing, not from a place of ignorance.

03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:14.240
What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works. I don't have any problem with what

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:22.080
you're saying, really, except that it's not possible without the humans. We went from a

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:29.280
hunter-gatherer type economy, if you like, without cities, and as soon as we get into

03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:35.680
human evolution, and culture, and society, and so on, then yes, there are other forms of evolution,

03:13:36.560 --> 03:13:42.640
other forms of change, but cities don't directly propagate themselves. They propagate themselves

03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:46.640
through human societies, and human societies only exist because humans, as individuals,

03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:52.720
propagate themselves. So there is a hierarchy there, and without the humans in the first place,

03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:59.760
none of the rest of it exists. So to you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit on which

03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:03.200
evolution can operate. I think it's a really important thing, yes.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:10.480
Yeah, and we don't have any other better ideas than evolution for how to create life.

03:14:10.480 --> 03:14:15.520
I never came across a better idea than evolution. I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.

03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:22.400
You mentioned that's no automator, and so on, and I don't think specifically about that,

03:14:22.400 --> 03:14:26.240
but I have thought about it in terms of selective units at the origin of life, and

03:14:26.320 --> 03:14:31.360
the difference between evolvability and complexity, or just increasing complexity,

03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:39.440
but within very narrowly defined limits. The great thing about genes and about selection

03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:43.440
is it just knocks down all those limits. It gives you a world of information in the end,

03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:50.160
which is limited only by the biophysical reality of what kind of an organism you are, what kind

03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:55.760
of a planet you live on, and so on. And cities and all these other forms that look alive and

03:14:55.760 --> 03:15:00.720
could be described as alive, because they can't propagate themselves, can only exist

03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:03.920
as the product of something that did propagate itself.

03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:11.600
Yeah. I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth to that kind of way of looking at things,

03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:18.240
but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud among us.

03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:24.080
I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this, because I can't say that my world view

03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:29.840
is particularly uplifting, but in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not.

03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:37.200
Science is about what's reality, what's out there, why is it this way? And I think there's

03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:42.720
beauty in that too. There's beauty in darkness. You write about life and death

03:15:44.080 --> 03:15:51.120
at the biological level. Does the question of suicide, why live, does the question of

03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:54.800
why the human mind is capable of depression? Are you able to

03:15:57.200 --> 03:16:04.960
introspect that from a place of biology? Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places?

03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:18.320
Why can we commit suicide? Why can we go suffer period, but also suffer from a feeling of

03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:24.160
meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take you? Is this a feature of

03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:33.200
life or is it a bug? I don't know. I mean, if it's a feature of life, then I suppose it would have

03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:39.200
to be true of other organisms as well. And I don't know. We were talking about dogs earlier on and

03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:46.720
they can certainly be very sad and upset and may mooch for days after their owner died or something

03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:53.200
like that. So I suspect in some sense it's a feature of biology. It's probably a feature

03:16:53.200 --> 03:17:01.920
of mortality. But beyond all of that, I mean, I guess there's two ways you could come at it.

03:17:01.920 --> 03:17:08.560
One of them would be to say, well, you can effectively do the math and come to the conclusion

03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:12.800
that it's all pointless and that there's really no point in me being here any longer.

03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:19.360
And maybe that's true. In the greater scheme of things, you can justify yourself in terms

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:23.760
of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well. And you end up with a very bleak place

03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:29.040
just by logic. In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning at all.

03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:34.720
Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in, that we have transient joy. But with transient

03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:39.920
joy, we have transient misery as well. And sometimes with everything in biology,

03:17:40.880 --> 03:17:46.800
getting the regulation right is practically impossible. You will always have a bell-shaped

03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:51.280
curve where some people unfortunately are at the joy end and some people are at the

03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:58.560
misery end. And that's the way brains are wired. And I doubt there's ever an escape from that.

03:17:58.560 --> 03:18:04.320
It's the same with sex and everything else as well. You can't regulate it. So

03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:08.320
it's anything goes. It's all part of biology.

03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:21.360
Amen to that. Let me on writing in your book, Power, Sex, and Suicide. First of all,

03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:27.600
can I just read off the books you've written? If there's any better titles and topics to be covered,

03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:31.360
I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write next.

03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:36.960
I hope there's things you write next. First, you wrote Oxygen, the molecule that made the world,

03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:42.800
as we've talked about, this idea of the role of oxygen in life on Earth. Then, wait for it,

03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:49.440
Power, Sex, Suicide, Mitochondria, and the Meaning of Life. Then, Life Ascending,

03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:54.640
the Ten Great Inventions of Evolution, The Vital Question, the first book I've read of yours,

03:18:54.640 --> 03:19:00.080
The Vital Question, Why is Life the Way It Is, and the new book, Transformer,

03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:08.480
The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power, Sex, and Suicide, you write about writing,

03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:11.680
or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing.

03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:19.360
You write, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching

03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:26.880
his revision to the Guide's entry on the Earth, which originally read harmless. By the way,

03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:33.200
also as a side question, I would like to ask you what would be your summary of what Earth is.

03:19:34.560 --> 03:19:40.720
You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down by the Guide to read mostly harmless.

03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:47.520
I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate, if not through absurd editing

03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:53.360
decisions, at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years

03:19:53.360 --> 03:19:59.520
have passed since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published, and I am resisting

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:06.000
the temptation to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:11.280
arguments in The Origin of Species through his multiple revisions, in which he dealt with

03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:17.920
criticisms and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak

03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:26.080
for itself, even if it turns out to be wrong. Let me ask the question about writing, both your

03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:31.440
students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant writings on science and

03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:44.960
humanity I've ever read. What's the process of writing? If you were to talk to young Darwin

03:20:44.960 --> 03:20:52.480
or the young you and just young anybody and give advice about how to write and how to write well

03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:59.760
about these big topics, what would you say? I suppose there's a couple of points. One of them is

03:21:01.120 --> 03:21:08.080
what's the story? What do I want to know? What do I want to convey? Why does it matter to anybody?

03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:19.200
And very often, the biggest, most interesting questions, the childlike questions are the one

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:23.200
actually that everybody wants to ask but don't quite do it in case they look stupid.

03:21:24.720 --> 03:21:29.360
One of the nice things about being in science is the longer you're in, the more you realize that

03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:32.560
everybody doesn't know the answer to these questions and it's not so stupid to ask them

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:43.920
after all. Trying to ask the questions that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15,

03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:48.880
16 when I was really hungry to know about the world and didn't know very much about it and

03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:58.880
wanted to go to the edge of what we know but be helped to get there. I don't want to be

03:21:59.120 --> 03:22:04.720
you know too much terminology and so I want someone to keep a clean eye on what the question is.

03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:14.160
Beyond that, I've wondered a lot about who am I writing for and that was in the end

03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:24.720
the only answer I had was myself at the age of 15 or 16 because even if you just don't know who's

03:22:24.720 --> 03:22:30.480
reading but also where are they reading it? Are they reading it in the bath or in bed or on the

03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:39.120
metro or listening to an audiobook? Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages because

03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:45.520
you read three pages at a time or are you really irritated by that? You're going to get criticism

03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:50.000
from people who are irritated by what you're doing and you don't know who they are or what

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:53.760
you're going to do that's going to irritate people and in the end all you can do is just try and

03:22:55.200 --> 03:23:02.400
please yourself and that means well what are these big fun fascinating and big questions

03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:08.640
and what do we know about it and can I convey that? I kind of learned in trying to write

03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:18.000
first of all say what we know and I was shocked in the first couple of books how often I came up

03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:28.400
quickly against all the stuff we don't know. I realized later on in supervising various physicists

03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:33.440
and mathematicians who are PhD students and their maths is way beyond what I can do

03:23:34.320 --> 03:23:38.480
but the process of trying to work out what are we actually going to model here? What's going into

03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:42.320
this equation is a very similar one to writing. What am I going to put on a page? What's the

03:23:42.320 --> 03:23:47.840
simplest possible way I can encapsulate this idea so that I now have it as a unit that I can kind of

03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:52.960
see how it interacts with the other units and you realize that well if this is like that and

03:23:52.960 --> 03:24:00.640
this is like this then then that can't be true. So you end up navigating your own path through

03:24:00.640 --> 03:24:03.840
this landscape and that can be thrilling because you don't know where it's going

03:24:05.280 --> 03:24:09.360
and I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have worked for people because

03:24:09.360 --> 03:24:13.120
this sense of the thrilling adventure ride I don't know where it's going either.

03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:17.680
So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know

03:24:18.240 --> 03:24:22.480
and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two

03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:30.560
and that's where the story emerges. What about the edit? Do you find yourself to the point of this

03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:40.560
editing dial to mostly harmless? To arrive at simplicity do you find the edit as productive

03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:47.120
or does it destroy the magic that was originally there? No I usually find I think I'm perhaps a

03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:51.600
better editor than I am a writer. I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite. Put a bunch of

03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:57.120
crap on the page first and then see where the edit where it takes. Yeah but then then there's

03:24:57.120 --> 03:25:04.080
the professional editors who come along as well and I mean in Transformer the editor came back to

03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:08.560
me after I'd sent me a few two months after I sent the first edition he'd read the whole thing and

03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:14.080
he said the first two chapters prevent a formidable hurdle to the general reader.

03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:19.520
Go and do something about it. Yes. And that was the last thing I really wanted. Your editor sounds

03:25:19.520 --> 03:25:26.560
very eloquent in speech. Yeah well this was an email but I thought about it and you know the

03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:33.920
bottom line is he was right and so I put the whole thing aside for about two months. Spent the summer

03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:39.760
this would have been I guess last summer and then turned to it with full attention in about

03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:43.920
September or something and rewrote those chapters almost from scratch. I kept some of the material

03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:49.600
but it took me a long time to process it to work out what needs to change. Where does it need to

03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:53.760
change? I wasn't writing in this time. How am I going to tell this story better so it's more

03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:58.560
accessible and interesting and in the end I think it worked. It's still difficult. It's still

03:25:58.560 --> 03:26:04.080
biochemistry but as he ended up saying now he's got a barreling energy to it and I was

03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:07.920
you know because he'd been because he told me the truth the first time I decided to believe that

03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:15.200
he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted. Could you give advice

03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:21.520
to young people in general? Folks in high school, folks in college, how to take on some of the big

03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:25.520
questions you've taken on. Now you've done that in the space of biology and expand it out.

03:26:26.480 --> 03:26:27.840
How can they

03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:37.200
have a career they can be proud of or have a life they can be proud of? Gosh that's a big question.

03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:48.240
I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom you can impart. Yeah so the only advice that I actually

03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:58.000
ever give to my students is follow what you're interested in because they're often worried

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.160
that if they make this decision now and do this course instead of that course then they're going

03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:10.320
to restrict their career opportunities and there isn't a career path in science. I mean there is

03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:17.680
but there isn't. There's a lot of competition. There's a lot of death symbolically. So who

03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:25.840
survives? The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it and they're very

03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:33.280
often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present

03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:38.320
because if you do a PhD you've competed hard to get onto the PhD then you have to compete hard

03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:45.120
to get a post-doc job and you have the next one maybe on another continent and it's only two years

03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:51.600
anyway and there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.

03:27:52.880 --> 03:27:58.080
And there's always the next step to compete if you get a faculty position you get a tenure and

03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:03.040
with tenure go full professor full professor then you go to some kind of whatever the discipline is

03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:07.040
there's an award if you're in physics you're always competing for the Nobel Prize there's

03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:12.560
different awards and then eventually you're all competing to I mean there's always a competition.

03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:16.720
So there is no happiness. Happiness does not lie. If you're looking into the future yes.

03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:23.440
And if what you're caring about is a career then it's probably not the one for you. If though

03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:29.600
you can put that aside and you know I've also worked in industry for a brief period and I

03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:37.120
was made redundant twice so I know that you know there's no guarantee you've got a career that way

03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:44.960
either. Yes. So live in the moment and try and enjoy what you're doing and that means really

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:52.720
go to the themes that you're most interested in and try and follow them as well as you can

03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:59.120
and that tends to pay back in surprising ways. I don't know if you've found this as well but

03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:07.280
I've found that people will help you often if they see some light shining in the eye

03:29:07.840 --> 03:29:14.880
and you're excited about their subject and you know just want to talk about it

03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:20.720
and they know that their friend in California has got a job coming up they'll say go for this this

03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:28.000
guy's all right you know they'll use the network to help you out if you really care and you're not

03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:31.520
going to have a job two years down the line but if you what you really care about is what you're

03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:37.040
doing now then it doesn't matter if you have a job in two years time or not it'll work itself out

03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:42.960
if you've got the light in your eye and so that's the only advice I can give and most people

03:29:43.760 --> 03:29:48.960
probably drop out through that system because the fight is just not worth it for them.

03:29:49.680 --> 03:29:54.400
Yeah when you have the light in your eye when you have the excitement for the thing what happens is

03:29:54.400 --> 03:29:58.480
you start to surround yourself with others they're interested in that same thing that also have the

03:29:58.480 --> 03:30:04.480
light if you really are rigorous about this because I think it does take it's it doesn't

03:30:05.280 --> 03:30:10.160
it takes effort to make. Oh you've got to be obsessive but if you're doing what you really

03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:15.200
love doing then it's not work anymore is what you do. Yeah but I also mean the surrounding

03:30:15.200 --> 03:30:19.920
yourself with other people that are obsessed about the same thing because that takes some work as

03:30:19.920 --> 03:30:25.280
well yes you know and look finding the right yeah finding the right mentors the collaborators

03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:32.800
because I think one of the problem with the PhD process is people are not careful enough

03:30:32.800 --> 03:30:39.200
in picking their mentors those are people mentors and colleagues and so on those are people going to

03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:45.840
define the the direction of your life the how much you love a thing how much I mean the the power of

03:30:45.840 --> 03:30:53.360
just like the few little conversations you have in the hallway it's incredible so you have to be

03:30:53.360 --> 03:30:59.440
a little bit careful in that sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned really

03:31:00.880 --> 03:31:08.240
pursue I suppose the subject as much as you pursue the people that do that subject so like

03:31:08.240 --> 03:31:12.960
both the whole dance they kind of go together yeah they do they really do but take that that

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:17.120
part seriously and probably in the way you're describing it

03:31:19.200 --> 03:31:24.800
careful how you define success because you'll never find happiness in success I know there's

03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:29.520
a lovely quote from Robert Louis Stevenson I think who said nothing in life is so

03:31:29.520 --> 03:31:37.760
disenchanting as attainment yeah so I mean in some sense the the true definition of success is

03:31:37.760 --> 03:31:46.640
is getting to do today what you really enjoy doing just what fills you with joy and that's

03:31:46.640 --> 03:31:53.520
ultimately success so success isn't the thing beyond the horizon the big stat the the the big

03:31:53.520 --> 03:31:58.560
trophy the the financial I think it's as close as we can get to happiness that's not to say you're

03:31:58.560 --> 03:32:04.000
full of joy all the time but it's as close as we can get to a sustained human happiness is by

03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:07.760
getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis and if what you're looking for

03:32:08.480 --> 03:32:14.960
is the the the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a fellowship

03:32:14.960 --> 03:32:22.320
or whatever it is then you know I've known people like this who they they're eaten away by the

03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:29.280
by the anger of kind of caustic resentment that they've not been awarded this prize that they

03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:34.720
deserve and the other way if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them

03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:39.520
I've gotten a chance to see that it also

03:32:42.320 --> 03:32:47.040
the more quote unquote successful you are in that sense the more you run the danger of

03:32:49.760 --> 03:32:56.720
growing ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life you start to believe

03:32:56.720 --> 03:33:02.640
that you figured it all out as opposed to I think what the ultimately the most fun thing is is being

03:33:02.640 --> 03:33:07.600
curious about everything around you being constantly surprised and these little moments

03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:12.720
of discovery of enjoying enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you and I think

03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:16.960
the bigger ego grows the more you start to take yourself seriously the less you're able to enjoy

03:33:16.960 --> 03:33:24.880
that oh man I couldn't agree more so you know the the summary from harmless to mostly harmless

03:33:25.600 --> 03:33:33.360
in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how would you try to summarize earth and you know if you were

03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:39.680
given if you have to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences and maybe throw in meaning

03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:48.000
of life in there like what why why why maybe is that a defining thing about humans that we care

03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:56.000
about the meaning of the whole thing I wonder I wonder if that should be part of the the these

03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:01.840
creatures seem to be very lost yes they're always asking why I mean that's my defining question is

03:34:01.840 --> 03:34:09.600
why it was uh as people used to make a joke I have a small scar on my forehead from a climbing accident

03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:15.520
years ago uh and the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock and he shouted something he

03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:19.920
shouted below I think meaning that the rock was coming down and uh and I hadn't caught what he

03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:27.360
said so I looked up and it smashed straight on my forehead and um and everybody around me uh took

03:34:27.360 --> 03:34:35.040
the piss saying he looked up to ask why yeah but that that's a human imperative that's part of

03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:43.760
what it means to be human look up to the sky and ask why and ask why uh so your question defined

03:34:43.760 --> 03:34:52.080
the earth um I'm not sure I can do that I mean the first word that comes to mind is living

03:34:54.640 --> 03:35:00.400
I wouldn't like to say mostly living but perhaps mostly well it's interesting because like if you

03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:09.840
were to to write the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I suppose say our idea uh that we talked

03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:16.000
about the bacteria is the most prominent form of life throughout the galaxy and the universe

03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:23.680
I suppose the earth would be kind of unique and would require its abundance in that case

03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:31.440
yeah it's profligate it's rich it's enormously enormously living so how how would you describe

03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:41.520
that it's not bacteria it's um eukaryotic yeah well I mean that's that's the technical term

03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:49.840
but it is basically it's uh yeah and then and how would I describe that I've I've actually really

03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:56.720
struggled with that term because the word I mean there's few words quite as good as eukaryotic to

03:35:56.720 --> 03:36:00.800
put everybody off immediately you start using words like that and they'll leave the room

03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:08.000
a Krebs cycle is another one that gets people to leave the room but um but but but so I've tried

03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:12.640
to think is there another word for eukaryotic that I can use and really the only word that I've been

03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:21.840
able to use is complex uh complex cells uh complex life and so on and that word it serves one

03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:29.440
immediate purpose which is to convey an impression but then it it it means so many different things

03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:37.440
just everybody that actually is lost immediately and so it's a kind of well that's a noticeable

03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:43.360
from the perspective of other planets that is a noticeable phase transition of complexity is the

03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:52.800
eukaryotic what about the harmless and the mostly harmless is that kind of probably accurate on a

03:36:53.040 --> 03:37:00.080
universal kind of scale I don't think that uh humanity is in any danger of disturbing the

03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:07.280
universe at the moment at the moment which is why the mostly we don't know depends what ilan is up

03:37:07.280 --> 03:37:14.640
to depends how many rockets I think uh it'll be still even then a while I think before uh before

03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:21.440
we disturb the fabric of time and space was the aforementioned andre carpati I think he summarized

03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:31.200
earth as um as a system where you uh hammer it with a bunch of photons the input is like

03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:38.560
photons and the output is rockets if you just well that's a hell of a lot of photons before

03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:44.400
there was a rocket yeah but like you know maybe maybe in the span of the universe it's not it's

03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:50.560
not that much time and so and I do wonder you know what the future is whether we're just in

03:37:50.560 --> 03:37:56.000
the early beginnings of this earth which is important when you try to summarize it or we're

03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:03.760
at the end where humans have finally gained the ability to destroy the entirety of this beautiful

03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:09.920
project we got going on now with nuclear weapons with engineered viruses with all those kinds of

03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:16.000
things or just inadvertently through global warming and pollution and so on we're quite capable I mean

03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:20.720
we just need to pass the tipping point I mean I think we're more likely to do it inadvertently

03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:27.680
than through a nuclear war which could happen at any time but um my fear is

03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:35.040
is we just don't know where the tipping points are and we will we kind of think we're smart

03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:39.600
enough to fix the problem quickly if we really need to I think that's the that's the overriding

03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:45.280
assumption that we're all right for now maybe in 20 years time it's going to be a calamitous

03:38:45.280 --> 03:38:48.560
problem and then we'll really need to put some serious mental power into fixing it

03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:55.840
without seriously worrying that perhaps that is too late and that however brilliant we are

03:38:56.720 --> 03:39:03.920
it's uh we miss the boat and just walk off the cliff I don't know I have optimism in humans being

03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:10.480
clever descendants oh I have I have no doubt that we can fix the problem but it's an urgent problem

03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:16.960
um we need to fix it pretty sharpish and I do have doubts about whether politically we are

03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:24.400
capable of coming together enough to uh not just in any one country but around the planet to to

03:39:24.400 --> 03:39:30.480
I mean I know we can do it but do we have the will do we have the the the vision to uh to accomplish

03:39:30.480 --> 03:39:37.360
it that's what makes this whole ride fun I don't know not only do we not know if we can handle the

03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:43.120
crises before us we don't even know all the crises that are going to be before us in the next 20

03:39:43.120 --> 03:39:49.520
years the the the ones I think that will most likely challenge us in the 21st century are the

03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:56.080
ones we don't even expect people didn't expect world war ii at the end of world war ii uh well

03:39:56.080 --> 03:40:01.200
some folks did but yeah not not at the end of world war ii but by the 19 late 1920s I think

03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:05.840
people were beginning to worry about it yeah no there's always people worrying about everything

03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:10.640
so if you focus on the thing that people worry about yes because there's a million things people

03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:16.000
worry about it and 99.99999 percent of them don't come to be of course the people that turn out to

03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:20.880
be right they'll say I knew all along but that's not you know that's not an accurate way of knowing

03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:26.400
what you could have predicted I think rationally speaking you can worry about it but nobody thought

03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:31.520
you could have another world war the war to end all wars why would you have another war and the

03:40:31.520 --> 03:40:38.960
idea of nuclear weapons just technologically is a very difficult thing to anticipate to create

03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:44.720
a weapon that just jumps orders of magnitude and destructive capability and of course we can

03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:53.280
intuit all the things like engineered viruses nanobots artificial intelligence uh yes all the

03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:58.800
different complicated global effects of global warming so how that changes the allocation

03:40:58.800 --> 03:41:04.320
resources the flow of energy the tension between countries the military conflict between countries

03:41:04.320 --> 03:41:11.280
the reallocation of power then looking at the role of china in this whole thing with with russia and

03:41:11.280 --> 03:41:18.560
growing influence of africa and the weird dynamics of europe and then america falling apart through

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:24.400
the political division fueled by uh recommender systems through twitter and facebook the whole

03:41:24.400 --> 03:41:31.200
beautiful mess is just fun and I think there's a lot of incredible engineers incredible scientists

03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:36.800
incredible human beings that while everyone is bickering and so on online for the fun of it on

03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:40.960
the weekends they're actually trying to build solutions and those are the people that will

03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:47.360
create something beautiful at least have you know that's the process of evolution it's uh there was

03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:54.800
it all started with a chuck norris uh single cell organism that went out from the vents

03:41:55.360 --> 03:42:01.440
and was the parent to all of us and for for that guy or lady or both i guess

03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:06.960
is a big thank you and i can't wait to what happens next and i'm glad there's

03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:11.680
incredible humans writing and studying it like you are nick it's a huge honor that you would

03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:16.720
talk to me this is fantastic this is really amazing i can't wait uh to read what you write

03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:24.880
next uh thank you for existing um and um thank you for talking today thank you

03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:29.840
thanks for listening to this conversation with nick laine to support this podcast

03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:35.440
please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from

03:42:35.440 --> 03:42:42.560
steve jobs i think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the intersection

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:52.080
of biology and technology a new era is beginning thank you for listening i hope to see you next time
