00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
The following is a conversation with Jared Kushner, former senior advisor to the

00:04.480 --> 00:09.120
president during the Donald Trump administration and author of Breaking

00:09.120 --> 00:11.120
History, a White House memoir.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.120
He's one of the most influential and effective presidential advisors in modern

00:16.120 --> 00:20.520
history, helping conduct negotiations with some of the most powerful leaders in

00:20.520 --> 00:26.360
the world and deliver results on trade, criminal justice reform, and historic

00:26.360 --> 00:28.840
progress towards peace in the Middle East.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.880
On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded conversation on topics of war and

00:33.880 --> 00:37.360
peace, history and power in the Middle East and beyond.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.680
This was about a day and a half before the Hamas attack on Israel.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.280
And then we felt we must sit down again on Monday, October 9th, and add a

00:47.280 --> 00:49.280
discussion on the current situation.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.400
We opened the podcast with the second newly recorded part.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.560
My heart goes out to everyone who has and is suffering in this war.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.960
I pray for your strength and for the long-term peace and flourishing of

01:04.960 --> 01:07.240
the Israeli and Palestinian people.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.000
I love you all.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.400
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.200
And now dear friends, here's Jared Kushner.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.600
We did a lot of this conversation before the Hamas attack on Israel, and we

01:21.800 --> 01:25.920
decided to sit down again and finish the discussion to address the current

01:25.920 --> 01:28.320
situation, which is still developing.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.840
If I may allow me to summarize the situation as it stands today, it's

01:32.880 --> 01:35.400
morning, Monday, October 9th.

01:36.240 --> 01:42.240
On Saturday, October 7th, at 6.30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of

01:42.240 --> 01:44.120
rockets into southern Israel.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.480
The rocket attack served as cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel

01:48.480 --> 01:51.680
territory by over 1,000 Hamas Militants.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.200
This is shortly after at 7.40 AM.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.400
The Hamas Militants went door to door in border towns, killing civilians and

02:00.400 --> 02:02.920
taking captives, including women and children.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.840
In response to this, Israeli air force began carrying out strikes in Gaza.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.680
Also fighting on the ground in Israel to clear out Hamas Militants from

02:11.680 --> 02:16.280
Israel territory and preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for potential

02:16.280 --> 02:18.080
ground attack on Hamas and Gaza.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.680
Now, of course, this is what it appears to be right now.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.040
And this along with other things might change because the

02:26.040 --> 02:27.360
situation is still developing.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.560
The IDF is ordering civilian residents of Gaza to evacuate their

02:31.560 --> 02:32.720
homes for their safety.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.800
Benjamin Netanyahu declared war in several statements and warned Israelis

02:37.800 --> 02:40.040
to brace themselves for a long and difficult war.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.480
Just today, Israeli ministers ordered a quote, complete siege of Gaza,

02:45.880 --> 02:50.640
interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza.

02:51.240 --> 02:57.640
As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1200 people and over 130

02:57.640 --> 02:59.920
hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.760
So as I said, the events are rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly

03:05.760 --> 03:12.840
increase, but hopefully our words here can at least in part speak to the, the

03:12.920 --> 03:18.600
timeless underlying currents of the history and as you write about the

03:18.600 --> 03:20.440
power dynamics of the region.

03:21.240 --> 03:26.320
So for people who don't know, Gaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of

03:26.320 --> 03:28.160
territory along the Mediterranean sea.

03:28.560 --> 03:33.760
It borders Israel on the East and North and Egypt on the Southwest.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.520
It's densely populated, about 2.3 million people.

03:38.200 --> 03:44.320
And there's been a blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt since 2007,

03:44.480 --> 03:45.960
when Hamas took power.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.120
I could just summarize that Hamas is a Palestinian militant group,

03:50.320 --> 03:52.120
which rules the Gaza strip.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.160
It originated in 1988 and it came to power in Gaza in 2006.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.920
That's part of its charter.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.840
It's sworn to the destruction of Israel and it is designated by the United

04:03.880 --> 04:09.240
States, European Union, UK, and of course, Israel as a terrorist group.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.600
So given that context, what are your feelings as a human being and what is

04:14.600 --> 04:19.640
your analysis as the former senior advisor to the president under the Trump

04:19.640 --> 04:22.880
administration of the current situation in Israel and Gaza?

04:23.320 --> 04:28.320
So I think you did an excellent job of summarizing a lot of the context, but

04:28.960 --> 04:33.360
watching what's unfolded over the last 48 hours has been truly heartbreaking to

04:33.360 --> 04:38.200
see. We're still in the early stages of what's developing, but seeing the images

04:38.920 --> 04:43.920
on X of militants, terrorists going door to door with machine guns, gunning down

04:46.280 --> 04:51.280
innocent civilians, seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers, seeing young 20-year-olds

04:53.080 --> 04:58.080
at a rave dance party to celebrate peace with militants flying in and then shooting

04:58.960 --> 05:03.960
machine guns to kill people indiscriminately, seeing young children captive and

05:07.560 --> 05:12.560
held prisoner, seeing 80-year-old grandmothers, a Holocaust survivor, also being

05:12.640 --> 05:13.640
taken captive.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.520
These are just images and actions that we have not seen in this world since 9-11.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.520
This is a terror attack on the scale of which we have not seen, and it's been

05:25.800 --> 05:28.800
incredibly hard for a lot of people to comprehend.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.800
My heart goes out obviously to all of the families of the victims, to the families

05:36.800 --> 05:41.800
of those who are held in captive now, and to all of Israel, because one of the

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
beautiful things about the state of Israel is that there are so many people

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
there.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
When one Israeli is hurting, the entire nation comes together.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.600
It's a shame that it's taking an action like this to unify the nation, but I have

05:58.600 --> 06:03.600
seen incredibly beautiful signs over the last 48 hours of a country coming together.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.480
The Jewish people have been under oppression before.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.920
The Jewish people know what it's like, and seeing people rally together to fight for

06:15.480 --> 06:20.480
their homeland, to try to reestablish safety, is a very beautiful thing to watch.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.600
I wish it wasn't something we had to watch, but it is.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.920
With that being said, though, the backdrop, I've been speaking to friends over the last

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
couple of days.

06:30.920 --> 06:35.920
I have one friend I spoke with last night who was saying that a good friend messaged

06:36.600 --> 06:40.800
him saying, I'm going in, we're going to do some operations to try to free some of the

06:40.800 --> 06:44.480
hostages held in one of the kippurzes, messaged him the next morning.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.160
He was one of the first through the door to try to free these hostages, and he was killed

06:49.160 --> 06:50.160
by a Hamas militant.

06:50.360 --> 06:56.160
And sadly, we're going to be hearing many, many more stories of brave Israeli soldiers

06:56.480 --> 07:01.480
trying to get these terrorists out of Israel, trying to free innocent civilians who,

07:02.560 --> 07:05.240
unfortunately, are risking their lives to do it.

07:05.720 --> 07:12.240
And they're all heroes, but some will have a less good fate than others, sadly.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.960
So it's a very, very heartbreaking moment.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.800
And I do think that it's very important at this moment in time for the entire world to

07:22.120 --> 07:23.320
stand behind Israel.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.120
I think that Hamas has shown the entire world who they really are.

07:28.560 --> 07:35.880
I think what their aim is, what they're willing to do and all of the strong security

07:35.880 --> 07:41.720
that Israel's put in place over the last years, which in some instances was criticized

07:42.040 --> 07:46.360
I think is now being validated that that there was a real threat that they were looking

07:46.360 --> 07:53.520
to deter. So short answer is my heart is broken, praying for peace, praying for strength,

07:53.520 --> 08:00.680
praying for praying for Israel to do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation

08:00.680 --> 08:05.000
again, which is either eliminating or severely degrading Hamas's capabilities.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.400
There cannot be peace in Israel and in the Middle East while there is a terror group

08:10.920 --> 08:16.320
that is being funded by Iran that is allowed to flourish and is allowed to plan operations

08:16.320 --> 08:19.040
that are going to aim to kill innocent civilians.

08:19.640 --> 08:26.480
And so as somebody who was formerly in this position, who was intimately involved with

08:26.480 --> 08:33.640
Israel, with the strategies to minimize attacks from Hamas and to try to turn the region

08:33.640 --> 08:37.760
around. And I think we did do a very substantial job under President Trump.

08:38.240 --> 08:43.720
The Middle East went from one of the most chaotic regions in the world. You had ISIS

08:44.000 --> 08:48.800
in 2016. ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio. They're beheading journalists. They

08:48.800 --> 08:54.320
were they were they were killing Christians. They controlled eight million people. They

08:54.320 --> 09:02.720
were planning attacks all over the world from their their caliphate. They were using

09:02.720 --> 09:07.240
the Internet to radicalize people. We had the San Bernardino shooting in America. We

09:07.240 --> 09:13.640
had the Pulse nightclub shooting in in Orlando. And there was real threat. And then you

09:13.640 --> 09:18.160
had Iran, which was given one hundred and fifty billion dollars in a glide path to a

09:18.160 --> 09:23.760
nuclear weapon. And they were using their newfound riches to fund Hamas, Hezbollah,

09:24.040 --> 09:29.480
the Houthis, different rebels all over the region that were looking to destabilize

09:29.480 --> 09:34.520
further. Syria was in a civil war where five hundred thousand people were killed. Yemen

09:34.520 --> 09:39.840
was destabilized. Libya was destabilized. And it was just a mess. And all of America's

09:39.840 --> 09:45.440
allies had felt betrayed. President Trump came into power. We rebuilt the trust and

09:45.440 --> 09:50.720
the relationships with all of our traditional allies. We were able to eliminate ISIS, the

09:51.040 --> 09:56.480
territorial caliphate. And then we were able to project strength in the region, really

09:56.520 --> 10:01.320
go after Iran's wallet. We were able to stop through through crushing sanctions, a lot

10:01.320 --> 10:06.080
of their financial resources which they were using to fund all these terror groups. And

10:06.080 --> 10:12.120
so we left the Middle East with six peace deals and a fairly peaceful world. So seeing

10:12.120 --> 10:16.200
what's happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it's horrible to see that

10:16.200 --> 10:22.640
it's occurring. And I pray that those in power will make the right decisions to to

10:22.640 --> 10:27.800
restore safety, but also to potentially create a better paradigm for peace in the

10:27.800 --> 10:28.280
future.

10:28.720 --> 10:35.000
So I have a lot of questions to ask you about the journey towards this historic progress

10:35.000 --> 10:39.480
towards peace with the Abraham Accords. But first on this situation, to step back and

10:39.480 --> 10:44.840
some of the history. Is there things about the history of Hamas and Gaza that's important

10:44.840 --> 10:50.840
to understand what is happening now? Just your comments, your thoughts, your understanding

10:50.840 --> 10:51.440
of Hamas?

10:51.760 --> 10:55.960
I think you did an excellent job, Lex, of really giving the summary. Just a couple things

10:55.960 --> 11:00.760
maybe I'll add to it is that Hamas was originally founded from the Muslim Brotherhood in

11:00.760 --> 11:06.960
Egypt, which is a group that's caused a lot of issues in the region. They've attacked

11:06.960 --> 11:12.120
Israel many times in the past. There's a lot of discussion about how Israel is an

11:12.120 --> 11:17.120
occupying power. Well, in Gaza in 2005, they withdrew from all the land, and then they

11:17.120 --> 11:21.160
say Israel's an apartheid state. Well, Israel then gave governance of the region to the

11:21.160 --> 11:25.520
Palestinians. And then what's happened is, is the Palestinian people's lives have now

11:25.520 --> 11:33.800
gone down, not up since then. I will say that under Hamas's leadership in Gaza, the

11:33.800 --> 11:38.840
people who have suffered the most are the Palestinian people. And I've watched cries

11:38.840 --> 11:44.560
throughout my time in government from people saying, we want to see the Palestinian people

11:44.560 --> 11:49.800
live a better life. I agree with those people. I think that the Palestinian people in Gaza

11:49.800 --> 11:56.520
are essentially hostages. In Gaza, you have basically 2.2 million people that are being

11:56.520 --> 12:02.480
held hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists. And that's really the problem. And I would just

12:02.480 --> 12:10.320
encourage people to push their attention and energy in this moment and their anger towards

12:10.320 --> 12:17.480
Hamas. Those are the people who are killing innocent civilians, who are murdering indiscriminately.

12:17.480 --> 12:23.240
And those are the people who have held back the Palestinians from having a better life.

12:23.240 --> 12:29.000
And just finally, what I would say is, what we saw with Hamas was that if you go back

12:29.000 --> 12:34.660
to 2007, they basically had just one plan that they did over and over. And we were very

12:34.660 --> 12:38.920
careful to try to monitor very closely and stop the Iranian money and the resources from

12:38.920 --> 12:43.440
coming in. And again, we took a little bit of criticism from the international community

12:43.600 --> 12:48.600
from keeping the border tight. But unfortunately, every time you'd allow construction materials

12:48.600 --> 12:52.720
to go into Gaza, they'd use them to build tunnels, not homes. You would have equipment

12:52.720 --> 12:57.320
that would come in to build pipes. They'd turn it into bombs. So it was very, very hard

12:57.320 --> 13:02.080
to figure out how do you get the resources into Gaza to help people have a better life,

13:02.080 --> 13:06.240
while at the same time, the leadership in Gaza was taking all those resources and turning

13:06.240 --> 13:09.800
it into military equipment to attack Israel.

13:09.880 --> 13:15.400
What role does Iran play in this war, in this connection to Hamas? Can you speak to the

13:15.400 --> 13:21.040
connection between Hamas and Iran that's important to understand, especially as this most recent

13:21.040 --> 13:22.040
attack unfolds?

13:22.040 --> 13:28.080
Sure. So the correlation, I mean, there's reports that Iran is behind the attack. Hamas

13:28.080 --> 13:34.800
has thanked Iran for their support. And it's been very well known that Iran supports the

13:34.800 --> 13:38.200
destruction of the state of Israel. And I won't say Iran as a country. I'll talk about

13:38.200 --> 13:41.920
Iran in the leadership. There's actually a beautiful thing I saw on the internet, where

13:41.920 --> 13:47.200
at one of the soccer games in Iran, they were trying to rally support for the Hamas terror

13:47.200 --> 13:52.640
attacks. And a lot of people in the crowds were chanting, you know, F you to the regime.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.040
Because I think the Iranian people, the Persian people generally are peace loving people who

13:57.040 --> 14:04.280
don't want to see this focus on destruction and annihilation. But you saw this in 2015-2016,

14:04.280 --> 14:10.480
when the Iranian government had resources, the region was less safe. And since now there's

14:10.480 --> 14:15.880
been more resources allowed to go to the Iranian regime by lack of enforcement of sanctions.

14:15.880 --> 14:21.160
And as a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas. They were funding the Houthis. Now

14:21.160 --> 14:24.360
there's a little bit of a detente between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going

14:24.360 --> 14:28.000
down, which only further proves that Iran was behind the Houthis, which is what the

14:28.000 --> 14:33.600
Saudis had been saying for years and Iran was denying. So there's a very strong relationship

14:33.600 --> 14:39.080
between the two. And we always knew that the way that Iran fights wars or fights conflicts

14:39.080 --> 14:43.840
is never directly, it's usually through its proxies. And in this case, a Hamas has been

14:43.840 --> 14:50.760
a proxy for Iran, who wanted to obviously see the destruction of Israel, but also does

14:50.760 --> 14:56.040
not want to see the Israelis and the Saudis come together for a peace agreement.

14:56.040 --> 15:02.880
The name of this operation, of the Hamas operation, is Al-Aqsa Flood, referring to the Al-Aqsa

15:02.880 --> 15:07.920
Mosque. How much of this attack is about the Al-Aqsa Mosque?

15:07.920 --> 15:14.320
In actuality, I don't think any of it is, but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is something that all

15:14.320 --> 15:21.560
of the Shia jihadists have used for years in order to justify their actions that are

15:21.560 --> 15:26.880
aggressive towards Israel. So this is something I'll maybe even take a step back and go through.

15:26.880 --> 15:32.520
When I was working initially in my first year on the peace plan, I was doing a lot of listening.

15:32.520 --> 15:38.480
And quite frankly, a lot of what people were saying to me didn't make sense. And the reason

15:38.480 --> 15:42.520
why I was trying to figure out, they were talking about sovereignty over Al-Aqsa Mosque.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.080
The Al-Aqsa Mosque is a mosque that's built in the Holy of Holies, the Haram al-Sharif

15:47.520 --> 15:52.520
where the Jewish Beit Hamigdash, the Holy Temple, was built in a very religious place

15:52.520 --> 15:57.240
about after the temple was destroyed. Then there was a big mosque built there,

15:57.240 --> 16:05.920
and it's one of the more holy places in Islam now. So the big thing everyone was saying is,

16:05.920 --> 16:09.920
what do you do with this land where you have a mosque built over a very big Jewish site?

16:09.920 --> 16:14.960
And I was hearing all of the experts, and I always say experts with quotes,

16:15.120 --> 16:19.520
because only in Washington can you work on something for a decade and continue to fail,

16:19.520 --> 16:23.840
and then you basically leave and are considered an expert. But that's one of the problems with

16:23.840 --> 16:29.520
Washington, which maybe we could talk about later. But the notion here was I went and I said,

16:29.520 --> 16:35.280
let me try to understand what the issue is with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.760
I always felt the politicians were a little disconnected, so I commissioned several focus

16:39.760 --> 16:45.280
groups, one in Amman, one in Cairo, one in Dubai, and one in Ramallah. And I asked people,

16:46.160 --> 16:53.600
Muslims, what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? And time and time again,

16:53.600 --> 16:58.880
the most popular thing that they said was that Israel was not allowing access to the mosque for

16:58.880 --> 17:04.800
Muslims to pray. And what was interesting was that Israel's policy is to allow anyone who wants to

17:04.800 --> 17:08.720
come and pray peacefully at the sites to come and pray. Sometimes they have security issues

17:08.720 --> 17:15.520
when there's provocations. But by and large, since 1967, when Israel was able to take back

17:15.520 --> 17:20.240
Jerusalem in a defensive war, just to be very clear, they were attacked in the south and they

17:20.240 --> 17:25.520
were attacked from the east, and they basically were able to beat back the Jordanians and the

17:25.520 --> 17:31.920
Egyptians and then reconquer the old city of Jerusalem. And during that time, immediately

17:31.920 --> 17:37.040
after Israel then passed the Protection of Holy Places law, which was they basically took resources

17:37.040 --> 17:41.200
they didn't have and they said, we're going to restore the Christian sites, the Muslim sites,

17:41.200 --> 17:45.760
the Jewish sites. And they've worked to allow everyone access to the mosque. So today,

17:46.640 --> 17:52.320
any Muslim who wants to come can come and pray at the mosque. The mosque is, Israel's acknowledged

17:52.320 --> 17:59.280
that King Abdullah, the King of Jordan, is the custodian of the mosque. And as long as people

17:59.280 --> 18:03.680
want to come to the country and pray peacefully, they're able to do that. But if you look at a lot

18:03.680 --> 18:12.240
of the propaganda that's been used by ISIS or Iran to recruit terrorists or to justify their

18:12.240 --> 18:17.680
incursions, they often say they're doing it in the name of liberating the al-Aqsa mosque. But

18:17.680 --> 18:23.360
from an operational and pragmatic perspective today, any Muslim who wants to go to the mosque,

18:23.360 --> 18:28.000
you can book a flight to Israel now through Dubai because there's flights between Israel and Dubai.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.320
And as long as your country has relations with Israel and they'll accept your passport in there,

18:32.320 --> 18:36.560
you can come and pray and that's what Israel wants. Israel wants Jerusalem to be a place

18:36.560 --> 18:41.440
where all religions can come and celebrate together, but you have a lot of actors that

18:41.440 --> 18:48.400
look to find ways to use these religious tensions in order to sow division and justify violent

18:48.400 --> 18:54.640
behavior. I wonder how it's possible to lessen the effectiveness of that propaganda message

18:55.840 --> 19:00.800
that a lot of the war, a lot of the attacks about access to the al-Aqsa mosque,

19:01.440 --> 19:07.360
is there something you can speak to why that message hasn't disseminated across the Arab world?

19:07.360 --> 19:11.760
So Israel's good at a lot of things. They're not very good traditionally with public relations.

19:12.960 --> 19:19.280
After the Abraham Accords, we made the first Abraham Accords deal in August 2020 and then we

19:19.280 --> 19:24.480
made five other deals. We first did United Arab Emirates, then we did a deal with Bahrain,

19:24.480 --> 19:30.640
then we did a deal with Kosovo, then we did a deal with Sudan, then we did a deal with Morocco,

19:31.520 --> 19:37.680
and then we got the GCC deal done as well. The tension between Qatar, Saudi, UAE, Egypt,

19:37.680 --> 19:43.680
and Bahrain, and that was allowing us to create a pathway to then pursue the Israeli-Saudi

19:43.680 --> 19:47.760
normalization. So we had so much momentum then that the goal was just keep getting more

19:48.480 --> 19:53.280
countries to normalize relations with Israel. Once you create the connection between people

19:53.280 --> 19:58.080
and create the ability for people to do business together, the ability for flights to fly between,

19:58.640 --> 20:02.640
then you would just start naturally having people coming and everyone has a smartphone today so they

20:02.640 --> 20:08.400
can then post and combat the misinformation that's been out there. This misinformation is not

20:08.400 --> 20:13.840
something that's new. One of the characters who played a very big role in spreading the

20:13.840 --> 20:20.640
anti-Semitism and the violence in Israel in the 1920s was a guy named Haj Amin al-Husseini, who

20:20.640 --> 20:25.440
was known as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. He was very close with Hitler and Mussolini,

20:25.440 --> 20:29.520
and he was working with them to try to get some claims to the Middle East once the Jewish people

20:29.520 --> 20:35.040
were annihilated. What he did for a very long time was he did the same shtick, only it was before

20:35.040 --> 20:39.520
he had smartphones and YouTube, where he would say the mosque is under intact, these imperialist

20:39.520 --> 20:43.360
Zionists are coming in to try to destroy the mosque, and he would use that to raise money

20:43.360 --> 20:49.200
from Indonesia, from Pakistan, from all over the world, and then use that threat to justify

20:49.200 --> 20:55.200
recruiting groups of young, vulnerable Muslim men and then getting them in the name of religious

20:55.200 --> 21:00.400
rights to go and kill people, which really is more of a perversion of the religion than I think the

21:00.400 --> 21:05.680
true essence of what Islam is. I think Islam at its core is a peaceful religion and I think that's

21:05.680 --> 21:11.520
where a lot of the great leaders in Islam want to take it, but the people who use Islam or the mosque

21:11.520 --> 21:18.560
or as a justification for violence, those are people who I think are really disrespecting

21:18.880 --> 21:24.640
the Islam religion. As you said, you helped make major strides towards peace in the Middle East

21:24.640 --> 21:32.320
with the Abraham Accords. Can you describe what it took to accomplish this and maybe this will help

21:32.320 --> 21:38.000
us understand what broke down and led to the tragedy this week? Yeah, so, you know, I always

21:38.000 --> 21:43.360
believed in foreign policy. I learned very quickly that the difference between a political deal and

21:43.360 --> 21:48.400
a business deal is that in a business deal, you have a problem set, you come to a conclusion,

21:48.400 --> 21:54.080
and then if you buy or sell something, you either have more cash or you have a company,

21:54.080 --> 22:00.000
more to do, less to do. A political problem set is very different where the conclusion of a problem

22:00.000 --> 22:06.880
set is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm. So when I would think about how do you move pieces

22:06.880 --> 22:10.560
around the board, you couldn't say, let me just solve the problem. You have to think about what

22:10.560 --> 22:15.760
happens the day after the signing and how do you create a paradigm that has positivity to it.

22:16.480 --> 22:24.080
So the biggest piece of what President Trump did during his four years in office was he really

22:24.080 --> 22:29.920
strengthened the relationship with Israel, number one, and he did things like recognizing Jerusalem

22:29.920 --> 22:35.200
as the capital of Israel. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He recognized the Golan Heights. He got

22:35.200 --> 22:41.600
out of the Iran deal. We did an economic conference in Bahrain where we brought Israelis to meet with

22:41.600 --> 22:46.880
Saudi and Emirati and Qatari businessmen, and everyone came together. Each one of these

22:46.880 --> 22:51.680
instances were unthinkable previously, and everyone said that if you did it, the world was going to

22:51.680 --> 22:57.040
end. Every time President Trump did one, the next morning the sun rose, the next evening the sun set,

22:57.040 --> 23:02.400
and things moved on. So by doing that, what President Trump did was he slaughtered a lot

23:02.400 --> 23:09.600
of the sacred cows of these false barriers that people had erected and showed people that the vast

23:09.600 --> 23:13.120
majority of the people in the Middle East, whether they're Jewish, Muslim, Christian,

23:13.120 --> 23:18.880
whatever religion they are, they just want to live better lives. So what we basically did was

23:18.880 --> 23:26.640
create a paradigm where the voices for peace, the voices for together, now finally had a forum

23:26.640 --> 23:30.960
where they were able to do it. We did that in the backdrop. The way we were able to be successful

23:30.960 --> 23:36.320
was we severely limited the resources of Iran, and they were focused more internally, and they

23:36.320 --> 23:40.400
couldn't cause the trouble that they were causing everywhere else. Since we've left,

23:40.400 --> 23:45.840
obviously the dynamics have changed, but the way you get to peace is obviously, number one,

23:45.840 --> 23:52.080
through strength, and number two, by finding a way for people to be better off tomorrow than they are

23:52.720 --> 23:57.920
today. What I found was that most of the voices looking for violence or trouble were people who

23:57.920 --> 24:04.160
were just focused on what happened two years ago, 20 years ago, 70 years ago, a thousand years ago.

24:04.240 --> 24:11.680
People who were trying to solve those problems in that context often were looking more to use those

24:11.680 --> 24:17.520
past grievances as a justification for their power and for the bad behavior that they were

24:17.520 --> 24:23.200
looking to perpetuate. So managing, as we have talked about extensively, managing the power

24:23.200 --> 24:29.600
dynamics of the region and providing a plan. This is something you did with the economic plan

24:29.600 --> 24:35.040
titled Peace to Prosperity, a Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People.

24:35.040 --> 24:41.040
Can you first of all describe what's in the plan? Sure. So this was something I took on.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.080
I was working on the political framework between the Israelis and the Palestinians and

24:46.080 --> 24:50.480
trying to understand what were the issues, and the issues were not very many. It basically was

24:50.480 --> 24:54.160
you had a land dispute, so you had to figure out where do you put borders ultimately.

24:54.720 --> 24:59.760
You had a security paradigm, which I was much more favorable to Israel's perspective on,

25:00.320 --> 25:06.560
and obviously the events of the past 48 hours have fully justified that bias.

25:08.480 --> 25:11.680
In addition to that, you had to deal with the religious sites, but I felt operationally that

25:11.680 --> 25:15.840
wasn't actually as complicated as people made it because you wanted to just leave it open for

25:15.840 --> 25:22.240
everybody. Then I went through and I felt that the Palestinian leadership was fairly disincentivized

25:22.240 --> 25:28.240
to make a deal because there was just this paradigm where they had billions of dollars

25:28.240 --> 25:32.960
coming in from the international community. I think that they feared that if they made a deal,

25:32.960 --> 25:37.760
they would lose their relevancy internationally and the money would stop flowing into the country.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.720
What I tried to do is to say my approach when I would get into a hard problem and say,

25:42.720 --> 25:47.360
how do I understand all the different escape patches? How do I try to eliminate them and

25:47.360 --> 25:52.960
then build a golden bridge that becomes really the only but also the most desirable pathway

25:53.520 --> 25:58.400
for the decision makers to walk through? It wasn't always hard and sometimes you have to go and

25:58.400 --> 26:02.720
hold their hand or you try to pick them up and walk them across, but a lot of these leaders are

26:02.720 --> 26:08.640
very reluctant to change. The dynamics of the Palestinians also were such that I think they

26:08.640 --> 26:16.080
were fairly stuck where they were. We developed a business plan for Gaza, the West Bank. We threw in

26:16.320 --> 26:22.880
some improvements for Jordan and Egypt as well. I based it off of the Vision 2030 that they did

26:22.880 --> 26:27.760
in Saudi Arabia, which I thought was a visionary document. I went back through this process and I

26:27.760 --> 26:34.080
studied basically every economic project in the post-World War II period. We looked at what they

26:34.080 --> 26:38.160
did in South Korea, why it was successful with some strong industrial planning. We looked at Japan.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.560
We looked at Singapore. We looked at Poland, why it was successful. We spent a lot of time on the

26:42.560 --> 26:47.440
Ukraine plan for the country and why it wasn't successful. That was mostly because of governance

26:47.440 --> 26:51.920
and corruption, which actually resembles a lot of what's gone wrong with the Palestinians where

26:51.920 --> 26:57.680
there's no property rights. There's no rule of law. What we did is we built a plan to show it's

26:57.680 --> 27:03.040
not that hard in the sense that between the West Bank and Gaza, you had 5 million people.

27:04.800 --> 27:10.160
We put together a plan, I think it was about $27 billion. We got together a conference. I had the

27:10.160 --> 27:14.560
head of AT&T. We had Steve Schwartzman from Blackstone came, which was very gracious of them.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.400
We had all the leading Arabic businessmen, the leading builders, leading developers.

27:18.400 --> 27:26.800
The general consensus of that conference was that this is very doable. We think that for Gaza in

27:26.800 --> 27:33.360
particular, it would cost maybe $7 to $8 billion to rebuild the entire place. We felt we could reduce

27:33.360 --> 27:38.240
the poverty rate in half. We can create over a million jobs there. The only thing that people

27:38.240 --> 27:42.960
said was holding it back wasn't Israel. What was holding it back was governance. People wouldn't

27:42.960 --> 27:50.560
have confidence investing there with the rule that Hamas was perpetuating. I encourage people

27:50.560 --> 27:55.200
actually to look at the plan. It was very thoughtful. It was 181 pages. We went project by project.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.040
Each project has costed out. It's a real plan that could be implemented, but you need the

28:01.040 --> 28:04.880
right governance. All of the different Arabic countries were willing to fund it. The international

28:04.880 --> 28:08.000
community is willing to fund it because they've just been throwing so much money at the

28:08.000 --> 28:12.560
Palestinians for years that's never been outcomes-based or conditions-based. It's

28:12.560 --> 28:18.240
just been entitlement money. Unfortunately, it hasn't really achieved any outcomes that

28:18.240 --> 28:25.040
have been successful. It's a great business plan. It just shows too rebuilding Gaza could be easy,

28:25.040 --> 28:29.360
but like I said, the problem that's held the Palestinian people back and that's made their

28:29.360 --> 28:35.840
lives terrible in Gaza has not been Israel. It's really been Hamas' leadership or lack of leadership

28:35.840 --> 28:42.000
and their desire to focus on trying to kill Israelis and start war with Israel over improving

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
the lives of the Palestinian people. The current approach of Hamas, the more violence they

28:48.000 --> 28:55.040
perpetrate, the more they can hold onto power versus improving the lives of people.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.040
They, as you said, maybe you can comment on, they do not propose an economics plan.

29:01.920 --> 29:08.160
Hamas has been running it now for 16 years and they don't have a lot to show for it. Our posture

29:08.160 --> 29:12.080
with them was basically a very simple deal. If you think about what's the end state in Gaza,

29:12.880 --> 29:18.160
it's actually not that complicated. There's no territorial disputes. The border is the border.

29:18.160 --> 29:22.400
There's no religious issues there as well. You're not dealing with Jerusalem.

29:22.400 --> 29:27.040
You're basically just dealing with the fact that Israel wants to make sure that there's

29:27.040 --> 29:33.600
no threat from Gaza, so it's a demilitarization or some kind of security guarantee from a credible

29:33.600 --> 29:39.440
source where Israel doesn't feel like Gaza can be used to stage attacks into Israel or to

29:40.080 --> 29:44.160
fire rockets into Israel. By the way, these are things I was saying three, four years ago

29:44.800 --> 29:50.000
that that was the objective and that was really the fear. Now that's been proven. Unfortunately,

29:50.000 --> 29:56.640
the fear has manifested. In exchange, you can rebuild the place and you can give the people

29:56.640 --> 30:01.280
a much better life, but Hamas has not shown a desire for that or a capability for that.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.560
I don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that, which is why

30:05.200 --> 30:08.240
under the current circumstances, if you do want to have peace there,

30:08.240 --> 30:14.720
Hamas has to be either eliminated or severely degraded in terms of their military capabilities.

30:14.800 --> 30:19.440
I would love to ask you about leadership, especially on the side of the United States.

30:20.640 --> 30:26.640
What has the current administration, the Biden administration, done different than the Trump

30:26.640 --> 30:32.880
administration, as you understand, that may have contributed to the events we saw this week?

30:34.000 --> 30:38.880
All I can talk about are where we left them. We left them a place where they had tremendous

30:38.880 --> 30:43.840
momentum in the Middle East. I met with them during the transition and said, look, we even

30:43.840 --> 30:50.960
got the Qatar-Saudi conflict done, which was a big... No peace between Israel and Saudi would

30:50.960 --> 30:58.240
have been possible without that, so we even got that done in our lame duck period. They came in

30:58.240 --> 31:02.480
and they said, look, we want to focus on the three Cs, which is COVID, climate change, and China.

31:02.480 --> 31:07.040
I said, that's great, but the Middle East, we have an amazing place right now. It's stable.

31:07.040 --> 31:13.200
There's momentum. Iran is basically broke. We put such crippling sanctions on Iran that

31:13.200 --> 31:17.040
they went from about, I think it was 2.6 million barrels a day of oil they were selling

31:17.840 --> 31:24.400
to about 100,000 under Trump. Their foreign currency reserves were basically depleted and

31:24.400 --> 31:32.240
they were broke. Same with the Palestinians. We stopped the funding to UNRWA, the UN agency,

31:32.240 --> 31:38.400
which is totally corrupt. We've put $10 billion in there. Over time, I did a poll in the Middle East,

31:38.400 --> 31:43.840
in Gaza to say, okay, we've invested $10 billion here as a country. Are we popular?

31:45.120 --> 31:51.040
The US had a 7% approval rating. USAID had a 70% approval rating, but it just felt like a waste

31:51.040 --> 31:56.000
of our taxpayer dollars. Again, we wanted to make it conditions-based. The Biden administration came

31:56.000 --> 32:03.600
in. Number one, they started insulting Saudi and Russia. Oil prices went up. At the same time,

32:03.600 --> 32:09.680
what they did was they stopped domestic production of oil. They disincentivized a

32:09.680 --> 32:16.560
lot of oil and shale production with regulations. They stopped pipelines. Oil prices went up.

32:17.360 --> 32:21.120
They stopped enforcing the sanctions against Iran, probably to get the oil prices lower,

32:21.120 --> 32:26.000
to make up for what they were doing. They ran to Iran to try to make a deal. They started funding

32:26.000 --> 32:30.240
the Palestinians again right away. I even said, if you're going to fund them, if that's your policy,

32:30.240 --> 32:34.720
I respect that. Again, elections have consequences. You can take a different policy,

32:34.720 --> 32:38.960
but what I would recommend is get some conditions. Make them do some reforms. Make them

32:38.960 --> 32:43.280
give property rights to people. Make them do real economic investments for people.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.240
They just went right away. They were funding the Palestinians, not enforcing the sanctions,

32:48.880 --> 32:54.480
and then overall just projecting a lot of weakness in the region. One of the most

32:55.040 --> 32:59.440
embarrassing examples is what happened in the United Arab Emirates. Again, an amazing,

32:59.440 --> 33:05.520
probably one of America's best allies over the last 20, 30 years. They fought with us in

33:05.520 --> 33:10.320
Afghanistan. They were the first Muslim country to stand up and do that after 9-11 because they

33:10.320 --> 33:17.200
didn't want it to be a war of the West against the Muslim religion, so they joined the fight

33:17.200 --> 33:22.080
because they saw it as a fight between right and wrong. They have rockets shot into their country

33:22.880 --> 33:33.840
from the Houthis, and they basically don't get a call from the US for 17 days. They need their

33:33.840 --> 33:37.600
equipment that they buy from the US, which creates jobs in the US. They need it restocked. We don't

33:37.600 --> 33:42.640
call. They've severely degraded the trust that we had to rebuild with our allies. I think they've

33:42.640 --> 33:47.280
been working now to get it back. They, after two years, started working with Saudi and Israel,

33:47.360 --> 33:52.960
which I think was good. I think that they realized after a stint that maybe the process that President

33:52.960 --> 33:57.600
Trump had created in the region was the right policy. Keep in mind, President Trump's policy

33:59.040 --> 34:04.560
that I was working on was very strongly criticized during the first three years before we were able

34:04.560 --> 34:09.280
to achieve the results because it was departure from the failed policies of the past. First,

34:09.280 --> 34:14.880
there was a return to those policies, appease Iran, let's criticize Saudi Arabia. Then they

34:14.880 --> 34:19.840
started embracing and working on the Israel-Saudi deal, which was really exciting. I think we're all

34:19.840 --> 34:25.200
very excited about it, but they did it in public. I think that that also was something. Again,

34:25.200 --> 34:29.120
I didn't have access to their intelligence, so I assumed that by doing it so publicly,

34:29.120 --> 34:32.640
they thought that they'd either had a deal with Iran because they were letting them get all this

34:32.640 --> 34:37.280
revenue or Iran wouldn't be a problem. One of the reasons with the Abraham Accords, we kept it so

34:37.280 --> 34:41.920
quiet during the whole time was because we always felt like the troublemakers in the region,

34:41.920 --> 34:48.160
particularly Iran, who we thought would be disadvantaged by having UAE, Saudi, Israel

34:48.160 --> 34:55.360
altogether. Israel's a nuclear power. You have other strong economies. Iran seeks instability.

34:55.360 --> 35:01.680
They seek looking to create division in the region. If you can create that economic sphere

35:01.680 --> 35:06.880
where you have security from Haifa to Muscat, from Israel to Oman all the way through with Saudi,

35:06.880 --> 35:13.680
Jordan, UAE, Qatar, Egypt, that's an incredibly powerful block. If you can make it secure and

35:13.680 --> 35:20.080
then get economic integration, that really could be a Middle East that thrives. Iran obviously

35:20.080 --> 35:23.680
wanted nothing to do with that, and that's why they've been working to disrupt. I think

35:25.280 --> 35:30.160
they took an incredibly stable situation with momentum. I think they underestimated

35:30.720 --> 35:39.120
the way that Iran would approach the region to undermine. I think they gave way too much

35:39.120 --> 35:43.440
rope to Iran, and I think that they didn't seize when they had an opportunity of strength with

35:43.440 --> 35:48.720
the Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that I believe could have prevented us being where

35:48.720 --> 35:55.040
we are today, not to mention that even just three weeks ago, it's a bad look that they just basically

35:55.040 --> 36:00.880
gave $6 billion to Iran in exchange for hostages, and then Iran's basically funding these terror

36:00.880 --> 36:07.760
attacks that are killing American citizens in Israel. It's a heartbreaking situation,

36:07.760 --> 36:12.400
again, totally avoidable, and one that I think has been very badly mismanaged to date.

36:13.360 --> 36:17.920
If Trump was currently president and you were still working with him on this part of the world,

36:17.920 --> 36:26.800
what actions would you take? What conversations would you have? What ideas would you be working

36:26.800 --> 36:34.960
with in order to unite the various allies that you mentioned in the Middle East over this tragedy

36:34.960 --> 36:42.720
and not let it be a thing that divides the Middle East, but make it a thing that

36:43.360 --> 36:46.800
catalyzes progress towards peace, further progress towards peace?

36:48.000 --> 36:52.640
I want to say one thing, Lex. I have a lot of friends who are fans of Trump or not fans of

36:52.640 --> 36:57.680
Trump, but one thing I want to say with absolute certainty is that if President Trump was in office,

36:57.680 --> 37:03.120
this never would have happened. When President Trump was in office, anyone who supports Israel

37:04.000 --> 37:09.200
or who wants to see Jewish people not be innocently slaughtered, he would never have

37:09.200 --> 37:12.560
allowed that to happen. It did not happen when he was in power, and I hope people

37:13.200 --> 37:21.120
recognize that as something that's very, very true. How I would play the ball where it lies

37:21.120 --> 37:25.360
right now, keep in mind we transferred the ball that was on the green. Now it's almost like it's

37:25.360 --> 37:30.560
gone back 150 yards and it's in a sand trap. I think the way that I would play the ball right

37:30.560 --> 37:35.280
now is number one is you have to show strength. I actually think President Biden's words were the

37:35.280 --> 37:40.240
right words. I see that they're moving aircraft carriers to the region. Again, the purpose of

37:40.240 --> 37:46.160
having a strong military, I believe obviously if you get into a war, you want to win the war,

37:46.160 --> 37:50.960
but the purpose of a very strong military primarily is to avoid a war. I don't know

37:50.960 --> 37:55.840
what kind of credibility the Biden administration has to show the strength, but right now you have

37:55.840 --> 38:03.200
to support Israel completely. You have to really let people in the region know that there'll be

38:03.200 --> 38:10.480
consequences if they try to escalate. Again, we saw a little bit of rocket skirmish from Lebanon,

38:10.480 --> 38:14.400
from Hezbollah, but again, this is the type of thing that they have to know there'll be

38:14.400 --> 38:19.600
severe consequences if they make this a multi-party fight. I think sending a strong

38:19.600 --> 38:23.600
message to Iran, I think that they have to see some consequences from this and know that they're

38:23.600 --> 38:29.360
not going to be allowed to have a free reign to cause instability and that Iran doesn't usually

38:29.360 --> 38:34.320
fight face to face. They usually do it through proxies, but let's just all be honest about where

38:34.320 --> 38:41.200
this is coming from and let them know that there will be a consequence if they instigate these

38:41.200 --> 38:45.520
actions. Again, at least with the Biden administration, they've had contact with Iran.

38:45.520 --> 38:50.560
They've been talking with Iran, but they've allowed Iran. Again, the number I saw last year,

38:50.560 --> 38:55.680
I think under Trump, the number was maybe like $4 or $5 billion of oil revenue in total. I think

38:55.680 --> 39:00.080
last year it was something like $45 billion in revenue. This year, I think it'll be even more.

39:00.080 --> 39:04.560
That's a combination of them driving up oil prices, but also allowing much more sales.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.640
You would think that they would find a way to get them to behave and allow them to

39:09.280 --> 39:14.480
have this happen, or if that's not the case, then be tough. Go back to being tough. That's what you

39:14.480 --> 39:19.920
have to do. Building off of Abraham Accords, as you mentioned, Israel-Saudi normalization,

39:20.640 --> 39:29.120
there's been a lot of promising progress towards this. What does it take to not allow this tragedy

39:29.760 --> 39:33.840
damage the progress towards Israel-Saudi normalization?

39:33.840 --> 39:38.240
I think right now it's probably not the best to think about that. I think that we want to think

39:38.240 --> 39:42.720
about that after whatever is going to happen is going to happen now. I think right now the

39:42.720 --> 39:49.200
number one priority for Israel has to be to fully regain security in the country, and then number

39:49.200 --> 39:55.920
two is to figure out how you can, like I said, eliminate or degrade the Hamas capability or

39:55.920 --> 40:00.240
other Iranian threats to make sure that you have your security apparatus. I think that

40:00.240 --> 40:05.040
the Israeli leadership right now should proceed with that, and I don't think that they should

40:05.040 --> 40:11.200
be thinking about normalization with Saudi at this moment. My instinct, and I've been watching this

40:11.200 --> 40:16.640
Israeli-Saudi normalization play out, obviously just speaking with people and seeing what I've

40:16.640 --> 40:21.760
been reading and watching with great excitement. I think it would be a game changer for the region.

40:21.760 --> 40:27.760
I think it's one of Iran's worst nightmares to have Israel and Saudi interlinked together.

40:27.760 --> 40:31.040
I think it would be great for the Saudi people from a security perspective. What they're

40:31.040 --> 40:37.200
discussing with America would be very strong. The ability to get different elements across

40:37.200 --> 40:42.960
would be incredible. What I would say with it is that the industrial logic held yesterday,

40:42.960 --> 40:48.720
and I think it will hold again tomorrow. I always expect countries to act in their

40:48.720 --> 40:55.360
interests. I think that the deal that's on the table right now between Saudi Israel and America

40:55.360 --> 40:59.840
is in Saudi's interests. It's in America's interests, and it's in Israel's interests.

41:00.480 --> 41:04.800
What's going to happen now, though, is the political dynamics are going to shift,

41:04.800 --> 41:08.720
and I think that as we've seen with political dynamics, they come and go. I think

41:09.360 --> 41:14.240
let's get through this moment, and then I hope at the right time that those talks will be able to

41:14.880 --> 41:21.120
resume and conclude in an appropriate way. It's funny, Lex, when I was working on the US-Mexico

41:22.480 --> 41:27.760
agreement for the trade, every day there would be a tweet that would go out or there would be an

41:27.760 --> 41:33.440
issue. People forget how intense it was between America and Mexico, and I would speak to my

41:33.440 --> 41:37.520
counterpart in Mexico after a rough day. We were working on something, we were making progress,

41:37.520 --> 41:41.920
it'd get blown up, and I'd speak to him and say, you know what? Look, they're not moving America,

41:41.920 --> 41:46.000
they're not moving Mexico. Let's just stop for today, let's pick up tomorrow, and let's

41:46.000 --> 41:50.240
find a new way to bring this forward. I would just encourage everyone working on that not to

41:50.240 --> 41:55.040
give up, to keep working hard at it, and to find a way. But like I said, I would take a little bit

41:55.040 --> 42:00.560
of a pause for the time being. Let's let the current situation play out, and then hopefully

42:00.560 --> 42:04.400
there'll be a way for it to move forward. I just hope there's still people on the US side

42:04.400 --> 42:12.080
picking up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia, just as human beings, as friends, as allies,

42:12.960 --> 42:18.640
and just keeping that channel of communication going. Maybe you can correct me, but I just feel

42:18.640 --> 42:26.400
like there's just simple human dynamics that play out here, that divisions can form and just run

42:26.400 --> 42:35.280
away from you over simple misunderstandings, over just the inability to see a tragedy

42:37.760 --> 42:43.920
from the same perspective because of conversations that could have happened but didn't happen.

42:43.920 --> 42:49.600
I think there'll definitely be communication, but words on phone calls is only worth so much. It's

42:49.600 --> 42:55.040
really trust between people and power, and obviously when you're in a position of power,

42:55.040 --> 42:59.840
you represent your country and your country's interests, but the ability to have trusting

42:59.840 --> 43:05.280
relationships where people feel like they're okay taking more risks to help each other,

43:06.000 --> 43:10.960
that's actually what's most important. Communication, I hope for, but deepening

43:10.960 --> 43:16.000
and trusting relationships, that's what I believe makes progress and keeps people safe.

43:17.520 --> 43:22.000
We talk quite extensively about the value of trust and negotiation and just working

43:22.000 --> 43:25.920
with leaders, which I think is a fascinating conversation and you've taught me a lot about

43:25.920 --> 43:32.960
that. Let me ask you about the end here. What are the various trajectories this war can take

43:33.520 --> 43:39.920
in your view? What are some of the end states, as you've said, which are desirable

43:40.960 --> 43:47.200
and are achievable? I mentioned this earlier, but whenever I would get a problem set in government,

43:47.200 --> 43:52.640
I'd always think from a first principles perspective, what's the logical outcome?

43:52.640 --> 43:56.400
Forget about all the reasons why it can't happen. That's what everyone in governments always rush

43:56.400 --> 44:01.680
to talk about, but I do think here, number one, Israel has to have a secure environment where they

44:01.680 --> 44:09.280
don't feel threatened from Gaza. Number two is the people in Gaza need to have an environment

44:09.280 --> 44:15.040
where they feel like they can live a better life and have opportunities. That's the end state.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.760
I think that the international community should come together. I do think that

44:20.320 --> 44:25.200
the people who are usually putting blame on Israel should now realize that maybe they've

44:25.200 --> 44:30.720
been a little bit harsher and that Hamas has been as big a threat, if not an even bigger threat,

44:30.720 --> 44:36.240
than Israel has been saying. I do think that if the international community comes together

44:36.240 --> 44:43.280
and unites behind Israel and really forces Hamas and the Iranian backers to stop hostilities,

44:43.280 --> 44:51.280
to stop saber rattling, to stop misrepresenting the history in order to justify their violent

44:51.280 --> 44:56.560
behavior, and if they say instead, we want to hold you accountable, no more money,

44:56.560 --> 45:02.000
and they all say that they're going to stand behind Israel's efforts to eliminate their national

45:02.000 --> 45:07.920
security threats, and then we will all come together and only fund again into a framework

45:07.920 --> 45:12.240
that we believe can be a long-term solution where the Palestinian people really have a

45:12.240 --> 45:16.160
chance to live a better life. That's really the best way to get there. There's tons of

45:16.160 --> 45:20.960
complicating factors, but that's the end state that the global community should be

45:20.960 --> 45:24.800
looking to come together, and it's very achievable. It's very, very achievable.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.480
As we stand here today, there's a lot of different ways that this war can evolve.

45:31.440 --> 45:39.280
If a ground invasion happens by Israeli forces of Gaza and if the number is correct of 100,000

45:39.840 --> 45:44.400
Israeli soldiers, do you worry about various trajectories that can take

45:45.120 --> 45:50.480
of the consequences that might have of an unprecedented ground troop attack?

45:51.920 --> 45:57.360
I think as a leader, you can't change yesterday, but you have the ability to change tomorrow,

45:57.360 --> 46:03.040
and that's a very important fundamental. That's true for all of us, not just leaders, but

46:03.680 --> 46:10.000
we saw with 9-11 how America was caught off guard by a terrorist attack. We acted

46:11.440 --> 46:17.040
somewhat rationally, somewhat emotionally, which led to a 20-year war with trillions of dollars

46:17.040 --> 46:23.280
lost. I think almost a million lives lost, not just American, but all lives, and it was a total

46:23.280 --> 46:29.440
tragedy what occurred. I think right now, the temptation is to be strong. I think that's a

46:29.440 --> 46:34.160
necessity. I do think eliminating risk is the right objective. I think the goal should be to

46:34.160 --> 46:39.200
stay very clear about what the objective is, but also this attack was very well planned,

46:39.840 --> 46:43.920
not to walk into another trap. I think you have to be very smart, very cautious. I've been happy to

46:43.920 --> 46:49.680
see that what they've been doing in retaliation so far has been somewhat measured, and they've

46:49.680 --> 46:53.840
taken their time to try to assess what's achievable. Again, I don't have access to

46:53.840 --> 46:59.520
the intelligence. We're talking at a very early stage in this conflict, so a lot could happen

46:59.520 --> 47:07.440
even by the time this is published. My hope is that they'll just stay very focused on what

47:07.440 --> 47:12.240
the objective is and try to make sure that they're acting appropriately in order to do that.

47:12.240 --> 47:15.680
I will say this too, that this has been different than what I've seen in the past in that

47:16.320 --> 47:25.920
the attacks were so heinous and so disgusting that I've seen the international community

47:25.920 --> 47:30.960
rally around Israel more so than I ever have. I hope that Israel continues to

47:31.680 --> 47:36.320
keep the moral high ground and continue to communicate what they're fighting for,

47:36.320 --> 47:41.600
why they're fighting. I do hope that the international community supports the objective

47:41.600 --> 47:47.120
and they can work together to achieve it. Benjamin Anyahu, Bibi, somebody you've gotten

47:47.120 --> 47:54.800
to know well in negotiation, in conversation. He has made statements. He has declared war.

47:55.760 --> 48:03.120
He has spoken about this potentially being a long and difficult war. What have you learned

48:03.120 --> 48:07.920
about the mind of Benjamin Anyahu that might be important to understand here in this current war?

48:08.640 --> 48:13.120
Bibi is definitely a historic figure. I meet with a lot of different world leaders and some of them,

48:13.120 --> 48:18.160
I would say, they're very, very special transformational figures. Some, I would say,

48:18.160 --> 48:24.480
how the hell is this person running a country? Bibi is somebody who has done a lot for the state

48:24.480 --> 48:30.080
of Israel. He has a tremendous understanding of the security apparatus. He has tremendous global

48:30.080 --> 48:36.480
relations. For a crisis like this, I think Bibi is the leader you want if you're Israel to be

48:38.080 --> 48:46.080
in that seat. I think he's ambitious in what he's going to look to achieve. He understands

48:46.880 --> 48:51.680
his role in history as somebody who's helped strengthen Israel economically, militarily,

48:52.480 --> 49:00.080
and I don't think he wants to see his legacy be somebody who left Israel more vulnerable

49:01.040 --> 49:05.360
than it had to be. I think in that regard, he'll be incredibly strong,

49:05.360 --> 49:09.520
but I also think that he'll hopefully be calculating in the risk that he takes

49:10.320 --> 49:16.080
and not create more risk than is needed. That's easy to say, the two of us sitting here having

49:16.080 --> 49:21.360
a conversation when you're sitting in that chair as a leader in the fog of war. It's a very, very

49:23.440 --> 49:30.400
hard decision to make. He's been here before. He knows the weight of the situation. I'm sure

49:30.400 --> 49:36.960
he knows the moment, and I pray that he'll do what's right here to bring the best outcome

49:36.960 --> 49:44.720
possible. I wonder if you can comment on the internal political turmoil that Bibi has been

49:44.720 --> 49:53.760
operating in and how that relates to the tragedy that we saw. On the one hand, the political turmoil

49:53.760 --> 50:02.400
is a sign of a vibrant democracy. I think it's been actually nice to see how people have fought

50:02.400 --> 50:06.960
for their country and their beliefs in a democratic way. You compare that to the Palestinians where

50:06.960 --> 50:13.120
there's no democracy, there's no free speech, there's no free press. You can't disagree with

50:13.920 --> 50:22.960
the leadership in Israel. If you want to be homosexual, you can go to a parade and live

50:22.960 --> 50:28.480
your life. In Gaza, they'll throw you off a building and kill you. In Israel, you have

50:28.480 --> 50:32.800
the freedoms which I think make it a special place, and you have a very vibrant democracy.

50:33.360 --> 50:38.560
With that being said, the times in Jewish history where the Jewish people have been

50:38.560 --> 50:43.440
most vulnerable have been when there's been division. That's when the temple was destroyed,

50:44.160 --> 50:47.600
but that's not just with the Jewish people and with Israel. That's in all societies.

50:48.560 --> 50:54.240
I definitely believe that this division has left them less prepared for the situation than it

50:54.240 --> 50:59.600
would. I do think there's real lessons we should be taking from this here in America where we're

50:59.600 --> 51:05.600
in a time where we're very divided, but I do think that it'd be very wise for our leaders to find

51:05.600 --> 51:11.120
the areas where we do agree and find ways to secure our southern border, to make sure that

51:11.120 --> 51:18.880
we know who's in our country, what risks we all face. I do think that division definitely

51:18.880 --> 51:25.360
creates risk for countries. Let me switch gears here and just zoom out and look at our society and

51:25.360 --> 51:31.600
our public discourse at the moment. What do you make of the scale and nature of the Palestinian

51:31.600 --> 51:38.960
support online in response to this situation? This is something I've observed over the years

51:39.680 --> 51:46.880
since I got involved with the Israeli-Palestinian issue with a lot of interest. I think a lot of

51:46.880 --> 51:54.160
the people who are pledging support for the Palestinian people, I think that they want to

51:54.160 --> 51:59.280
see the Palestinian people live a better life, and I actually agree with them in that regard.

51:59.280 --> 52:05.600
Unfortunately, I think many of them are incredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground.

52:05.600 --> 52:12.080
I think all of the people who are advocating online for the Palestinian people who are going

52:12.080 --> 52:17.120
to these marches in support of them, I think they'd be best served if they really care about

52:17.120 --> 52:25.760
effectuating the outcome of joining with Israel right now and directing their anger towards the

52:25.760 --> 52:32.000
Hamas leadership. I think that it's very clear that the group that's responsible for the

52:32.000 --> 52:37.440
Palestinian people living the lives that all these people are angry about is Hamas,

52:37.440 --> 52:43.440
and if they direct their anger towards Hamas and put the attention on the failings of Hamas

52:43.440 --> 52:49.040
and put forth a vision for what they'd like to see leadership in Gaza do and they respect

52:49.040 --> 52:54.240
that there's a real fear that Israel has and any country would have of having a group of

52:54.240 --> 52:59.760
terrorists next to them that's calling for their destruction, I think that that recognition of

52:59.760 --> 53:06.480
finding a way for Israel to be secure and then having an opportunity for the Palestinian people

53:06.480 --> 53:12.240
to live a better life is the right pathway to try and pursue. To you, there's a clear distinction

53:12.240 --> 53:17.600
between Hamas and the Palestinian people in that Hamas is the enemy of progress

53:18.720 --> 53:23.760
and the flourishing of the Palestinian people. 100%. It's very, very clear, and I think that if

53:24.320 --> 53:28.240
people were honest about the situation, if they spent the time to really understand it, again,

53:29.760 --> 53:32.960
if you follow the conference I did in Bahrain, we had all of the leading businessmen there and

53:32.960 --> 53:37.760
they said, we can rebuild Gaza very easily. We all want to. The leading Arab businessmen,

53:37.760 --> 53:41.600
the leading American businessmen, everyone wants to. They're just held back by Hamas.

53:41.600 --> 53:47.120
And so I do think having an honest conversation about this at this point in time has really only

53:47.120 --> 53:53.520
one logical conclusion, and my hope is that maybe this conflict leads to that conversation being had

53:54.080 --> 53:59.200
and if it is, then maybe that brings more unity and understanding and we kind of get to a conclusion

53:59.200 --> 54:03.840
better that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people. Pragmatic question about

54:03.840 --> 54:11.920
the future. Do you hope Donald Trump wins in 2024 and how can his administration help bring peace

54:11.920 --> 54:18.080
to the Middle East? I think when Donald Trump was president, we had a peaceful world. Everyone said

54:18.080 --> 54:24.240
if he was elected, we would have World War III. Meanwhile, he gets elected and he not only is the

54:24.240 --> 54:30.080
first president in decades to not start any wars, he's making peace deals. He's making trade deals.

54:30.080 --> 54:36.080
He's working with our allies, getting them to pay their fair share in NATO. He's having a dialogue

54:36.080 --> 54:41.920
with China, with Russia. He's weakening Iran. And so I do think that the job he did as a foreign

54:41.920 --> 54:48.320
policy president was tremendous. I think now more and more people are starting to recognize that.

54:48.320 --> 54:52.240
Again, under President Biden, this is the second war that's broken out in the world.

54:52.400 --> 54:59.280
When you have a weak American leadership, the world becomes a less safe place. My hope and

54:59.280 --> 55:07.120
prayers are that President Trump is re-elected and that he's able to then restore order and

55:07.120 --> 55:11.360
calm and peace and prosperity to the world. From a place of strength.

55:12.320 --> 55:18.240
That's the only way he knows how to do it. What gives you hope about the future of this region,

55:18.880 --> 55:22.240
of Israel and of the Middle East?

55:22.960 --> 55:31.360
The Middle East for 20 years was an area of conflict. They spent all their money on bullets

55:31.360 --> 55:37.680
and bombs. You have young leadership now in Saudi Arabia and UAE and Qatar.

55:38.720 --> 55:44.560
There's a much more ambitious agenda now for the region to make it an economic superpower and hub

55:44.560 --> 55:50.160
of the world. Israel is one of the most burgeoning and exciting tech economies in the world.

55:50.960 --> 55:56.640
If you think about it, it's almost like having Silicon Valley not connected to California.

55:56.640 --> 56:00.960
The thing that's held the region back for all these years has just been the conflict and the

56:00.960 --> 56:05.680
division and the lack of connectivity. But if you have that region, if it can all come together,

56:05.680 --> 56:09.840
if you can create a security architecture, you have an incredibly young population.

56:09.840 --> 56:15.200
You have a lot of wealth and resources and a lot of capabilities and know-how.

56:16.400 --> 56:23.600
I think that if it's managed correctly and if Iran is able to be restrained and suppressed with

56:23.600 --> 56:28.880
their ambitions to cause destabilization, I don't mean Iran the country. I mean the Iranian regime

56:28.880 --> 56:34.000
because actually, once you have this economic sphere, if you could bring Iraq into it, if you

56:34.000 --> 56:38.480
could bring Iran into it, that makes it even bigger and stronger. The Persian people are

56:38.480 --> 56:43.280
incredibly entrepreneurial and incredibly industrious. I do think that the region has

56:43.280 --> 56:49.040
tremendous potential. It's just been held back by bad policy, bad leadership, bad objectives.

56:49.680 --> 56:57.360
Again, when President Trump left office in 2021, the Middle East was really on a very,

56:57.360 --> 57:01.920
very positive trajectory. If the right things happen, it can continue to be so.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.200
I'm praying at this moment in time that we navigate the current crisis, that the

57:07.840 --> 57:13.200
important objectives are achieved of eliminating the terrorists and their threats and then allowing

57:13.200 --> 57:18.560
the leaders who are focused on giving their citizens and their neighbors the opportunity

57:18.560 --> 57:26.320
to live a better life are able to work together and really dream and be ambitious and find ways to

57:26.880 --> 57:33.280
create a paradigm where humans can flourish. What is the best way to defeat hate in the world?

57:34.160 --> 57:40.880
Hate is a very powerful force. It's much easier to hate people you don't know.

57:43.280 --> 57:49.680
It's funny, when I was working on prison reform, one of the most interesting people I met was a

57:49.680 --> 57:56.000
reverend actually down in Texas who negotiated the first truce between the Bloods and the Crips,

57:56.800 --> 58:00.320
two of the notorious gangs in America in prison. I was very excited to meet him.

58:00.720 --> 58:05.600
And when I met him, I said, well, how'd you do it? And he said, it was very simple. He says,

58:05.600 --> 58:11.600
I got all the guys together and I had a tremendous amount of barbecue brought in.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.560
He says, and I got the meeting. He says, no drinking. He says, drinking sometimes gets

58:14.560 --> 58:18.720
people a little bit more against each other. He says, but I got a meeting and they started

58:18.720 --> 58:23.280
sitting down together and they started saying, you know what, you're just like me. And all of a

58:23.280 --> 58:28.080
sudden they started finding areas where they were more together. Look, I've traveled all over the

58:28.080 --> 58:34.000
world now. I've been very fortunate to meet people from different states in America. I've

58:34.000 --> 58:39.760
different political persuasions, different ages, different classes. And what I found is that

58:40.560 --> 58:46.880
there's a fundamental driving amongst all of us where we all want to live a better life.

58:46.880 --> 58:52.960
And people don't want to fight naturally, but it's easy to fight when you feel wronged or you feel

58:52.960 --> 58:59.120
like somebody disrespected you or somebody did something from hatred. And hatred leads to more

58:59.120 --> 59:04.960
hatred, which sometimes just pushes that cycle further and further. So I believe that each and

59:04.960 --> 59:11.280
every one of us has the power to stop that cycle. And we don't do it by being on Twitter and yelling

59:11.280 --> 59:17.360
at people. We don't do it by just being critical. We do it by finding the people we disagree with,

59:17.360 --> 59:22.480
by listening to them, by asking questions, by sitting with them. And then if we each take

59:22.560 --> 59:28.480
responsibility to try to make the world better, then I think that there's no limits to the

59:28.480 --> 59:33.440
incredible place that this world can be. So as you've said, you've traveled all across the world.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.720
Do you think most people are good? Most people have love in their heart?

59:41.680 --> 59:45.600
I do believe that. Yeah. And you have some bad people. I mean, you have some real evil people.

59:45.600 --> 59:52.000
I mean, a big part of the work I did was on prison reform. And, you know, previously the mentality

59:52.000 --> 59:56.240
was is that the prison should basically be a warehouse for human trash. And if you've

59:56.240 --> 59:59.600
made a mistake in this world, then, you know, we're going to throw you out and we're going to

59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.640
make the rest of your life incredibly difficult because you're going to have a criminal record.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.800
You're not going to have access to jobs. But what I found is when I would sit with people in prison,

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.480
the people I met through my father's experience and who I met along the way is that, you know,

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.400
people make mistakes. We're all human. I think it's the right thing from a religious perspective to

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.600
give people second chances. I always believe you shouldn't judge people by the worst mistake they

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.080
make in their life. Unfortunately, now in the era of social media, people will say one wrong thing.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.880
It sticks with them forever. They get canceled or they get put out. We're all humans. We grow from

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.760
our mistakes. We learn from our mistakes. And I think that some people are just evil. There are

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:46.000
some evil people, but I do think the vast, vast, vast majority of people are good. And I do think

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.080
that people sometimes also can be in a bad place and then society can push them to a worse and

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.920
worse place. But we all have the power to make them feel loved, make them feel heard. And I think

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.280
there's also tremendous power that we have as people to help people get to a better place.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.280
My wife and I, we've always tried to be a force for good. We've always tried to provide a place

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.480
where people can discuss with each other. When we were in Washington, we would host dinners at our

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.800
house all the time or we would have Democrats and Republicans sitting together. I saw Senator

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.680
Feinstein just passed away. We had a great dinner at our house when she was a senator with her and

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.000
her husband and Mark Meadows when he was on the Freedom Caucus. We had actually a fascinating

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.120
discussion about Iran. Mark was much more hardline than me. I had to actually bite my tongue. I was

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.240
impressed at how much he did, whereas Feinstein and her husband were super into it. They knew

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.880
the Iranians well. They thought they were peace loving. It was an incredibly robust and respectful

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.560
debate. I don't think we maybe concluded anything that night, but it was interesting for people to

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.560
get together. Having a dinner at my house where I had Dick Durbin, the number two ranking Democrat

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.960
in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Stephen Miller, who's known to be a very hardline on immigration

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.560
discussing what an immigration reform could look like. They left that dinner saying, wow,

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.080
we hadn't spoken to people on the other side and we actually agree on 85% of things. Maybe

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.880
something is possible. I believe that we should always be trying to push to make the world a

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.960
better place. You only do that by listening to people and connecting with people and by

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:32.400
respecting people. Finally, I'll just say on this is that I meet people all the time who have so

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.720
much confidence in their perspectives. I'm very jealous that these people are able to be so

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.240
confident about every single thing because for me, I have some degree of confidence in the things

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.200
that I've studied and what I've learned, but I'm always trying to find people who disagree to

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.800
sharpen my perspectives and to help me grow and to help me learn further. I think that's the beauty

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.760
of the world is that the knowledge base continues to grow, the facts continue to change and what's

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:07.680
possible tomorrow continues to become different. As humans, we have to continue to thrive,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.200
to learn and to grow and to connect. If we do that, everything's possible.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.080
Well, Jared, thank you for your compassion, first of all, but also your wisdom today on this very

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:26.240
difficult, this tragic set of events, these difficult days for the world. It's a big honor

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.200
to speak with you again. Every time I speak to you, I learn a lot about the world and I deeply

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.800
appreciate, like I said, your humility and your understanding of the details of all the complex

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.600
power dynamics and human dynamics that are going on in the world. Once again, thank you for talking

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.880
today. Thank you. And Lex, if I could say just one final thing, which is that my thoughts and

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.240
prayers are really with all the people in Israel and the innocent civilians as well

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.840
from the Palestinian side. My prayers are with the idea of soldiers that they should be safe and they

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:10.640
should be really watched by God to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.080
a safer place. Thank you for listening to this newly recorded segment of the conversation

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:23.200
that addresses the current situation in Israel and Gaza. And now we'll go on to the second part

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.800
of the conversation recorded on Thursday, October 5th.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.000
Given your experience in negotiating with some of the most powerful and influential

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.200
leaders in the world, what's the key to negotiating difficult agreements in geopolitics?

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.400
Let's start with the big question. If I look back on the different negotiations I had

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.080
when I was in government, either with leaders of countries, with representatives of leaders,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.920
or even with members of Congress to pass legislation, the most important thing I

01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.800
would draw back to would be trust. I think getting to know each other, understanding what

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:07.840
was motivating the other party to get to the outcome, and making them feel like you weren't

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:14.560
going to use whatever information they gave you to benefit yourself at the expense of them,

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.320
is probably what I would call table stakes to have a shot at accomplishing anything that was hard

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:30.160
in negotiation. After that, I would say taking maybe a first principles approach to

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:37.040
what the outcome of whatever problem you're looking to solve should be. Now you have different

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.760
kinds of negotiations. I always tried to create a framework in the negotiation where

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:48.000
it wasn't me against you. It was always, let's agree on what the outcome is that we're trying

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.280
to accomplish. Let's all sit on the same side of the table and say, we want to get to this outcome.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.040
How do we get there? Really trying to create a roadmap. Once you understand the destination

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.160
you want to get to, the endpoint, then you'd have to work backwards and really try to put yourself

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.080
in their shoes and try to understand what were their motivations macro. Most of the time,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:16.080
you have to assume that a leader's primary objective was to stay in power. All decisions

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.120
made would be made through the framework of what it would take to do that and how it would impact

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.640
their ability to do that. Then finally, I would just say that in any negotiation, you have to

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.880
understand the power dynamics as well. You have to then wait your approach in order to maneuver

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:39.760
pieces to accomplish the objective. In areas where we had stronger power dynamics, I'd always

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.080
look at it and say, what are the potential escape routes where a politician would say,

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.880
this is just the reason why we can't get there? I'd always think, how can you try to

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.000
eliminate those escape routes or make them much harder to accomplish? Then ultimately think about

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.640
what's the golden bridge that you want to create for them in order to get to the other side

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.440
where they were motivated to get there because it was in their self-interest to get there,

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.960
but also because it helped accomplish the different objective. I have many examples that I

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.400
lived through with that, obviously, negotiating in Congress for prison reform. I had to form a lot

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.600
of trust with Democrats, whether it was Hakeem Jeffries or Dick Durbin. Then also on the

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:27.120
Republican side, I had Mike Lee, I had Lindsey Graham, I had Tim Scott, Senator Grassley,

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.560
also Doug Collins in the House was tremendous. Every time we maneuvered something, we would

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.680
get attacked either from the left. There was a time we were being attacked by Nancy Pelosi,

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.960
John Lewis for not being inclusive enough. Then there were times that we maneuvered it,

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.600
we'd be attacked from the right for maybe going too far. Ultimately, we had to find just the right

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:53.360
place where we can get it done. The same thing happened with USMCA where we were negotiating

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.640
the biggest trade deal in the history of the world, which was $1.3 trillion in annual trade

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:05.280
between Mexico, Canada, the United States of America. We were able to form good trust with

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.240
the other side and try to say, how do we create win-win outcomes? Ultimately, we were able to do

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.000
something in a record time that people thought was very hard to do. Both of them in a divided

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.920
time of the Trump administration were bipartisan wins with big, big votes in the Senate and the

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.400
House. You have a lot of stories of this kind, sometimes a soft approach, sometimes a hard

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:33.840
approach. There's, I think, a story where with Bibi, there was a potential dramatic election

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:40.000
coming up and you had to say, no, no excuses, no delaying. We have to make this agreement.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.240
I know Bibi cares about Israel more than the particular dynamics of the election. You have to

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.800
draw a hard line there. In fairness, too, for him, during the time that we were dealing with him,

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.160
he was always in election versus election and then election. What he was saying wasn't wrong.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.720
I think he was more expressing his concerns given the dynamics. We never held those concerns

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.200
against him. We just said those are real concerns he had. We respected those concerns, but then we

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.240
helped him prioritize to help accomplish the right things. That's ultimately what the partnership is.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.280
My job was to represent America. His job was to represent Israel. You had other parties

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.720
representing their own interests. As long as you assumed that people were acting mostly in good

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.840
faith, you were able to navigate areas where you didn't have complete overlap of priorities

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.720
and objectives. Just to go back to the trust thing, you sometimes see that with leaders

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.200
where it looks like they're trying to screw over the other person when they're talking.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:46.320
Not having that, I think, is a really powerful thing for earning trust. People actually can

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.880
believe that they're results-driven and are working towards a certain end. Is there a skill

01:09:52.880 --> 01:10:00.800
to that? Is that genetics? You're born with that? Or is that something you develop? Basically,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.880
it requires you to look at the game of politics and not have a kind of cynicism about it

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.600
to where everybody's trying to manipulate you and actually just go in with an open mind and open

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.880
heart and actually speak truthfully to people on a basic human level.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.800
I would say that I always would think about, how can I be a partner to others? I would want

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.240
somebody to be a partner to me. A lot of it comes from just my different experiences in business.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:35.040
I've had great partners. I've had terrible partners. My father, again, a lot of my childhood was I was

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.640
exposed to business. My father, on Sundays, he would take us to job sites and to the office

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.360
with him instead of to football games like my friends' fathers would do. We were exposed to

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.000
business. What he would say about his father, who was an immigrant to America, came over with

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.040
nothing and no formal education, but he would always say, a good deal with a bad partner will

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.960
always be a bad deal. A bad deal with a good partner, you'll figure it out. Going through

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:07.360
some of the challenges that I had in my life early on, whether it was the issue with my father,

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.560
I'm sure we'll talk about, or even going through some tougher financial times during the great

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:19.120
financial crisis, I really learned a lot about partnership. I always thought, how can I act in

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.720
a way where I could be the type of partner or friend to others that I wish others would be to

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:34.960
me? When you look for a good partner, don't you think there's the capacity for both good and bad

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:42.080
in every person? When you talk, when you negotiate with all these leaders, aren't there multiple

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.280
people you're speaking to inside one person that you're trying to encourage, catalyze the goodness

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:57.120
in the human? Leaders are generally chosen by their country. My view was, if I had an objective,

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.920
I didn't get to choose who was the leader of other countries. My job was to deal with that leader,

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.600
understand their strengths, understand their weaknesses, understand their power dynamics

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.720
as well. One of my greatest takeaways when I grew up, I'd read the newspapers about all these

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.240
powerful, famous people. Then as I got older and had the chance to meet them and do business with

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:22.400
them and then ultimately interact with them in government, I realized that they're just like you

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.160
and me. They wake up every morning, their kids are pissed at them, their wife doesn't want to talk

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:31.200
with them. They've got a set of advisors around them, one saying, let's go to war, one saying,

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.360
let's make peace, one saying, do the deal, one saying, don't do the deal. They're all thinking,

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.640
where do I get advice? How do I make decisions? Understanding the true human nature of them

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.560
and then the different power dynamics around them, I thought was very key.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.960
I didn't have a choice. Do I deal with them or not? It was a function of how do you deal with them

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:55.680
effectively in order to find areas where you have common interests and then work well together to

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.680
pursue those common interests in order to achieve a certain goal.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.840
First of all, you're incredibly well read. I've gotten to know you and I've gotten to know Ivanka

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.160
and the book recommendation list is just incredible. First of all, thank you for that.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:17.440
You told me about The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman. It's a book on World War I and I went

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.480
down a whole rabbit hole there. She's like an incredible historian. By the way, there's a bunch

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.720
of stuff you learn from that, but one of the things you told me is it influenced your general

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:34.400
approach to diplomacy of just picking up the phone and giving it a try. As opposed to planning and

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:42.720
strategizing, just pick up the phone. This was a book I read way before the notion of

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:49.680
serving in government was ever even on my mind or reality. I remember thinking about it,

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.960
reading it and thinking how World War I started where you had somebody who was assassinated and

01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:02.080
then you had all these different alliances that were created. Then in order to accomplish

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.480
objectives, it triggered all of these people getting in bed with everyone else because of

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:14.080
documents that were created without the intent of going to a massive war. I think in the course

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.560
of World War I, it was one of the greatest atrocities that we've seen as humanity. We've

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.200
had 16 million people killed in that war. As I was reading the book, I remember thinking to myself,

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.200
even though things are set in a certain way, go sit with somebody. Go talk to them and say,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.400
this doesn't make sense. This is wrong. How do we create a better pathway?

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.120
As a civilian all my life, I would read the newspapers. I would observe how different

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.560
leaders would act, but when we had the opportunity to serve in government and have the position,

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.040
you realize you're not a civilian. You don't have the luxury of sitting back and letting

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:56.080
the world happen the way it's happening. You have agency and you have the potential to influence

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.200
the outcome of things. One thing I've seen is most political prognosticators are wrong. Anyone who

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.760
tells you what's going to happen really has no clue. It's not because they're bad or they're not

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.360
intelligent. It's because nobody knows. At the end of the day, the outcomes in the world are usually

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.400
driven by the decisions of humans. If you're able to come together, form relationships,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.600
listen to each other, you can do that. One of the great examples that I speak about in the book is

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.840
with North Korea. Whereas if you remember in 2017, it was very intense. When President Obama was

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.520
leaving office, he told President Trump that the single biggest fear that he had, and this is a

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.120
time when the world was a mess. The Middle East was on fire. ISIS was beheading journalists and

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.600
killing Christians. They had to caliphate the size of Ohio. Libya was destabilized. Yemen was

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:49.040
destabilized. Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were killed. Iran was on a quiet path to

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.440
a nuclear weapon. Yet the single biggest fear he had was North Korea. Then it got compounded

01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:00.160
by the fact that we get into office and President Trump brings his generals around and he's

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.960
learning how to interact with all the generals and says, okay, what are my options? They said,

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.280
calm down. We've been using all of our ammunition in the Middle East. We don't have enough

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.480
ammunition to go to war over there. He says, let's not let that be due public. Let's try to restock

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:22.560
and come up with a plan. At the time, there was a lot of banter back and forth. I got a call from a

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:29.200
friend who was an old business contact who actually had done business in North Korea. He said, I'd

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.120
love to find a way to solve this. I was getting calls from friends at the time saying, I'm trying

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.080
to go to Hawaii for a vacation. Should I not be going? Is it not safe? I mean, we forget the

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:45.120
psychology of how intense that was at the time. Then through that interaction, he called some of

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.440
his contacts in North Korea and then we were able with the CIA to open up a back channel that

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.360
ultimately led to the de-escalation, the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un, which led to a

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.560
de-escalation. That was really the mindset, which was whenever there's a problem, just pick up the

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.160
phone and try. I think President Trump had a very similar approach, which was, let's give it a shot.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:11.200
He wasn't afraid to go after the hard ones too. I'll say one final thing on this, which is that

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:19.360
in politics, the incentive structure is just much different than in the real world. In the sense that

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:24.560
you have a hard problem, then if you try to solve a hard problem, the likelihood of failure is

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.840
great. Whereas in the business world, if you're going after a hard problem, we celebrate those

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:34.240
people. We want our entrepreneurs and our great people to go after solving the big hard problems,

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.720
but in politics, if you try to take on a hard problem, you have a high likelihood of failure.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:44.400
You'll get a lot of criticism on your pathway to trying to accomplish that if you fail. Then if

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:51.200
you fail, it has a higher probability of leading to you losing your opportunity to serve. It's

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.320
just one of these things where people want to play it safe, which is not the notion that really was

01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.240
taken during the time that President Trump was in office. Do you think it has to be that way?

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.880
I think there's something in the human spirit, like in the public, that desires politicians to

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.840
take on the big, bold problems. Why is it that the politician needs to be so afraid of failure?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.360
I don't think it has to be that way. That's, I think, one of the great lessons from the time

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.680
of the Trump administration. He brought a lot of people from the business world into government.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.240
The business people have a much different mindset than government people,

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.880
and there was a lot of resistance. I think part of why there was so much resistance was because

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.200
I think about it from my personal sense, was that if I was successful with no traditional

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.240
qualifications to do diplomacy, it meant that all the people with traditional qualifications and

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.320
diplomacy didn't necessarily need those qualifications in order to be successful.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:57.760
That same sentiment manifested itself in many areas in government. I think that in the business

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.600
world, it's outcome-oriented, it's results-oriented. What we would see in New York is

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.040
there, they would stab you in the eye. In D.C., they would stab you in the back. It just became

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.640
a whole different dynamic of how you work through these different areas. The answer is, it doesn't

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.760
have to be that way. You just need the right courageous leader. That's why I'm so optimistic

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.160
about what the future of America and the world could be if you have the right people in power

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.560
who are willing to take on the right challenges and do it in the right way.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.720
If we just linger on the North Korea and the de-escalation and the meeting, what's the

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:37.440
trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.960
to you find back channels, you start talking and start arranging the meeting? Is there some

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.640
insights you can give to how difficult that is to do in the North Korea case, which seems like to

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.200
be one of the more closed-off parts of the world and in the other cases that you worked on?

01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.920
It's always very challenging, especially when you're going against the grain of what's established.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:06.960
We did something different to think that an old business contact that I had could then do it.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:12.400
That's the type of thing that if the press knew what we were doing, they would have derided it

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.960
and criticized it in every which way. That was one of the benefits of operating very much below

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.280
the radar is that we were able to try all these different things. Not all of them worked, but some

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.240
of them did. That is what's amazing about the world. This could be the biggest story on the

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.400
front page of every paper and they're inciting fear in everyone. It's not illegitimate fear.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:38.240
There were missile tests over Japan. You had a lot of very big challenges with that file. Then

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.400
all of a sudden, we make contact. We go through negotiations to set a meeting. There's a meeting

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.560
between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. Then all of a sudden, there's a framework

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:54.160
to try and move things forward. Again, I think that there's a lot of possibility there for what

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.480
could happen if it's worked in the right way. I just want to know how you word that first

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:05.200
email or text message, what emojis to use, the hugging emoji. I've gotten to know a lot of

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.000
powerful and rich people. It's funny that they're all human, just like you're saying.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.560
A lot of the drama, a lot of the problems can be resolved with just a little camaraderie,

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.000
a little kindness, a little like just actually just reaching out.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.920
We're all human beings. People want to be successful and people want to be good.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.360
You're right too. There's way more emojis involved in diplomacy than I ever would have expected.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.200
Every leader, I'm sure, has their favorite emoji. This is also I learned about people.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:40.080
Like everybody has their go-to emoji. I usually go to the heart very quickly, emoji. There's some

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.800
people who go to the hugging, whatever that, where you're like doing the hugging thing. Anyway,

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.920
this conversation quickly turned to the ridiculous. But to do another book reference,

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.480
you mentioned the book 13 Days in September by Lawrence Wright in discussing all the work you've

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.720
done in Israel and the Middle East. I just want to ask you sort of the interesting aspect of that

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.080
book, which is the influence of the personalities and personal relationships

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.760
on these negotiations. You kind of started to allude to that with the trust, but

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.520
how much do the personalities matter in this? So going from North Korea to the Middle East here

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.160
to within Congress and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, completely in every way. I mean, that's

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.960
an incredible book and it's a very entertaining read. It has obviously a lot of good historical

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.680
context on some of the key players, whether it was Anwar Sadat or Menachem Begin

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:38.240
or Jimmy Carter and Cy Vance and a lot of the others who were involved with those negotiations.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.000
The thing that I kind of took from that experience was just how personal it was.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.760
Again, one of my favorite stories from that book was how Anwar Sadat, who was a big, big leader,

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.640
he had a mystic who was, according to this book, again, history. I like reading it, but I always

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.040
realize that you have to notice that this is just the perspective of a given author that's

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.040
writing it. But the way that they write this book was that he had an advisor who was a mystic

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.320
and the mystic was having a back channel with the Israelis. The mystic told Sadat,

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.920
if you go to Israel and you make a speech at the Knesset, Begin is ready to give you the Sinai.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.240
He goes to Israel, they set this whole thing up. He goes and gives the Knesset. They go for their

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.000
meeting after and Sadat says, okay, well, are we going to do this thing? And Begin says,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.800
what are you talking about? I'm not giving you an inch of our land. It was just one of these

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.440
things where it was a miscommunication that brought about the symbolic visit of Anwar Sadat

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:42.320
to Israel. That was one of these notions that just made everyone think that something was possible

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.360
that they thought was impossible a moment before. Actually, we had an example like that during our

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:53.440
time in government when we did the Abraham Accords. The first step of the Accords was really a

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.800
phone call between President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Mohammed bin Zayed,

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:04.480
who at that point was the crown prince and de facto ruler of the UAE. But all we had was a

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.840
phone call and then a statement that was released. What was interesting after that is we said, okay,

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.080
well, how do we integrate countries? Nobody's done this in a long time. We were trying to figure out

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.480
all the issues and there's big miscommunications between Israel and UAE and we were navigating

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.880
through all the issues. After a couple of weeks, I said, you know what, I've got to go over there

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.400
and try to sort through these issues. We make a plan to go to Israel and then we can go to UAE.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.680
Then a young gentleman who worked with me named Avi Berkowitz says, well, if we're flying from

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.240
Israel to UAE, instead of flying on a government plane, why don't we see if we can get an LL plane

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.360
and we'll do the first official commercial flight? I said, that's a great idea. Let's call

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.440
Ambassador Otaiba Youssef, who was a tremendous player in the Abraham Accords working behind the

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.400
scenes day and night and was really a big catalyst. He calls Youssef and he said, sure,

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.040
no problem. Let's give it a shot. We go and we do it. He says, if we can work out these issues,

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.920
what we'll do. We go to Israel, we do our meetings, we get everything back into a good place.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.160
We set up this trip over. We fly in an LL plane. We fill it up. At the time, it was during COVID

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:14.320
with a health delegation. We had the financial ministry because we had to open up banking

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.120
relationships. They could wire money between countries. We wanted to get health partnerships.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.720
Then we just had a lot of legal things and national security things we wanted to start

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:31.600
putting together. We do this flight and we end up landing in UAE. The picture of us coming off the

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:39.600
plane being greeted by Emiratis and Tobes with an LL plane with an Israeli flag on it just captured

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.640
everyone's imagination. It was one of these things where it's like you work so hard on the details

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.360
and the negotiation, hundreds of hours to make sure everything's perfect. Then the one thing that

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:55.360
you do, yeah, let's give it a shot. That image ended up capturing everyone's heart. Going back

01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:01.200
to Sadat, that visit was very critical. What was interesting was, according to this book,

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.200
it happened because of a miscommunication. That was the first part. The second part of the book,

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.600
that's just amazing theater. Actually, the book was based on a play. It was just going back and

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:16.640
forth with all of the different methodologies that they tried that failed, but they kept trying at it

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.840
and then ultimately seeing how the personalities were able to find ways to make the compromise

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.880
that ultimately was a very, very big thing for more stability in the Middle East. Amazing book.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.280
I would highly recommend it. A very entertaining read and something that at least gave me

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.120
encouragement to keep going when the task I was pursuing seemed so large.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.720
If you could just linger on the personalities, you write in the book that words matter.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.760
You write in the context of saying, in the diplomacy business, words matter. Then you said that

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:59.520
we're in the results business. There's a bad-ass line. If we just stick to the diplomacy business

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.720
and words mattering, it seems like one of the things you really highlight that individual words

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.280
can really have, you can fight over individual words. How do you operate in a world where

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:18.240
single words matter? I think you have to be respectful to the craft that you're in where

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:24.000
words matter, but then realize that they don't matter as much. Then also, focus on the fact that

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.040
the actions are actually what's going to matter more than the words. You have a difference between

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:33.840
leaders and politicians. Politicians are there to say the right thing and to hold the power.

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.320
Leaders are people who are willing to do things that will be transformational from my perspective.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:46.880
When I would think about diplomacy, words without actions or without the threat of actions,

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.840
and that was something that President Trump did very well, was that people knew that he was willing

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.800
to take action. He was very unpredictable in how he would act, and that made our words much more

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:02.160
effective in what they did. It's all a combination, but coming from the private sector,

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.680
we are all about results. If you're in government, you can work on something for 10 years and fail,

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.240
and then retire and they consider you an expert. In the private sector, if you work on something

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:18.000
for 10 weeks and you don't have a success, then you're unemployed. It's a different kind of notion.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.600
It was just understanding the mentality and trying to adjust and bridging the divides

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.040
between the different trainings. Is that the biggest thing you took from

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.120
your business background? Is that just be really results-focused?

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:38.000
It was just the only way to be. If I was giving up a nice life in New York and if I was giving up

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.920
the stuff that I really enjoyed, the company that I'd helped build and the life that I was

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.480
enjoying in order to do government, I was going there to make a difference. We had to focus on

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.640
it. The other skill set, so there was a couple skill sets that I found were quite deficient

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.600
in government. First of all, there was a ton of amazing people. People talk about the bureaucracy.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:04.640
What I found was you had incredibly committed, passionate, intelligent, capable people all

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:11.280
throughout the government. What they were waiting for, though, was direction and then cover in order

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.160
to get there. There were a lot of tasks that I worked on, whether it was building the wall

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:23.040
at the southern border where I was able to work with Customs Border Patrol, Army Corps of Engineers,

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:30.160
military DHS professionals, DOD. We basically all came together. Once we had a good project

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.960
management plan, we were able to move very, very quickly. I think we built about 470 miles of

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:42.800
border barrier in about two years, basically. That worked very well because we basically brought

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:49.600
private sector project management skill sets, which were quite often missing in government.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:54.880
The second one is just we spoke about negotiation earlier. I would say that most people in government

01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:00.400
it's just a different form of negotiation than you see in the private sector and way less effective

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.720
in that regard, which is why I think it's good the more we can encourage more people with private

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.760
sector experience to do a stint in government and to really try to contribute and serve their

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.080
country. That's how our founders, George Washington and all the founding fathers,

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.040
they were working on their farms. They left their farms, serving government,

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.680
then they went back to the farm. That was the design of the representative government. It wasn't

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:28.480
a career political class. It was people coming in to show gratitude for the freedoms and liberties

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:34.720
that they enjoyed and then do their best to help others have those same opportunities that they had

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:39.680
and then they'd go back and live their lives. I think that there's a lot of opportunity

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.000
with our government of people with more business mindsets who are going to think about things

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.360
from a solutions perspective, go and serve. Is that one of the main problems here? You also

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.440
mentioned the book, The Great Degeneration by Neil Ferguson, an awesome historian. He's been on this

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:02.720
podcast. It helped you understand the inefficiencies of government regulation. I'd love it if you can

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:09.680
give an insight into why government is so inefficient at times. When it is inefficient,

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.640
when it doesn't work, why is that the case? The bureaucracy that you spoke to,

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.360
the negative aspects of the bureaucracy. We don't have enough time on this podcast to go

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:26.160
into it. There's a lot of aspects that work as well, but I do think we've gotten too big.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.040
Neil's book that you mentioned, one of the things that I took from that, I read it I think in 2012,

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.920
kind of in the middle of the great financial crisis, was he was talking about how government

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:41.840
regulation often was put in place to deal with old crises. It was never going to solve future

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:47.680
problems. It was more to solve for problems that had happened in the past. I remember thinking

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:53.200
about that. One thing I was very proud of the work of the Trump administration was that you had four

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.640
years consecutively where there was a net decrease in the cost of regulations. To give you a context,

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:04.800
in the last year of Obama in 2016, there were six million man hours spent by the private sector

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.920
complying with new federal regulations. That's not really what the intent of our government was.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.760
If we have rules or regulations, those should be legislated by Congress. They shouldn't be

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:20.160
put in by bureaucrats who are basically saying, I want to follow this objective. Using the power

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.680
of the pen in order to do that. The deregulatory effort was actually very critical to Trump's

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.880
economic success that happened at the beginning of the administration. Then what I saw with

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.000
regulation was anytime either there was legislation or regulation coming, the people pushing for it

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.840
were usually the people who would benefit from the regulatory captures. You look at the great

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.560
financial crisis where you had this big banking reforms. What happened during the big banking

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:51.200
reforms? Then you had a big reduction in the amount of banks that occurred and the big banks

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.120
became even bigger. Whereas I don't think that was the intention of the legislation,

01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:00.080
but the people who were writing the legislation and influencing it had a lot of the constituencies

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.320
from those larger institutions. Then what happened as a result of that? A lot of these smaller

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.200
institutions didn't have the ability to be as competitive. They had more restrictions,

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.680
more costs. They became less profitable, but these were the banks that were serving small business,

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.880
which is the biggest creator of jobs in our country. Then as a result, the bigger banks got

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:24.560
more powerful. What happened in the country as a result of the regulations that they put in place,

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:30.480
the wealth gap in the country grew. It didn't shrink. I think oftentimes what they say these

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:37.520
regulations are intended to be, the result often becomes the opposite. What President Trump did in

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.160
his administration was they did a massive deregulatory effort. I think they pledged

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:47.920
that for every one regulation they put on, because you do need some regulation in an economy and in

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.960
a society they would take off to. In the first year, they eliminated eight regulations for

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:58.000
every one. That was just something I took from it, which was, I thought, very interesting.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.040
I think you just have to think through what are the consequences going to be of the different

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.640
actions you take. Often government gets it wrong by taking an action that feels right,

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:15.920
but has big negative consequences down the road. Let's go to some difficult topics. You wrote

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.640
in the book about your experience with some very low points in government.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.760
You've been attacked quite a bit. One of the ones that stands out is the accusations of collusion

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:34.000
with Russia. You tell in the book, in general, this whole story, this whole journey, on a personal

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.720
level, on a big political level. Can you tell me some aspects of this story?

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:45.120
Sure. To give the listeners some context, and people remember this now, it's been kind of

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:51.280
swept away because it turned out not to be true, was that after President Trump won the election

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:57.680
in 2016, instead of the media saying, we were wrong, because again, everyone thought he had

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.440
zero chance of winning, they said, okay, well, we couldn't have been wrong. It must have been

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.640
the Russians who worked with him. At first, when this started coming up, I thought this was

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.960
ridiculous. I was very intimately involved with the operations of the campaign. I was running the

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:17.200
finance of the campaign. I was running the digital media of the campaign. I was running the schedule

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:22.960
for the campaign. I knew that on most days, we had trouble coordinating with ourselves,

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.320
collaborating with another government, or colluding, as they called it.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:35.200
We did a great job, I think, as an underdog campaign, very leanly staffed.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.920
And then they said that we were working with the Russians. At the time, I didn't take it

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.640
too seriously because I knew there was no truth to it. But it was amazing to me to start seeing

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.280
all of these institutions, whether it was CNN, The Washington Post, New York Times. These were news

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:57.040
organizations that I grew up having a lot of respect for, taking these accusations so seriously,

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.200
and then working themselves up in order to just cover it for two years. Then as a result,

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.600
you had a special counsel. You had a House investigation, a Senate investigation.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.840
I personally spent about, I think, over 20 hours just testifying before these different committees.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.160
Again, spent millions of dollars out of my own pocket on my legal fees to make sure I was well

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:22.880
represented. The reason I did that was because I saw in Washington, it was like a sick game.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:31.360
Even though there was no underlying problems to the accusation, I felt like this is one of those

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.120
things where they're going to try to catch you. Then if you step on the line, they catch you with

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.920
one misrepresentation. They're going to try to put you in jail or worse. For me, that was a big

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:48.320
concern. It was amazing. My poor mom, I told her to stop reading whatever. I said, I promise you,

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.960
we didn't do anything wrong. It's good. But she'd call me and say, well, our friends were on the

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.800
Upper East Side. We're talking with Chuck Schumer. She says, Jared's going to jail. We know for sure

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.240
that he colluded with the Russians. This is like a leading senator saying things like this.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:06.640
It was just interesting for me to see how the whole world could believe something and be

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.720
talking about it that I knew with 1000% certainty was just not true.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.080
Seeing that play out was very, very hard. Obviously, I was accused of a lot of things.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.120
There were times in Washington I was radioactive. I remember one weekend,

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.760
it was all over CNN. The people, the panels on CNN, the news organization that I grew up

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.720
thinking was the number one trusted name for news in the world, talking about how I'd committed

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.360
treason because I met with an ambassador and said, we'd like to hear your perspective on

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.360
what you think the policy should be in Syria where there was a big civil war happening and ISIS and

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.960
a lot of different things. It was quite a crazy time in that regard, but luckily, again, we were

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.920
able to fight through it. It was a major distraction for our administration. I think we were able to

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.720
stay focused on the objectives and the policies, but it was a crazy time. I learned a lot

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.000
from that experience. It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go.

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:10.000
One of the things that worries me is the effect on your mind, the psychology of it,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.160
to make sure it doesn't make you cynical. People that are trying to do stuff, those kinds of stories

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.920
that can destroy their mind. One of the things I'd love to understand, you who rolled in from the

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:26.560
business world and all of a sudden, the entire world, from CNN to everybody is accusing you of

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:34.400
colluding with the Russians. When you're sitting at home, how do you keep a calm mind, a clear mind,

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.040
a optimistic one that doesn't become cynical and actually just keep trying to push on and do stuff

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:45.280
in the world? It was a surreal experience. I would say number one is I felt very confident that I

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.840
hadn't done anything wrong. I would always tell my lawyer, the good news is I've got a good

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:53.760
fact problem. I need a good lawyer to get me through it, but it's much easier to be a good

01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:00.720
lawyer if you have a very innocent client. The fact that I knew that I didn't believe that I had

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:07.120
any legal liability helped me intellectually separate the challenge I needed to do to fight

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.680
through it from it. Then I just basically said, I'd had hardship earlier in my life where I dealt

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:17.760
with the situation with my father. What I realized there is that you can't really spend energy

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.200
on the things that you don't control. All you can do is spend your time and energy worrying about

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:29.040
what you can control and then how you react to the things that you have there. It took a lot of

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.520
discipline. It took a lot of strength. Again, I give my wife, Ivanka, and even Donald a lot of

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.760
credit for having my back during that time and encouraging me just to fight through it.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.560
Then I also had to make sure that I didn't allow that to distract me from my job. I felt like I

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.800
had an amazing opportunity in the White House to make a difference in the world. If I would have

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.680
spent all my time playing defense, in politics, it's a time duration game. In business, you have

01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.240
whatever duration you set for yourself. In politics, it's time duration. We had four years.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.320
Every day was sand through an hourglass. My mindset was I need to accomplish as much as I

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.120
can in these four years. I guess the traditional game that's played in Washington is whether it's

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.160
the media, the opposition, their job is to distract you and then try to stop you from being

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:22.720
as successful as you want to be. Just fought through it. It wasn't always fun, but we got

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.760
through. Thank God, it's something people don't talk about. It has been amazing to me just the

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:35.040
lack of self-awareness and reflection of a lot of the people who hyped this up for two years.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.280
They don't think there was anything wrong with it. That's interesting, but my view is we got

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.760
through it. It's good. It's in the past. Then I started moving to the future. That's really

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.880
what I want to linger on because to me, that has a really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.800
to do positive in the world. These kinds of attacks are intense. You say one of the lessons

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.720
you learned is that you really have to be perfect, but I hate that to be the lesson.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.680
I feel like you should be able to do stupid stuff, take big risks, and people celebrate the big

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:17.120
risks and not try to weave gigantic stories over nothing. I just want to understand the two

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:24.880
aspects of this, how to not have such stories of so much legs, and the other is how to stay

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.880
psychologically strong. You kind of waved it off that you didn't have a fact problem,

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.320
but it can just have an effect on your psyche. You seem to be pretty stoic about the whole thing,

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:43.920
but just on the psychology side, how did you stay calm and not become cynical where you can

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.040
continue to do stuff and take big risks? I didn't have a choice. What do you mean?

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.920
I could have spent every day feeling sorry for myself or complaining or saying things aren't

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.760
fair, but the general way I looked at it was that in life, every opportunity has a cost.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.760
And you could look at it and say maybe this was a massive cost, either in dollars or in time or

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:15.120
in reputation or in emotional drain, but you could also say that I had an opportunity to work in the

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.360
White House and I had an opportunity to work on some of the hardest challenges. You talk about

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.440
how that's not celebrated, that is something very different. In the private sector, when you take on

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.160
big challenges, that is celebrated. In government, when you take on big challenges, people want to

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.800
see it fail or they want to criticize the people who are trying to take that on. I think that's

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.960
wrong and I think that as a country, we should be thinking big, we should be dreaming big,

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:43.200
and we should be encouraging our politicians to try and to fail more and to go and to take on big

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.400
things knowing that there's risk of failing. We obviously want them to succeed, not to fail,

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.720
but let's take on the big things. Let's try to do that. I think it's just very basic that

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.320
you're in a situation, I've made decisions, I can't go back and change decisions in the past.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.880
I still felt very blessed to be in the position I was in and I knew that I just had to work through

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.720
it. Like I said, I was very lucky to have support from my wife and from my family and from good

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.880
friends. Again, I think I'd chosen very good friends in life and my friends were with me.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.720
I had one friend who, my lowest moment, got on the plane, he lived in Arizona, got on a plane and

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.560
came just to have dinner with me to say, just pick your head up, I know you're down now,

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.120
you're going to be fine, just fight through. That meant a lot to me. Again, I always think

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:31.680
in my life, you don't learn as much from your successes, you don't learn as much from your

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.960
high points, you learn the most about who you want to be and how the world works from your lowest

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.720
moments. At those lowest moments, it made me better and it taught me how to be a better friend to

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.960
people who are in tough situations. I tried to just get tougher and I tried to just get better

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:56.000
and work through it. Yeah, you said that you and Ivanka, this intense time brought you two together

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:03.040
and helped you kind of deal with the intensity of the chaos of it all. I think it was just number

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.280
one, knowing that you had a partner and knowing that you had somebody who loved you and believed

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:12.000
in you. I think that was definitely by far the biggest of anything. Love is the answer.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.240
Love is very important. But then there's also a lot that I've learned from her, always getting

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.040
me to read different books or learn different things, which I love. But she's also, I think,

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:28.960
an amazing role model. I go through our time in Washington where there were so many people who

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:36.160
were, I thought, very nasty to her unfoundedly. I'm not talking about individually because, again,

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.200
most people interacted with her were super kind, but I would see people on Twitter,

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.760
different places go after and she always stayed elegant. I felt like that was something

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:52.800
that she never stooped down to a lower level. She kept her elegance the whole time. She really went

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.000
to Washington wanting to be a force of good. I see all the time that she follows her heart.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.520
She does what's right. She has a very strong moral compass and I feel very lucky to have

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.720
her as a partner and I respect her tremendously. Yeah, she walks to the fire with grace, I would

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.040
say. And she's recommended a bunch of amazing books to me and she has an incredible, a fascinating

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:24.480
mind. But one thing that jumped out to me is you both love diners, Jersey diners. So I lived in

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.880
Philly for a while and I've traveled quite a bit and traveling from Boston down to Philly, maybe to

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.760
D.C. You can drive through Jersey. It's something about Jersey. I don't know what it is. It's the

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:42.240
best. You listen to Bruce Springsteen. Louis C.K. has this bit where I think it's part of criticizing

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.120
cell phones today where people are too much on their phone. They don't just sit there and be

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:53.520
bored. But he uses that story to tell where he's just driving and Bruce Springsteen's song comes

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:58.800
on and he just wants to pull over to the side of the road and just like weep for an unexplainable

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:07.120
reason. I think that's true because life is difficult. Life is full of suffering or struggle

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.480
or challenges. Sometimes it's always Bruce Springsteen, but some kind of song like this can

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.160
really make you reflect on life, that melancholy feeling. But that melancholy feeling is the other

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:26.080
side of the happiness coin where if you just allow yourself to feel that pain, you can also

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.960
feel the highest joys. That's sort of the point Louis C.K. makes. There's something about Jersey

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.840
with the diners, often late at night. There's several diner experiences, I should say.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.840
There's the family-friendly, there's the nice waitress, there's the sweetness, the kindness,

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:48.640
hello sweetheart, that kind of thing. There's also the 3 a.m. diner, the ones that are open 24 hours

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.760
that has a romantic element when you're a young man or young woman. You're traveling

01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:01.440
the loneliness of that, all of it. The American diner is like, from like Jack Kerouac on,

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:08.160
represents something. I'm not sure what that is, but it's like a real beautiful experience and the

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.440
food itself too. Oh, always fresh, yeah. The thing with diners, there's so much to love about it,

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.880
but I grew up obviously in New Jersey when I'd go with my father to business. He'd always stop

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.040
when we'd eat at a diner or late night I'd be coming back with my friends. We'd stop at a diner

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.320
and it's a tradition that Ivanka and I love doing as well. I think there's a notion of,

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.760
it's very egalitarian in that people from all places are there. You could order basically

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.720
whatever you want. I mean, the menus at the diners look like the phone book and it's amazing how

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.680
they keep so much fresh ingredients to do it, at least the good ones do. I love, as a Jersey guy,

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.640
you get mozzarella sticks and an omelet at any hour of the day because most of them are open

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.680
24 hours and that's basically, my Ivanka, my go-to, we'll throw in a milkshake or two as well,

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.640
but for me as a kid, my father would take me. Sometimes I'd sit with him in the meeting,

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.880
sometimes I'd be at the table next to him. He'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the music

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.600
machine that they would have on the wall and it was always just a great experience doing it.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.240
In Jersey, and I joke that if you grew up in Jersey, you grew up with just enough of a chip

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.320
on your shoulder that you have to go and make something of yourself in life. It's a special

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:21.360
place. I had an amazing childhood there and very, very proud to be from the state. I will

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.920
just give a little bit of a plug now because the state has now actually turned the corner and they

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.160
had a $10 billion budget surplus for many years. It was a state that was basically bankrupt and

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.640
now actually under a pretty progressive Democrat governor, Phil Murphy, he's turned the state

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.680
around and it actually has a very bright future ahead. It's probably one of the best places

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.480
to raise a family in the country. It's got very low crime, one of the best public school systems

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.280
in the country, a pretty good healthcare system, a lot of green parks. People know the turnpike,

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.200
but it's got a lot to it. That's really great. I'm a big, big fan of Jersey.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.400
I like how this is a first for this particular podcast. You literally gave a plug to a state.

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.200
New Jersey, everybody. It's where it's at.

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.360
There's South Jersey, there's North Jersey. There's all kinds of Jerseys too. The whole thing,

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840
and don't get me started on the Jersey Shore, Lex.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.040
Jersey Shore is the whole thing.

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.160
I'm not talking about the snooky part. I'm talking about the real nice parts where

01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.600
you have great food, great people.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.120
I mean nice parts. It's all beautiful. The full range of human characters

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.760
that are in New Jersey are all beautiful.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.800
I agree with that.

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.640
Every time I travel across the world, there's always to meet somebody from New Jersey and you

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:39.200
kind of give a nod of a deep understanding. It's the cradle of civilization in many ways.

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.880
Okay. So back, I don't know how we got there. Oh, all right. Going back to the low points,

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.520
you mentioned your father, if we could just return there, even just the personal story

01:49:50.480 --> 01:50:00.080
of your father, that you write about the betrayal that happened in his life and then how he

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.800
responded to that betrayal and he was after that arrested. Can you just tell the story?

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:12.240
Sure. So my father is an amazing person. We grew up in New Jersey. My father was a big developer,

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:20.400
a great entrepreneur, built an amazing business. He got into a dispute with two of his siblings

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.720
and through that dispute, they basically took all of the documents in his company,

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:33.680
went to the U.S. Attorney's office and turned from a civil dispute into a real public dispute.

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:39.920
My father did something wrong in that process and when he got arrested for that, he basically

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:45.360
said what I did was wrong and he took his medicine and he did it like a man and he said,

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:51.520
I'm going to go to prison and he did that for a year. And so for me, that was a very challenging

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:59.600
time in the family. Obviously, it was a shock. It was a total change. I grew up, my childhood was,

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:03.680
I think, a very nice childhood. My parents always said do good in school, work hard.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:09.840
I was very focused on my athletics. I was captain of the basketball team, captain of the hockey team.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.480
I ran a marathon with my father and it was always about pursuing. I went to Harvard,

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:19.120
graduated with honors and then was in NYU pursuing a law degree and a business degree.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.120
And I was working at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office at the time actually thinking

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.600
I wanted to go into public service because my father always taught us. We were always surrounded

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:33.360
by politicians and he always said, my parents came to America, they lived in the land of

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.560
opportunity and they had these opportunities because this is the best country in the world.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:44.160
And so you should be successful, work hard, don't ever let your opportunities become your

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.680
disadvantages. Because you have advantages in life, you have to work harder and that's what

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:51.840
he instilled in myself and my brother and he always pushed us to make the most of ourselves.

01:51:52.480 --> 01:52:00.080
And when we did that, everything changed overnight when my father got arrested. Obviously,

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.760
it's very embarrassing for a family when you're on the front page of the papers. I would see

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.440
the newspapers writing all these things about my father that I didn't think were representative

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:17.360
of the person that I knew. It was a big change for our family and I was angry. I was angry. I

01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:22.800
could be angry at the prosecutor. I could be angry at my father's brother. I could be angry

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:28.000
at my father's lawyers. I could be angry at my father for making this mistake. And then I kind

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:34.080
of said, that's not going to change anything. And I had a real shift and I do think that that was a

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.520
turning point in my life where I basically said, let me focus on the things I can control. Let

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:43.840
me focus on the positive things I can do. And from that moment forward, I said, how can I be

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:49.680
a great son to my father? How can I be a great older brother slash substitute father for my

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.360
two sisters and my younger brother? How could I be there for my mother? How could I be there

01:52:53.360 --> 01:53:00.960
for my father's business? And I just went into battle mode and I put my armor on and I just

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:06.000
ran into it. And for the next two years, every day was painful. I was dealing with banks. I was

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.920
dealing with the companies still at subpoenas. I was still in law school. I told my father I

01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.200
wanted to drop out of law school and business school, but he said, please don't. So I would

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:17.760
basically go to law school one day a week or maybe I'd skip it most days and I'd go to his

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.720
office every day. And my friends would joke that if my professors wanted to fail me, the law

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:26.960
professor would have to give me a test that had four pictures and say, circle who your professor

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:30.880
is. But I would basically take a week off. I'd read the books and I did well and I got my degrees.

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:37.520
And it was just a very, very challenging time. But like I said to you before is that you learn

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.880
the most about life and you learn the most about humanity and yourself when you're in your most

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:49.200
challenging periods. And I'll say that that experience also changed the people I interacted

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:53.840
with. Spending weekends with my father down in a prison in Alabama, I met the other inmates,

01:53:53.840 --> 01:54:00.000
I met their families. I spent time then trying to advise the children of other people who were

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.480
going through the same experience that I'd gone through on how to navigate it correctly.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.160
And you just learn a lot about the world and you see that in life everything could get taken from

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:16.240
you, your status, your money, your friends. I saw that certain people were very disloyal to my

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.800
father at the time who he thought were friends. It was only a handful, but again, I learned from

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:26.000
those people, how can I be a true friend to people? How can I be better? And I learned a

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.280
tremendous amount through that experience. You're right that your father told you about being

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.320
humble. I'd love to ask you about this, that in life sometimes we get so powerful that we start

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.760
to think we're the dealers of our own fate. We're not the dealers, God is the dealer.

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.800
Sometimes we have to be brought back down to earth to get perspective on what is really important.

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:49.760
What do you think he meant by that? What did you learn from that experience?

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.280
The way I interpreted it at the time, and those were very, very memorable words, and it occurred,

01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.800
I was down after I picked up my father from the arraignment. I drove him down, I drove the car,

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.120
and my father and I were very, very close, and he didn't say a word for the whole time.

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:11.360
And I think he was processing, number one, what was happening to him. And I couldn't even imagine,

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:16.720
but I actually think the bigger pain for him, because my father is such a committed person

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.840
to the family, is like, did I let my family down? Did I let my kids down? And I do think he felt

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:27.840
at that moment like his life was over. He couldn't really see past what this challenge

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:32.000
was going to bring and if there would be a life for him after it. So I could see that he had a

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.680
lot of fear, and he really wasn't saying much. And then I didn't know what to do, and so I just

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:46.000
stood by him and stood close. And later that day, or the next day, he got up and started walking.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.880
He had an ankle monitor. For whatever reason, the prosecutor was so aggressive. He was a flight risk,

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.480
so they made him wear an ankle monitor. They were very, very aggressive and nasty. And at the time,

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.800
my father was the biggest donor to Democrats. The prosecutor was a Republican. It was a very

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.120
political thing. And what happened was he was walking around the pool, and I just started

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.520
walking with him. And he said to me, you know, Jared and life, sometimes we get so powerful

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.080
that we believe that we're the dealer. He says, but we're not the dealer. God's the dealer,

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:19.440
and we have to come down to earth to understand, like you said. So what I took from that was that

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:27.040
my father, with all of his success, had started to believe that maybe certain rules didn't apply

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.680
to him. And I think that that's where he made a mistake. And I think he had a lot of regret

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.080
that he made the mistake. And my father is a very humble person. He's a very moral person.

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:41.680
For me, with my humility, my brother and I joke that we give our credit for being humble, number

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.000
one, to being Mets fans, because every year you have a lot of promise, and then it never ends up

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.440
paying off. Although now with Steve Cohen, hopefully we run a different trajectory.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:55.200
But the other thing is also our mother. Our mother really raised us to be very humble.

01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:02.080
We knew we had a lot, but every Sunday morning my mom was there clipping the coupons. The cereal we

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:09.280
ate in our house was based on what was on sale versus what we liked. When we would have a problem

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:12.800
with our teachers in school, and I'd say, well, teacher doesn't like me, she'd say, well, I'm not

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.840
calling them. It's your job to make the teacher like you. And so my mother gave us a lot of that.

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:23.200
My father gave us a lot of the grounding. And I think during that time, my father was just

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:32.560
realizing that maybe he had gotten disconnected from the grounding and the values. And again,

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.280
I think he also accepted maybe he could have blamed others for acting inappropriately, but

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.480
I respect the fact that he took responsibility himself and said, I can't control the actions of

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.760
other people. I can't control what they do is right and wrong. I can just control my actions.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.840
As I go on the next journeys in my life, and I go to government, I go to Washington, I even

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.280
think through the craziness of going from visiting my father in a prison to 10 years later sitting in

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:04.960
the office in the White House next to the President of the United States. And I think about that story

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.240
and that it's a story that only God could write. And I really believe that you have to have a lot

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:18.880
of faith because the lows and the highs are both so extreme and unbelievable that I feel like those

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:24.240
low moments in some ways allowed me to keep my grounding and to understand what was truly

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:29.120
important in life for when I ended up going through those other moments. Your father was

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:36.320
betrayed perhaps over money by siblings. Is there some deeper wisdom you can draw from that?

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.240
Have you seen money or perhaps power cloud people's judgment?

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.840
Oh, a hundred percent. A hundred percent.

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:50.080
Is there some kind of optimistic thing you can take from that about human nature

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:57.360
of how to escape that clouding of judgment when you're talking about leaders, when you're talking

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:03.760
about government, even business? Because you mentioned there's a power dynamics at play always

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:11.280
when you're negotiating. Is there a way to see the common humanity and not see the sort of

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:16.320
will to power in the whole thing? Definitely. You mentioned about power,

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:20.720
money corrupting. There's a great quote I heard a friend of mine say. It's a guy, Michael Harris,

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:26.000
who was one of the founders of Death Row Records. And he was being interviewed recently and they

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
asked him about what happened with Suge Knight. And his line was, money just makes you more of

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.640
what you already are, which I thought was a very elegant way of saying it. And I would see this

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:42.560
time and time again in the White House where you had people who were now given a lot of responsibility

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:51.120
and power and it went to their head and they acted very crazily and maybe didn't act in a

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.760
way that I thought was always conducive to the objective. So I think it's a very big problem that

01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:01.280
you have. Whether it's something that's solvable, I think it's about having the right leaders and

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:04.960
hopefully for the leaders having good friends. I mean, I'm still friends with a lot of the people

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:09.680
I interacted with when I was in government and the number one thing I try to be to them is just a

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:14.240
good friend. I try to be somebody who they can talk about things with. I don't go in trying to

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:19.920
tell them what to do on different things. And I think that that's a big thing is that people

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.240
just need friends and they need conversation. And if they have that, then hopefully that allows them

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:29.440
to keep their head in the right place. I think this is a good place to ask

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:36.560
about one aspect of the fascinating work you've done, which is on prison reform. Can you take me

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:43.200
through your journey of helping the bipartisan bill get passed? Just working on prison reform

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:47.680
in the White House in general, how you made that happen, how you help make that happen?

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:53.520
Sure. We passed a law called the First Step Act, which was the largest

02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:59.520
prison and criminal justice reform bill that's been done maybe in 30, 40, 50 years in the US.

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.720
What it basically did was two things. Number one is it took the prison system and it took a certain

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:12.480
class of offenders and allowed them to become eligible for earlier release if they go through

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:17.600
the certain trainings that will allow them to have a lower probability of going back.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.480
Stepping back, you look at the prison system and you say, what's the purpose? Is it to

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:28.400
punish? Is it to warehouse? Is it to rehabilitate? I do think that we're a country that believes in

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:35.200
second chances. I saw firsthand when my father was a client of the system how inefficient it was and

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:40.320
how much better it could be. When my father got out, we didn't run from that experience.

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.000
He started hiring people from Rikers Island and different prisons into the company into a second

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.680
chance program, which we're very, very proud of doing. What we saw through our micro experience

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:57.440
was that if you give people mentorship, if you give them job training, a lot of people leave,

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:03.360
they have addiction issues and they can't find housing. People leave prison with a criminal

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:10.480
record and they're less likely to go back and reintegrate in society without help from

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.120
different institutions that can help them do that. We modeled the reforms off of what they did in

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.000
Texas and Georgia and other states where they basically put a lot of job training, alcohol,

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.080
and addiction treatment programs in the prisons as a way to incentivize the prisoners to work

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.120
on themselves while they're there in order to allow them to reenter society. It's turned out

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.840
to be very successful so far. They just had a report that showed that the general population

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.200
has had a 47% recidivism rate, meaning that people who leave federal prison,

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.840
half of them go back and people who have now taken this program, only 12% of them go back.

02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.560
Number one, you're making communities safer because if people are going to now get a job

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.960
and enter society instead of committing future crimes, you're avoiding future crimes. Number

02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:02.080
two, you're giving people a second chance at life. That was the first part of it.

02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.800
The second thing we did was there was a rule passed in the 90s that basically penalized

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.920
crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty of what regular cocaine was. I think a lot of the

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:21.120
motivations what people say in retrospect was that crack was more of a black drug and cocaine was

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.800
more of a white drug. There was a really racial disparity in terms of what the application of

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:33.760
these sentences were. They then revised that to make it 18 to 1. What we did in this bill is we

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:40.240
allowed it to go retroactive to allow people who were in prison with sentences under what we thought

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:45.200
was the racist law to be able to make an application to a judge in order to be dismissed. It was based

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.680
on good behavior, being rehabilitated and the fact that they would have a low probability of offending

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.680
in the future. That was really the meat of it. There was a couple other things in there we did

02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:01.840
as well, which were also quite good. We did it, worked very closely with the Democrats,

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:06.880
Republicans to do it. At first, President Trump was a little bit skeptical of it because he's a

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:12.560
big strong law and order supporter, but he made me work very hard to put together a coalition of

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:19.680
Republicans and Democrats and law enforcement. We had the support from the policemen. We had

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.640
the support from the ACLU. Ultimately, we were able to get it together. It was an amazing thing.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:32.640
We ended up getting 87 votes in the Senate. This happened for me at a time while the Russia

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.360
investigation stuff was still happening. A new chief of staff came in, John Kelly. He basically

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.720
marginalized me and the operations, so I had less day-to-day responsibilities in the White House.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:48.720
For me, this effort became one of my full-time efforts along with negotiating the Mexico trade

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:54.080
deal and along with the Middle East efforts. The reason why that was great was because it didn't

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:59.040
have a lot of support from the Republican caucus originally, and people thought there was no way

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:04.480
it would happen, so I really was able to be the chief executive, the middle executive,

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:08.800
the low executive, the intern. Through that process, I really got an education

02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.480
on how Congress works, on how to pass legislation. I was negotiating text. I was negotiating back

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:19.360
and forth, and I built a lot of trust. Again, I deal with whether it's Hakeem Jeffries or

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:22.880
Cedric Richmond, that we built a lot of trust. We'd speak three times a day.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:27.760
These guys had my back. The ACLU, again, I never thought they were suing our administration every

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.680
day or every other day on something, but for whatever reason, we built trust and were able

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:37.680
to work together. Then also with the real conservative groups, because there was a big

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:42.080
part of the conservative base that felt like we should be giving people a second chance.

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:47.200
In addition to that, this will keep our country safer and it will reduce the cost of what we spend

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:52.480
on prisons. It was a great effort, and I was very, very proud that we're able to get it done.

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:56.800
How'd you convince the Republicans? They were skeptical at first.

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:03.680
We're talking about phone conversations, going out to lunch, just back to the emojis or what?

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:08.640
Hand-to-hand combat, meetings. The cool thing about this is everyone always says,

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:12.560
I always get frustrated when I hear lawmakers say, oh, the Senate's not what it used to be,

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:17.200
or Congress isn't what it used to be. Things are broken today. I don't think that's true.

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:23.840
Going through the process, I think that our founders were totally genius in the way that they

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:28.960
designed our system of government. What I saw is you just have to work it. Everyone knows the power

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:32.560
of their vote. Some would give it to me easily. Some wouldn't give it to me easily. Some would

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.240
trade it for other things. Some would withhold it because they were pissed about other things.

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:40.800
It was just hand-to-hand combat. It was just making calls, using the phone, walking the halls,

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:46.640
going to lunches, hosting dinners at my house. It was a nonstop lobbying effort. By the way,

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:50.960
it was also adjudicating issues and making people feel like they were heard, hearing their issues,

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:56.320
and then trying to find solutions that you don't put something in that then tips off where you

02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:02.560
lose a whole coalition. It was really a balancing act, but it was an amazing thing. I worked very

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:07.200
closely on that with Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, who also gave me a lot of help on the left.

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.720
It was an amazing thing. I had a great team, too.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:14.320
So you mentioned the importance of trust at the very beginning of the conversation.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.920
From the outsider perspective, just maybe a dark question, which is how much

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:28.720
trust is there in Washington? The flip side of that, how much backstabbing is there?

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:40.000
Can you form long-term relationships with people on a basic human level where you know you're not

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:46.880
going to be betrayed, screwed over, manipulated for, again, going back to the old money and power?

02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:53.760
The answer is yes, and the answer is no. I made some incredible friends, lifelong friends,

02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:58.720
through my time in Washington. But the way I think about it from politics,

02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:03.600
and I think in geopolitics as well, is I would say that politicians really don't have friends,

02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:09.280
politicians have interests. As long as you follow that rule, you should be able to know

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:16.240
how to rate where your relationship with a given person falls in the spectrum. But I do

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:21.520
think I was the exception. I did make some tremendous friends. Again, I'd go back to what

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:27.760
I said about negotiation, where when you're in a situation where there's really nothing in it for

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.800
any of you personally, but you're in a foxhole together and nobody in Washington can get anything

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:37.040
done by themselves. You have people coming from all different backgrounds, all different experiences,

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:42.240
all different geographies, coming together, agreeing on an objective, creating a plan,

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:47.280
and then every day rowing together in order to get it done. It's a beautiful thing. You really

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:52.400
learn what people are about. When you go through an experience like that, you learn who's in it for

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.680
themselves, you learn who's in it for the cause. For every thing you read about in the press of a

02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:03.600
fight I had with somebody because we were at odds, I have about 100 people who have become lifelong

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.320
friends because I respect the way that when we were under fire together, they got better,

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:13.760
they were competent, and they were there to serve for the right reason. I guess the answer is yes,

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:20.000
it is possible. You have to be careful because there are a lot of mercurial people there. I

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.200
always say the politicians are like gladiators. I didn't have as much respect for politicians

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.960
until I got there, but if you think about it, everyone who's got a congressional seat or a

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.600
Senate seat, there's 25 people back at home who want their job. We think they're smarter than them

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:40.240
who are trying to backstab them. I always say that the political dynamic, it's like in the private

02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.200
sector, you're standing on flat ground. You choose which fights you take on, when you take them on,

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:50.560
how you fight them. In politics, it's like you're standing on a ball. What you have to realize is

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:56.080
that there's maybe 10 things that you have to do, but there's a potential cost to taking on each one

02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.640
that might destabilize you. You fall off the ball, and then you lose your opportunity

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:06.160
to pursue those. You have to always be marking everything to market and going through your

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.680
calculations to make sure you can accomplish what you want to without falling off the ball

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:15.600
and losing your opportunity to make a difference. I guess people like power.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.640
I just feel like to be a good politician, you should be willing, good meaning good for humanity,

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:31.040
be willing to let go of power. Try to do the right thing. If there's somebody back home

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.800
that does manipulative stuff, screws you over, and takes power from you, it's okay.

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:43.440
I feel like that kind of humility is required to be a great leader. I feel like that's actually

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:50.880
a good way to have long-term power because karma has a viral aspect to it. Just doing good by others,

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:58.720
I feel like, is a- I'd like to say that's true, Lex. I think it's just way more complicated.

02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.520
Look what happened this week with Kevin McCarthy. He did what he thought was morally right.

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.480
He did a bipartisan deal. He was told that they would have his back, and then the moment things

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:16.320
got tough, they cut him loose. Again, I don't know if that was the right thing or the wrong thing.

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:21.920
I've also seen leaders on the other end say, I'm going to do things that are short-term more

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:28.880
selfish, but the way they justify to themselves is to say, I believe that myself staying in power

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:35.040
is existential to the greater good, so I will do things that maybe are not in the greater good now

02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:42.560
because I believe that my maintaining power is. It's complicated. In an idealized world,

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:46.480
I'd love to believe that's the case, but it's just way more complicated than that.

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:55.120
I wish it wasn't, but it is. Yeah. I do just wish people zoomed out,

02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.160
people in politics zoomed out a bit and just asked themselves, what are we all doing this for?

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:07.600
Sometimes you can get a little bit lost in the game of it. If you zoom out, you realize integrity

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:15.440
is way more important than little gains in money or little gains in power in the long term,

02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:20.960
just when you look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day, and also how history remembers

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:30.000
you. I just feel like people do some dark stuff in that moment when they're losing power and they

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.640
try to hold on a little too hard. This is when they can do really dark things, like bring out

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:43.520
the worst in themselves. It's just sad to see, and I wish there was a machinery of government

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.880
would inspire people to be their best selves in their last days versus their worst selves.

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:55.760
When that system gets invented, you'll share with me what it is. Look, let me give you another way

02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:02.080
to frame it. This was the revelation we spoke before about when I was getting my butt kicked

02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.600
by the Russia investigation and all the different areas. The basic framework I looked at was,

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:12.240
I said, okay, this all feels tough, but I said, the game's the game. The game's been here

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:19.680
way longer, but way before I came, and it'll be here way long after I leave. I have two choices.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:24.080
I can complain that the game's tough, it's not fair, it's not moral, or I can go and I can try

02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:28.880
to play the game as hard as possible. I think that there's two different things. You have people who

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:34.960
are willing to sit in the stands and they're willing to yell at the players or make their

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.160
points known, or you have people who are willing to suit up and get in the arena and go play.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.520
I have a lot of respect for the people who suit up and go play. Again, some of them,

02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:49.280
I wish they would play for different means, but the fact that they're willing to put their name

02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:53.600
on the ballot, make the sacrifice, and go put on the pads and get hit and hit others,

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.040
I think that you need those people, and I wish more people who had maybe the moral wiring that

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.840
you discussed would be putting on a helmet and going to play, because it's hard. It's hard.

02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:09.200
I agree with you. I just would love to fix the aspect of the Russia collusion accusation,

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:14.320
the virality, the power of that, because that's a really discouraging thing for people. Maybe it's

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:20.000
the way it has to be, but it seems like a disincentive to people to participate.

02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:24.960
It is, but I'll give you, again, an optimistic side of it is that what you're seeing now with

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:31.920
social media is I do think with what's happening at X, there is now more of a reversion towards

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:43.440
more egalitarianism of information. For many years, the media publications were the gatekeepers,

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:48.480
and then you had these social media companies that grew, they became so powerful, but then they were

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:54.480
tilting the scales. Why they were doing it, we can go through long explanations for that,

02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:58.960
but if there truly is a real forum and a democratization of information, then you

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.600
would think that the marketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and discredit the non-real

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:08.320
ones. I think that as a society, we're starting to come to grips with the fact that the power

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.520
dynamic is changing and that some of these institutions that we used to have a lot of faith

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:18.480
and don't deserve our faith, and some of them will actually reform and maybe re-earn our faith.

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.920
I think that there could be an optimistic tone. Again, the years of Trump, I think that

02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:31.520
he was an outsider and he represented something that was existential to the system. You think

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:36.720
about for the 30 years before, you were either part of the Clinton dynasty or the Bush dynasty.

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.400
I think a lot of people in the country felt like that whole class, whether you're wearing a red

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.840
shirt or a blue shirt, wasn't representing them, and Trump represented a true outsider to that

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:54.240
system. I do think that as he went in there, there was a lot of norms that were broken to try to stop

02:15:54.240 --> 02:16:01.840
him from changing the traditional power structure. I think that we're at a time where maybe there

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:08.240
will be an optimistic breakthrough where you'll have institutions that will allow for a lot more

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:14.960
transparency into what truth really is. I'd love to go back and talk to you about the Middle East

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.160
because there's so many interesting components to this. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia. First,

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:26.000
let me ask you about MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince. You've gotten to know him pretty

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.960
well. You've become friends with him. What's he like as a human being, just on a basic human level?

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:37.200
What's he like? For the listeners, Mohammed bin Salman is now the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.920
He's risen to that position over the last couple of years and he's been a tremendous reformer for

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:49.440
the country. He's gone in and he's really modernized the economy. He's put a lot more

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.760
investment into the country. He's marginalized the religious police and he's really done a good job

02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:02.080
to bring modernization and a lot of reform. He's been a great reformer. What he's like as a person

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:10.240
is he's very high energy. He's got tremendous candle power, very, very smart, incredibly well

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:15.440
read. When he was younger, his father would give him a book a week and make him report on it on

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:22.080
the weekend. He was trained as a leader and as a politician really by his father. He's not

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.440
Western educated, so he grew up in the Saudi culture and he's a real Saudi nationalist.

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:33.920
He loves their history, loves their heritage, has a steep understanding of the tribal nature

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:40.000
of the region. His father was actually known to be a tremendous politician. When he was

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.440
governor of Riyadh, people who I speak to today about him say that if they had a full election,

02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.560
he would have won in a landslide. They say every time somebody went to the hospital,

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:53.440
he was the first person to call. Anytime there was a funeral, he was the first person to show up.

02:17:53.520 --> 02:18:00.880
He's a very, very beloved leader. Mahmoud Bin Salman, he was a businessman before he got into

02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:08.000
Crown Prince. He thinks really with a business mindset about how he runs the country. He's

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.240
brought, I think, a different mindset and energy to the Middle East. One thing I'll say maybe that

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:20.640
comes to mind here is that I remember early on talking with him about all the different

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:25.360
initiatives he was taking on. He's building a big city called Neom in the desert, in a place

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:29.440
where there really was nothing on the Red Sea. A lot of people were criticizing the ambition of

02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:34.320
the plan. I was sitting with him one night and I said, why are you taking on all these things?

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:39.280
You've got a lot of different programs, but what most politicians do is they set lower

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:43.520
expectations and then they exceed the expectations. He looked at me without hesitation. He says,

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:50.320
Jared, the way I look at it is that in five years from now, if I set five goals and I achieve five

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:55.840
goals, I'll achieve five things. If I set 100 goals and I fail at 50 of them, then in five years

02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:01.760
I'll accomplish 50 things. It's a very different mindset as a leader. The way I got to work with

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:08.160
him was Saudi Arabia was a big topic in the campaign. President Trump was basically saying

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:12.960
during the campaign that they've got to pay for their fair share. They haven't been a great

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:17.920
partner in the region. He's very critical of Saudi. Then during the transition,

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:22.080
I was asked by several friends to meet with a representative of Saudi Arabia. I said,

02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:26.720
I don't want to meet with them. I came over and I met and they said, well, we want to make changes.

02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:31.680
I said, well, you have to make changes to how you treat women. Then women couldn't drive.

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:36.480
They had guardianship laws, so you've got to start working with Israel. You have to be paying more

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.840
if you're fair share and you have to be stopping the Wahhabism that's being spread. Again, I had

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.880
no knowledge. These were just the traditional talking points about Saudi Arabia. The guy I

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:52.480
was with basically said as a guy, Fadel Tunzi, who's a very respected minister there, he says,

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.040
Jared says, you don't know much about Saudi Arabia, do you? I said, no, no, no, I don't.

02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:02.800
Just really what I've been told or what I read. He says, okay, let me do this.

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:08.480
We want to be great allies with America. We've traditionally been great allies with America.

02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:13.280
Can I come back to you with a proposal on ways that we can make progress on all of the different

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:17.840
areas where we have joint interests? Keep in mind at that point in time, the Middle East was a mess.

02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:24.000
Probably the single biggest issue we had after ISIS was the ideological battle. If you remember

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.760
in 2016, there was the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. You had the San Bernardino shooting.

02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:36.720
People were being radicalized online with the extremism. Then there was a lot of crimes that

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:42.720
were happening because of that. It was a big topic in the campaign. That, when I was thinking about

02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:46.480
talking to different generals and what capabilities the US had to really combat

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:51.920
the extremism and the ideological battle, what we realized was that Saudi Arabia is the custodian

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:57.760
of the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina, that that would be the best partner to

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.160
work with if they were willing to. For years, they really hadn't been willing to lean into this fight.

02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.880
I said, sure, give a proposal. They come back, give a proposal. They said, look,

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.760
if you make President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia,

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:16.320
we will do all these different things. We'll increase our military spending and cooperation.

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:21.840
We'll counter all the terror financing. Unbelievable layer. I took the proposal. I

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:26.480
went to the national and then it was General Flynn. I said, if Saudi Arabia did these things,

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:31.600
would this be considered a big, unbelievable, but it will never happen? I said, well,

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:35.120
they're telling me they want to do these things. Again, having no foreign policy experience,

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.680
I'm just saying I've got somebody telling me they want to do it. That's where we started.

02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:45.120
Again, to office, I don't think much more about it. Then I think it was a baby of a month in,

02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:51.360
President Trump has a call with King Salman. Before the call, we're in the Oval Office.

02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:56.560
The President's basically saying, well, this is what we want to go through.

02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:03.120
I have Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson, the Minister of Defense and the Secretary of

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:09.840
State, basically saying, you have to deal with MBN. MBN is the guy who's been our partner for

02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:12.640
all these years. He's the head of intelligence and he's been a great partner. I said, well,

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:16.160
if he's been a great partner, then why do we have all these problems that you guys are complaining

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.800
about with Saudi? I said, I've been told that we have this proposal from MBS, who's the Deputy

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.000
Crown Prince, and that's who we should be dealing with on this. The phone call starts

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:30.880
and President Trump listened to both of us. On the phone call with King Salman,

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.600
President Trump says, okay, we'll go through all these things. These are the things we want to get

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:41.280
done. He says, well, who should we deal with? King Salman says, deal with my son, the Deputy

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:46.800
Crown Prince, MBS. President Trump said on the phone, have him deal with Jared, because I think

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.920
he knew that if he put him with the other guys, they were not believers in what he had the ability

02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:56.320
to do. That's how I got assigned to work with him. I get back to my office after that, have an email

02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:01.600
from him, spoke to him for the first time. Then we just went to work. A lot of people were betting

02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:05.600
against that trip. They thought it wasn't going to be successful, and they've been betting against

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:11.760
him. He's been underestimated, but he's been doing an incredible job. The whole Middle East

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.640
is different today because of the work that he's done. Maybe it's instructive to go through the

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:22.880
mental journey that you went on from the talking points, the basic narratives, the very basic

02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:30.720
talking points, the understanding of Saudi Arabia, to making that human connection with MBS

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:36.000
and making the positive connection that's actually possible to solve problems. What was that journey

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:42.160
like? Why was it so difficult to take for others, and why were you effective in being able to take

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:48.480
that journey yourself? Maybe some of it came from my inexperience, but my desire to listen

02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:54.080
and hear people. I had this proposal. I was told that all of these things were good.

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:59.200
Then we're trying to schedule this trip, and the National Security Council calls a meeting where

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:05.440
we're in the Situation Room, and we have Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State,

02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:09.040
and everyone's saying, this is going to be a disaster. They said, if we go to Saudi Arabia,

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:13.680
the Saudis never keep their promises. Our Secretary of State at the time was a gentleman

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:20.640
named Rex Tillerson, who'd been the CEO of Aksan. He dealt with all these people very extensively,

02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:24.400
and he basically said, in my experience, the Saudis won't come through, and Jared,

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.320
you don't know what you're doing. You're wasting your time. I basically was at a point where I

02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:32.720
said, look, guys, but they're saying they want to do all these things. Shouldn't we at least give

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:40.160
them a chance to try to do it? Why do we want to predetermine their direction by not giving them

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.080
a chance to change? Just because things in the past haven't gotten the way you want them to,

02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:48.640
that doesn't mean they can't go that way in the future. We fought the battle. They basically

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:52.880
deferred and let me go through with it, but when I do the planning meetings for the trip,

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:56.880
nobody would show up because they all thought it was going to be an absolute disaster. By the way,

02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.760
they probably weren't wrong to think that because I'd never planned a foreign trip before,

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.480
and I'd never done any foreign policy before. During the planning, I'd speak to MBS almost

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:09.600
every day, and I'd go through all the different details and the things that would be coming up,

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:13.600
and I said, look, I really need to get these things in writing. He sent over a guy, Dr. Masada

02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:19.280
Liban, who's a tremendous diplomat for them, and he came to Washington, stayed for three weeks,

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:24.000
and we worked through all the different details of what we needed, and we ended up coming to

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.280
an arrangement on what it should be. I think about now in retrospect why I was so focused on

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.640
getting things like this done and why I even believed that they could be possible, but the

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.840
answer is really the people I was talking to on the other end were telling me that these things

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:47.280
were possible, and so just because they hadn't been done before and just because others around

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.600
me didn't believe that they could be done, I wasn't willing to just say, well, let's not try.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:59.920
It just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing, and you sent me a great essay from

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:06.240
Paul Graham, I'm a big fan of, that I think explains a lot of your success. The essay is called

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.880
How to Do Great Work, and people should go definitely read the full essay. There's a few

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:16.320
things I could read from it, some quotes. Having new ideas is a strange game because it usually

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.120
consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends

02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:28.960
to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before? Seeing something obvious sounds easy and

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:36.800
empirically having new ideas is hard. The steps you took seem trivial, and yet nobody was taking

02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.080
them, or at least in the past they weren't successful. The successes you've had were as

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:48.560
simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying. There's a lot of interesting things here

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:57.200
to talk about this aspect of doing this seemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do. It, as Paul

02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:02.240
describes, requires a willingness to break rules. There are two ways to be comfortable breaking

02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:08.160
rules, to enjoy breaking them and to be indifferent to them. That's an interesting distinction. I call

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.680
these two cases being aggressively and passively independent minded. So again, that's to enjoy

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:18.640
breaking the rules or being indifferent to the rules. The aggressively independent minded are

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:25.360
the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them. Breaking rules gives them additional energy.

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:29.760
For this sort of person, delight at the sheer of audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:34.000
activation energy to get it started. The other way to break the rules is not to care about them at

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.120
all or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:47.440
Their ignorance of a field, ignorance maybe in quotes, of a field's assumptions act as a

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:53.680
source of temporary passive independent mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity

02:27:53.680 --> 02:28:00.800
to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas. So the aggressive

02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:07.120
and the passive, it's such an interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps some aspect of this,

02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:13.440
at least in the story you told us, some passive aspect where you're like not even acknowledging,

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:18.720
not even caring that there was rules, just kind of asking the simple question and taking the simple

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:24.880
action. I think that was an essay I read and we're doing just a snippet of it, but I would

02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:29.680
encourage anyone listening to go and find it and read the entire thing because it's something that

02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:35.760
really spoke to me as I was transitioning into my new career now. And I just loved it. But when we

02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:42.480
were talking about why certain people who don't have traditional qualifications are able to come in

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.040
and do incredible work and solve complex problems, it made me think of that essay,

02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:52.560
which is why I shared it. And I think that in the context of the work that I was doing here,

02:28:53.760 --> 02:29:00.160
perhaps not having the historical context became an advantage and obviously went back and then

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:05.040
tried to study it. But if you go into a problem, I always find that, especially in the political

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:11.120
realm, my favorite political issues are ones where they're contrarian by being obvious.

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:16.800
And sometimes they feel very intuitive and so you take them on. There's always a lot of resistance

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:22.320
when you go against something that's been accepted as the way that you're supposed to do things.

02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:29.040
And I came to learn over the course of my time in government that when everyone was agreeing with

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:34.400
what I was doing, then it actually made me more nervous because I felt like you have these problems

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.800
that haven't been solved for a long time. And then if you take the same approach as others,

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.040
you're going to fail just like they did. So taking a different approach doesn't mean you're going to

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:49.760
succeed, but at least if you fail, you're going to fail in an original way. And so I did like this

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:56.400
a lot. And I think that what I saw was the people who were very good at getting things done that

02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:01.920
hadn't been done before were people who came with different qualifications, different perspectives,

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:07.040
and they came in and really worked the problem in untraditional ways. And so I think in the Middle

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:11.840
East, I came in with a very different approach than people before me, not because I came in

02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:17.200
deliberately trying to do it differently, but because I came in trying to listen and understand

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:22.880
from people why the problem hadn't been solved. And then think from a first principles perspective

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:27.600
on what's the right perspective today, not based on what happened 50 years ago, or not based on

02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:31.760
what somebody's feelings who were hurt, but what's the right thing to make people's lives better,

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:38.880
to make the world a safer and more prosperous place tomorrow. So if we can go back to MPS for

02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:45.680
a little bit, from the person to the vision, there's something called Vision 2030 about

02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:51.120
his vision for Saudi Arabia in the future. Can you maybe look from his perspective, what is his

02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:59.280
vision for the region? Sure. So it's funny, we were talking before about how we wish leaders would set

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:05.120
big audacious goals and take on big things. Well, that's what he did with Vision 2030. When he was

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:08.800
young, and again, this is something that was derided, and a lot of people were very skeptical

02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:13.920
of it. But the people who actually picked it up and read it said this is a very thoughtful plan

02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:19.360
that's very achievable. So he studied his country and said, what's our place in the world? What are

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:25.680
our advantages? What are our disadvantages? And then he set publicly KPIs that he wanted to hold

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:30.240
his country to and then put in place plans and committees and really worked hard to push things

02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:34.640
in that direction, which was pretty remarkable. I think that it's something when I saw it,

02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:40.320
I thought it was very refreshing. I said, wait, in America, why don't we have set goals? Why don't

02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:45.040
we have KPIs? And I do think that it's something that most countries, if not all countries should

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:51.600
have. One of my favorite quotes was from the Alice in Wonderland where the Cheshire Cat says,

02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:55.840
if you don't know where you're going, it doesn't matter which path you take. And so I think that

02:31:55.840 --> 02:32:00.640
that's something that really helped set them on a good path and they've been very successful with

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:06.800
it. One of the things he told me about putting that together was he said, my father's generation,

02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:10.880
they created this country from almost nothing. They came here, they were a poor country,

02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:15.440
they were Bedouins in the desert, and then they look back and see what they've done over 50 years

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:20.080
and they say, it's absolutely remarkable. He said his generation, they come in and they say,

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:25.760
we're very grateful for everything that's been done to date, but we have so much opportunity

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:31.120
that we're not taking advantage of. And so he's now empowered the next generation to be ambitious

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:35.520
and think big and grow with it. What that means for his vision for the Middle East is that

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:40.800
the general architecture that should exist, and now there's excitement in the discussions

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:45.840
with Israel that have advanced, was the general view of what we thought from a Trump perspective

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:51.920
should be the new Middle East is having an economic and security corridor all the way from

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:57.280
Haifa to Muscat, from Oman to Israel, where basically you go through and if you can create

02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:04.000
a security area where people can live free of fear of terrorism and of conflict.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:10.720
The Middle East for the last 20 years has been a sinkhole for arms, for death, for terrorism. It's

02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:17.840
been awful. It's been a big national security threat for America, a big place where our treasure

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:23.040
is gone. We've had a lot of our young, amazing American soldiers killed in action there,

02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:28.640
and the same thing for the Arab countries as well. So if we can create a security architecture

02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:33.440
for that region and then we can create economic integration between all the different countries,

02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:38.400
the amount of innovation happening in Israel is unbelievable. Think of it like Silicon Valley is

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:43.120
not connected to the rest of California. You have a very young population, a very digital savvy

02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:47.360
population. You have a lot of resources, and so if you can get that whole set,

02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:52.800
the potential for it is unbelievable. I do think that that's his ultimate vision is to become

02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:56.800
a really strong country economically and then to become a place where you could be funding

02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.280
advancements in science, advancements in humanity, advancements in artificial intelligence,

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.480
and think about ways to be a positive influence in the world.

02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:12.400
So a difficult question. One big source of tension between the United States and Saudi

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:19.680
is the case of Jamal Khashoggi. I was wondering if you can comment on what MBS has said about it to

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:25.120
you. You've spoken to him about it and what MBS has said about it publicly on 60 Minutes and After.

02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:29.360
Yeah. So what he said to me was no different than what he ultimately said on 60 Minutes,

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:36.800
which was as somebody helping lead this country, I bear responsibility and I'm going to make sure

02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:42.720
that those who are involved are brought to justice and I'm going to make sure that we put in place

02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:46.400
reforms to make sure things like this don't happen again. It was a horrible situation

02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:53.920
that occurred. What I saw from him after that was just a doubling and a tripling down on the positive

02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:59.200
things he was doing, figuring out ways to kind of continue to modernize his society, build opportunity

02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:04.560
in the kingdom and to continue to be a better ally to all the different countries that wanted to be

02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:13.040
aligned with them. One thing I learned from this case is how one particular situation, a tragedy,

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:19.600
can destroy so much progress and the possibility of progress and the possibility of connection

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:27.200
between the bridges that are built between different nations and how narratives around that

02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:33.920
can take off and take such a long time to repair. You've worked with this in the Middle East,

02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:42.080
with Israel and so on, how the history, the narratives, the stories, they kind of have

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:50.160
this momentum that's so hard to break, even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:59.280
come in. And it's just sad to see that, yes, this tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:05.920
you can't make progress. I don't know if you have kind of lessons from that, just how much

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:12.720
of a dramatic impact it had on creating tension between the United States and Saudi and in general

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:22.560
in the Middle East that somehow Saudi's not a friend, but is against the ideals and the values

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:28.320
of the United States. So it definitely created massive tension and it became a very high-profile

02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.840
action that actually overshadowed a lot of the good work that was being done in the region and

02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:39.840
a lot of the progress we were making. But when you think about this or you think about the other

02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.520
issues that we've gone through today, I think the general framework that I always try to approach

02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:51.200
things with is you can't change what happened yesterday. You can only learn from it and then

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:56.400
you can change how you deal with tomorrow. And when I think about the people in power,

02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:02.640
what do I hope that they're spending their time focused on? Two basic things. Number one is how

02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:09.360
do I create safety and security for my people and for the world? And then how do I give people

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:14.560
the opportunity to live a better life? And so when things like this happen, obviously,

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:21.440
there are certain reactions that are appropriate, but ultimately you have to think through how do

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:27.440
you not allow the paradigm that you're creating in the world to lead to worse outcomes than would

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:31.920
happen otherwise. And so when I would think about foreign policy in general, one of the differences

02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:37.120
between foreign policy and business is that in business, the conclusion of a problem set,

02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:43.120
you finish a deal, you either have a company or a property, or if you sell it, you have less to do

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:50.000
and more capital, hopefully if it's successful. In a political deal, it's always about paradigms.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
So the end of a problem set is always the beginning of a new paradigm. And you're always

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.240
thinking through how do you create an environment that leads to, hopefully, the best amount of

02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:06.400
positive outcomes that could occur versus creating a paradigm that will lead to negative outcomes.

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:13.440
So bad things happen a lot in the world, and you have to make sure that when those happen,

02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.000
people are held accountable for it. But you also don't want to make sure that in the process of

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.520
making sure that there's accountability for these actions, you don't set a lot of progress that the

02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:32.400
world is making back that will lead to worse off situation for many more people. If we can go back

02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:36.240
to the incredible work with Abraham Accords in Israel and the Middle East,

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:44.480
first a big question about peace. Why is it so difficult to achieve peace in this part of the

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.120
world between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and the other countries in the Middle East,

02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.160
or any sort of peace-like agreements? If I had to give you the most simple answer,

02:38:54.160 --> 02:39:00.080
I would say that it's structural. And if you go back to the incentive structure of different leaders,

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:06.640
this whole peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and again, I've gotten criticized

02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:10.880
for saying this, but it's what I believe, so I'm going to say it, is that the incentive structure

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:15.920
was all wrong. And when I went before the United Nations Security Council to discuss the peace plan

02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.160
that I proposed, which again, was more of an operational plan, and it was a pragmatic plan.

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:25.840
It was over 180 pages in detail. In politics, people don't like putting forward detail

02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:29.360
because it just gives a lot of places for you to get criticized on.

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:35.120
Nobody actually criticized the detail of my plan. They just criticized the fact that it was coming

02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:41.440
from us and didn't want to debate the merits of the operational pieces of it. So I created a slide

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:48.000
where I showed from the Oslo Accords till the day I was there, all the different peace discussions.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.240
I put a dove in the slide for those. And then I put a tank for every time there was a war,

02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.160
there was always skirmishes between Hamas and Hezbollah and the Palestinians.

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.280
And then I showed two lines and they both went from the bottom of the page all the way up like

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:08.080
this. One of the lines was Israeli settlements. So every time a negotiation failed, Israel was

02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:12.880
able to get more land. And then the other one was money to the Palestinians. And I said,

02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:18.320
every time a negotiation failed, the Palestinians would get more money. The problem with that money

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:22.880
though was that it wasn't going to the people. Some of it would make its way down, but most of

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.680
it was going to the politicians. You had leadership of the Palestinians who was basically, I think at

02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:32.080
that point it was in like the 16th year of a four-year term, so it wasn't democratically elected.

02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.440
And a lot of what I tried to show was that there was no rule of law, there was no judicial system,

02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:42.160
there were no property rights, and there was no opportunity or hope for the people to live a

02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:49.760
better life. And so all of the envoys to date were basically trained to go and do the same things.

02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:55.040
And again, I got massively criticized by all the previous envoys for not doing it the same way they

02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:00.960
did, but I thought the problem structurally just didn't make sense. And so I felt like the incentive

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:06.880
structure was all wrong and I took a different approach. And so what's the different approach?

02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:11.840
I started writing down a document. These are the 11 issues, but there's really only three

02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:17.360
issues that matter. I said, just tell me what you think the compromise is that you think the other

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:21.760
side could live with that you would accept. And it was very hard to get them talking about this.

02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:25.840
Oh, you have to go back to 1972, you have to go back to 1982, you have to go back to 2001,

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:29.120
you have to go to camp day. And I was just like, I don't need a headache and I don't need a history

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:34.400
lesson. I want a very simple thing. Here today in 2017, what's the outcome that you would accept?

02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:39.680
And I was dealing with their negotiators, their back channel secret negotiators,

02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:44.320
their double secret. And I was just like, this whole thing is like, it's a process created where

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:50.960
nobody wants to talk about the actual solution. So coming from the business world, I said, okay,

02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:56.080
let me just write down a proposed solution that I think is fair and let me have each side react.

02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.800
Don't tell me about theoretical things. Tell me I want to move the line from here to here. I want

02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:06.800
to change this word. So I tried to make it much more tactical. And what I realized was the

02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:12.640
Palestinians, they'd worked so hard to get the Arab world to stay with the line of the Arab

02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:17.680
peace initiative. And so I went back and I read the Arab peace initiative. It was 10 lines and

02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:21.920
it didn't have any detail. So it was a concept. And so they liked that concept because it allowed

02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:26.080
them to reject everything. They kept getting more money. I mean, Bibi Netanyahu, who runs

02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:30.880
one of the most incredible economies in the world, who runs an incredible superpower

02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.480
militarily for the size of their country, he would fly to Washington to meet us and he'd be

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:43.760
taking a commercial LL plane. A boss who runs a refugee organization, a refugee group that claims

02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.160
that they don't have a state that gets billions of dollars in aid every year from the global

02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:55.040
community would fly in a $60 million Boeing BBJ. So the whole thing was just very corrupt and off.

02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:01.440
And I do think that that's why I don't think people were incentivized to solve it, to be honest.

02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.720
What do you think an actual plan on that part, if you can, just before we talk about

02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:13.040
Abraham Accords, if there is a peace plan that works between Israel and Palestine,

02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:14.640
what is it? What do you think it looks like?

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:18.800
You have to separate it into two different issues. And I think that that's actually how

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:24.320
we came to the Abraham Accords is that, you know, I was, I tell the story in the book and it was one

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.760
of my like favorite experiences during my time in diplomacy, where I went to meet with Sultan

02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:35.280
Qaboos, who was the Sultan of Oman. And we fly out there because he'd had a secret meeting with

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:40.640
BB. And I thought maybe he was open to normalizing with Israel. So after he meets with BB, he calls

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:46.000
me and says, I want you to come see me. So I go over to see him. And again, I tell the story. It

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.760
was a crazy night and all these different areas. But when I was talking to him, he basically says

02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:57.600
to me, I feel badly for the Palestinian people that they carry with them the burden of the Muslim

02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:02.480
world. And that line just like stuck with me. And a couple of days later, I was thinking about it.

02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:09.200
And I said, wait a minute, who elected the Palestinian people to represent the Muslim world

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:14.800
on the Al-Aqsa Mosque? And so the reason why I felt like it had never been solved was it was a

02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:19.840
riddle, A, that I believed wasn't designed to not be solved, but B, you were conflating two separate

02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:24.320
issues. You had the issue between Israel and the Muslim world, which really was the issue of the

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:29.200
Al-Aqsa Mosque. And then you had just a territorial dispute, which throughout history,

02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:32.400
you have lots of territorial disputes and they're usually resolved in different ways.

02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.840
So if you go back to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, there's just a couple of components you need to

02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:43.120
solve. Number one is territorial contiguity. You need to figure out where do you draw the lines?

02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:49.200
And that's something that you can talk about what people were owed 70 years ago, but it's much more

02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:53.760
productive to say, this is what you can make work today. And that's kind of what we did.

02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:58.080
We literally spent months and months drawing a map and we put something out, probably change a couple

02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:02.880
lines here and there, but by and large, it was a very pragmatic solution that I think could work.

02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:06.080
And I think it could work for the safety and security of Israel, which was number one.

02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:14.080
So first issue is drawing a map. Second issue is security. Again, Israel, and again, this is one

02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.040
issue we were incredibly sympathetic with Israel, which is you can't expect a prime minister of

02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:23.600
Israel to make a deal where he's going to make his people less secure than before. So we worked

02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:27.760
very closely with them on a security apparatus. We laid something out that I think would keep the

02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:32.880
whole area safer and it would make sure Israel was safe and also keep the Palestinian issue safe.

02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:37.440
So you need security. Number three was the religious sites. And that was one that was actually

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.280
always made much more complicated by people, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, because you basically have

02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:47.040
Haram al-Sharif, which is a place where the mosque was built in the seventh or eighth century.

02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:52.800
But originally it was where the Holy of Holies were in the Beit Hamigdash for the Jewish people.

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:57.200
And then compounding by the fact that you have all of the Christian holy sites in Jerusalem,

02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:02.480
it's a city that should be bringing everyone together, but in fact has become a place where

02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:08.640
you have wars and hatred and a lot of different conflicts that have risen because of it.

02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:13.040
But what I said was instead of fighting over concepts of sovereignty, which is interesting

02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:17.280
how I got to the notion that this wasn't really the big issue, I basically said just operationally,

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:20.960
why don't we just make it simple? Let everyone come and be able to worship as long as they're

02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:28.240
being able to worship peacefully. So that's really the contours of it. And what the Palestinians have

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.920
done is they've kind of deflected from a lot of their own shortcomings. And a lot of the Arab

02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.880
leaders did that as well, kind of in the pre-Abraham Accord days, by kind of allowing this issue to be

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:42.080
so prevalent. So one thing I'll say on the Palestinians is that what we tried to do

02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:49.360
by laying out a plan was we said, okay, what are the reasons why the Palestinian people

02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.360
are not having the lives that they deserve? And I'll give you a couple of things. One is

02:46:54.160 --> 02:47:03.040
I studied the economies of Jordan, West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Morocco. This was numbers from 2019,

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:08.960
but what was interesting was the GDP per capita of somebody living in the West Bank was actually

02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:14.560
the same as Jordan, and it was actually more than somebody living in Egypt. And the debt of GDP

02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:20.480
that the Palestinians had was like 30, 40 percent compared to Egypt, which was at like 130 percent,

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:26.400
and Jordan, which was at 110 percent, and Lebanon was at 200 percent. And so you're in a situation

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:32.080
where a lot of this stuff didn't make sense, but if you draw lines, create institutions where

02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:35.760
Palestinian people can now feel like they have property rights and have ownership over their

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:41.600
place and let the money flow past the leadership ranks to the people, let them have jobs, let them

02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:47.600
have opportunity, and then let all Muslims from throughout the world have access to the mosque

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:51.920
and Israel making sure that they can control the security, which I think the Jordanians and a lot

02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.400
of others want Israel to have strong security control there to prevent the radicalists and

02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:02.400
the extremists from coming. You could have peace there very easily. So there's a lot of things to

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:09.840
say here. One is just to emphasize Al Aqsa Mosque. So this is a holy place, and this is something in

02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:18.000
our conversations and in my own travels I've seen the importance of sort of frictionless access

02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:23.120
to those sites from the entirety of the Muslim world, and that's what Abraham, of course,

02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:30.080
took big leaps on. Okay, so we'll talk about that a little bit more, but that's kind of a religious

02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:36.160
component. That's a dignity in the religious practice and faith component. But then the other

02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:44.560
thing you mentioned so simply, which is you have money flow past the leadership ranks.

02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:54.000
How do you have money flow past the leadership ranks in Palestine? So make sure that the money

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:00.800
that's invested in Palestine, the West Bank, gets to the people. So to date, all of the aid that's

02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.720
been given to the Palestinians has been an entitlement. It's not conditions-based. It's

02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:09.120
always just we give the money and there's no expectations. It's very simple. You make the aid

02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:13.440
conditions-based. You fight for transparency. You do it through institutions other than the PA,

02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:18.480
or you put reformers into the PA that will allow it to go down that way.

02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:21.040
PA being the Palestinian Authority, which is the leadership.

02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:25.840
It's not hard to do. It just takes people who actually want to do it. But I think the mindset

02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:30.240
of the international community has not been, let's solve this problem. It's like, let's just

02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:34.000
throw a little bit of money. The money's novocaine. Let's put a little novocaine on the problem,

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.480
and let's not have to deal with it. But nobody's ever said, oh, let's do an accounting of the $20

02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:42.640
billion we've given them and see how many jobs it's done and where it's gone. That just hasn't

02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:48.160
happened. Again, it's an incredibly corrupt organization. You think about the post-World War

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:52.160
II dynamic. You had a lot of refugees. My grandparents were refugees post-World War II.

02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:57.760
Every other refugee class has been resettled, and you only have one permanent refugee organization

02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:02.560
ever created. Why was this done? It was done to perpetuate the conflict so that a lot of Arab

02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:05.680
leaders could basically deflect from a lot of their shortcomings at home.

02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:11.120
I think for Israel, they view all these things as existential. They value their safety. They've

02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:17.520
been under attack for a long time. I do think having a deal where we can say, how do the Jews

02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:21.520
and the Muslims, Christians come together? I think King Abdullah from Jordan's been an incredible

02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.800
custodian for the mosque. I think everyone in my travels recognized that he's the right guy for

02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:31.520
that, that the King of Jordan should be the custodian of the mosque. We should have some

02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:35.680
framework to make sure everyone has access. The more countries that have diplomatic relations

02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:40.880
with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit. By the way,

02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:45.440
the more you have these normalizations, think about what that will do to the economy of the

02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.240
West Bank, where they'll have great hotels, hospitality, tremendous tourism industry because

02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:55.440
of all the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy sites that they have there. There's a lot of

02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:02.560
potential there. We just have to get unstuck. I believe that it's so possible if the leaders

02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:08.560
want to make tomorrow better, that they can. Unfortunately, the people who suffer the most

02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:15.680
are just the Palestinian people. I think that in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas and in the

02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:24.080
West Bank. They're just held back because their leadership is afraid or too self-interested

02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:31.600
to give them the opportunity to change their paradigm and pursue the potential of what they

02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:37.760
have. By the way, it's an incredibly well-educated population. It's an incredibly capable population.

02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:42.720
They're right next to Israel where the economy, they need everything. The potential should be

02:51:42.720 --> 02:51:48.320
incredible if you can just move some of these pieces. Again, there's still a lot of emotion

02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:52.400
and hatred you have to work through as well, but I do believe that you're not going to solve that

02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:57.360
by litigating the past. You're only going to solve that by creating an exciting paradigm for

02:51:57.360 --> 02:52:03.840
the future and getting everyone to buy in and then move towards that. Maybe increase the chance of

02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:08.800
being able to establish an economy where the entrepreneurs can flourish in the West Bank and

02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:16.320
so on in Palestine once the relationship across the Arab world is normalized.

02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:22.880
One thing on that which is very interesting is when I got into my job in the Middle East,

02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:28.400
all the conventional thinkers said to me, the separation in the Muslim world is between the

02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:34.560
Sunnis and the Shias. That's really the big divide. As I was traveling, I didn't think there was any

02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:40.960
divide in that regard. The divide that I saw was between leaders who wanted to give a better

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:45.520
opportunity for their people and create economic reforms and opportunity, and leaders who wanted

02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:51.680
to use religion or fear to keep their stronghold on power. If you think about who's not creating

02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:56.240
the opportunity for their people, it's the Palestinian leadership and the Iranian leadership.

02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:00.480
All the other Arab countries were focused on how do we give opportunity for our people

02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:08.080
to live a better life. There is a big foundation on which that framework can succeed, which I think

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:17.120
is the, in general, the idea of Arab-Israeli normalization. That's where Abraham Accords

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:24.720
come in. Can you tell the story of that? Sure. It's an amazing thing. I sit here today,

02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:30.080
somebody not in government, and every day I see another flight that goes between,

02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:36.560
or I see an Israeli student studying at a university in Dubai or a new synagogue opening up

02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:44.640
in Abu Dhabi, or Bahrain. It gives me such tremendous pride to see all of the progress

02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:51.280
that's been made. How it occurred, part of why I wrote the book was to put this down for history's

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:56.400
sake, to go through all the different intentional, unintentional, circumstantial things that occurred.

02:53:58.240 --> 02:54:01.440
It's funny, we left government, there's a lot of people saying, well, this is why I said,

02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:06.080
I was kind of at the middle of it, and I couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened,

02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:13.680
because it was an evolution of a lot of things. And I joke that we made peace on Plan C,

02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:18.080
but only because we went through the alphabet three times, failing at every letter,

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:21.200
and by the time we didn't give up, we kept going and we got it done.

02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:26.800
And maybe this is a good place to also step back and say, what is Arab-Israeli normalization?

02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:33.600
What is the state of things for people who may not be aware before the progress you made?

02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:38.240
That's probably the best place to start. So what we did is we made a peace deal between

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:43.360
Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then Israel and Bahrain. Then we did a deal with

02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:49.200
Israel and Sudan, then Israel and Kosovo, Israel and Morocco, were basically countries that didn't

02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:54.240
recognize each other before, ended up recognizing each other. All of these were Muslim majority

02:54:54.240 --> 02:55:00.160
countries, and getting them to integrate with Israel was a very big thing. The traditional

02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:05.680
thinking had always been that Arab-Muslim countries would not make peace with Israel

02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:12.240
until the Israeli-Palestinian issue was solved. What we were able to do was separate the issues

02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:18.560
and then make these connections, which are leading to amazing interaction between Jews

02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:23.440
and Muslims. So when I think about, obviously you have national security, you have emotional

02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:28.160
benefits from these things, but the single biggest benefit that I've seen

02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:38.480
from the accords is that if you were an Arab or a Muslim and you were willing to say positive

02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:43.680
things about Israel or the Jews before this came out, you had been viciously attacked by

02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:49.600
the media or the hordes of influencers or the extremists in these different countries.

02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:54.480
What this did was it brought out into the public the fact that Jews and Muslims can be together

02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:00.320
and they can be respectful, they can have meals together, and that the cultures can

02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:10.000
live together in peace. So just to linger on this, it's like once subtle and in another sense

02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:16.160
transformative. So normalization means you're allowed to travel from one place to the other.

02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:23.040
That has a kind of ripple effect of that you can now start talking in a little bit more

02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:30.240
accepting way. You can start integrating, traveling, communicating, doing business with,

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:37.840
socializing. So the cultures mix, conversations mix, all of this. And this kind of has a ripple

02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:45.680
effect on the basic connection between these previously disparate worlds. I don't know if

02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:54.400
there's a nice way to kind of make clear why these agreements have such a transformative effect,

02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:59.920
especially in the long term. I would say the simplest form is it's just a mindset.

02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:06.560
And it's almost like you're taught all your life we're enemies or we can't be friends with that

02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:12.400
tribe on the other side of the fence. And then like one day the leaders get up and say, no,

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:17.200
it's okay now. And there was never an issue between the people. The people were just taught

02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:21.040
different things and they were separated from each other. But again, one of the things that

02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:26.000
I respect about the work you do is you believe in the power of conversation and the power of

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:33.520
human interaction. And these issues and gaps between us feel so big when we think about them,

02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:38.080
when we're told about them, when we read about them. But when we go and sit with each other,

02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:42.400
all of a sudden we realize maybe we have a lot more in common than we have that divides us.

02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:47.200
For me, what I've seen about it that's made the biggest difference is I've seen

02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:54.160
people who wouldn't have the ability to be together, be together. And that's now forming

02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:00.000
a nucleus of togetherness, which is a restoration. So you think about the modern Middle East from

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:08.800
post Holocaust to now. Again, in 1948, after that war of independence, you had Jews living in

02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:17.440
Baghdad and Cairo. Then they became so anti-Jewish that they then expelled all of the Jews from

02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:22.160
all these capitals of the city. So you think about the Jewish history in Baghdad. I mean,

02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:27.280
I think the Talmud was written in Baghdad. It was a place in Babylon where the Jewish people

02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:33.680
thrived. I think in 570 BCE, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, he took about 10,000 Jews

02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:38.400
back with him to Babylon because he thought it'd be good for his economy. And during that place,

02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:43.600
the Jews actually flourished and had a good life there. So for a thousand years before

02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:49.600
the Second World War, the Jews and the Muslims lived very peacefully together. So people say

02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:53.440
that what we're doing now is an aberration. I actually think it's not an aberration. I

02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:57.680
think it's actually a return to the time where people can live together culturally.

02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.800
So this is the beginning of the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And it's the beginning

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:08.240
of togetherness, which again, you think about how much war, how much provocation, how much terrorism

02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:14.080
has been made in the name of religious conflict. This is, I think, the start of the process of

02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:20.000
religious respect and understanding. We've talked about you being attacked in the press

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:24.880
for the Russian collusion and other topics. One of the most recent set of attacks comes on

02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:31.680
the topic of Saudi Public Investment Fund giving $2 billion to your investment firm

02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:39.200
after you left government. So that includes a 1.25% asset management fee of $25 million a year.

02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:45.440
Can you respond to these recent set of attacks? Sure. So I left government, obviously worked for

02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:51.520
years. It was a very action-packed time. That's why I wrote the book. I wanted to put down all

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:57.840
those experiences. I started thinking, what do I want to do next? So my previous career,

02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:02.400
I'd been in real estate. I'd worked with my brother on some technology businesses that I'd

03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:09.680
started. And then I got into government. So I kind of had a career shift. In my previous career,

03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:14.960
obviously, it was very successful. The New York Times, they violated and they published my

03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:21.600
financial statements. They showed I was making about $50 million a year in the private sector

03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:26.720
before I went into government. I went into government and I volunteered. I didn't take a

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:30.960
salary. I paid for my own health insurance for four years, my wife and I. And then we went and

03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:36.160
I was thinking, should I go back to my old company or should I start something new? And my thinking

03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:42.480
was is that through my time in government, I'd met so many people. I'd learned so much about the

03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:48.640
world. I had a big understanding now for how the macroeconomic picture worked. And I did feel like

03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:52.960
there was a lot more that I could do than just going back to real estate. In the meantime,

03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:57.680
I was getting a lot of calls from different CEOs and companies saying, can you help me with this

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:03.360
company? Can you help me with that company? Your knowledge could be helpful to help this company

03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:07.680
navigate this challenge or to expand internationally. And so I said, you know what? Maybe I should

03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.480
create a business to do an investment firm where I can do something different, where I'm putting

03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:18.880
together geopolitical expertise and traditional private equity and growth investing and figure

03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:23.120
out how to do that, where I can do something differentiated, where I can invest in growing

03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:28.560
things and help with my navigation skills and relationships. So that was kind of the thesis of

03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:34.080
what I thought could make sense as kind of a next step. I called different friends. They were

03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:39.360
very excited to back the effort. Obviously, this was coming off the success that I just had in the

03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:45.520
Middle East where I did six peace deals there. And one of the notions I wanted to be able to do

03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:50.720
with the firm was to be able to take money from the Gulf and then to be able to invest it in Israel

03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:55.040
to continue to build the economic links between the countries. Again, if countries have more

03:01:55.040 --> 03:02:01.200
economic ties, I think war and fighting is less likely. And then in addition to that,

03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.440
I wanted to figure out how do you bring the entrepreneurs together from both of those

03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:10.480
countries? So that was really the mission of what I set out to do. So far, I've been enjoying it.

03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:14.080
It's been a lot of fun. I've been learning a ton. I think we're doing very well with it.

03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:20.240
In terms of the criticisms, I think that I've been criticized in every step of everything I've

03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:25.760
always done in my life. And so what I would say is this business is actually an objective

03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:30.480
metric business. It's about returns. So in three, four years from now, five years from now,

03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:34.880
see how I do. Hopefully, I'll do very well and judge me based on that. In terms of

03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:42.960
any of the nefarious things, I haven't been accused of violating any laws and I haven't

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:47.440
violated any of the ethics rules either. When I was in government, I every year submitted all my

03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:52.880
financials to the Office of Government Ethics. They certified it every year and I followed every

03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:58.960
rule and every law possible. So to my critics, I'll say, criticize me before, you'll criticize

03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:04.320
me now. I'm going to keep doing me and I'm going to keep pursuing things that I think are worthwhile.

03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:07.360
And I'm very excited about this chapter of my career.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.880
Maybe this is a good place to ask. In working closely with Donald Trump,

03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:17.200
what in your sense, looking into the mind of the man,

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.200
what's the biggest strength of Donald Trump as a leader?

03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:30.160
I would say his unpredictability. I think that as a leader, he consumes a ton of information.

03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:35.920
He doesn't like to be managed or have his information filtered, so he'll speak to a

03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:41.680
lot of people to draw his information himself. He's very pragmatic. I don't see him as terribly

03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:47.760
ideological. I see him as somebody who's about results. I think he wants to deliver results.

03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.160
And I think ultimately, I mean, he's an incredible fighter. He's a big counter puncher,

03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:58.880
but he also wants to get along with people. And that's probably the biggest surprise that

03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:05.760
people found with him. I mean, you look at even situations like, I would always tell people,

03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:10.240
if you disagree with him, don't go on television and criticize him. Just pick up the phone and call

03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:15.360
him and go see him and he'll talk to you about it. He may not agree with you, but again, that's what

03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:21.920
Kim Kardashian did when she had a case of clemency with a woman, Alice Johnson, that she felt strongly

03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:25.280
about. We went through the case. I wouldn't have had her call if I didn't think it was a legitimate

03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:29.600
case, so we spent about eight months quietly working through the case, working through the

03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:36.080
details to make sure that it really was a worthy case. I brought it to President Trump, said she'd

03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:41.120
like to come meet with you to talk about this case. And he said, have her come in. So she came

03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:46.400
in. We went through the case and President Trump ultimately granted the clemency to Alice Johnson,

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:53.120
who was a woman who was accused of being part of a drug ring. She had basically a life sentence

03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:57.440
for doing it. She'd served 22 years in prison while in prison. I mean, she basically was a

03:04:57.440 --> 03:05:03.520
grandmother and she was putting on the prison plays. She was mentoring young women in prison,

03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:09.040
somebody who, again, there's always a risk, but by and large had a very, very, very low risk of

03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:14.000
committing a crime in the future. And then it goes back to the notion of, are we going to

03:05:14.640 --> 03:05:18.480
judge people by the worst decision they make in their life? And so President Trump

03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:23.120
was willing to grant the clemency and it went. And I think that it just goes to the notion of like,

03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:28.560
maybe this goes back to his unpredictability in a positive way, which is if you go sit with him

03:05:28.560 --> 03:05:32.560
and you make your case, he'll hear you, he'll listen to you, and he's not afraid to act,

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:37.680
and he's not afraid to be controversial, which I think is a good thing. So from a foreign policy

03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:42.720
point of view in particular, his unpredictability just meant that everyone was always on their back

03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:48.160
foot. People were afraid to kind of cross America. And what I would tell people who don't like Trump

03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:52.640
is I would say, think about how crazy he's making you and his enemies. He did that to the enemies

03:05:52.640 --> 03:05:58.240
of America. And yeah, so he was a very, very strong president and I think did a great job.

03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:02.720
So in some of these agreements that we've been talking about and speaking with leaders,

03:06:02.720 --> 03:06:04.800
how do you think the unpredictability helps?

03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:11.120
So in all the agreements that I was negotiating, I wasn't doing it as a principle. I was doing it

03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:17.040
on behalf of President Trump. And people knew that I had access to President Trump and they knew that,

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:21.120
you know, I could say, you may say this that we don't like, but I'm going to have to take it

03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:25.680
back to him and then we'll see what he does. And one of the biggest instances was on the USMCA

03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:33.920
trade deal where that deal happened because Mexico was legitimately concerned and smartly so

03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:38.400
that President Trump was going to impose tariffs on the car industry, which would have been

03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:43.120
decimating to their economy. And by the way, he was ready to do it. We were holding it back from

03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:47.120
doing it with every ounce of strength that we could. So it wasn't a bluff. I mean, that one

03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:53.440
was actually real, but they were smart to read that it was real. And ultimately we created a great

03:06:53.440 --> 03:06:59.840
win-win deal. I'll tell you a funny story just popped into my mind from the tariffs is we did

03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:06.000
also, we used a 232 national security exemption to protect our steel industry and we put tariffs

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:10.800
on steel and aluminum. And again, I thought about this because we also negotiated them with Canada

03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:16.400
and there was a very funny phone call where Trudeau was calling Trump. And again, they got along

03:07:16.400 --> 03:07:22.800
decently well. And Trudeau was calling saying, you can't put national security tariffs on us in

03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:28.800
Canada. We're your NATO ally. We fought wars with you. We do military together. And Trump says to

03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:33.200
him, didn't you burn the White House down in 1812? And Trudeau says, that was the French. He says,

03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:38.880
no, it was the Canadians. And so it was just, like I said, he's always keeping everyone on their

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:49.520
toes. But he took very calculated risks. And like I said, everyone was outraged all the time with

03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:54.080
everything. But if you look at his body of work, people said if he was elected, he would start World

03:07:54.080 --> 03:08:00.000
War III. Meanwhile, we inherited a world filled with wars. No new wars, right? Yeah. Three years,

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:05.280
he made peace deals. No new wars. He was tough. He was strong. People respected him. He built

03:08:05.280 --> 03:08:11.200
relationships and got trade deals done, got peace deals done. The economy was rocking.

03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:15.600
His body of work, I think, was pretty strong as president. Like you said, no new wars. This

03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:20.560
makes me think, if Donald Trump won the presidency, what the current situation in

03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:24.960
Ukraine would look like. But let me just ask you, zoom out and ask you broadly,

03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:31.600
do you think the war in Ukraine could have been avoided? And what do you think it takes to bring

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:37.760
it to an end? I think 100% it would have been avoided, not 99%. President Trump for

03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:44.320
four years had no problems with Russia. We were arming Ukraine, but we were working with Russia.

03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:49.760
And again, the first two years, we had a little bit of issue working with Russia because they were

03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:55.520
accused of colluding with us and so we had to go through that investigation. But in the second two

03:08:55.520 --> 03:09:00.720
years, we were trying to focus Russia on what are the areas where we can collaborate together.

03:09:00.720 --> 03:09:06.800
I think Russia, we thought it was in their strategic advantage to play U.S. and China

03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:10.720
against each other because of the way that everything was done before. They were stuck

03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:15.920
with China, but not getting a lot for it. Under Bush, they took Georgia. Under Obama,

03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:22.160
they took Crimea. Under Trump, there was no problems. And then under Biden, unfortunately,

03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:27.760
I think they misplayed a couple of things, which I think provoked Russia to go forward.

03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:32.400
Still no excuse to do what they did. I think that the invasion was a terrible thing and

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:39.040
should not have occurred. But with that being said, I think 100%, if Trump was president,

03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:43.680
there would not be a war in Ukraine today. Coming to the table and negotiating a peace,

03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:50.480
whether it's Donald Trump, whether it's Biden, whether it's anybody, what do you think it takes?

03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:57.280
Do you think it's possible? And if you're in a room, if Jared Kushner is in the room,

03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:04.400
Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, what does it take to have a productive conversation? And

03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:08.320
what does it take for that conversation to fail? What are the trajectories

03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:13.600
that lead to success and failure? I think we go back to negotiations. Number one is trust.

03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:21.040
Both leaders have to have the ability to communicate what an off-ramp is without

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.680
fearing it's going to leak to the public. So if you go to the posture of Zelensky right now,

03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:30.400
and by the way, President Zelensky, I have a lot of respect for the courage he showed,

03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:35.440
especially initially. You saw what Ghani did in Afghanistan. They were getting attacked by

03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:40.320
the Taliban. He took the cash and got the hell out of there. Staying in Kiev when he did,

03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:44.480
how he did, it was one of the most brave things we've seen in a long time. And he has a ton of

03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:50.080
my respect and admiration for doing that. But now he's promising his people, we're going to win the

03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:58.320
war. And the military action has not necessarily coincided with that sentiment. And so there has

03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:04.080
to be some form of off-ramp, but he can't say that publicly. So for him to be able to work

03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:09.280
privately with somebody who can help create a new paradigm where both leaders can say,

03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:12.960
we're going to stop the bloodshed, we're going to stop the risk of nuclear war for the world,

03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:19.200
we're going to stop what's happening, that's really what it will take. How that occurs, again,

03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:24.880
it's not something I'm involved in now, so I don't know who the right broker is or how to put that

03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:30.400
together. But essentially they need somebody in between them who can figure out how do you create

03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:35.600
a landing zone that works because neither party is going to jump until the pool is filled with

03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:42.240
water. And you have to outline what the go-forward looks like because you can't just stop it for

03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:48.320
them to get worse for both parties. You have to move it forward into what happens next that

03:11:48.320 --> 03:11:55.040
hopefully can start to turn the tide to benefit both sides where they can focus on the future

03:11:55.040 --> 03:12:00.880
instead of being stuck into the old paradigm of who started what, who's to blame for what,

03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:06.800
who did what to who. It's just a lot of tough stuff now that's occurred that's going to be

03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:12.320
hard to walk back and it's a big task to get it done. But for the sake of the world, it'd be

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:16.240
amazing if we were able to reach a conclusion to that conflict.

03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:22.880
Just going back to your earlier mention of North Korea, what do you think it takes to

03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:26.720
bring Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky to the table together?

03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:27.220
Leadership.

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:33.040
So you're saying it has to be a U.S. president?

03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:39.520
It has to be somebody who's willing to put themselves on the line to go and do it. And

03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:43.200
again, if you're the U.S. president and you're the most powerful nation in the world,

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:48.720
you should be trying. But I do think, again, the posture that the U.S. has taken has probably

03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:54.720
been in a place where it would be very hard for them to get the trust of Russia based on the way

03:12:54.720 --> 03:12:59.760
that they've played their moves to date. I always thought from the beginning that Putin

03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:05.280
would try to bring in President Xi in China to resolve it, to basically give a big screw you

03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:12.880
to America to say China's now the one in charge of this. But that hasn't seemed to manifest itself

03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:16.960
to date either. But it takes leadership. The leaders have to get it and say,

03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:20.640
let's get everyone together and let's try to get this done. Because every day it goes wrong,

03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:28.240
A, more people are dying, and B, we do risk nuclear war for the world, which is not a good situation.

03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:35.280
Let me ask, since you helped set up phone calls between Donald Trump, Putin, and King of Saudi

03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:40.880
Arabia, if I were to interview Putin, what advice would you give on how to

03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:45.280
get a deep understanding of the human being?

03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:52.240
Yeah, so I didn't deal with Russia a ton. But in my interaction with Putin and with Russia,

03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:59.600
I would point out a couple of things. Number one is when America was hit with COVID and New York

03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:03.600
was looking like we were going to run out of ventilators and masks, Russia was the second

03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:08.480
country that sent us a plain load of supplies. And they didn't send that because they hate America.

03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:13.200
They sent that because we were starting to make progress together as countries. And they thought

03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:18.080
that they wanted to show goodwill to figure out how can we start working together. And again,

03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:23.280
people may attack me for saying that that sounds naive. Again, the past 15 years may show that

03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:27.520
that's not the case. But I don't believe that countries have permanent enemies. I don't believe

03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:32.320
countries have permanent allies. Again, you think about the U.S. and Russia in World War II, we

03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:38.400
worked together to defeat the Nazis. And now we're great allies with Germany, who basically was

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:42.160
our great enemy in World War II. We're great allies with Japan, who was our great enemy in

03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:48.400
World War II. So it goes back to the notion we discussed earlier of you shouldn't condemn

03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:54.960
tomorrow to be like yesterday if you're unhappy with yesterday. So number one is I would definitely

03:14:54.960 --> 03:14:59.280
ask him about that. The phone call that you mentioned was after we did a pretty intense

03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:05.680
negotiation to create the largest oil cut in the history of oil production. So during COVID,

03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:11.360
demand just shut off like crazy. And it was stopping very quickly. Saudi and Russia at that

03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:16.240
time were having a conflict. They created this thing called OPEC plus, which goes back again,

03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:20.640
history between the two countries where they had conflicts. And then all of a sudden they

03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:25.440
were working together to try to stabilize the oil markets, but they couldn't agree on the cuts. So

03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:31.520
Saudi actually increased production. So you had two things hitting at once where Saudi and Russia

03:15:31.520 --> 03:15:35.680
were both increasing production and demand was dropping. So you were headed for a real crisis.

03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:40.160
And I was starting to get calls from a lot of the oil industry executives here in America saying,

03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:43.680
you don't understand. We can't just flip a switch and turn off our oil wells. We're running out of

03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:50.000
storage here. And I said, look, President Trump likes low oil prices. So he's not upset about

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:54.240
what's happening. You have to call him. And if he gives me permission or the instruction,

03:15:54.240 --> 03:16:00.400
then I can try to intervene. But right now he's not inclined to intervene. After a little bit,

03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:05.120
he said, you know what? It's time. Get involved. Go do it. It was right over Passover. This was

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:10.240
during COVID. I spent three days nonstop on the phone with Kirill Dmitriev from Russia and with

03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:14.160
MBS directly. And I was dealing with Dan Burlett, who was our energy minister,

03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:20.000
going back and forth. And it was crazy. It was just one of the craziest negotiations.

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:25.360
We ended up agreeing on the largest oil cut in the history of the world. But the story you

03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:31.200
went to before, which was pretty funny, was finally make the deal. And we set up a call

03:16:31.200 --> 03:16:36.080
between King Salman, Vladimir Putin, and President Trump to announce the deal.

03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:41.280
And I'm like, oh, this is great. So President Trump gets on and says, congratulations, we have

03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:46.720
a deal. And then King Salman says, we don't have a deal. Mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts. And

03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:51.360
he's saying, what do you mean? And so they were part of the OPEC+. And so I get a note saying,

03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:55.520
you got to go call Mexico. So I'm calling Mexico. They're saying, we're not doing any cuts. So why?

03:16:55.520 --> 03:16:59.600
I said, we're hedged to $55. He said, why do you tell us that in the beginning? So I'm telling the

03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:04.480
Saudis. So we were working through this whole thing. So meanwhile, we were trying to find the

03:17:04.480 --> 03:17:09.680
compromise with Mexico. I set up a call with Trump and Putin so they can kind of talk this through.

03:17:10.480 --> 03:17:15.520
And he was always trying to play the game of how do we get Russia away from China? He always thought

03:17:15.520 --> 03:17:22.160
that that was not the right strategic framework for US interests. And again, we had no problems

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:29.360
with them during that time. What I would say is that for Zelensky and Putin, any conversation

03:17:29.360 --> 03:17:34.880
with both of them is about understanding their perspective. I think with Putin, he's a student

03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:40.080
of history from the things that I saw with him. If you look at Russia over the last 500 years,

03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:45.600
I think they were attacked by the Polish in early 1600. I think they were attacked by

03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:52.000
the Swedes in the 1700s. I think they were attacked by Napoleon in the 1800s. And then in

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:59.840
the 1900s, they were attacked by Germany twice. And so from his perspective, in the early days of

03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:06.320
Russia, they were attacked by the Mongols. They were very vulnerable. And a lot of the geography

03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:11.120
of Russia today is really designed for defensive purposes, that they have natural barriers that

03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:15.120
makes them easier to defend. And Russia is a massive landmass. It's twice the size of America.

03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:21.440
They have 11 time zones in the country. And so I do think that for Vladimir Putin,

03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:27.840
his biggest concern is how do we create a security paradigm in the west of his country

03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:32.560
that won't be a creep. And I think that there's two different parts of the mindset. The people

03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:37.360
who are most cynical of Putin will say, well, he's just trying to recreate the USSR. He's being

03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:42.480
expansionist. And the people who want to be sympathetic to him will say, well, if you think

03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:47.840
about it, the Russian perception of the NATO arrangement was that they wouldn't be expanding

03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:52.640
westward over the last years. They've included all these countries that they said they promised

03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:59.360
they wouldn't include, who knows what the promises were or weren't. But what I do know from his

03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:05.200
perspective is allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a red line. And that's why we never offered

03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:08.880
it. We never provoked it. We never brought it up. We said, we're going to arm them. And we basically

03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:12.720
said, just calm down. We don't want any conflicts there. We have bigger issues and bigger opportunities

03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:17.440
to work from. So I do think you have to think through what's a paradigm that he can accept.

03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:25.760
And I do think that he'll give the justification for why he's done what he's done. And then I think

03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:32.080
the framework for a solution is about how do we move both parties forward? Tough job. I hope you

03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:37.840
get the opportunity to do it because I think it's a conversation that will only help the world

03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:42.560
hopefully find a pathway forward. And as you mentioned, because you mentioned geography,

03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:47.920
one of the many books you've recommended to me that gives a very interesting perspective

03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:54.800
on history is called Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall. And it has a very interesting

03:19:54.800 --> 03:20:03.120
perspective on the geopolitical conflicts and perspective of Russia from a geography perspective.

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:09.840
And also for China in the second chapter. And there's a lot of understanding of why

03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:16.160
the expansion of NATO is such a concern for Russia. Because geography still, even in the 21st century,

03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:21.280
less and less so because of technology and so on, but it still plays a major role

03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:27.600
in conflicts between nations, rivers, mountains. And understanding the DNA of countries. It was

03:20:27.600 --> 03:20:32.240
one of the most phenomenal books. And I just found it on Amazon randomly, but I loved every

03:20:32.240 --> 03:20:35.760
minute of it. The chapter on America is also incredible. Going through the evolution of

03:20:36.400 --> 03:20:40.720
you know, how we became the country we are, the different acquisitions, the different changes,

03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:45.920
why we have all these geographic advantages. And it's an unbelievable book for anyone who's

03:20:45.920 --> 03:20:53.120
interested in geopolitics. So I have to ask on several aspects of China. First on the president,

03:20:54.400 --> 03:21:00.080
the meeting, you hope set up a first call and first meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:03.840
Can you tell the story of that? Because that's also interesting. Again, that first phone call,

03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:08.720
the reaching out, the forming the human connection, which ultimately leads to the

03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:13.760
connection between nations and the possibility of collaboration. So during the transition,

03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:20.400
President Trump took a call from the head of Taiwan, and that sent the Chinese into a real

03:21:20.400 --> 03:21:26.160
tailspin. And he didn't do it, I think, to be provocative to them as much as just as a businessman,

03:21:26.160 --> 03:21:29.600
he felt the answer your call, somebody wants to speak to you, you speak to him like you,

03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:33.760
you want to have conversations, hear their point of view. And but it was taken as a very big

03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:40.400
insult and it was against tradition and norm. And so that was something that set us off in a

03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:46.880
wrong direction. My view at the time was that, you know, we are kind of entering a G2 world,

03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:53.280
whether people want to admit it or not. And that a lot of these countries in what I call the middle

03:21:53.280 --> 03:21:56.880
market countries were basically playing this when China was being aggressive with their one belt,

03:21:56.880 --> 03:22:02.000
one road, they were basically playing US and China against each other. And I thought that by

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:07.680
the two leaders coming together, there were some things they wouldn't agree on. But there's a lot

03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:14.480
that they probably could agree on, which could lead to resolutions to a lot of issues in the

03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:21.200
world. That was like my most optimistic view. My most more pragmatic view was that President Trump

03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:26.000
had very big issues on trade that he wanted to get to with China. You know, he felt like China,

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:30.720
their trade practices were unfair, they weren't following all the global rules of trade. He was

03:22:30.720 --> 03:22:34.240
a little bit nervous that they would be provocative with Taiwan. And I felt like the two of them

03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:40.960
getting together would be the best way to try and resolve that. So the Chinese are very proud and a

03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:47.680
lot of it is about face. And so we in order to negotiate for that first call, we basically agree

03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:51.200
on what would happen in the call. So not let's just have a call say hi, nice to meet you is a

03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:55.680
question of President Trump basically agreed that he would acknowledge the one China policy,

03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:59.520
which he didn't see as a big concession because you could always unacknowledge it the next day.

03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:03.840
So yeah, I'll acknowledge it. And then we'll go and exchange President Xi was going to come

03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:08.320
over to the US for a visit so they could sit together. And they want to do it outside the

03:23:08.320 --> 03:23:12.480
White House. And so we agreed on Mar-a-Lago, which I also thought was good because President Trump

03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:17.040
always felt much more comfortable when he was hosting at his properties and he just felt at

03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:21.760
home. And so he liked having people as his guests and he loved he loved it. He always felt really

03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:27.600
relaxed and it was great. So that was really what we did. Then the Chinese come over very much

03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:32.320
anticipated visit. And it was incredible. So they were supposed to sit together for 15 minutes.

03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:37.280
And they said about an hour and a half together. And during that meeting, President Trump,

03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:40.720
they said, look, let's just set some ground rules to this relationship. Like, let's just not talk

03:23:40.720 --> 03:23:44.000
about Taiwan. Like, you know, just don't do anything I don't want on the table. If it does,

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:47.840
I'm gonna have to do harsh things. I still want this to be a problem for four years. We got bigger

03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:52.880
issues. They basically just again, you notice four years of Trump administration, no Taiwan

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:57.280
talk whatsoever. It was a non-issue. Started talking about the trade issues. They spent a

03:23:57.280 --> 03:24:02.800
lot of time on North Korea. President Trump was trying to get the perspective from President Xi

03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:07.040
about North Korea because that was, again, considered from Obama, the biggest national

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:13.040
security issue that we faced at the time. And they just had a good feeling for each other.

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:19.680
It also helped that, you know, my wife and I, we actually had a Chinese nanny and teacher in our

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:26.320
house and our kids learned fluent Mandarin. And our daughter actually opened when President Xi

03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:33.760
and President Trump were together with Melania and with Madam Pang, is my daughter actually

03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:37.440
sang them a couple of Chinese songs. And I thought that was a nice way to show,

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:41.520
you know, we're tough, but we respect your culture. Because the Chinese have an incredible culture

03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:46.720
that goes back thousands of years. They're very proud in how they do it. And I think that sign

03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:51.520
of respect also set things off in a very warm way for President Trump to say, my granddaughter

03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:57.520
speaks Chinese and we're showing you the respect, which I think is very important. And he did have

03:24:57.520 --> 03:25:02.080
respect for them. The next part about the visit, I mean, obviously we had a lot of discussions on

03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:07.440
trade, but the part that was probably most impactful to me was President Xi basically did

03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:14.640
an hour monologue at lunch where he just went through Chinese history from his perspective.

03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:20.800
And he talked about with particular emphasis on kind of the Treaty of Unequals and then the

03:25:20.800 --> 03:25:27.120
100 years of humiliation. And then you go through from Mao all the way to today and you had, you

03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:33.840
know, China coming back and rising. And you could tell that he was learned the lessons from the past

03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:37.840
and was very committed to kind of seeing China go through. So that was a different time, right? So

03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:45.680
China today is different than it was in 2017. In 2017, I remember President Xi was at Davos and

03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:50.080
he was feted by all the top business people in the world as the, you know, Donald Trump was the

03:25:50.080 --> 03:25:54.880
threat to the global world order. President Xi was the champion of free trade and the biggest

03:25:54.880 --> 03:26:01.920
champion of environmentalism and fighting for climate change. And what occurred was President

03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:06.240
Trump came in and basically said, like, I think China has not been following the rules-based order.

03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.280
Took very, very drastic approaches with tariffs. Every time he would do the tariffs, again,

03:26:11.280 --> 03:26:15.360
you know, I had Mnuchin, our Treasury Secretary, come to Ivanka, my house. If he does this,

03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.360
this is going to crash the whole economy. I mean, and by the way, he believed it. I mean,

03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:23.520
these were things that people were telling him would be very tough to do. You know,

03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:28.480
President Trump had a gentleman named Ambassador Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer. He was really the

03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:33.520
tip of the spear on all of our trade negotiations. He worked very well with Secretary Mnuchin.

03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:40.560
And they ended up, we ended up increasing tariffs to numbers that hadn't even been thought

03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:44.800
could happen. So we did the first round of tariffs. Then, you know, the Chinese came back

03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:49.280
and retaliated very surgically trying to hit us in all the areas that politically would have been

03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:54.000
difficult. And what Trump did was instead of backing down, he took some of the revenue from

03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:57.600
the tariffs, gave it to the farmers and said, I know that this is going to hurt your business,

03:26:57.600 --> 03:27:01.520
but I'm going to make sure you guys are made whole. And then he doubled down and basically

03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.280
went back at the Chinese with even more tariffs. So what we watched over a year and a half was

03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:11.520
probably the biggest hand of poker that was ever played. And it was an amazing experience to be a

03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:15.920
part of it. And the role I played was really working for Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador

03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:22.000
Lighthizer as a back channel with the Chinese to make sure we can just deescalate things and get

03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:29.520
to solutions in the best way possible. And so anyway, it was a fascinating time. But if you

03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:35.680
think about the global awareness of the bad practices that China was putting in place today

03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:41.760
versus what they were in 2016, I think one of President Trump's most successful policies was

03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:48.160
shifting the way the entire world understood the threat of China and then putting in place the

03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:55.440
beginning of a regime to try and rebalance the world so that we could have more economic parity.

03:27:55.440 --> 03:27:59.440
So you mentioned to me the book, The Hundred Year Marathon by Michael Pillsbury

03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:08.400
when we discussed China. And I've got a chance to read parts of it. And I highly recommend people

03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:14.400
read it because there's a few, it's definitely an eye-opening perspective. I don't know if I

03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:19.040
agree with all of it. I don't know if you agree with all of it, but it certainly opens, it gives

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:25.040
a very intense perspective on China. And you said it was instructive to how you thought how now

03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:31.920
Trump thought about China. Can you describe the main thesis of the book and maybe with the hopeful

03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:37.920
view, how it's possible to have a trajectory of these two superpowers working together in the

03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:45.760
21st century versus fighting against each other? Perfect. So it's a very, very big book. And I

03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:52.720
think it's a book definitely worth reading. Michael is tremendous. He speaks fluent Mandarin,

03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:57.600
so he spent a lot of time researching to do the book. So I highly recommend it to everyone.

03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:04.080
And it was considered more of a fringe perspective in 2016, but it really, I think, came to represent

03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:10.720
the underpinning of what the collective thought was of the Trump administration. And maybe you

03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:16.560
could argue that it was even more cynical. The whole thesis of the book was that China from 1949

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:23.200
to 2049 was working to reclaim their position as the global leader, right? So you had the Chinese

03:29:23.200 --> 03:29:27.840
empire. One of the things, I don't know if it's from this book or a different book that I read,

03:29:27.840 --> 03:29:33.360
that spoke about how in the late 1700s, basically the emperor of China was offered some of the

03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:40.000
industrial capability from England, which was basically now becoming the industrial revolution.

03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:44.080
And basically, no, we're fine. We're the great Chinese empire. We don't need any of these

03:29:44.080 --> 03:29:49.040
things. We're better than that. And by rejecting that, the rest of the world got stronger. China

03:29:49.040 --> 03:29:55.120
remained weaker. Then you had the opium wars. The Chinese had big opium problems through all

03:29:55.120 --> 03:30:02.240
the trade back and forth. And then China from about 1840 to 1940 had 100 years where they really,

03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:08.400
after all these treaties, were really a second class country. And so then you have the people's

03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:13.520
revolution that comes in. And he talks about how China very strategically is a very, very

03:30:13.520 --> 03:30:19.360
poor country, you know, would fight their way back and build brick by brick. And, you know,

03:30:19.360 --> 03:30:23.200
he proffers in the book that Nixon didn't go to China and open China. It was China that actually

03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:27.600
went to Nixon and was able to use Nixon in order to open up. And then they talk about how under

03:30:27.600 --> 03:30:32.880
Carter, they were able to get the US to contribute to a lot of their, they were able to kind of start

03:30:32.880 --> 03:30:37.040
borrowing the US know how from our university systems, from our medical, from our science,

03:30:37.040 --> 03:30:42.560
from our research. And the whole notion that was the conventional thinking of American leaders was

03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:47.440
that the more we helped China advance, the more they would become a free market economy.

03:30:47.440 --> 03:30:51.520
And it was a great market. The only difference was, was that they weren't allowing us access.

03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:55.600
They were making our companies basically give them all of their technical knowledge. They

03:30:55.600 --> 03:31:00.880
were stealing our intellectual property. They were doing espionage to steal a lot of the

03:31:00.880 --> 03:31:04.800
patents. They were just ignoring our patents and they weren't following any of the rules

03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:09.840
of international trade. Then they started becoming the world's manufacturing hub. They basically

03:31:09.840 --> 03:31:13.360
became the world's factory. And then they started this whole initiative called the belt and road

03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:17.680
initiative in order to start locking in their lines of traits. They were buying up all the

03:31:17.680 --> 03:31:22.960
ports everywhere. They were building railways thinking, how do we lock in our distribution

03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:27.600
so that we can maintain the dominance as the world's global factory? And so it was a brilliant

03:31:27.600 --> 03:31:33.120
long-term plan that they were doing. And by raising awareness, by putting the tariffs,

03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:39.120
Trump slowed them down a lot. The real question is, is if they actually did achieve this full

03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:44.640
objective of becoming the world dominant country, what they would have done with it, whether they

03:31:44.640 --> 03:31:48.880
would have been nefarious or not. I think from my perspective, even with some of the divisions and

03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:54.160
issues we have now in America, I still would rather an American led world order than a Chinese led

03:31:54.160 --> 03:32:00.480
world order. But the notion was, is that they were playing a very zero sum game and really going to

03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:06.480
be the dominant leader in this new world order. So that really framed the perspective and it

03:32:06.480 --> 03:32:13.200
wasn't necessarily, and the Chinese were always fearing, is Trump trying to stop our rise? And

03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:18.320
you have a great book also by Graham Allison that he writes about, are we destined for war between

03:32:18.320 --> 03:32:23.200
the US and China? And he goes through different historical times where you have a power and a

03:32:23.200 --> 03:32:28.640
rising superpower. And I think more than half the time it ends up leading to war. So the question is,

03:32:29.760 --> 03:32:34.640
what's going to happen here? And I do think that Trump's perspective, and this is my interpretation,

03:32:34.640 --> 03:32:38.960
because everything was always tactical day to day. And he was unpredictable to the Chinese,

03:32:38.960 --> 03:32:42.240
which they couldn't deal with. And he was unpredictable even to his team sometimes,

03:32:42.240 --> 03:32:47.440
because he was playing it day by day and issue by issue and always changing and adjusting,

03:32:47.440 --> 03:32:53.680
which is how an entrepreneur thinks. He respected the job they did by building their country. They

03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:58.160
moved 300 million people out of poverty into the middle class. They did it at the expense of a lot

03:32:58.160 --> 03:33:03.920
of other countries throughout the world, especially America. But Trump says, look, stupid politicians

03:33:03.920 --> 03:33:08.400
made deals. I respect China for doing what they did. But what I want to do is I want to change the

03:33:08.400 --> 03:33:14.720
paradigm so that for the next 20 years, we can maintain our advantage over them. We can maintain

03:33:14.720 --> 03:33:19.600
our competitive dynamic. And his general view was that America is the best private sector in the

03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:25.280
world. We have a lot of the best minds in the world. And if we can just have a level playing

03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:32.000
field with set rules, then America should be able to outperform. And so that's really what we were

03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:36.800
trying to do. We were trying to get rid of some of their state subsidies, make them follow some

03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:43.760
of these international rules of trade and not allowing them to do predatory investments that

03:33:43.760 --> 03:33:48.960
then undercut different industries that we had so that they can have global market dominance or

03:33:48.960 --> 03:33:54.560
monopolies on different industries and then have pricing power, but also geopolitical power.

03:33:54.560 --> 03:34:00.560
So one of the examples that people talk about now is China for the last 20 years was very advanced

03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:07.440
on seeing this electrification trend. They subsidized solar panels. A lot of the American

03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:12.560
solar panel players were put out of business. So now I think it's like 90 plus percent of solar

03:34:12.560 --> 03:34:17.920
panels in the world are manufactured in China. Then all the rare earths that you need in order to

03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:24.000
make these solar panels and to make these electric vehicles, China's bought up most of them and a lot

03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:29.120
of the refining capacities in China. So thinking through strategically, how do we create an even

03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:34.160
playing field so that we're not at the mercy of them and how you can have a rules-based world

03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:38.880
order. That was really kind of the thought of what we were trying to work towards.

03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:48.080
So there's this SNL skit where Jimmy Fallon plays you and you're walking into the Oval Office

03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:55.440
looking cool, wearing shades and a bulletproof vest to the song Unbelievable by EMF. I don't know

03:34:55.440 --> 03:35:00.560
if you've seen it but it's pretty epic. Then Trump says that you've traveled the world

03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:05.360
representing the administration but no one has ever heard you speak. So there's a lot of questions

03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:10.720
I can ask about that. One of them is can you introspect why you choose this low-key approach

03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:16.480
of kind of operating behind the scenes and not speaking much to the public,

03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:21.840
at least at the time. You've spoken a little bit more and today you've spoken for a really long time

03:35:21.840 --> 03:35:27.040
which I deeply appreciate. It's been a pleasure to do this and thank you for the opportunity to

03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:34.720
to talk about these things. So that was a really funny skit and it's funny the thing I got made

03:35:34.720 --> 03:35:40.320
fun of the most for that was the wardrobe and that came from after three months in the administration

03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:45.360
we were having dinner with all the generals and they were saying updating us on the war with ISIS

03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:49.600
and General Dunford said to me after, look the president can't come to see how we're fighting

03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:54.640
this war but I'd like to invite you to come with me to Iraq and come see and would you come with

03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:58.800
me? I said you know what that's great I always learned in business that you can't make decisions

03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:03.440
from just an ivory tower you have to go to the front lines and see what what's actually happening

03:36:03.440 --> 03:36:08.160
so I said no problem I'd love to go. Meanwhile two days before I'm about to go the doc from the

03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:11.360
White House stops by my office and says we need to get your blood type so what do you my blood

03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:15.600
type is you're going to an active war zone like okay so I guess we'll go to a war zone I didn't

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:22.720
really think this thing fully through so I get on the plane with Dunford and we land in Iraq and

03:36:22.720 --> 03:36:27.040
he looks like GI Joe he's you know he's a great great general he's very very well respected in

03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:33.440
the military and we we go in and we we get on Black Hawk helicopter they said you know today's

03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:40.400
a nice day let's take the the sides off and so I get on the plane and there's a guy you know

03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:46.480
military service officer who then takes a machine gun locks it into a thing takes the bullets puts

03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:50.080
them into the gun and is sitting there saying we're ready to go and then I'm looking out there's

03:36:50.080 --> 03:36:55.920
like three other helicopters with guys one was an osprey with a guy buckled in also with a machine

03:36:55.920 --> 03:37:01.520
gun looking out we take off and we're flying over Baghdad from the airport to the embassy

03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:07.760
and as we're going I'm sitting in an open air helicopter with the chairman of the joint chiefs

03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:13.120
of staff guys with machine guns everywhere this is a new experience for you you have an experience

03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:18.400
slightly I mean I was doing real estate like three months ago you know now I'm flying over Iraq and

03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:22.480
and the chairman says that's Saddam Hussein's palace and I look down there's like a big bomb

03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:26.560
right through the middle then you see the area with the two swords in the hands I'm saying to

03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:31.280
myself like how the hell did I get here like what is happening so meanwhile we end up going to the

03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:36.160
front lines to be with the service the Iraqi military which the US military is working closely

03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:40.320
with and I had a meeting that night with the president of Iraq and so I wore what are you

03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:44.800
wearing at the front lines in a battle zone and and also me the president so I put a sports jacket

03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:50.800
on we land at the at the front line and they give me a bulletproof vest that says Kushner on it I

03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:58.320
tape it I just I put it on I go out and I covered the NER so it just said Kush and and I went and

03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:01.760
I didn't realize they were taking pictures and I think the picture looks pretty epic you with

03:38:01.760 --> 03:38:05.920
sunglasses I think I love it so anyway so that was the funny story behind that and then

03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:11.760
actually my brother was at a some society event in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon so the

03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:17.520
two of them took a selfie together and Josh writes me says hanging out with my older brother in New

03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:22.800
York you know I'm trying to explain to him what your voice sounds like so so it was good so that

03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:29.200
was a funny one but I think just being behind the scenes for me just gave me more maneuverability

03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:33.440
in the sense that you know again it goes back to trust and people knowing that I wasn't going to

03:38:33.440 --> 03:38:39.040
try to publicize the things they were telling me I think it just gave me more ability to operate

03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:45.600
that way and I also realized too like communicating is a very important skill luckily in Washington

03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:49.760
there's no shortage of amazing communicators I think there were a lot of people who are much

03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:54.640
better at me than being communicators so I was very happy that they were willing to do it because

03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:59.040
it wasn't something that I had a lot of experience with or necessarily I thought was very I was very

03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:04.080
good at and so I kind of just did my job and just focused on getting things done.

03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:13.680
Let me ask you you have a very interesting life if you were to give advice to young folks

03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:22.400
on how to have such an impactful life what would you say career and life how to have a successful

03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:29.200
career and a successful life? Number one is I would say you just have to work hard at everything

03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:38.320
you do number two I would say never stop learning and always try to say yes more than you should go

03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:45.600
out of your comfort zone and I think just you got to work hard at everything you do and if you're

03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:49.760
going to take something on do it the best you can you know one of the lessons I write about in the

03:39:49.760 --> 03:39:54.560
book from my father was I remember I was going for a job interview and he asked me he says well

03:39:54.560 --> 03:39:58.720
what time are you leaving to the job interview is that nine o'clock I said I'll leave at eight

03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:02.480
o'clock he says well what if there's traffic I said dad I've done this drive a thousand times

03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:06.800
like there's never traffic so what if there's an accident I said I can't control that he said

03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:11.680
Jared the only excuse you ever have for being late is that you didn't leave early enough and

03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:16.080
I just think it's something where if you want to accomplish something you know a lot of people I

03:40:16.080 --> 03:40:20.800
hear they complain about what other people do or why it's hard or why it's impossible and again I

03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:26.160
say this as somebody who's been so blessed with so many things in life but you know when I've had

03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:32.400
challenges or things I've wanted to achieve I just focus and say what can I do and I'll read

03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:38.000
everything I can get my hands on if I fail at one the door closes I'll try the window if the window

03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:41.840
closed I'll try the chimney if the chimney throws I'll try to dig a tunnel it's just if you want to

03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:46.400
accomplish something you just have to go at it and you know I think the most important thing I'll

03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:52.400
say sorry I'm kind of thinking my way into this answer is just do the right thing I think that's

03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:57.520
also right and I saw that in my career you know be good to people be honest do the right thing

03:40:58.160 --> 03:41:04.400
and and if you do that I think long term it does pay off maybe not in politics but in

03:41:05.120 --> 03:41:08.640
in the world at large it does and my hope is in politics it will as well

03:41:08.640 --> 03:41:13.040
I wonder if you can comment on your process of learning in general because you took on so many

03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:19.200
new interesting problems and approached them with a first principles kind of approach

03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:24.960
so what was your source of information so because you didn't seem to be listening to the

03:41:25.680 --> 03:41:33.120
assumptions of the prior experts you were just taking on the problem in a very pragmatic

03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:39.520
uh perspective so what was uh how did you learn about the middle east how did you learn about

03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:45.440
china how did you learn about mexico how did you you know like all of these prison reform all

03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:50.400
this that you've taken on and were extremely effective at it really started with just talking

03:41:50.400 --> 03:41:55.760
to people um I would I would try to reach out to people who had been involved in different things

03:41:55.760 --> 03:42:00.480
and ask them you know what they did what they thought of the problem who they thought was smart

03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:05.520
on it what they read that helped them get a better understanding why they think something

03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:10.880
had failed um and then I would just you know read voraciously on every topic um you know

03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:15.680
Washington it was harder to get advice from from humans because I found humans had this weird

03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:20.160
tendency to talk to the media and so you know I talked to somebody and I'd ask advice and then

03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:23.600
the next thing I know is the Washington Post would call and say Jared's an idiot doesn't know what

03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:27.360
he's doing and he's even going to this person to get advice I'm like yeah I'm asking everyone so

03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:34.720
so books really became an amazing guide for me um Ivanka she she's an incredible researcher

03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:39.840
she she's just voracious and so she gave me some of my best books and some incredible advice as

03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:44.880
well but that was really the the process and then I think that was kind of the first stage and then

03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:49.680
the second stage was just constant iteration and readjusting plan as you continue to get more

03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:54.640
learning and one story I tell in the book as well is that on my my first trip to the middle east

03:42:54.640 --> 03:43:00.640
where I met with Mohammed bin Zayed who I spoke about earlier the ruler of UAE I spent two hours

03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:06.320
with him asking him questions and really going through the Israeli Palestinian issue the Israeli

03:43:06.320 --> 03:43:10.800
Arab issue and he said to me at the end of the meeting he says Jared I think you're going to

03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:15.280
make peace here in the middle east and I was shocked because I mean first of all he was you

03:43:15.280 --> 03:43:20.400
know at the time I think one of the most respected leaders in the region somebody who I found to be

03:43:20.400 --> 03:43:26.080
very wise and super thoughtful and experienced and I said to him why do you say that I was

03:43:26.080 --> 03:43:31.440
flattered obviously but but not certain why he was saying that based on the fact that I didn't

03:43:31.440 --> 03:43:34.880
know what my plan was I didn't know what I was going to do and I had no pathway to make peace

03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:40.480
and he said well the U.S. usually sends one of three different kinds of people to come see me

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:45.520
he says the first are people who come and they fall asleep in meetings he said the second are

03:43:45.520 --> 03:43:51.760
people who come and they basically read me notes but have no ability to interact on the message

03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:56.800
theory there to convey and then the third have been people who have come to convince me to do

03:43:56.800 --> 03:44:01.920
things that aren't in my interest he says you're the first person who's ever come here and it's

03:44:01.920 --> 03:44:08.000
just asked questions he says why why have you done that I said because I figure you know this

03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:12.160
problem's been going on for a long time you live here I'll be gone at some point you're going to

03:44:12.160 --> 03:44:17.440
have to live with the consequences of whatever my work is and the U.S. has a lot of power and my

03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:23.520
question is what would you do if you were me and how would you approach this and help me think

03:44:23.520 --> 03:44:28.160
about it and again I wasn't going to then take his plan and then execute it but I thought it'd be

03:44:28.160 --> 03:44:34.720
very provocative to understand from the people in the region and instructive how they would use the

03:44:34.720 --> 03:44:40.800
resource and the power that the U.S. had to solve the problems that were having significant impact

03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:48.880
on their lives yeah there's a lot of power to the sort of the the simplicity of that

03:44:50.240 --> 03:44:56.480
human approach where you're just listening yeah and one of my wishes for society is I leave

03:44:56.480 --> 03:45:03.280
government you know I was living on the Upper East Side in a very liberal echo chamber I then traveled

03:45:03.280 --> 03:45:08.400
the country I met so many people who I never would have met otherwise on the conservative side on the

03:45:08.400 --> 03:45:13.120
independent side on so many different issues I think that people benefit if you have such a

03:45:13.120 --> 03:45:17.360
strong point of view I would follow you know the John Stuart Mill marketplace of ideas

03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:22.880
and find people who disagree with you and don't call them names don't say they're a bad person

03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:27.920
say I want to understand why you feel the way you do let's have conversations in this country

03:45:27.920 --> 03:45:33.360
and I think that that's probably going to be our best way to work through the issues that we have

03:45:33.360 --> 03:45:40.080
currently when you zoom out and look at the 21st century from a human history perspective across

03:45:40.080 --> 03:45:46.480
the time scale of many decades maybe centuries what gives you hope about human civilization

03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:50.640
everything you've seen you've traveled the world you've talked to some of the most powerful and

03:45:50.640 --> 03:45:56.480
influential people and you look at the future what gives you hope about this little planet of ours

03:45:57.040 --> 03:46:01.760
what gives me the most hope is that anything's possible if there's there's one lesson that I

03:46:01.760 --> 03:46:07.760
took from my time in government it's that people coming together to try to make tomorrow different

03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:14.000
than yesterday can succeed and if the right people in the right places focus on the right ideas I

03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:19.360
think the advancement that we can have for human history and for society can be tremendous and I

03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:24.320
think that right now I see we're at a place in society where there's a lot of what I call

03:46:24.320 --> 03:46:31.040
squabbles between countries which are really man versus man issues and those are as old as time

03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:36.800
right you know we've been fighting about borders or or religion or you know or who wronged somebody

03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:41.920
a hundred or a thousand years ago and these are what I call more tribal battles but I do think that

03:46:42.480 --> 03:46:48.240
as we advance with artificial intelligence as energy becomes cheaper and it's more readily

03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:51.680
available I think we're gonna have massive industrialization I think we're gonna have

03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:56.800
massive advancement I think in medical and science we're gonna have cures for diseases

03:46:57.680 --> 03:47:02.560
we have the potential in 10-20 years from now to enter a dawn for humanity that could be

03:47:02.560 --> 03:47:08.160
incredible we could become multi-planetary we can we can explore the wonders of the world we can

03:47:08.160 --> 03:47:16.720
find things we didn't know so I think that if if we we put our energy towards finding these

03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:23.680
advancements that will improve the lives of of everyone on this planet instead of figuring out

03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:28.720
ways to have these tensions between us that for me is the most optimistic case for what's

03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:34.400
possible and the reason why I believe it's possible is because somebody with no experience

03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:42.400
somebody who all I really had was was the faith of a leader and I had the the courage to try

03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:47.680
and I went out there with other people and we took on some of the most hopeless impossible problems

03:47:47.680 --> 03:47:52.400
and we succeeded and if we were able to do that then everyone else should be able to do that as

03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:58.800
