The following is a conversation with Jo Bowler,

00:02.740 --> 00:04.820
a mathematics educator at Stanford

00:04.820 --> 00:08.100
and co-founder of ucubed.org

00:08.100 --> 00:10.100
that seeks to inspire young minds

00:10.100 --> 00:12.540
with the beauty of mathematics.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.060

00:17.140 --> 00:19.340
This is the Lex Fridman podcast,

00:19.340 --> 00:22.420
and here is my conversation with Jo Bowler.

00:23.620 --> 00:27.180
What to you is beautiful about mathematics?

00:27.180 --> 00:29.800
I love a mathematics

00:29.800 --> 00:32.720
that some people don't even think of as mathematics,

00:32.720 --> 00:37.620
which is beautiful, creative mathematics,

00:37.620 --> 00:39.520
where we look at maths in different ways,

00:39.520 --> 00:41.240
we visualize it,

00:41.240 --> 00:44.680
we think about different solutions to problems.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.980
A lot of people think of maths as

00:46.980 --> 00:49.560
you have one method and one answer.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.160
And what I love about maths

00:51.160 --> 00:54.000
is the multiple different ways you can see things,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.780
different methods, different ways of seeing different,

00:56.780 --> 00:59.180
in some cases, different solutions.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.140
So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics,

01:02.140 --> 01:05.800
that you can see and solve it in many different ways.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.000
And also the sad part that many people think

01:10.000 --> 01:13.820
that maths is just one answer and one method.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.340
So to you, the beauty emerges

01:16.340 --> 01:18.560
when you have a problem with a solution

01:18.560 --> 01:21.100
and you start adding other solutions,

01:21.100 --> 01:24.700
simpler solutions, weirder solutions,

01:24.700 --> 01:26.500
more interesting, some that are visual,

01:27.100 --> 01:30.140
some of their algebraic, geometry, all that kind of stuff.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.300
Yeah, I mean, I always say

01:32.300 --> 01:35.380
that you can take any maths area and make it visual.

01:35.380 --> 01:38.100
And we say to teachers, give us your most dry,

01:38.100 --> 01:41.700
boring maths and we'll make it a visual,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.240
interesting, creative problem.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.940
And turns out you can do that with any area of maths.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.640
And I think we've given,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.720
it's been a great disservice to kids and others

01:51.720 --> 01:56.140
that it's always been numbers, lots and lots of numbers,

01:56.700 --> 01:58.660
numbers can be great, but you can think about maths

01:58.660 --> 02:01.040
in other ways besides numbers.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.100
Do you find that most people are better visual learners?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.580
Or is this just something that's complimentary?

02:08.380 --> 02:11.060
What's the kind of the full spectrum of students

02:11.060 --> 02:13.380
in the way they like to explore math, would you say?

02:13.380 --> 02:17.500
There's definitely people who come into the classes I do

02:17.500 --> 02:19.760
who are more interested in visual thinking

02:19.760 --> 02:21.960
and like visual approaches.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.680
But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us

02:24.680 --> 02:26.700
is that when we think about maths,

02:26.700 --> 02:29.160
there are two visual pathways in the brain

02:29.160 --> 02:32.760
and we should all be thinking about it visually.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.760
Some approaches have been to say, well,

02:34.760 --> 02:37.400
you're a visual learner, so we'll give you visuals

02:37.400 --> 02:40.620
and you're not a visual learner.

02:40.620 --> 02:45.120
But actually, if you think you're not a visual learner,

02:45.120 --> 02:48.880
it's probably more important that you have a visual approach

02:48.880 --> 02:51.560
so you can develop that part of your brain.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.900
So you were saying that there's some kind

02:52.900 --> 02:54.520
of interconnected aspect to it.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.680
So the visual connects with the non-visual.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.840
Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us,

02:59.840 --> 03:01.160
that when you work on a maths problem,

03:01.160 --> 03:03.480
there are five different brain pathways

03:03.480 --> 03:06.720
and that the most high achieving people in the world

03:06.720 --> 03:08.420
are people who have more connections

03:08.420 --> 03:10.460
between these pathways.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.840
So if you see a maths problem with numbers,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.880
but you also see it visually,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.980
that will cause a connection to happen in your brain

03:17.980 --> 03:19.860
between these pathways.

03:19.860 --> 03:22.080
And if you maybe write about it with words,

03:22.080 --> 03:23.380
that would cause another connection

03:23.380 --> 03:26.460
or maybe you build it with something physical

03:26.460 --> 03:28.380
that would cause a different connection.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.060
And what we want for kids is,

03:31.060 --> 03:33.620
we call it a multi-dimensional experience of maths,

03:33.620 --> 03:35.500
seeing it in different ways,

03:35.500 --> 03:37.860
experiencing it in different ways,

03:37.860 --> 03:40.620
that will cause that great connected brain.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.300
You know, there's these stories of physicists doing the same.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.220
I find physicists are often better at building

03:46.220 --> 03:49.020
that part of their brain of using visualization

03:49.020 --> 03:50.620
for intuition building,

03:50.660 --> 03:53.060
because you ultimately want to understand

03:54.380 --> 03:57.100
the deepest secret underneath this problem.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.820
And for that, you have to intuit your way there.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.780
And you mentioned offline that one of the ways

04:02.780 --> 04:03.700
you might approach a problem

04:03.700 --> 04:05.900
is to try to tell a story about it.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.820
And some of it is like legend,

04:07.820 --> 04:10.580
but I'm sure it's not always,

04:10.580 --> 04:14.940
is you know, you have Einstein thinking about a train,

04:14.940 --> 04:16.720
you know, and the speed of light,

04:16.720 --> 04:20.020
and you know, that kind of intuition is useful.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.980
And you start to like imagine a physical world,

04:22.980 --> 04:25.500
like how does this idea manifest itself

04:25.500 --> 04:26.340
in the physical world,

04:26.340 --> 04:28.860
and then start playing in your mind with that physical world

04:28.860 --> 04:30.260
and think, is this going to be true?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.540
Is this going to be true?

04:31.540 --> 04:32.380
Right.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.860
Einstein is well known for thinking visually.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.420
And people talk about how he really didn't want to go

04:40.420 --> 04:43.300
anywhere with problems without thinking about them visually.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.820
But the other thing you mentioned

04:44.820 --> 04:48.820
that sparked something for me is thinking with intuition,

04:48.820 --> 04:51.420
like having intuition about maths problems.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.100
That's another thing that's often absent in maths class,

04:54.100 --> 04:55.860
the idea that you might think about a problem

04:55.860 --> 05:00.820
and use your intuition, but so important.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.860
And when mathematicians are interviewed,

05:02.860 --> 05:05.220
they will very frequently talk about the role of intuition

05:05.220 --> 05:07.220
in solving problems,

05:07.220 --> 05:12.220
but not commonly acknowledged or brought into education.

05:13.000 --> 05:13.840
Yeah.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.700
I mean, that's what it is.

05:14.740 --> 05:18.020
Like if you task yourself

05:18.020 --> 05:21.340
with building an intuition about a problem,

05:21.340 --> 05:23.700
that's where you start to pull in,

05:23.700 --> 05:27.180
like what is the pattern I'm seeing?

05:27.180 --> 05:28.580
And in order to understand the pattern,

05:28.580 --> 05:31.780
you might want to then start utilizing visualization.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.100
But ultimately, that's all in service

05:34.100 --> 05:38.860
of like solving the puzzle, like cracking it open,

05:38.860 --> 05:40.380
to get the simple explanation

05:40.380 --> 05:43.780
of why things are the way they are,

05:43.980 --> 05:46.180
as opposed to, like you said,

05:46.180 --> 05:47.620
having a particular algorithm

05:47.620 --> 05:50.180
that you can then execute to solve the problem.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.820
Yeah, but it's hard, it's hard.

05:51.820 --> 05:52.660
Yeah.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.580
Like reasoning is really hard.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.140
Yeah, it's hard.

05:55.140 --> 05:58.860
I mean, I love to value what's hard in maths

05:58.860 --> 06:00.620
instead of being afraid of it.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.500
We know that when you struggle,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.540
that's actually a really good time for your brain.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.260
You want to be struggling when you're thinking about things.

06:07.260 --> 06:10.100
So if it's hard to think intuitively about something,

06:10.100 --> 06:13.620
that's probably a really good time for your brain.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.700
I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,

06:16.700 --> 06:19.580
who is a great sort of mathematician,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.220
you might think of him, an AI person.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.740
And I remember in one interview I did with him,

06:23.740 --> 06:25.780
he talked about how they'd built robots,

06:25.780 --> 06:27.580
I think for the Smithsonian,

06:27.580 --> 06:29.380
and how they were having this trouble

06:29.380 --> 06:32.340
with them picking up white noise.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.580
And he said they had to solve it,

06:34.580 --> 06:36.420
they had to work out what's going on,

06:36.420 --> 06:41.300
and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.620
But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.060
I thought that was really interesting

06:47.060 --> 06:49.620
that how you can have this intuition

06:49.620 --> 06:51.820
and know something works.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.420
It's kind of different from going through

06:53.420 --> 06:57.020
that long mathematical process of proving it,

06:57.020 --> 06:58.300
but so important.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.660
Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved

07:01.660 --> 07:03.980
as like intuition machines.

07:03.980 --> 07:08.900
And the math of like showing it like formally

07:08.900 --> 07:10.580
is probably an extra thing

07:10.580 --> 07:12.100
that we're not designed for.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.100
You see that with Feynman and his,

07:15.660 --> 07:17.980
all of these physicists, definitely you see

07:19.620 --> 07:21.100
starting with intuition,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.420
sometimes starting with an experiment,

07:24.460 --> 07:27.860
and then the experiment inspires intuition.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.260
But you can think of an experiment

07:29.260 --> 07:31.020
as a kind of visualization.

07:31.020 --> 07:34.260
Just like let's take whatever the heck we're looking at

07:34.260 --> 07:38.620
and draw it, and draw like the pattern as it evolves,

07:38.620 --> 07:41.060
as the thing grows for n equals one,

07:41.060 --> 07:42.740
for n equals two, n equals three,

07:42.740 --> 07:44.780
and you start to play with it.

07:44.780 --> 07:48.660
And then in the modern day, which I loved doing,

07:48.660 --> 07:52.420
is you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.

07:52.420 --> 07:55.460
And then you can start exploring it programmatically.

07:55.460 --> 08:00.140
And then you can do so interactively too.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.580
I tend to not like interactive

08:03.580 --> 08:05.660
because it takes way too much work,

08:05.660 --> 08:07.140
because you have to click and move and stuff.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.900
I love to interact through writing programs,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.500
but that's my particular brain, software engineer.

08:12.500 --> 08:17.180
So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.300
And then there's the tools of visualization,

08:19.300 --> 08:22.620
like color, all of those kinds of things.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.220
That you're absolutely right.

08:24.220 --> 08:27.180
They're actually not taught very much.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.780
Like the art of visualization.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.060
Not taught.

08:30.060 --> 08:33.700
And we love as well color coding.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.500
Like when you represent something mathematically,

08:36.540 --> 08:41.060
you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.340
So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,

08:44.340 --> 08:46.740
maybe I show the X with a certain color,

08:46.740 --> 08:48.020
but I also write in that color

08:48.020 --> 08:51.420
so you can see the relationship.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.340
Very cool.

08:52.340 --> 08:56.860
And yeah, particularly in our work with elementary teachers,

08:56.860 --> 08:58.780
many of them come to our workshops

08:58.780 --> 09:00.780
and they're literally in tears

09:00.780 --> 09:03.900
when they see things making sense visually.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.340
Because they've spent their whole lives

09:06.340 --> 09:09.260
not realizing you can really understand things

09:09.260 --> 09:10.980
with these visuals.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.740
It's quite powerful.

09:12.740 --> 09:17.740
You say that there's something valuable to learning

09:17.860 --> 09:20.540
when the thing that you're doing is challenging,

09:20.540 --> 09:21.660
is difficult.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.060
So a lot of people say math is hard

09:24.060 --> 09:28.100
or math is too hard or too hard for me.

09:28.100 --> 09:32.420
Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?

09:33.380 --> 09:36.860
I think it's great when things are challenging,

09:36.860 --> 09:39.100
but there's something that's really key

09:39.100 --> 09:42.820
to being able to deal with challenging maths

09:42.820 --> 09:46.740
and that is knowing that you can do it.

09:46.740 --> 09:48.620
And I think the problem in education

09:48.620 --> 09:51.140
is a lot of people have got this idea

09:51.140 --> 09:53.940
that you're either born with a maths brain or you're not.

09:53.940 --> 09:56.380
So when they start to struggle, they think,

09:56.380 --> 09:58.380
oh, I don't have that maths brain.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.900
And then they will literally sort of switch off

10:00.980 --> 10:04.060
in their brain and things will go downhill from that point.

10:04.060 --> 10:06.260
So struggle becomes a lot easier

10:06.260 --> 10:10.940
and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.420
But you know that you can do it.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.980
You have to go through this struggle to get there,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.740
but you're able to do that.

10:18.740 --> 10:21.780
And so we're hampered in being able to struggle

10:21.780 --> 10:25.260
with these ideas we've been given about what we can do.

10:25.260 --> 10:27.220
Ask a difficult question here.

10:27.220 --> 10:32.020
So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is,

10:32.020 --> 10:37.020
but some people struggle with learning in different ways.

10:38.700 --> 10:42.460
Like their brain is constructed in different ways.

10:42.460 --> 10:47.060
And how much should, as educators,

10:47.060 --> 10:49.300
should we make room for that?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.420
So how do you know the difference between this is hard

10:52.420 --> 10:54.500
and I don't like doing hard things

10:54.500 --> 10:57.100
versus my brain is wired in a way

10:57.940 --> 10:59.060
where I need to learn in very different ways.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.660
I can't learn it this way.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.340
How do you find that line?

11:02.340 --> 11:04.020
How do you operate in that gray area?

11:04.020 --> 11:07.380
So this is why being a teacher is so hard.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.380
And people really don't appreciate

11:09.380 --> 11:12.300
how difficult teaching is when you're faced with,

11:12.300 --> 11:14.900
I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.500
But this is also why I believe it's so important

11:19.500 --> 11:21.940
to have this multi-dimensional approach to maths.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.700
We've really offered it in one way,

11:24.700 --> 11:27.380
which is here's some numbers and a method.

11:27.380 --> 11:31.220
You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.820
And so there are some kids who like doing that

11:33.820 --> 11:34.860
and they do well.

11:34.860 --> 11:39.100
And a lot of kids who don't like doing it and don't do well.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.780
But when you open up maths and you give,

11:42.780 --> 11:44.660
you let kids experience it in different ways,

11:44.660 --> 11:47.660
maybe visually with numbers, with words,

11:47.660 --> 11:49.980
what happens is kids,

11:49.980 --> 11:52.460
there are many more kids who can access it.

11:52.460 --> 11:56.180
So those different brain wirings you're talking about

11:56.180 --> 11:58.860
where some people are just more able to do something

11:58.860 --> 12:01.860
in a particular way, that's why we want to,

12:01.860 --> 12:04.700
that's one of the reasons we want to open it up

12:04.700 --> 12:08.380
so that there are different ways of accessing it.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.180
And then that's not really a problem.

12:11.180 --> 12:14.420
So I grew up in the Soviet Union

12:14.420 --> 12:17.420
and fell in love with math early.

12:17.420 --> 12:22.340
I was forced into math early and fell in love through force.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.180
That's good.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.820
Well, good that you fell in love with the force.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.380
But something we talked about a little bit

12:28.380 --> 12:33.300
is there's such a value for excellence.

12:33.300 --> 12:37.900
It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.900
The definition of success is being in a particular class

12:44.460 --> 12:46.340
is being really good at it.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.900
And it's not improving, it's like being really good.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.820
I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.860
We're not, it's like it's understood,

12:56.860 --> 12:59.780
you're going to star on the basketball team.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.420
If you're gonna start on the basketball team,

13:02.420 --> 13:05.140
if you're going to be better than the other guys,

13:05.140 --> 13:06.540
the other girls on the team.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.220
So that coupled with the belief,

13:12.220 --> 13:14.700
this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know,

13:14.700 --> 13:19.180
but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.220
But if you're not great, that's your fault.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.460
And you need to work harder.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.940
And I remember I had a sense that, probably delusional,

13:27.940 --> 13:29.660
but I could win a Nobel Prize.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.460
I don't even know what that entails.

13:33.100 --> 13:38.100
But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand

13:39.580 --> 13:42.540
and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out

13:42.540 --> 13:46.140
how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time,

13:46.140 --> 13:48.380
it will probably give you a Nobel Prize.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
And I remember early in my life thinking,

13:50.460 --> 13:52.500
I'm going to invent the time machine.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.740
And like the tools of mathematics were in service

13:56.740 --> 14:00.020
of that dream of winning the Nobel Prize.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.180
It's silly.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.540
I didn't really think in those concrete terms,

14:03.540 --> 14:06.820
but I just thought I could be great, that feeling.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.700
And then when you struggle,

14:08.700 --> 14:11.980
the belief that you could be great is like,

14:11.980 --> 14:13.220
struggle is good.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.620
Right, pushes you on, yeah.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.300
And so the other thing about the Soviet system

14:17.500 --> 14:20.580
that might love to hear your comments about

14:20.580 --> 14:24.380
is just the sheer hours of math.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.780
The number of courses, you're talking about

14:26.780 --> 14:29.300
a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.700
I think in the American system,

14:30.700 --> 14:33.100
you take maybe one year of geometry.

14:33.100 --> 14:33.940
In high school, yeah.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.300
In high school.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.500
First of all, geometry is beautiful, it's visual.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.140
And then you get to reason through proofs

14:39.140 --> 14:40.180
and stuff like that.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.660
In Russia, I remember just being nailed

14:42.660 --> 14:43.860
over and over with you all.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.500
It was just nonstop.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.220
And then of course, there's different perspectives

14:48.220 --> 14:50.420
on calculus and just the whole.

14:50.420 --> 14:55.420
The sense was that math is like fundamental

14:56.060 --> 14:58.700
to the development of the human mind.

14:58.700 --> 15:02.460
So math, but also science and literature, by the way,

15:02.460 --> 15:04.940
was also hit very hard.

15:04.940 --> 15:08.260
We read a lot of serious adult stuff.

15:08.260 --> 15:09.980
America does that a little bit too.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.660
They challenge young adults with good literature,

15:12.660 --> 15:16.180
but they don't challenge adults very much with math.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.900
So those two things, valuing excellence

15:20.900 --> 15:23.740
and just a lot of math in the curriculum.

15:23.740 --> 15:26.900
Do you think, do you find that interesting?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.580
Because it seems to have been successful.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.220
Yeah, I think that's very interesting.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.740
And there is a lot of success,

15:32.740 --> 15:34.140
people coming through the Soviet system.

15:34.140 --> 15:37.340
I think something that's very different to the US

15:37.340 --> 15:39.500
and other countries in the world

15:39.500 --> 15:41.940
is that idea that excellence is important

15:42.300 --> 15:44.940
and you can get there if you work hard.

15:44.940 --> 15:48.700
In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important,

15:48.700 --> 15:52.140
but then kids are given the idea in many ways

15:52.140 --> 15:53.740
that you can either do it

15:53.740 --> 15:56.140
or you're one of the people who can't.

15:56.140 --> 15:58.460
So many students in the school system

15:58.460 --> 15:59.700
think they're one of the kids who can't.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.260
So there's no point in trying hard

16:02.260 --> 16:04.700
because you're never going to get there.

16:04.700 --> 16:09.620
So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.140
And it seems from what you've said

16:11.140 --> 16:16.140
that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.580
Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there

16:19.580 --> 16:24.020
if you work hard is that thought

16:24.020 --> 16:26.540
that if you're not getting there, it's your fault.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.700
And I would add something into that.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.740
I would say that anybody can get there,

16:31.820 --> 16:35.180
but they need to work hard and they also need good teaching

16:35.180 --> 16:37.980
because there are some people who really can't get there

16:37.980 --> 16:41.260
because they're not given access to that good teaching.

16:41.260 --> 16:44.620
So, but that would be huge, that change.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.500
As to doing lots of maths,

16:46.500 --> 16:50.980
if maths was interesting and open and creative

16:50.980 --> 16:53.780
and multi-dimensional, I would be all for it.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.060
We actually run summer camps at Stanford

16:56.060 --> 16:59.100
where we invite kids in and we give them this maths

16:59.100 --> 17:00.700
that I love.

17:00.700 --> 17:05.300
And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.

17:05.340 --> 17:08.540
And when we were planning, the teachers were like,

17:08.540 --> 17:11.500
three hours, are we gonna be able to keep the kids excited

17:11.500 --> 17:12.540
for three hours?

17:12.540 --> 17:16.020
Turned out they didn't want to go to break or lunch.

17:16.020 --> 17:19.500
They'd be so into these mathematical patterns.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.140
We couldn't stop them.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.820
It was amazing.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.220
So yeah, if maths was more like that,

17:25.220 --> 17:29.100
then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.020
So what age are you talking about?

17:31.020 --> 17:34.740
Is there, could you comment on what age

17:34.740 --> 17:39.180
is like the most important when people quit math

17:39.180 --> 17:42.820
or give up on themselves or on math in general?

17:42.820 --> 17:45.580
And perhaps that age or something earlier

17:45.580 --> 17:48.620
is really an important moment for them to discover,

17:48.620 --> 17:51.500
to be inspired to discover the magic of math.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.460
I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves

17:54.460 --> 17:59.260
and maths around from about fifth grade.

17:59.260 --> 18:02.420
And then those middle school years are really important.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.580
And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids

18:05.420 --> 18:07.980
just because they're allowed to explore

18:07.980 --> 18:11.500
and think in good ways in the early grades

18:11.500 --> 18:12.340
of elementary school.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.580
But fifth grade teachers are often like,

18:13.580 --> 18:15.500
okay, we're gonna prepare you now for middle school

18:15.500 --> 18:18.220
and we're gonna give you grades and lots of tests.

18:18.220 --> 18:21.300
And that's when kids start to feel

18:21.300 --> 18:22.580
really badly about themselves.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.820
And so middle school years,

18:24.820 --> 18:27.060
our camps are middle school students.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.220
We think of those years as really pivotal.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.700
Many kids in those years are deciding,

18:31.700 --> 18:35.700
yes, I'm gonna keep going with STEM subjects,

18:35.700 --> 18:38.380
or no, I'm not, that this isn't for me.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.860
So, I mean, all years are important.

18:40.860 --> 18:43.180
And in all years, you can kind of switch kids

18:43.180 --> 18:45.700
and get them on a different pathway.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.500
But I think those middle school years are really important.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.900
So what's the role of the teacher in this?

18:50.900 --> 18:53.140
So one is the explanation of the subject,

18:53.140 --> 18:57.700
but do you think teachers should almost do like one-on-one,

18:58.380 --> 19:01.820
you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?

19:01.820 --> 19:03.860
Like that energy of like-

19:03.860 --> 19:05.380
Turns out it's really important.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.500
There's a study that was done,

19:07.500 --> 19:10.420
it was actually done in high school English classrooms

19:10.420 --> 19:14.100
where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.100
And this was done as an experiment.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.900
Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,

19:18.900 --> 19:21.100
diagnostic feedback, which is great.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.060
But for half of the kids,

19:22.060 --> 19:23.980
it said an extra sentence at the bottom

19:23.980 --> 19:26.300
that the researchers had put on.

19:26.300 --> 19:30.060
And the kids who read that extra sentence

19:30.060 --> 19:33.540
did significantly better in English a whole year later.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.780
The only change was this one sentence.

19:36.780 --> 19:37.620
What did the sentence say?

19:37.620 --> 19:39.780
So what did the sentence say?

19:39.780 --> 19:42.940
The sentence said, I'm giving you this feedback

19:42.940 --> 19:44.220
because I believe in you.

19:45.260 --> 19:48.460
And the kids who read that did better a year later.

19:49.460 --> 19:52.380
So when I share this with teachers,

19:52.380 --> 19:53.900
I say, you know, I'm not suggesting

19:53.900 --> 19:56.060
you put on the bottom of all kids' work,

19:56.780 --> 19:58.460
I'm giving you this feedback because I believe in you.

19:58.460 --> 19:59.500
One of the teachers said to me,

19:59.500 --> 20:00.780
we don't put it on a stamp.

20:00.780 --> 20:03.420
I said, no, don't put it on a stamp.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.060
But your words are really important.

20:08.060 --> 20:12.580
And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time thinking,

20:12.580 --> 20:13.940
what does my teacher think of me?

20:13.940 --> 20:15.780
Does my teacher think I can do this?

20:17.300 --> 20:19.580
So it turns out it is really important

20:19.580 --> 20:22.620
to be saying to kids, I know you can do this.

20:22.620 --> 20:27.620
And those messages are not given enough by teachers.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.060
And really believe it.

20:29.060 --> 20:29.900
And believe it, yeah.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.540
You can't just say it, you have to believe it.

20:32.540 --> 20:37.540
I sometimes, it's such a funny dance

20:38.100 --> 20:39.660
because I'm almost such a perfectionist,

20:39.660 --> 20:41.420
I'm extremely self-critical

20:41.420 --> 20:43.700
and I have students come up to me

20:43.700 --> 20:48.700
and it's clear to me that they're not even close to good.

20:49.460 --> 20:52.380
And it's tempting for me to be like,

20:53.180 --> 20:55.700
I'm not going to be able to sort of give up on them mentally.

20:55.700 --> 20:59.220
But the reality is, if you look at many great people

20:59.220 --> 21:01.980
throughout history, they sucked at some point.

21:01.980 --> 21:02.820
Yeah, exactly.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.860
And some of the greatest took non-linear paths

21:05.860 --> 21:10.460
to where they sucked for long into later life.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.060
And so always kind of believing

21:12.060 --> 21:14.780
that this person can be great.

21:14.780 --> 21:15.620
Exactly.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.420
You have to communicate that

21:17.420 --> 21:19.180
plus the fact that they have to work hard.

21:19.180 --> 21:20.700
That's it, yeah.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.540
Yeah, and you're right.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.580
It's filled with people who are dropouts of school

21:24.580 --> 21:28.860
or who had special needs, who didn't succeed.

21:28.860 --> 21:30.780
It's very interesting that have gone on

21:30.780 --> 21:34.300
to do amazing work in creative ways.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.700
I mean, I do think our school system is set up

21:36.700 --> 21:41.500
to value good memorizers

21:41.500 --> 21:44.780
who can reproduce what a teacher is showing them

21:44.780 --> 21:49.260
and push away those creative deep thinkers,

21:49.260 --> 21:51.500
often slower thinkers.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.700
They think slowly and deeply.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.420
And they often get the idea early on

21:55.420 --> 21:59.100
that they can't be good at maths or other subjects.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.380
So yeah, I think many of those subject people

22:02.380 --> 22:05.220
are the ones who go on and do amazing things.

22:05.220 --> 22:08.340
So there's a guy named Eric Weinstein.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.860
I know many mathematicians like this,

22:09.860 --> 22:14.860
but he talks a lot about having a non-standard way

22:16.100 --> 22:17.740
of learning.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.700
I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,

22:19.700 --> 22:22.100
a lot of great physicists are like that.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.660
And he felt like he became quickly,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.420
he got his PhD at Harvard,

22:26.420 --> 22:28.580
became quickly an outcast of the system.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.220
Like the education, especially early education system

22:32.220 --> 22:33.180
didn't help him.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.860
Is there ways for an education system

22:37.860 --> 22:40.340
to support people like that?

22:40.340 --> 22:42.420
Is it this kind of multi-dimensional learning

22:42.420 --> 22:43.260
that you're mentioning?

22:43.260 --> 22:44.300
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.620
I mean, I think education system

22:46.660 --> 22:48.940
still uses an approach that was in classrooms

22:48.940 --> 22:50.380
hundreds of years ago.

22:50.380 --> 22:53.780
The textbooks have a lot to answer for

22:53.780 --> 22:58.380
in producing this very uninspiring mathematics.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.780
But yeah, if you open up the subject

23:00.780 --> 23:03.020
and have people see and solve it in different ways

23:03.020 --> 23:05.380
and value those different ways.

23:05.380 --> 23:08.140
Somebody I appreciated a lot is a mathematician

23:08.140 --> 23:09.740
called Maryam Mizikhani.

23:09.740 --> 23:10.660
I don't know if you've heard of her.

23:10.660 --> 23:12.540
She won the Fields Medal.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.540
She was from Iran.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.660
First woman in the world to win the Fields Medal

23:16.660 --> 23:17.500
in mathematics.

23:17.500 --> 23:21.300
She died when she was 40, she was at Stanford.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.900
But her work was entirely visual.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.700
And she talked about how her daughter

23:27.700 --> 23:28.820
thought she was an artist

23:28.820 --> 23:30.740
because she was always visualizing.

23:30.740 --> 23:35.740
And I attended, she asked me to chair the PhD defense

23:35.860 --> 23:37.500
for one of her students.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.380
And I went to the defense in the math department.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.500
And it was so interesting

23:41.500 --> 23:45.340
because this young woman spent like two hours

23:45.340 --> 23:46.860
sharing her work.

23:46.860 --> 23:47.860
All of it was visual.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.540
In fact, I don't think I saw any numbers at all.

23:50.540 --> 23:53.500
And I remember that day thinking,

23:53.500 --> 23:55.980
wow, I could have brought her like 13 year old

23:55.980 --> 23:57.060
into this PhD defense.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.340
They would not recognize this as maths.

24:00.340 --> 24:03.820
But when Maryam Mizikhani won the Fields Medal,

24:03.820 --> 24:05.740
all these other mathematicians were saying

24:05.740 --> 24:07.980
that her work had connected

24:07.980 --> 24:11.300
all these previously unconnected areas of maths.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.100
So, but when she was, she also shared

24:15.100 --> 24:17.700
that when she was in school, when she was about 13,

24:17.700 --> 24:21.140
she was told that she couldn't do maths.

24:21.140 --> 24:22.780
She was told that by her teacher.

24:22.780 --> 24:24.060
Is this is Iran?

24:24.060 --> 24:24.900
She grew up in Iran?

24:24.900 --> 24:26.140
In Iran, yeah.

24:26.140 --> 24:27.460
So I love that.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.420
To be told you can't be good at maths

24:29.420 --> 24:33.940
and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.

24:33.940 --> 24:37.220
I've been told by a lot of people in my life

24:37.220 --> 24:38.260
that I can't do something.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.060
I'm very, definitely non-standard.

24:41.020 --> 24:44.380
But all it takes, that's why people talk about

24:44.380 --> 24:46.620
like the one teacher that changed everything for them.

24:46.620 --> 24:47.980
All it takes is one teacher.

24:47.980 --> 24:48.820
That's right.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.340
That's the power of that.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.780
So that should be inspiring to teachers.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.500
I think it is.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.980
You as a single person, given the education system,

24:59.980 --> 25:01.660
given the incentives, you have the power

25:01.660 --> 25:03.220
to truly change lives.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.860
And like 20 years from now,

25:04.860 --> 25:07.980
the Fields Medalists will walk up to you and say thank you.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.340
You did that for me.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.380
Yeah, absolutely.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.180
And I share that with teachers

25:12.180 --> 25:15.580
that even in this broken system

25:15.580 --> 25:19.820
of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,

25:19.820 --> 25:22.940
a single teacher can change kids' maths relationship

25:22.940 --> 25:26.500
or other subjects and forever.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.620
What's the role of the parents in this picture?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.700
Let's go to another difficult subject.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.140
Yeah, that is a difficult subject.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.140
One study found that

25:36.980 --> 25:41.980
the amount of maths anxiety parents had

25:42.820 --> 25:45.460
predicted their child's achievement in school,

25:46.780 --> 25:50.460
but only if they helped with homework.

25:51.340 --> 25:52.740
So...

25:52.740 --> 25:55.900
Oh, that's so funny.

25:55.900 --> 25:59.860
Yeah, there were some interesting implications for this.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.340
I mean, you can see how it works.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.540
If you have maths anxiety

26:02.540 --> 26:03.900
and you're helping your kids with homework,

26:03.900 --> 26:06.300
you're probably communicating things like,

26:06.300 --> 26:08.100
oh, I was terrible at this at school.

26:08.100 --> 26:12.460
And that's how it gets passed on to kids.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.620
So one implication is

26:14.620 --> 26:17.020
if you have a really bad relationship with maths,

26:17.020 --> 26:19.100
you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,

26:19.100 --> 26:22.380
just don't do maths homework with your kids.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.900
But we have on our website,

26:25.900 --> 26:28.540
we have a little sheet for parents

26:28.540 --> 26:32.620
of ways to interact around maths with your kids.

26:32.620 --> 26:33.740
And...

26:33.740 --> 26:36.580
That's ucubed.org?

26:36.580 --> 26:39.340
That's ucubed.org, yes.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.980
So one of the things I say to parents

26:40.980 --> 26:43.020
when I give parent presentations is,

26:43.020 --> 26:44.700
even if you hate maths,

26:44.700 --> 26:46.780
you need to just fake it with your kids.

26:46.780 --> 26:49.980
You should be always endlessly optimistic

26:49.980 --> 26:52.220
and happy about doing maths.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.060
And...

26:54.060 --> 26:55.460
I'm always curious about this.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.900
So I, you know, I hope to have kids one day.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.300
I don't have kids currently.

27:00.140 --> 27:04.140
Are parents okay with like sucking at math

27:04.140 --> 27:06.460
and then trying to get their kid

27:06.460 --> 27:07.900
to be better than them essentially?

27:07.900 --> 27:10.020
Like, is that difficult thing for a lot of parents?

27:10.020 --> 27:10.940
It is difficult.

27:10.940 --> 27:12.860
To have like, it's almost like an ego thing.

27:12.860 --> 27:15.140
Like, I never got good at this

27:15.140 --> 27:16.860
and I probably should have.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.460
And...

27:18.460 --> 27:20.860
Yeah, I mean, to me that you wanna celebrate that,

27:20.860 --> 27:23.860
but I know a lot of people struggle with that,

27:23.860 --> 27:25.940
like coaches in sports,

27:26.220 --> 27:29.700
to make an athlete become better than them,

27:29.700 --> 27:31.780
it can be hard on the ego.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.740
Yeah.

27:32.740 --> 27:35.700
So is that, do you experience the same with parents too?

27:35.700 --> 27:38.540
I think, I mean, I haven't experienced parents worrying

27:38.540 --> 27:40.820
that their kids will be better than them.

27:40.820 --> 27:45.620
I have experienced parents

27:45.620 --> 27:47.940
just having a really bad relationship with maths

27:47.940 --> 27:50.300
and not wanting to help,

27:50.300 --> 27:54.020
not knowing how to help, saying things.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.660
Like another study showed

27:55.660 --> 27:58.140
that when mothers say to their daughters,

27:58.140 --> 28:00.100
I was bad at maths in school,

28:00.100 --> 28:02.460
their daughter's achievement goes down.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.340
So we know that kids pick up on these messages

28:05.340 --> 28:08.420
and which is why I say you should fake it.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.180
But also I know that lots of people

28:10.180 --> 28:12.340
have just had a really bad relationship with maths,

28:12.340 --> 28:15.140
even successful people.

28:15.140 --> 28:17.540
The undergrads I teach at Stanford

28:17.540 --> 28:20.100
have pretty much always done well in maths,

28:21.060 --> 28:24.060
but they come to Stanford thinking maths

28:24.060 --> 28:26.980
is a set of methods to memorize.

28:28.180 --> 28:31.420
And so do many parents believe that.

28:31.420 --> 28:34.300
There's one method that you memorize

28:34.300 --> 28:36.860
and then you reproduce it.

28:36.860 --> 28:40.060
So until people have really had an experience

28:40.060 --> 28:42.260
of what I think of as the other maths,

28:42.260 --> 28:43.700
well, until they've really seen

28:43.700 --> 28:45.500
that it's a really different subject,

28:48.620 --> 28:51.220
it's hard for them to be able to shift their kids

28:51.220 --> 28:52.580
to see it differently.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.060
Is there for a teacher,

28:55.060 --> 28:57.940
if we're to like systematize it,

28:57.940 --> 28:59.820
is there something teachers can do

28:59.820 --> 29:01.420
to do this more effectively?

29:01.420 --> 29:04.060
So you mentioned the textbook.

29:04.060 --> 29:07.740
So what are the additional things you can add

29:07.740 --> 29:11.260
on top of this whole old school traditional way of teaching

29:12.180 --> 29:14.700
that can improve the process?

29:14.700 --> 29:17.580
So I do think there's a way of teaching maths

29:17.580 --> 29:21.660
that changes everything for kids and teachers.

29:21.700 --> 29:25.540
So I'm one of five writers of a new framework

29:25.540 --> 29:27.620
for the state of California, a new maths framework

29:27.620 --> 29:29.300
that's coming out next year.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.300
And we are recommending through this maths framework

29:32.300 --> 29:33.900
that people teach in this way.

29:33.900 --> 29:37.540
It's called teaching to big ideas.

29:38.620 --> 29:42.540
So at the moment people have standards

29:42.540 --> 29:44.500
that have been written and then textbooks

29:44.500 --> 29:45.820
have taken these standards

29:45.820 --> 29:48.900
and made not very good questions.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.500
And if you look at the standards,

29:50.500 --> 29:53.060
like I have some written down here,

29:53.060 --> 29:54.580
just reading the standards,

29:54.580 --> 29:57.820
it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.

29:57.820 --> 30:00.940
What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?

30:00.940 --> 30:03.180
So this is an interesting example.

30:03.180 --> 30:06.180
In third grade, there are three different standards

30:06.180 --> 30:07.700
about unit squares.

30:10.540 --> 30:11.660
Okay.

30:11.660 --> 30:12.660
So this is one of them.

30:12.660 --> 30:16.180
A square with side length one unit called a unit square

30:16.180 --> 30:18.820
is said to have one square unit of area

30:18.820 --> 30:20.580
and can be used to measure area.

30:20.580 --> 30:23.420
And that's something you're expected to learn.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.580
That is something, so that's a standard.

30:25.580 --> 30:26.900
The textbook authors say,

30:26.900 --> 30:28.420
oh, I'm gonna make a question about that.

30:28.420 --> 30:32.140
And they translate the standards into narrow questions.

30:32.140 --> 30:33.300
And then you measure success

30:33.300 --> 30:36.900
by your ability to deliver on these standards.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.260
So the standards themselves, I think of maths

30:40.260 --> 30:41.780
and many people think maths in this way

30:41.780 --> 30:44.740
is a subject of like a few big ideas

30:44.740 --> 30:47.140
and really important connections between them.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.340
So you could think of it as like a network map

30:50.340 --> 30:52.540
of ideas and connections.

30:52.540 --> 30:55.740
And what standards do is they take that beautiful map

30:55.740 --> 30:58.660
and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces

30:58.660 --> 31:00.940
and they deliver the pieces to schools.

31:00.940 --> 31:05.220
And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas

31:05.220 --> 31:06.380
nor do the kids.

31:06.380 --> 31:08.340
So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying

31:08.340 --> 31:11.780
that what we've done in this new initiative

31:11.780 --> 31:16.020
is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas

31:16.100 --> 31:17.540
and connections between them.

31:17.540 --> 31:20.860
So this is a grade three.

31:20.860 --> 31:25.140
So instead of there being 60 standards,

31:25.140 --> 31:29.660
we've said, well, you can pull these different standards

31:29.660 --> 31:32.220
to get in with each other

31:32.220 --> 31:37.220
and also value the ways these are connected.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.860
And by the way, for people who are just listening,

31:39.860 --> 31:44.020
we're looking at a small number of like big concepts

31:44.060 --> 31:47.060
within mathematics, square tiles, measuring,

31:47.060 --> 31:49.100
fraction, shape and time,

31:49.100 --> 31:51.700
and then how they're interconnected.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.060
And so the goal is for, this is for grade three,

31:54.060 --> 31:55.100
for example.

31:55.100 --> 31:59.020
Yeah, and so we've set out for the state of California,

31:59.020 --> 32:02.540
the whole of mathematics K10

32:02.540 --> 32:05.180
as a set of big ideas and connections.

32:05.180 --> 32:08.540
So we know that teachers, it works really well

32:08.540 --> 32:13.540
if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring

32:14.860 --> 32:19.180
and instead of reading five procedural statements

32:19.180 --> 32:21.500
that involve measuring, they think,

32:21.500 --> 32:22.580
okay, measuring is a big idea.

32:22.580 --> 32:25.380
What rich deep activity can I use

32:25.380 --> 32:27.900
that teaches measuring to kids?

32:27.900 --> 32:30.460
And as kids work on these deep rich activities,

32:30.460 --> 32:32.620
maybe over a few days,

32:32.620 --> 32:34.980
turns out a lot of maths comes into it.

32:35.860 --> 32:40.140
So we're recommending that let's not teach maths

32:40.140 --> 32:43.420
according to all these multiple, multiple statements

32:43.420 --> 32:45.620
and lots and lots of short questions.

32:45.620 --> 32:48.100
Instead, let's teach maths by thinking about

32:48.100 --> 32:49.260
what are the big ideas

32:49.260 --> 32:52.260
and what are really rich deep activities

32:52.260 --> 32:53.740
that teach those big ideas.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.620
So that's the, like how you teach it and maximize learning.

32:57.620 --> 33:01.500
What about like from a school district perspective,

33:01.500 --> 33:04.700
like measuring how well you're doing,

33:04.700 --> 33:07.060
grades and tests and stuff like that.

33:07.060 --> 33:08.940
Do you throw those out or is it possible?

33:08.940 --> 33:13.460
I'm not a fan of grades and tests myself.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.940
I think grades are fine

33:15.940 --> 33:18.980
if they're used at the end of a course.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.020
So at the end of my maths course,

33:21.020 --> 33:21.860
I might get a grade

33:21.860 --> 33:24.380
because a grade is meant to be a summative measure.

33:24.380 --> 33:27.700
It kind of describes your summative achievement.

33:27.700 --> 33:31.300
But the problem we have in maths classrooms across the US

33:31.300 --> 33:33.460
is people use grades all the time,

33:33.460 --> 33:36.380
every week or every day even.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.580
My own kids, when they went through high school,

33:38.580 --> 33:40.580
technology has not helped with this.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.820
When they went through high school,

33:41.820 --> 33:42.860
they knew they were being graded

33:42.860 --> 33:45.900
for everything they did, everything.

33:45.900 --> 33:48.140
And not only were they being graded for everything,

33:48.140 --> 33:50.420
but they could see it in the grade book online

33:50.420 --> 33:52.900
and it would alter every class they went into.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.940
So this is the ultimate,

33:54.940 --> 33:57.500
what I think of as a performance culture.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.140
You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you,

34:00.140 --> 34:01.860
you see your score.

34:02.860 --> 34:07.860
So I think that's not conducive for deep learning.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.980
And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,

34:10.980 --> 34:12.460
but during the year,

34:12.460 --> 34:14.940
you can assess kids in much better ways.

34:14.940 --> 34:18.740
Teachers can, a great way of assessing kids

34:18.740 --> 34:22.100
is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines

34:22.100 --> 34:24.020
what they're learning over the course of a unit

34:24.020 --> 34:25.780
or a few weeks.

34:25.780 --> 34:29.020
So kids can actually see the journey they're on.

34:29.020 --> 34:31.140
This is what we're doing mathematically.

34:31.180 --> 34:34.420
Sometimes they self-assess on those units

34:34.420 --> 34:39.420
and then teachers will show what the kids can do

34:40.060 --> 34:42.260
with a rubric and also write notes.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.620
Like, in the next few weeks,

34:43.620 --> 34:46.100
you might like to learn to do this.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.900
So instead of kids just thinking about,

34:49.900 --> 34:51.220
I'm an A kid or a B kid,

34:51.220 --> 34:53.300
or I have this letter attached to me,

34:53.300 --> 34:56.980
they're actually seeing mathematically what's important

34:56.980 --> 34:58.660
and they're involved in the process

34:58.660 --> 35:02.340
of knowing where they are mathematically.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.860
At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,

35:04.860 --> 35:06.300
but during the year,

35:06.300 --> 35:09.260
they get these much more informative measures.

35:10.220 --> 35:14.780
I do think this might be more for college,

35:14.780 --> 35:16.340
but maybe not.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.700
Some of the best classes I've had

35:18.700 --> 35:23.700
is when I got a special, like set aside,

35:23.780 --> 35:27.900
like the professor clearly saw that I was interested

35:27.940 --> 35:29.980
in some aspect of a thing.

35:29.980 --> 35:34.980
And then I have a few in mind, one in particular,

35:35.020 --> 35:38.180
he said that he kind of challenged me.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.420
So this is outside of grades and all of that kind of stuff

35:41.420 --> 35:44.980
that basically it's like reverse psychology.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.300
I don't think this can be done.

35:47.300 --> 35:51.020
And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.

35:51.020 --> 35:54.420
So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.660
But I think that like special treatment

35:57.660 --> 36:01.900
of taking students who are especially like excellent

36:01.900 --> 36:03.540
at a particular little aspect,

36:03.540 --> 36:06.180
do you see their eyes light up?

36:06.180 --> 36:09.500
I often think like maybe it's tempting for a teacher

36:09.500 --> 36:11.740
to think you've already succeeded there,

36:11.740 --> 36:13.460
but they're actually signaling to you

36:13.460 --> 36:17.260
that like you could really launch them on their way.

36:18.620 --> 36:21.660
And I don't know, that's too much to expect from teachers,

36:21.700 --> 36:24.980
I think to pay attention to all of that

36:24.980 --> 36:26.020
because it's really difficult.

36:26.020 --> 36:30.100
But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,

36:30.100 --> 36:32.420
the most important people in the history

36:32.420 --> 36:34.900
of my life of education.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.140
And it's those people that who really didn't just like

36:38.140 --> 36:40.460
inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did,

36:40.460 --> 36:42.740
but also just, they pushed me a little,

36:42.740 --> 36:45.220
like they gave me a little push.

36:45.220 --> 36:47.540
And that requires focusing on the quote unquote

36:47.540 --> 36:51.100
excellent students in the class.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.860
I think what's important though is teachers

36:53.860 --> 36:56.100
to have the perspective that they don't know

36:56.100 --> 36:58.500
who's gonna be excellent at something

36:58.500 --> 37:00.340
before they give out the activity.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.180
Exactly.

37:01.180 --> 37:04.780
And in our camp classes that we ran,

37:05.740 --> 37:10.460
sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.580
And we would say to them,

37:12.580 --> 37:16.900
can you write a question that's like this but different?

37:17.820 --> 37:22.820
And over time we encouraged them to extend things further.

37:24.780 --> 37:26.820
I remember we were doing one activity

37:26.820 --> 37:30.140
where kids were working out the borders of a square

37:30.140 --> 37:33.540
and how big this border would be in different case sizes.

37:33.540 --> 37:36.300
And one of the boys came up at the end of the class

37:36.300 --> 37:38.260
and said, I've been thinking about

37:38.260 --> 37:40.460
how you do this with a pentagon.

37:40.460 --> 37:42.180
And I said, that's fantastic.

37:42.180 --> 37:44.420
How do you, what does it look like with a pentagon?

37:44.420 --> 37:47.220
Go find out, see if you can discover.

37:47.220 --> 37:49.700
So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.740
And I didn't have in my head,

37:52.740 --> 37:55.580
like this is the kid who could have this extension task,

37:55.580 --> 37:58.820
but you can still do that as a teacher.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.340
When kids get excited about something

38:01.340 --> 38:03.180
or they're doing well in something,

38:03.180 --> 38:05.380
have them extend it, go further.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.020
It's great.

38:07.020 --> 38:10.500
And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,

38:11.700 --> 38:13.940
you could say it in different ways to different students.

38:14.340 --> 38:18.660
For me, the right thing to say is almost to say,

38:18.660 --> 38:21.540
I don't think you could do this, this is too hard.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.180
That's what I need to hear.

38:23.180 --> 38:26.340
It's like, no, there's immediate push.

38:26.340 --> 38:29.220
But with some people, if they're a little bit more,

38:29.220 --> 38:31.220
I mean, it all has to do with upbringing,

38:31.220 --> 38:33.220
how your genetics is.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.380
They might be much more, that might break them.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.740
Yeah, that might break them.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.380
So you have to be also sensitive to that.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.740
I mean, teaching is really difficult.

38:39.740 --> 38:41.180
It is really difficult.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.260
For this very reason.

38:42.260 --> 38:43.260
It is.

38:43.260 --> 38:47.780
So what is the best way to teach math,

38:47.780 --> 38:50.780
to learn math at those early few days

38:50.780 --> 38:52.540
when you just want to capture them?

38:53.740 --> 38:54.820
I do something.

38:54.820 --> 38:58.220
Actually, there's a video of me doing this on our website

38:58.220 --> 39:03.220
that I love when I first meet students.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.340
This is what I do.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.060
I show them a picture.

39:06.060 --> 39:08.300
This is the picture I show them.

39:08.300 --> 39:11.020
And it's a picture of seven dots like this.

39:11.740 --> 39:15.140
And I show it for just a few seconds.

39:15.140 --> 39:15.980
And I say to them,

39:15.980 --> 39:17.700
I'd like you to tell me how many dots there are,

39:17.700 --> 39:19.180
but I don't want you to count them.

39:19.180 --> 39:21.780
I want you to group the dots and I show it them.

39:21.780 --> 39:24.180
And then I take it away

39:24.180 --> 39:27.100
before they've even had enough time to count them.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.780
And then I asked them, so how did you see it?

39:29.780 --> 39:34.780
And I go around the room and amazingly enough,

39:35.020 --> 39:36.980
there's probably 18 different ways

39:36.980 --> 39:39.260
of seeing these seven dots.

39:39.260 --> 39:42.300
And so I asked people, tell me how you grouped it.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.380
And some people see it as like an outside hole

39:44.380 --> 39:45.740
with a center dot.

39:45.740 --> 39:49.300
Some people see like stripes of lines.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.820
Some people see segments.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.820
And I collect them all and I put them on the board.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.500
And at the end, I say, look at this.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.300
We are a class of 30 kids

39:57.300 --> 40:00.300
and we saw these seven dots in 18 different ways.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.940
There's actually a mathematical term for this.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.780
It's called groupitizing.

40:03.780 --> 40:04.780
Groupitizing?

40:04.780 --> 40:05.620
Yeah.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.780
I like it.

40:06.780 --> 40:07.620
It's kind of cool.

40:07.620 --> 40:11.860
So turns out though, that how well you groupitize

40:11.860 --> 40:15.580
predicts how well you do in maths.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.180
Is it a raw talent

40:18.180 --> 40:20.220
or is it just something that you can develop?

40:20.220 --> 40:22.660
I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think,

40:22.660 --> 40:27.340
but some kids have developed that ability, if you like,

40:27.340 --> 40:29.020
and you can learn it.

40:29.020 --> 40:34.140
So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.660
that we think to tell whether a kid's good at maths,

40:36.660 --> 40:40.660
we're going to give them a speed test on multiples.

40:40.660 --> 40:43.940
But actually seeing how kids group dots

40:43.940 --> 40:46.180
could be a more important assessment

40:46.180 --> 40:48.260
of how well they're going to do maths.

40:48.260 --> 40:49.620
Anyway, I diverge.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.340
What I like to do though, when I start off with kids

40:52.340 --> 40:54.620
is show them, I'm going to give you maths problems.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.140
I'm going to value the different ways you see them.

40:57.140 --> 40:59.900
And turns out you can do this kind of problem

40:59.900 --> 41:03.100
asking people how they group dots with young children

41:03.100 --> 41:05.500
or with graduate students.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.220
And it's engaging for all of them.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.180
You talk about creativity a little bit

41:12.180 --> 41:15.180
and flexibility in your book, Limitless.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.780
What's the role of that?

41:16.780 --> 41:19.780
So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing

41:19.780 --> 41:22.660
involved in groupitizing.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.620
Yeah, yeah.

41:24.620 --> 41:25.700
I love this term.

41:25.700 --> 41:28.580
So what would you say is the role of creativity

41:28.580 --> 41:31.340
and flexibility in the learning of math?

41:31.340 --> 41:34.100
I think what we know now is that

41:34.100 --> 41:37.820
what we need for this 21st century world we live in

41:39.100 --> 41:40.540
is a flexible mind.

41:41.820 --> 41:43.620
It's, school should not really be about

41:43.620 --> 41:45.540
teaching kids particular methods,

41:45.540 --> 41:49.500
but teaching them to approach problems with flexibility.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.860
Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.

41:52.860 --> 41:55.660
So people don't think the words maths

41:55.660 --> 41:58.220
and creativity come together,

41:58.220 --> 42:00.300
but that's what I love about maths

42:00.300 --> 42:02.900
is the creative different ways you can see it.

42:02.900 --> 42:06.100
And so, Helping Our Kids,

42:06.100 --> 42:10.940
there's a book I like a lot, it's been by physicists.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.900
You probably know this book called Elastic.

42:13.900 --> 42:14.900
You might know it.

42:15.780 --> 42:18.420
And it's about how we want elastic minds.

42:18.420 --> 42:21.460
Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds.

42:21.460 --> 42:26.460
And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.

42:26.780 --> 42:31.740
They do a lot of developing the kind of mind

42:31.740 --> 42:35.300
that a computer now does for us.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.540
Memorization.

42:36.540 --> 42:40.460
Memorization, doing procedures,

42:40.460 --> 42:45.340
a lot of things that we spend a lot of time in school on.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.500
In the world, when kids leave school,

42:47.500 --> 42:49.540
a computer will do that.

42:49.540 --> 42:52.540
And better than they will.

42:52.540 --> 42:54.860
But that creative, flexible thinking,

42:54.860 --> 42:57.140
we're kind of at ground zero at computers

42:57.140 --> 42:59.500
being able to engage in that thinking.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.900
Maybe we're a little above ground zero,

43:00.900 --> 43:05.780
but the human brain is perfectly suited

43:05.780 --> 43:07.540
for that creative, flexible thinking.

43:07.540 --> 43:09.860
That's what humans are so great at.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.060
So I would like the balance to shift in schools.

43:12.060 --> 43:15.140
Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,

43:15.140 --> 43:16.700
but there should be a lot more

43:16.700 --> 43:18.860
of that creative, flexible thinking.

43:20.180 --> 43:23.980
And what's the role of other humans in this picture?

43:23.980 --> 43:27.340
So collaborative learning.

43:27.340 --> 43:29.420
So brainstorming together.

43:29.420 --> 43:33.780
So creativity as it emerges from the collective intelligence

43:33.780 --> 43:34.620
of multiple humans.

43:34.620 --> 43:36.540
Yeah, super important.

43:36.540 --> 43:40.620
And we know that also helps develop your brain,

43:40.620 --> 43:42.340
that social side of thinking.

43:42.340 --> 43:44.940
And I love mathematics collaboration,

43:44.940 --> 43:47.580
where people build on each other's ideas

43:47.580 --> 43:49.780
and they come up with amazing things.

43:49.780 --> 43:54.100
I actually taught a hundred students calculus

43:54.100 --> 43:56.900
at Stanford recently, undergrads.

43:56.900 --> 43:59.460
And we taught them to collaborate.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.300
So these students came in Stanford

44:01.300 --> 44:04.660
and most of them were against collaboration in maths.

44:04.660 --> 44:06.260
This is before COVID in person?

44:06.260 --> 44:08.340
Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.

44:08.340 --> 44:10.260
It was 2019.

44:10.260 --> 44:12.100
And this summer.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.300
So you said they're against such a way.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.780
Yeah, so it's really interesting.

44:16.780 --> 44:20.180
So they'd only experienced maths individually

44:20.180 --> 44:22.100
in a kind of competitive individual way.

44:22.100 --> 44:24.700
And if they had experienced it as group work,

44:24.700 --> 44:26.580
it had been a bad experience.

44:26.740 --> 44:28.860
Maybe they were the one who did it all

44:28.860 --> 44:31.540
and the others didn't do much.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.180
So they were kind of against collaboration.

44:33.180 --> 44:35.140
They didn't see any role for it in maths.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.500
And we taught them to collaborate.

44:38.460 --> 44:42.180
And it was hard work because as well as the fact

44:42.180 --> 44:43.580
that they were kind of against collaboration,

44:43.580 --> 44:48.500
they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.

44:48.500 --> 44:51.500
So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads

44:51.500 --> 44:53.540
and they're better than me.

44:53.540 --> 44:55.820
So when we set them to work on a maths problem together,

44:55.820 --> 44:57.260
the first one was kind of a disaster

44:57.260 --> 44:59.260
because they were all like, they're better than me.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.500
They're faster than me.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.660
They came up with something I didn't come up with.

45:02.660 --> 45:05.980
So we taught them to let go of that thinking

45:05.980 --> 45:08.620
and to work well together.

45:08.620 --> 45:10.020
And one of the things we did,

45:10.020 --> 45:12.580
we decided we wanted to do a pre and post test

45:12.580 --> 45:13.500
at the end of this teaching.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.780
It was only four weeks long,

45:15.780 --> 45:17.220
but we knew we didn't want to give them

45:17.220 --> 45:19.340
like a time test of individual work.

45:19.340 --> 45:23.740
So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning.

45:23.740 --> 45:26.220
And we gave them to do in pairs together.

45:26.220 --> 45:28.620
And we gave each of them a different colored pen

45:28.620 --> 45:31.060
and said, work on this activity together

45:31.060 --> 45:33.060
and keep using that pen.

45:33.060 --> 45:35.180
So then we had all these pieces of student work.

45:35.180 --> 45:37.580
And what we saw was they just worked

45:37.580 --> 45:39.220
on separate parts of the paper.

45:40.180 --> 45:42.060
So there's little like red pen section

45:42.060 --> 45:43.740
and a green pen section.

45:43.740 --> 45:45.940
And they didn't do that well on it.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.100
Even though it was a problem

45:48.100 --> 45:49.820
that middle or high school kids could do,

45:49.820 --> 45:52.700
but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.060
And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,

45:55.060 --> 45:56.220
gave them the same colors

45:56.220 --> 45:59.220
and actually they had learned to collaborate.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.260
And not only were they collaborating

46:01.260 --> 46:02.140
the second time around,

46:02.140 --> 46:04.060
but that boosted their achievement.

46:04.060 --> 46:07.860
And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.

46:07.860 --> 46:10.260
Collaboration is important having people

46:10.260 --> 46:12.540
and what was so eyeopening for these undergrads

46:12.540 --> 46:15.380
and they talked about it in lovely ways

46:15.380 --> 46:19.980
was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem.

46:19.980 --> 46:21.580
And I learned to value

46:21.580 --> 46:24.340
that other people saw it in different ways.

46:24.340 --> 46:29.340
And it was quite a big experience for them

46:29.500 --> 46:31.740
that they came out thinking,

46:31.740 --> 46:33.660
I can do maths with other people.

46:33.660 --> 46:34.860
People can see it differently.

46:34.860 --> 46:38.340
We can build on each other's ways of thinking.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.540
I got a chance to,

46:39.540 --> 46:42.020
I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,

46:42.020 --> 46:44.100
got a chance to interact with him.

46:44.100 --> 46:46.940
And like the first, cause he had a few,

46:46.940 --> 46:49.580
but one famous collaboration

46:49.580 --> 46:52.980
throughout his life with Tversky.

46:52.980 --> 46:57.980
And just like, he hasn't met me before in person,

46:58.580 --> 47:01.300
but just the number of questions he was asking,

47:01.300 --> 47:03.180
just the curiosity.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.420
So I think one of the skills,

47:05.420 --> 47:07.980
the collaboration itself is a skill.

47:07.980 --> 47:10.780
And I remember my experience with him was like,

47:10.780 --> 47:14.060
okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration

47:14.060 --> 47:17.500
because he was just extremely good at listening

47:17.500 --> 47:21.460
and genuine curiosity about how the other person

47:21.460 --> 47:23.420
thinks about the world, sees the world.

47:23.420 --> 47:27.460
And then together he pulled me in in that particular case.

47:27.460 --> 47:29.620
He doesn't know in particular

47:29.620 --> 47:31.220
that much about autonomous vehicles,

47:31.220 --> 47:34.580
but he kept asking all of these questions.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.420
And then like 10 minutes in,

47:36.420 --> 47:37.700
we're together trying to solve

47:37.700 --> 47:39.940
the problem of autonomous driving.

47:39.940 --> 47:43.900
And that's really fulfilling, that's really enriching,

47:44.740 --> 47:46.700
but it also in that moment made me realize

47:46.700 --> 47:48.180
it's kind of a skill,

47:48.180 --> 47:50.740
is you have to kind of put your ego aside,

47:50.740 --> 47:52.500
put your view of the world aside

47:52.500 --> 47:55.780
and try to learn how the other person sees it.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.580
And the other thing you have to put aside

47:57.580 --> 48:00.700
is this social comparison thinking.

48:00.700 --> 48:03.300
If you are sitting there thinking,

48:03.300 --> 48:04.860
wow, that was an amazing idea,

48:04.860 --> 48:06.660
he's so much better than I am,

48:06.660 --> 48:10.020
that's really gonna stop you taking on

48:10.020 --> 48:12.220
the value of that idea.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.300
And so there's a lot of that going on

48:14.300 --> 48:17.460
between these Stanford students when they came.

48:17.460 --> 48:21.980
And trying to help them let go of that.

48:21.980 --> 48:24.300
One of the things I've discovered,

48:24.300 --> 48:27.380
just because being a little bit more in the public eye,

48:27.380 --> 48:31.260
how rewarding it is to celebrate others.

48:31.260 --> 48:35.820
And how much it's going to actually pay off in the long term.

48:35.820 --> 48:38.220
So this kind of silo thinking of like,

48:38.220 --> 48:41.260
I want to prove to a small set of people around me

48:41.260 --> 48:45.340
that I'm really smart and do so

48:45.340 --> 48:47.500
by basically not celebrating

48:47.500 --> 48:48.820
how smart the other people are.

48:48.820 --> 48:51.540
That's actually maybe short term,

48:51.540 --> 48:53.020
it seems like a good strategy,

48:53.020 --> 48:54.580
but long term it's not.

48:54.580 --> 48:56.500
And I think if you practice at the student level

48:56.500 --> 48:58.900
and then at the career at every single stage,

48:58.900 --> 49:00.540
I think that's ultimately.

49:00.540 --> 49:01.380
I agree with you,

49:01.380 --> 49:04.460
I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.

49:04.460 --> 49:08.300
You mentioned textbooks and you didn't say it,

49:11.300 --> 49:15.420
maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics,

49:15.420 --> 49:17.300
but I love textbooks.

49:17.300 --> 49:19.900
They're like pretty pictures and they smell nice.

49:19.900 --> 49:21.660
I mean, I talk about like physical.

49:21.660 --> 49:25.420
Some of my greatest experiences have been just like,

49:25.420 --> 49:27.300
because they're really well done

49:27.300 --> 49:30.460
when we're talking about basic like high school,

49:30.460 --> 49:34.140
calculus, biology, chemistry.

49:34.140 --> 49:36.860
Those are like, those are incredible.

49:36.860 --> 49:40.340
It's like Wikipedia, but with color and nice little stuff.

49:40.340 --> 49:41.980
You must have seen some good textbooks

49:41.980 --> 49:44.580
if they had pretty pictures and color.

49:44.580 --> 49:46.260
Yeah, I mean, I remember,

49:46.260 --> 49:49.260
I guess it was very, very standard,

49:49.260 --> 49:53.540
like AP calculus, AP biology, AP chemistry.

49:53.540 --> 49:56.140
I felt those are like some of the happiest days of my life

49:56.140 --> 49:58.100
in terms of learning was high school,

49:58.100 --> 50:00.820
because it was very easy, honestly.

50:02.020 --> 50:03.300
It felt hard at the time,

50:03.300 --> 50:07.140
but you're basically doing a world-win tour

50:07.140 --> 50:08.500
of all the science.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.460
Yeah, yeah.

50:09.740 --> 50:12.220
Without having to pick, you do literature,

50:12.220 --> 50:16.740
you do like Shakespeare, calculus, biology, physics,

50:17.700 --> 50:19.100
chemistry, what else?

50:19.100 --> 50:23.580
Anatomy, physiology, computer science,

50:23.580 --> 50:26.780
without like, nobody's telling you what to do with your life.

50:26.780 --> 50:28.100
You're just doing all of those things.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.740
That's a good thing, you're right.

50:29.740 --> 50:32.500
But I remember the textbooks weren't,

50:32.500 --> 50:35.460
I mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past,

50:35.460 --> 50:38.700
but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good.

50:38.940 --> 50:42.060
So you think, what role do you think they play still?

50:42.060 --> 50:45.540
And like in this more modern digital age,

50:45.540 --> 50:47.780
what's the best materials

50:47.780 --> 50:50.100
with which to do these kinds of educations?

50:50.100 --> 50:52.900
Well, I'm intrigued that you had such a good experience

50:52.900 --> 50:53.740
with textbooks.

50:53.740 --> 50:56.820
I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks

50:56.820 --> 50:59.540
I had when I was learning, and I loved books.

50:59.540 --> 51:03.100
I loved to pick up books and look through them.

51:03.100 --> 51:06.580
But a lot of maths textbooks

51:06.580 --> 51:08.980
are not good experiences for kids.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.940
We have a video on our website

51:12.940 --> 51:14.140
of the kids who came to our camp,

51:14.140 --> 51:15.660
and one of the students says,

51:16.540 --> 51:18.860
in maths, you have to follow the textbook.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.580
The textbook is kind of like the Bible.

51:20.580 --> 51:22.460
You have to follow it.

51:22.460 --> 51:25.980
And every day, it's slightly different.

51:25.980 --> 51:28.820
Like on Monday, you do 2.3.2,

51:28.820 --> 51:32.540
and on Tuesday, you do 2.3.3, and on Wednesday.

51:32.540 --> 51:35.140
And you never go off that.

51:35.140 --> 51:37.900
That's like every single day.

51:37.900 --> 51:42.580
And that's not inspiring for a lot of the kids.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.460
So one of the things they loved about our camp

51:45.460 --> 51:46.900
was just that there were no books.

51:46.900 --> 51:50.740
Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,

51:50.740 --> 51:53.100
they still felt more free

51:53.100 --> 51:55.180
because they weren't just like trotting

51:55.180 --> 51:58.100
through exercises, exercises.

51:58.100 --> 51:59.540
So-

51:59.540 --> 52:02.100
Like what a textbook allows you is like,

52:02.100 --> 52:06.660
you're, the very thing you said they might not like,

52:06.660 --> 52:11.140
the 2.3, 2., it feels like you're making progress.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.780
And like it's little celebrations

52:12.780 --> 52:16.220
because you do the problem and it seems really hard

52:16.220 --> 52:17.340
and you don't know how to do it.

52:17.340 --> 52:20.980
And then you try and try and then eventually succeed.

52:20.980 --> 52:23.660
Then you make that little step and further progress.

52:23.660 --> 52:26.180
And then you get to the end of a chapter

52:26.180 --> 52:28.060
and you get to like, it's closure.

52:28.060 --> 52:29.900
You're like, all right, I got that figured out.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.380
And then you go on to the next chapter.

52:31.380 --> 52:32.300
I can see that.

52:32.300 --> 52:34.940
I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.

52:34.940 --> 52:39.020
You can have a good experience with a textbook,

52:39.020 --> 52:43.220
but what's really important is what is in that textbook.

52:43.220 --> 52:45.340
What are you doing inside it?

52:45.340 --> 52:47.940
And I mean, I grew up in England

52:47.940 --> 52:50.500
and in England we learn maths.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.420
We don't have this separation of algebra and geometry.

52:54.420 --> 52:56.180
And I don't think any other country

52:56.180 --> 52:58.260
apart from the US has that.

52:58.260 --> 53:01.260
But I look at kids in algebra classes

53:02.140 --> 53:02.980
where they're doing algebra for a year.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.900
And I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.

53:08.460 --> 53:13.100
By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?

53:13.100 --> 53:18.100
Why do British folks call mathematics maths?

53:20.020 --> 53:21.620
Why is it the plural?

53:21.620 --> 53:23.180
Is it because of everything you're saying

53:23.180 --> 53:25.220
or it's a bunch of sub-disciplines?

53:25.220 --> 53:30.220
Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be the,

53:32.260 --> 53:35.100
the different maths that you look at,

53:35.100 --> 53:38.020
whether you think of that as topics

53:38.020 --> 53:39.780
like geometry and probability,

53:39.780 --> 53:44.780
or I think of it as maths is just multi-dimensional

53:45.180 --> 53:48.700
lots of ways, but that's why it was called mathematics.

53:48.700 --> 53:50.500
And then it was shortened to maths.

53:50.500 --> 53:53.340
And then for some reason it was just math in the US.

53:53.340 --> 53:58.340
But to me, math has that more singular feel to it.

53:58.460 --> 54:01.100
And there's an expression here,

54:01.940 --> 54:02.780
which is do the math,

54:02.780 --> 54:05.220
which basically means do a calculation.

54:05.220 --> 54:07.460
That's what people mean by do the math.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.340
So I don't like that expression

54:09.340 --> 54:11.220
because no math could be anything.

54:11.220 --> 54:12.460
It doesn't have to be a calculation.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.580
And so, yeah, I like maths

54:14.580 --> 54:17.300
because it has more of that broad feel to it.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.180
Yeah, I love that maths kind of emphasizes

54:19.180 --> 54:21.420
the multi-dimensional, like variety of different,

54:21.420 --> 54:23.700
the sub-disciplines, different approaches.

54:23.700 --> 54:25.860
Yeah, okay.

54:27.300 --> 54:28.660
But outside of the textbook,

54:28.700 --> 54:33.700
what do you see like broadly being used?

54:33.700 --> 54:34.940
You mentioned Sebastian Thrun

54:34.940 --> 54:37.940
and MOOCs, online education.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.500
Do you think that's an effective set?

54:39.500 --> 54:40.980
Can be.

54:40.980 --> 54:45.100
I mean, online, having great teachers online

54:45.100 --> 54:48.140
obviously extends those teachers to many more people.

54:48.140 --> 54:49.820
And that's a wonderful thing.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.300
I have quite a few online courses myself.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.300
I got the bug working with Sebastian

54:56.300 --> 54:59.820
when he had released his first MOOC.

54:59.820 --> 55:02.180
And I thought, hmm, maybe I could do one

55:02.180 --> 55:03.500
in maths education.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.460
And I didn't know if anybody would take it.

55:06.460 --> 55:08.460
I remember releasing it that first summer

55:08.460 --> 55:09.940
and it was a free online class

55:09.940 --> 55:13.820
and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer.

55:13.820 --> 55:16.060
And they were all talking about it with each other

55:16.060 --> 55:16.940
and sharing it.

55:16.940 --> 55:18.100
And it was like, took off.

55:18.100 --> 55:23.100
In fact, it was that MOOC that got me to create U-Cubed

55:24.100 --> 55:26.740
with Cathy Williams, who's the co-founder

55:26.740 --> 55:30.060
because people took the MOOC and then they said,

55:30.060 --> 55:32.060
okay, what now?

55:32.060 --> 55:34.460
I finished, what can I have next?

55:34.460 --> 55:36.660
And so that was where we made our website.

55:36.660 --> 55:40.420
But so yeah, I think online education can be great.

55:40.420 --> 55:45.260
I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy.

55:45.260 --> 55:47.380
They're just a talking head.

55:47.380 --> 55:52.460
And you can actually engage people in more active ways

55:52.700 --> 55:54.900
even in online learning.

55:54.900 --> 55:57.780
So I learned from the Udacity principle

55:57.780 --> 55:59.180
when I was working at Udacity,

55:59.180 --> 56:02.180
never to talk more than like five minutes.

56:02.180 --> 56:05.780
And then to ask people to do something.

56:05.780 --> 56:09.780
So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have

56:09.780 --> 56:12.460
is a little bit of presenting something

56:12.460 --> 56:15.140
and then people do something and there's a little bit more

56:15.140 --> 56:17.180
because I think if you have a half hour video,

56:17.180 --> 56:20.980
you just switch off and start doing other things.

56:20.980 --> 56:24.780
So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute,

56:24.780 --> 56:29.740
like a bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps.

56:29.740 --> 56:31.140
And then there's like a quiz almost.

56:31.140 --> 56:33.100
Then you answer a question, yeah.

56:33.100 --> 56:35.980
No, that's really effective.

56:35.980 --> 56:37.060
You mentioned YouCubed.

56:37.060 --> 56:37.980
So what's the mission?

56:37.980 --> 56:38.820
What's the goal?

56:38.820 --> 56:40.260
You mentioned how it started,

56:40.260 --> 56:44.700
but what's, yeah, where are you at now?

56:44.700 --> 56:46.620
And what do you, what's your dream with it?

56:46.620 --> 56:48.260
What are the kind of things

56:48.260 --> 56:50.460
that people should go and check out on there?

56:50.460 --> 56:52.380
Yeah, we started YouCubed,

56:52.380 --> 56:54.140
I guess it was about five years ago now

56:54.140 --> 56:57.340
and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site.

56:57.340 --> 56:59.420
So I'm very happy about that.

56:59.420 --> 57:03.860
And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching

57:03.860 --> 57:08.020
with teachers, students, parents in maths.

57:08.020 --> 57:10.660
And to help, we have a sort of sub goal

57:10.660 --> 57:13.260
of erasing maths anxiety, that's important to us,

57:13.260 --> 57:17.900
but also to share maths as this beautiful creative subject.

57:17.900 --> 57:21.380
And it's been really great.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.820
We have lessons on the site,

57:23.820 --> 57:26.900
but one of the reasons I thought this was needed

57:26.900 --> 57:29.580
is there's a lot of knowledge in the academy

57:29.580 --> 57:30.700
about how to teach maths.

57:30.700 --> 57:34.460
Well, loads and loads of research and journals

57:34.460 --> 57:38.340
and lots of things written up, but teachers don't read it.

57:38.340 --> 57:41.100
They don't have access to it.

57:41.100 --> 57:43.220
They're often behind pay walls.

57:43.220 --> 57:46.460
They're written in really inaccessible ways.

57:46.460 --> 57:49.260
So people wouldn't want to read them or understand them.

57:49.260 --> 57:51.140
So this actually is a big problem.

57:51.140 --> 57:53.740
You have this whole industry of people

57:53.740 --> 57:55.700
finding out how to teach well,

57:55.700 --> 57:58.740
not sharing it with the people who are teaching.

57:58.740 --> 58:01.380
So that's why we made YouCubed.

58:01.380 --> 58:03.620
And instead of just putting articles up saying,

58:03.620 --> 58:05.780
here's some things to read about how to teach well,

58:05.780 --> 58:08.220
we translated what was coming from research

58:08.220 --> 58:10.500
into things that teacher could use.

58:10.500 --> 58:13.580
So lessons, there were videos to show kids

58:13.580 --> 58:16.380
and there were tips for parents.

58:16.380 --> 58:17.940
There were all sorts of things on the site.

58:17.940 --> 58:22.940
And it's been amazing as we took inspiration

58:23.580 --> 58:24.820
from the week of code,

58:24.820 --> 58:29.500
which got teachers to focus on coding for a week.

58:29.500 --> 58:33.860
And we have this thing called the week of inspirational maths.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.780
And we say, just try it for a week.

58:35.780 --> 58:39.340
Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.620
And so it's been downloaded millions of times.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.580
Teachers use it every year.

58:44.620 --> 58:46.540
They start the school year with it.

58:46.540 --> 58:49.660
And what they tell us is it was amazing.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.780
The kids lights were on, they were excited.

58:51.780 --> 58:52.980
They loved it.

58:52.980 --> 58:56.020
And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks

58:56.020 --> 59:00.020
and the lights went out and they were not interested.

59:00.020 --> 59:04.180
Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful.

59:04.180 --> 59:05.020
It is.

59:05.020 --> 59:09.900
I wish, what I would love is if we could actually extend

59:09.900 --> 59:11.660
that for the whole year.

59:11.660 --> 59:13.980
We're a small team at Stanford

59:13.980 --> 59:17.060
and we're trying to keep up with great things

59:17.060 --> 59:18.300
to put on the site.

59:19.700 --> 59:22.540
We haven't the capacity to produce

59:22.540 --> 59:24.220
these creative visual maths tasks

59:24.220 --> 59:25.860
for every year group for every day,

59:25.860 --> 59:27.180
but I would love to do that.

59:27.180 --> 59:28.620
How difficult is it to do?

59:28.620 --> 59:33.620
I mean, it's to come up with visual formulations

59:34.700 --> 59:39.100
of these big important topics you need to think about

59:39.140 --> 59:43.420
in a way that you could teach.

59:43.420 --> 59:44.820
I mean, we can do it.

59:44.820 --> 59:47.460
We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths

59:47.460 --> 59:52.020
and we made K-8 maths books with exactly that.

59:52.020 --> 59:54.980
Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.

59:54.980 --> 59:56.620
We just finished the last one.

59:56.620 --> 59:59.020
We've been doing it for five years

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.700
and it's been exhausting and we just finished.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.620
So now there's a whole K-8 set of books

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.180
and they're organized in that way.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.380
These are the big ideas.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.340
Here are rich, deep activities.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:16.100
They're not though what you can do every day for a year.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.100
So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.060
to their boring textbook.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.420
And some people have said, okay, this is the year.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.500
This book tells us what the year is

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.220
and then we'll supplement these big activities with.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.460
So they're being used and teachers really like them

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.260
and are really happy about them.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.500
I just always want more.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.260
And I guess one of the things I would like for U-Cubed,

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.620
one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.500
knows about U-Cubed.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.500
At the moment, a lot of teachers who come to us

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.820
are really happy they found it,

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.220
but there's a lot of other teachers

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.620
who don't know that it exists.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.940
I hope this helps.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.980
Yeah.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.460
From a student perspective and not in the classroom,

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:04.460
but at home studying, is there some advice you can give?

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.860
On how to best study mathematics?

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.660
So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.700
Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.740
when they review material,

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.340
whether it's maths or anything else,

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.580
don't do it in the best way.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.140
I think a problem a lot of people have is they read through

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:28.580
maybe a teacher's explanation or a way of doing maths

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.980
and it makes sense and they think, oh yeah, I've got that.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.820
And they move forward.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.420
But then it's not until you come to try and work on something

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.820
and do a problem that you actually realise

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.060
you didn't really understand it,

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.460
just seemed to make sense.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.020
So I would say this is also something

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.180
that New York scientists talk about,

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.980
to keep giving yourself questions

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.220
is a really good way to study,

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.900
rather than looking through lots of material.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.540
It's always like giving yourself lots of tests

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.900
and trying to figure out how to do it.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.540
Giving yourself lots of tests

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.420
is a good way to actually deeply understand things

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.620
and know what you do when you don't understand.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.460
So would the questions be in the form of

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.500
the material you're reviewing is the answer to that question?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.100
Or is it almost like beyond,

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.940
it's the polygon thing you mentioned for a square?

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:22.820
Is it almost like, I wonder, what is the bigger picture?

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.220
I was kind of asking how is this extended and so on.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.740
Yeah, that would be great.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.220
And it's a similar,

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.500
I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.980
What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.980
And one of the recommendations I give

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:41.980
is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.100
but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.740
Like, what was the big idea you learned today?

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.940
Or what did you find difficult?

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.500
What did you struggle with?

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.500
What was something that was exciting?

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.140
Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.460
in a deeper way.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.540
A lot of times, I don't know if you had this experience

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.700
as a math student, lots of people do.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.820
Kids are going through maths questions,

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.940
they're successful, they get them right,

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.980
but they don't even really know what they're about.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.220
And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that,

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.220
doing lots of questions,

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.980
but they're really knowing what even the topic is

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.460
or what it's about, what it's important for.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.780
So having students go back and think at the end of a day,

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.660
what was the big idea from this maths lesson?

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.340
Why is it important?

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.060
Where would I find that in real life?

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.740
Those are really good questions for kids

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.980
to be thinking about.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.420
It's probably for everybody to be thinking about.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.380
I think most of us go through life

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.220
never asking the bigger question.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.500
Always those layers of why questions that kids ask

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.980
when they're very young.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.980
We need to keep doing that.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.820
We do.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.420
Whatever the term is, you call first principles thinking,

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.380
some people call it that, which is like,

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.540
why are we doing it this way?

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.740
So one nice thing is to do that

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.380
because there's usually a good answer.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.380
The reason we did it this way

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.780
is because it works for this reason.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.620
But then if you want to do something totally novel,

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.220
you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.620
because of historical reasons,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.540
but really this is not the best way to do it.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.220
There might be other ways.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.460
And that's how invention happens.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.540
And then you get, you know,

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.340
that's really useful in every aspect of life,

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:42.380
like choosing your career, choosing your,

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.820
I don't know, where you live,

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.740
who your romantic partner is, everything.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.940
Everything, yeah.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.220
And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.340
That would be good if we started doing that.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.020
I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.820
for most of my education, asking why,

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.220
except for later, much later in the subjects

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.300
on like grad school when you're doing research on them.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.700
When your first task or doing something novel using this

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.020
or solving a problem really outside the classroom,

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:20.860
they have to publish on it.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.260
It's the first time you think, wait,

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:27.100
why are these things interesting, useful?

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.460
Which are the things that are useful?

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.700
And yeah, I guess that would be nice

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:35.300
if we did that much earlier, that the quest of invention.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.700
I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:44.620
I think about is the questions kids ask in school

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.620
goes down like in a linear progression

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.460
from in the early years,

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.820
you can't stop kids asking those questions,

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.780
but they learn not to ask the questions.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.060
I think you told somewhere about an early memory

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.740
you had in your own education where you asked the question,

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.340
or maybe that was an example you gave,

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.500
but it was shut down.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.940
Oh, yeah.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.940
You've listened to something I said, yeah.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.340
I don't remember where it was,

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.220
but it caught me.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.700
Yeah, I remember it really vividly.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.860
Well, can you tell the memory?

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.820
Yeah, it's funny I can remember.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.980
It must've really impacted me in that moment

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.300
because you know how there's lots of hours of school

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.260
you don't remember at all.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.260
But anyway, I can remember where I was sitting

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.100
and everything.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.380
I was in a high school maths class,

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.300
although they don't call it that in England,

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:39.060
and the teacher said,

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.980
and it was like the first class of this teacher's class,

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.460
and he said, ask if you have any questions.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.900
So at one point, I put my hand up and I said,

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.340
I have a question, and he said something like,

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.580
that's your question?

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.940
And I was like, okay, I'm not asking any more questions

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.780
in this class.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.020
And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna,

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.100
the lesson you learned from that is I'm not gonna ask.

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.060
Yeah, that was absolutely the lesson I asked.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.420
That's the last question I'm asking.

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:11.420
And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.780
I remember that really well.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.140
So maybe because of that experience,

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.500
one of the things we encourage when we teach kids

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.260
is asking questions, and we value it

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.100
when they ask questions,

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.820
and we put them up on walls and celebrate.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.460
It's funny, because I wish there was a feedback signal

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:35.140
because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.540
he probably didn't realize the negative impact

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.820
he's had in that moment, right?

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.260
If he only knew, see, this is probably

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.180
when you're more mature in grad school.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.020
He had an amazing professor named Alisha Kafande

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.740
in computer science.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.300
And he would encourage questions,

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.500
but then he would tell everybody

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.340
how dumb their questions are.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:57.420
But it was, I guess, if you show,

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.820
if you say it with love and respect behind it,

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.780
then it's more like a friendly, humorous encouragement

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.460
for more questions.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.380
It's an art, right?

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.140
Yeah, teaching is very hard.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.300
You have to time it right,

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.180
because that kind of humor is probably better

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.540
for when you're in grad school

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.060
versus when you're in early education.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:18.900
Right.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.380
Well, and I guess kids or young people get

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:27.380
whether somebody's doing it to be funny or, you know,

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:31.220
has it, I mean, this is why teaching is so hard.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.220
Even your tone can be impactful.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.740
It's so sad, because for that particular human,

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.820
the teacher, you just had a bad day,

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.980
and one statement can have a profound negative impact.

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.860
I know, sadly, that math,

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.140
there's a lot of math teachers

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.020
who have that kind of approach.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.020
And they, I think they're suffering from the fact

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.260
that they think people are math people, not math people.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.100
And that comes across in their teaching.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.780
But on the flip side, one positive statement,

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.740
to keep them going.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.580
That's right.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.260
That is the flip side of that.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.900
And I myself had like one teacher

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.580
who was really amazing for me in maths,

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.860
and she kept me in the subject.

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.300
I believe we left it.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.140
Who was she?

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.860
She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.620
And she was my A-level maths teacher.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.020
So I was in England.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.020
You do lots of subjects, so you're 16,

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.300
and then you choose like three or four subjects.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.300
So I had chosen maths and you go to higher levels.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.700
Probably equivalent more to a master's degree in the US

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.220
because you're more specialized.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.780
But anyways, she was my teacher.

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.740
And for the first time in my whole career in maths,

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.340
she would give us problems

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.020
and tell us to talk about them with each other.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.020
And so here I was sitting there like 17,

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.020
talking with friends about how to solve a math problem.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:04.860
And that was it.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.820
That was the change that she made,

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.060
but it was profound for me

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.420
because like those calculus students,

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.220
I started to hear other people's ways of thinking

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.980
and seeing it, and we would talk together

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.900
and come up with solutions.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.900
And I was like, that was it, that changed maths for me.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.580
So it wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.260
It was more like she was the catalyst

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.060
for that collaborative experience.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:35.020
I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.940
I mean, sometimes it's a personal message,

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.860
but it can be your teaching approach

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.460
that changes maths for kids.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.460
You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.500
and he's a mathematician, theoretical computer scientist.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.740
And he talks about the kind of the focus required

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.180
to do that kind of work.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.780
Is there something you can comment on?

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.980
You know, we live in a world full of distractions.

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.420
That seems like one of the elements that makes studying

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.300
and especially the studying of subjects

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:14.540
that require thinking like math does, difficult.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.460
Is there something from a student perspective,

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.700
from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.540
that you can comment on?

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.540
Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.380
and we have some on our website

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.140
is a really important experience for them.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.380
Even if they only do it occasionally,

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.220
but it's really important.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:43.580
They actually realize, I give a problem out often

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.220
when I'm working with teachers and I say to them,

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:48.980
all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.700
And they were like, an hour?

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.700
They think it's shocking.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.660
And then they work on this problem.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.980
And after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.580
They're like, an hour's gone by?

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.980
How is this possible?

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.980
And so everybody needs those like rich, deep problems.

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:12.020
Most kids go through their whole maths experience

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:16.140
of however many years never once working on a problem

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.060
in that kind of deep way.

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.780
So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.340
We work on these deep problems every session

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.100
and the students come away going,

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.100
okay, I never wanna go back to that maths relationship

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.940
I had where it was just all about quick answers.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.700
I just don't wanna go back to that.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:40.700
And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.380
those problems in their classrooms.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.620
Maybe they don't do them every day,

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:47.260
but they at least give kids some experience

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.900
of being able to work slowly and deeply

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.980
and to go to deeper places

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.860
and not be told they've got five minutes

01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.740
to finish 20 questions.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.860
But part of it is also just the exercise

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.380
of sitting there and maintaining focus

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.060
or prolonged periods of time.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.980
That's not often, I mean, that's a skill.

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:16.060
It's a skill that also could be discouraging.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.180
Like if you don't practice it,

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.580
just sitting down for 10 minutes straight

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.500
or maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.620
Like if you're really thinking about a problem.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.260
And I think it's really important to realize

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.060
that that's a skill that you can,

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.460
just like a muscle you can build,

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.580
you can start with five minutes

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.740
and it goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.060
And to be successful, I think in certain subjects

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.580
like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:46.700
Otherwise, you're not going to get

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:49.780
to the really rewarding experience

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.420
of solving these problems.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.620
Definitely.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.980
There was a survey done of kids in school

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.820
where they were asked,

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.420
how long will you work on a maths problem

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.540
before you give up and decide it's not possible to solve it?

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.860
And the result on average across the kids was two minutes.

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.500
Yeah, that's a bad sign,

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.460
but that was a powerful sign

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.620
that they need to learn to not give up so quickly.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.900
Yeah, we mentioned offline

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.660
because we've been talking so much about visualization.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.300
Grant Sanderson, Three Luan Brown.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.140
So he's inspired millions of people

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.580
with kind of exactly the kind of way of thinking

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.740
that you've been talking about.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.060
Yeah, I love his work.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.780
Converting sort of mathematical concepts

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.180
into visual,

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.580
visually representing them, exploring them in ways

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.220
that help you illuminate the concepts.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.100
What do you think is the role of that?

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.100
So he uses mostly programmatic visualizations.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.220
So it's the thing I mentioned

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:04.220
where there's animations created by writing computer programs.

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.460
What do you think, how scalable is that approach?

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.500
But in general, what do you think about his approach?

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.940
I think it's amazing.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.220
I should work with him.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.100
I can share some of our visuals

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.660
and he can make them in that amazing way.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.140
So part of his storytelling,

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:26.460
part of it is creating the visuals

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:29.500
and then weaving a story with those visuals

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.100
that kind of builds.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:35.060
There's also, I mean, there's also drama in it.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.620
You start with a small example

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.660
and then all of a sudden there's a surprise.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.500
And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.620
with the concept.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.100
He does talk about that.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.860
His sense is like some of the stuff,

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.940
he doesn't feel like he's teaching

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.500
like the core curriculum, which is something,

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.300
he sees himself as an inspirational figure.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.900
Because I think it's too difficult to kind of convert

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.660
all of the curriculum into those elements.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.060
And probably you don't need to.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.980
I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:20.060
in the way that he shares them, that will change them

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.620
and it will change the way they think.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.860
And maybe they could go on to take

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.340
some other mathematical idea and make it that beautiful.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340
Well, he does that.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.980
He created a library called Manum and he open sourced it.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:36.460
And that library is the, people should check it out.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.460
It's written in Python and uses some of those same elements.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.100
Like it allows you to animate equations

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.660
and animate little shapes, like people that,

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.380
he has a very distinct style in his videos.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.580
And what that resulted in, even though

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.220
from a software engineer perspective,

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.820
the code he released is not like super well documented

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.540
or perfect, but him releasing that,

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.260
now there's all of these people educating it.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.620
And the cool, to me personally, the coolest thing

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:11.220
is to see like people that are not,

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.860
you know, don't have like a million subscribers

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.540
or something, they have just a few views in the video,

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.580
but it just seems like the process of them

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.420
creating a video where they teach

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.260
is like transformative to them from a student perspective.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.420
It's the old Feynman thing,

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.340
the best way to learn is to teach.

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.780
And then him releasing that into the wild is,

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.860
it shows that impact.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.540
Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.900
I think just giving people that idea

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.980
that you can do that with maths and other subjects,

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.740
there's bound to be people all around

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.820
who can create more, which is cool.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.220
Yeah, they definitely, so I recommend people do

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.540
like JavaScript or Python, you can build like visualizations

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.060
of most concepts in high school math,

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.100
you can do a lot of kinds of visualizations

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.980
and doing that yourself, plus if you do that yourself,

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.460
people will really love it.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.060
People actually, people love visualizations of math.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:09.900
Yeah.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.460
I mean, it's something in us that loves patterns,

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.380
loves figuring out difficult things

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:19.100
and the patterns that are unexpected in some way.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.100
Yeah, have you ever noticed that hotels

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.300
are always filled with patterns?

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.420
I was just noticing at the hotel, I mean now,

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.780
all of their carpets are pattern carpets

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.980
and then they have patterns on the walls.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.820
Yeah.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.420
Yeah.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.500
We humans love the symmetry and patterns,

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.900
the breaking of symmetry and patterns.

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.980
Yeah.

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.940
And it's funny that we don't see mathematics

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.020
as somehow intricately connected to that, but it is.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.420
I mean, that's one of the perspectives

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.020
I love students to take is to be a pattern seeker.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.260
In everything.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.900
Yeah, certainly in all of maths.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.380
I mean, you can think of all of maths

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.220
as a kind of subject of patterns

01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.100
and not just visual patterns,

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.100
but when you think about multiplying by five

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:10.740
and the fact you can, if you're multiplying 18 times five,

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.820
you can instead think of nine times 10.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.260
That's a pattern that always works in mathematics.

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.100
You can have a number and double the number.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.340
And so yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.780
And if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.500
and find patterns, it's really exciting.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.020
What do you think about like MIT OpenCourseWare

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.340
and the release of lectures by universities?

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.940
I think it's good.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.780
I think it's good.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.780
I think that is what started the MOOC I did

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.140
was using that platform.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.820
So you ultimately think like the Udacity models

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.540
is a little bit more effective

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.540
than just a plain two hour lecture.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:53.700
I think there's definitely,

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:57.100
you can bring in good pedagogy into online learning.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.660
And I think the idea of putting things online

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.820
so that people all over the world can access them is great.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.100
I don't think the initial excitement around MOOCs

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:09.620
sort of democratizing education and make it more equal

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.180
came about because they found that the people taking MOOCs

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.140
tended to be the more privileged people.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:21.020
So that was, I think there's still something to be found

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.940
in that there's still more to be done

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:27.780
to help that online learning reach those principles.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.940
But definitely, I think it's a good invention.

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.220
And I have an online class that's for kids

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.460
that's a little free class that gives some-

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.300
What's the topic?

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.660
It's called How to Learn Maths.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.860
How to Learn Maths.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.540
It shows maths as this visual creative subject

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.260
and it shares mindset and some brain science

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.380
and kids who take it do better in maths class.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.340
We've studied it with randomized controlled trials

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:57.380
and given it to middle school kids

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.140
and other middle school kids who don't take it

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.460
but are taught by the same teachers.

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.100
So their teachers are the same.

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:07.620
And the kids who take the online class end up 68% more engaged

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.660
in their maths class and do better at the end of the year.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:15.260
So that's a little six session, 15 minute class

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.060
and it changes kids' maths relationship.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:24.060
So it is true that we can do that with some words

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.620
that aren't, it's not a huge change to the education system.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.300
Do you have advice for young people?

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.100
We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.420
but in terms of their journey through education,

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.980
through their career choices, through life,

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.260
maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students,

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:48.860
how to live a life that they can be proud of?

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.300
I think if I were to give advice to people,

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:59.300
especially young people, my advice would be to always,

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:03.540
it sounds really corny, but always believe in yourself

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.380
and know that you can achieve

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:08.020
because although that sounds like obvious,

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.460
of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.900
I know that millions of kids who are in the school system

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.340
have been given the message they cannot do things

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.700
and adults too, they have the idea,

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.380
oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.020
because those other things I could never have done okay in.

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.660
So actually when they hear,

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.620
hey, maybe you could do those other things,

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.100
even adults think, you know, maybe I can

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.180
and they go back and they encounter this knowledge

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.860
and they relearn things and they change careers

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.700
and amazing things happen.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.980
So for me, I think that message is really important.

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.820
You can learn anything.

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.140
Scientists try and find a limit.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.260
They're always trying to find a limit.

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.540
Like how much can you really learn?

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.300
What's the limit to how much you can learn?

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.540
And they always come away not being able to find it.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.540
People can just go further and further and further.

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.140
And that is true of people born with brain,

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.420
you know, areas of their brain that aren't functioning well

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.740
that have what we call special needs.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.980
Some of those people also go on to develop

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.820
and do amazing things.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:17.380
So I think that really experiencing that,

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.540
knowing that feeling, not just saying it,

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.220
but knowing it deeply, you can learn anything

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.740
is something I wish all people would have.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740
Actually also applies when you've achieved

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.500
some level of success too.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.380
What I find like in my life with people that love me,

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.260
when you achieve success, they keep celebrating

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.780
your success and they want you to keep doing the thing

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.740
that you were successful at as opposed to believing

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.220
in that you can do something else,

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.700
something big, whatever your heart says to do.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.020
And one of the things that I realized the value of this,

01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.540
you know, quite recently was just sad to say

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.300
is how important it is to seek out,

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.020
when you're younger to seek out mentors,

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.900
to seek out the people, like surround yourself with people

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.820
that will believe in you.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.300
It's like a little bit is on you.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:18.340
It's like, you don't get that sometimes

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.220
if you go to like grad school,

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.420
you think you kind of land on a mentor,

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.580
maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.820
they're interested in.

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.100
But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.540
they're going to define your life trajectory.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.780
So select people that-

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.620
That's really true.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.780
And get away from people who don't believe in you.

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.500
Sometimes parents can be that.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:44.700
They love you deeply, but they be, you know, they set,

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.420
it's the math thing we mentioned,

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.020
they might set certain constraints

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.100
on the beliefs that you have.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.220
And so in that, if you're interested in mathematics

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.940
and your parents are not that interested in it,

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.740
don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.940
Exactly.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:03.020
Yeah, and if people tell you you can't do things,

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.780
you have to hear from other people who believe in you.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.380
I think you're absolutely right about that.

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.940
So sad the number of people

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.180
who've had those negative messages from parents.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.660
In my limitless mind book,

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:17.700
I interviewed quite a few people who'd been told

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.140
they couldn't do math, sometimes by parents,

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.860
sometimes by teachers.

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.020
And fortunately, they had got other ideas

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.180
at some point in their life

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.660
and realized there was this whole world

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.380
of mathematical thinking that was open to them.

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:37.380
So it's really important that people do connect

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.260
with people who believe in them,

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.060
however hard that might be to find those people.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.980
What do you hope the education system,

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.140
education in general, looks like 10, 20, 50,

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.740
100 years from now?

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.820
Are you optimistic about this future?

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.180
Yeah, I definitely have hope.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.700
There is, change can happen in the education system.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.100
In recent years, it's been microscopically slow

01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:06.140
and but I do actually see change happening.

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:10.300
We were talking earlier that data science

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.500
is now a course you can take in high school

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.380
instead of algebra too.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.660
And that's pretty amazing

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:20.020
because that content was set out in 1892

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.220
and hasn't changed since then.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.260
And so now we're actually seeing a change

01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:27.020
in the content of high school.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:29.620
So I'm amazed that that's happening

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:30.620
and very happy it's happening.

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.060
So change is very slow in education usually,

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:39.060
but when you look ahead and think about all that we know

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.940
and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:48.620
you've got to think that 100 years from now,

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.580
education will be totally different to the way it is now.

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:56.060
Maybe we won't have subject boundaries anymore

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:59.020
because those don't really make much sense.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.500
And it's interesting to think how certain tools

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.740
like programming, maybe they'll be deeply integrated

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.140
in everything we do.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.020
You would think that all kids are growing up

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.780
learning to program and create.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.860
So I just think, I mean, the system of schooling we have now,

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.940
people call it a factory model.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.780
It's not designed to inspire creativity.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.380
And I feel like that will also change.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.100
People might look back on these days

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.660
and think they were hilarious,

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:33.980
but maybe in the future,

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.340
kids will be doing their own programming

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.740
and they'll be able to learn things and find out things

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.580
and create things even as they're learning.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.580
And maybe the individual subjects boundaries will go.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.980
Data science itself coming into the education system

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.980
kind of illustrates that because people realize

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:56.580
it doesn't really fit inside any of the subjects.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:57.900
So what do we do with it?

01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.900
Where does it go?

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:01.460
And who teaches it?

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.740
So it's already raising those kinds of questions

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:09.060
and questioning how we have these different subject boundaries.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.820
So you've seen data science be integrated

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.260
into the curriculum?

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.660
Yes, it's happening across the United States as we speak.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.020
I wonder how that got initiated.

01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:19.860
Like how does change happen in the education system?

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.900
Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.420
I think so, I think so.

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.020
It's been an interesting journey

01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.180
seeing data science take off, actually.

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:33.180
There was a course that was developed in 2014

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.060
by some people who thought data science

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.420
was a good idea for high schoolers.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:42.260
And then after some kids took the course

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.340
and nothing bad happened to them,

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:49.220
they went to college and people started to accept it more.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.260
And then this was a big piece of the change in California.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.860
The UC system communicated.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.900
They sent out an email last year to 50,000 high schools

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.820
saying, we now accept data science.

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.900
Kids can take it instead of Algebra II.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.740
That's a perfectly legitimate college pathway.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.340
So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.220
who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.740
So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.580
So now-

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.420
It goes viral.

01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.260
Yeah.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.100
In this modern age.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:18.940
Then it goes viral.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:23.700
California's ahead, I think, in creating courses

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.460
and having kids go through it.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.940
But certainly when I last looked,

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.700
there were 12 states that were allowing data science

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.540
as a high school course.

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:37.540
And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:41.100
So change is happening.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.860
Joe, as I said, I think mathematics

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.940
is truly a beautiful subject.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.220
And you having an impact on millions of people's lives

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:56.220
by educating them, by inspiring teachers to educate

01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.020
in the ways that you've talked about

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.500
in multidimensional ways, in visual ways,

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.500
I think is incredible.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.940
So you're spreading beauty into the world.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.100
Thank you, I really appreciate that.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.580
So I really, really appreciate

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.300
that you've spent your valuable time with me today.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.140
Thank you for talking.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.620
Thank you, it was really good to talk to you.

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:15.340
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Bowler.

And now let me leave you with some words

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.700
from Albert Einstein.

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:28.020
Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.

01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:31.580
Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
