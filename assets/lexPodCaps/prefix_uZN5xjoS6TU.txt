WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only

00:02.680 --> 00:04.520
civilization in the galaxy right now.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.080
Living.

00:05.280 --> 00:09.360
Yeah, that's currently extent, but there may be very many

00:09.400 --> 00:10.640
extinct civilizations.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.520
If each civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to,

00:13.560 --> 00:15.440
let's say AI is the demise of our own.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.240
That's only a few hundred years of technological development, or

00:18.280 --> 00:19.520
maybe 10,000 years.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.560
If you go back to the Neolithic revolution, the dawn of

00:22.560 --> 00:25.920
agriculture, you know, hardly anything can cosmic time span.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.800
Um, that that's nothing.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.840
That's the blink of an eye.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.360
And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to

00:32.360 --> 00:35.760
coexist with anyone else, but that doesn't mean nobody else

00:35.760 --> 00:37.000
was ever here.

00:37.800 --> 00:42.200
And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and

00:42.200 --> 00:45.040
realization, maybe they scour the galaxy around them, don't

00:45.040 --> 00:46.560
find any evidence for intelligence.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.680
Then they have two options.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.360
They can either give up on communication and just say,

00:51.360 --> 00:52.400
well, it's never going to happen.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.880
Uh, we just may as well just, you know, worry about what's

00:55.880 --> 00:58.640
happening here on our own planet, or they could attempt

00:58.640 --> 01:00.800
communication, but communication through time.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.120
The following is a conversation with David Kipping, an

01:06.120 --> 01:10.280
astronomer and astrophysicist at Columbia university, director

01:10.360 --> 01:11.800
of the cool worlds lab.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.200
And he's an amazing educator about the most fascinating

01:16.200 --> 01:18.680
scientific phenomena in our universe.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.040
I highly recommend you check out his videos on the

01:22.040 --> 01:23.840
cool worlds YouTube channel.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.040
David quickly became one of my favorite human beings.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.760
I hope to talk to him, uh, many more times in the future.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.960
This is the Lex Reedman podcast to support it.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.360
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.120
And now to your friends, here's David Kipping.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.040
Your research at Columbia is in part focused on what you

01:44.040 --> 01:48.160
call cool worlds or worlds outside our solar system where

01:48.160 --> 01:52.000
temperature is sufficiently cool to allow for moons, rings and

01:52.000 --> 01:54.880
life to form and for us humans to observe it.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.000
So can you tell me more about this idea, this place of cool worlds?

02:00.440 --> 02:03.840
Yeah, the history of discovering planets outside our solar system

02:03.840 --> 02:06.560
was really dominated by these hot planets.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.120
And that's just because of the fact they're easier to find.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.960
When the very first methods came online, these were primarily

02:12.960 --> 02:17.400
the Doppler spectroscopy method, looking for wobbling stars, um,

02:17.440 --> 02:18.760
and also the transit method.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.960
And these two both have a really strong bias towards

02:21.960 --> 02:23.160
finding these hot planets.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.040
Now, hot planets are interesting.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.160
The chemistry in the atmosphere is fascinating.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.160
It's very alien.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.400
Um, an example of one that's particularly close to my heart is

02:33.400 --> 02:37.960
Trace 2b, whose atmosphere is so dark, it's less reflective than coal.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.640
And so they have really bizarre photometric properties, yet at the

02:42.640 --> 02:45.920
same time, they resemble nothing like our own home.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.120
And so it said there's two types of astrophysicists, the astrophysicists

02:50.120 --> 02:52.160
who care about how the universe works.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.360
They want to understand the mechanics of the machinery of this universe.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.640
Why did the Big Bang happen?

02:57.640 --> 02:58.920
Why is the universe expanding?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.080
How are galaxies formed?

03:00.440 --> 03:04.960
And there's another type of astrophysicist, which perhaps, um, speaks

03:04.960 --> 03:09.120
to me a little bit more, it whispers into your ear, and that is why are we here?

03:09.960 --> 03:10.880
Are we alone?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.080
Are there others out there?

03:12.440 --> 03:16.240
And ultimately, along this journey, the hot planets aren't going to get us there.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.280
We, when we're looking for life in the universe, seems to make perfect sense

03:20.360 --> 03:24.760
that there should be planets like our own out there, maybe even moons like

03:24.760 --> 03:27.520
our own planet around gas giants that could be habitable.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.560
And so my research has been driven by trying to find these more

03:31.560 --> 03:34.360
miraculous globes that might resemble our own planet.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.080
So they're the ones that lurk more in the shadows in terms of

03:38.080 --> 03:39.400
how difficult it is to detect.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.680
They're much harder.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.000
They're harder for several reasons.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.520
The method we primarily use is the transit method.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.560
So this is really eclipses as the planet passes in front of the star,

03:48.600 --> 03:49.800
it blocks out some starlight.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.120
The problem with that is that not all planets pass in front of their star.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.320
They have to be aligned correctly from your line of sight.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.520
And so the further away the planet is from the star, the cooler it is, the

04:00.520 --> 04:03.800
less likely it is that you're going to get that geometric alignment.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.880
So whereas a hot Jupiter, about 1% of hot Jupiters will transit in front of their

04:07.880 --> 04:13.800
star, only about 0.5%, maybe even a quarter of a percent of Earth-like

04:13.800 --> 04:16.240
planets will have the right geometry to transit.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.760
And so that makes it much, much harder for us.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.120
What's the connection between temperature of the planet and geometric alignment,

04:22.360 --> 04:23.800
probability of geometric alignment?

04:23.840 --> 04:26.920
There's not a direct connection, but they're connected by an intermediate

04:26.920 --> 04:28.960
parameter, which is their separation from the star.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.080
So the planet will be cooler if it's further away from the star, which in

04:33.080 --> 04:37.240
turn means that the probability of getting that alignment correct is going to be less.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.120
On top of that, they also transit their star less frequently.

04:41.560 --> 04:45.240
So if you go to the telescope and you want to discover a hot Jupiter, you

04:45.240 --> 04:47.680
could probably do it in a week or so because the orbital periods have

04:47.680 --> 04:49.240
order of one, two, three days.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.240
So you can actually get the full orbit two or three times over.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.400
Whereas if you want to set an Earth-like planet, you have to observe

04:55.400 --> 04:57.600
that star for three, four years.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.320
And that's actually one of the problems with Kepler.

05:00.520 --> 05:06.120
Kepler was this very successful mission that NASA launched over a decade ago now,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.960
I think, and it discovered thousands of planets.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.680
It's still the dominant source of exoplanets that we know about, but

05:12.720 --> 05:15.920
unfortunately, it didn't last as long as we would have liked it to.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.880
It died after about 4.35 years, I think it was.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.840
And so for an Earth-like planet, that's just enough to catch four transits.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.120
Four transits was kind of seen as the minimum, but of course, the more transits

05:28.120 --> 05:31.640
you see, the easier it is to detect it because you build up signal to noise.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.880
If you see the same thing tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, the more ticks you get,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.240
the easier it is to find it.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.120
And so it was really a shame that Kepler was just at the limit of where we were

05:41.120 --> 05:43.400
expecting it to start to see Earth-like planets.

05:43.840 --> 05:49.000
And in fact, it really found zero, zero planets that are around stars like the

05:49.000 --> 05:54.120
sun, orbits similar to the earth around the sun, and could potentially be similar

05:54.120 --> 05:55.960
to our own planet in terms of its composition.

05:56.360 --> 06:01.320
And so it's a great shame, but that's why it gives astronomers more to do in the

06:01.320 --> 06:01.760
future.

06:02.320 --> 06:08.680
Just to clarify, the transit method is our primary way of detecting these things.

06:09.640 --> 06:17.200
And what it is, is when the object passes, occludes the source of light, just a

06:17.200 --> 06:18.960
tiny bit, a few pixels.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.720
And from that, we can infer something about its mass and size and distance,

06:22.720 --> 06:24.200
the geometry, all of that.

06:24.760 --> 06:33.240
That's like trying to tell what, at a party, you can't see anything about a

06:33.240 --> 06:36.360
person, but you can just see by the way they occlude others.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.560
So this is the method.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.800
But is this a super far away?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.480
How many pixels of information do we have?

06:43.280 --> 06:48.680
Basically, how high resolution is the signal that we can get about these

06:48.680 --> 06:49.320
occlusions?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.560
You're right in your description.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.480
I think just to build upon that a little bit more, it might be almost like your

06:55.480 --> 06:56.560
vision is completely blurry.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.240
Like you have an extreme, you know, eye prescription, and so you can't resolve

07:01.240 --> 07:01.600
anything.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.760
Everything's just blurs.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.720
And, but you can tell that something was there because it just got fainter for a

07:06.720 --> 07:07.440
short amount of time.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.840
Something, someone passed in front of a light and so that light in your eyes

07:10.840 --> 07:12.360
would just dim for a short moment.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.640
Now, the reason we have that problem with blurriness or resolution is just

07:16.640 --> 07:18.120
because the stars are so far away.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.480
I mean, these are, the closest stars are four light years away, but most of the

07:21.480 --> 07:23.680
stars Kepler looked at were thousands of light years away.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.600
And so you, there's absolutely no chance that the telescope can physically

07:27.600 --> 07:34.160
resolve the star or even the separation between the planet and the star is, is

07:34.160 --> 07:37.120
too small, especially for a telescope like Kepler, it's only a meter across.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.120
In principle, you can make those detections, but you need a

07:42.120 --> 07:43.320
different kind of telescope.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.720
We call that direct imaging and direct imaging is a very exciting, distinct

07:47.720 --> 07:52.880
way of detecting planets, but it, as you can imagine, is going to be far easier

07:52.880 --> 07:55.800
to detect planets, which are really far away from their star to do that, because

07:55.800 --> 07:57.480
that's going to make that separation really big.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.600
And then you also want the star to be really close to us.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.520
So the nearest stars, not only that, but you would prefer that planet to be really

08:04.520 --> 08:07.200
hot because the hotter it is, the brighter it is.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.200
And so that tends to bias direct imaging towards planets which

08:10.200 --> 08:11.480
are in the process of forming.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.760
So things which have just formed the planet still got all of its primordial

08:15.760 --> 08:18.120
heat embedded within it and it's glowing.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.400
We can see those quite easily, but for the planets more like the earth, of course,

08:21.400 --> 08:25.520
they've cooled down and so we can't see that the light is pitiful compared to a

08:25.520 --> 08:29.080
newly formed planet we would like to get there with direct imaging.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.480
That's the dream is to have the pale blue dot, an actual photograph of it, maybe

08:33.480 --> 08:35.280
even just a one pixel photograph of it.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.280
But for now, the entire solar system is one pixel with a, certainly with the

08:39.280 --> 08:40.880
transit method, most of the telescopes.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.640
And so all you can do is see where that one pixel, which contains potentially

08:45.640 --> 08:50.480
dozens of planets and the star, maybe even multiple stars, dims for a short amount

08:50.480 --> 08:52.600
of time, dims just a little bit.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.160
And from that, you can infer something.

08:54.680 --> 08:54.960
Yeah.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.040
I mean, it's, it's like being a detective in the scene, right?

08:58.040 --> 09:01.440
It's very, it's indirect clues of the existence of the planet.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.240
It's amazing that humans can do that.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.680
It was just looking out in these immense distances and looking, you know, if

09:08.680 --> 09:13.160
there's alien civilizations out there, like, let's say one exactly like our own.

09:14.280 --> 09:20.400
We're like, would we even be able to see an earth that passes in the way of its

09:20.400 --> 09:21.880
sun and slightly dims?

09:21.960 --> 09:26.680
And that's the only sign we have of that, of that alien human-like

09:26.680 --> 09:29.360
civilization out there is it's just a little bit of a dimming.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.080
Yeah.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.440
I mean, it depends on the type of star we're talking about.

09:32.440 --> 09:37.920
If it is a star truly like the sun, the dip that causes is 84 parts per million.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.480
I mean, that's just, it's like the same as a, um, it's like a firefly flying in

09:42.480 --> 09:45.280
front of like a giant floodlight at a stadium or something.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.680
That's the kind of the brightness contrast that you're trying to compare to.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.160
So it's, it's extremely difficult detection.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.960
And in the very, very best cases we can get down to that.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.840
But as I said, we don't really have any true earth analogs that have been in

09:58.840 --> 10:00.080
the exoplanet candidate yet.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.840
Unless you relax that definition, you say it's not just doesn't have to be a star

10:04.840 --> 10:07.320
just like the sun, it could be a star that's smaller than the sun.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.760
It could be these orange dwarfs or even the red dwarf stars.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.560
And the fact those stars are smaller means that for the same size planet

10:14.560 --> 10:17.240
passing in front of it, more light is blocked out.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.520
And so a very exciting system, for example, is TRAPPIST-1, which has seven

10:22.520 --> 10:24.640
planets, which are smaller than the earth.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.280
And those are quite easily detectable, not with a space-based telescope, but

10:29.280 --> 10:30.040
even from the ground.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.240
And that's just because the star is so much smaller that the relative increase in

10:34.280 --> 10:38.000
or decrease in brightness is enhanced significantly because that smaller size.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.000
So TRAPPIST-1e, it's a planet which is in the right distance for liquid water.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.800
It has a slightly smaller size than the earth.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.120
It's about 90% the size of the earth, about 80% the mass.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.560
And it's one of the top targets right now for potentially having life.

10:53.480 --> 10:59.320
And yet it raises many questions about what would that environment be like?

10:59.320 --> 11:02.360
This is a star which is one-eighth the mass of the sun.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.360
Stars like that take a long time to come off that adolescence.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.280
When stars first form, like the sun, it takes them maybe 10, 100 million years

11:12.280 --> 11:14.720
to sort of settle into that main sequence lifetime.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.440
But for stars like these late M dwarfs, as we call them, they can take up to a

11:19.480 --> 11:23.000
billion years or more to calm down.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.320
And during that period, they're producing huge amounts of X-rays, ultraviolet

11:27.320 --> 11:30.920
radiation that could potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.800
It may desiccate the planets in the system.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.320
And so even if water arrived by comets or something, it may have lost all that

11:38.320 --> 11:41.480
water due to this prolonged period of high activity.

11:41.840 --> 11:47.080
So we have lots of open-ended questions about these M dwarf planets, but they are

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
the most accessible.

11:48.320 --> 11:54.120
And so in the near term, if we detect anything in terms of biosignatures, it's

11:54.120 --> 11:58.520
going to be for one of these red dwarf stars, it's not going to be a true earth

11:58.520 --> 12:00.840
twin as we would recognize it as having a yellow star.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.680
Well, let me ask you, I mean, there's a million ways to ask this question.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.000
I'm sure I'll ask it about habitable worlds.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.000
Let's just go to our own solar system.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.040
What can we learn about the planets and moons in our solar system that might

12:18.040 --> 12:24.640
contain life, whether it's Mars or some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, what

12:24.640 --> 12:28.160
kind of characteristics, because you said it might not need to be Earth-like, what

12:28.160 --> 12:30.880
kind of characteristics might we be looking for?

12:31.720 --> 12:37.040
When we look for life, it's hard to define even what life is, but we can maybe do a

12:37.040 --> 12:39.920
better job in defining the sorts of things that life does.

12:40.440 --> 12:45.120
And that provides some aspects to some avenue for looking for them.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.240
Classically, conventionally, I think we thought the way to look for life was to look

12:50.240 --> 12:51.120
for oxygen.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.320
Oxygen is a byproduct of a synthesis on this planet.

12:54.760 --> 12:55.960
We didn't always have it.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.960
Certainly, if you go back to the Ikean period, you have this period called the

13:00.960 --> 13:04.480
Great Oxidation Event where the Earth floats with oxygen for the first time, and so

13:04.480 --> 13:06.960
that's to saturate the oceans and then the atmosphere.

13:07.560 --> 13:12.000
And so that oxygen, if we detect it on another planet, whether it be Mars, Venus, or

13:12.640 --> 13:18.000
an exoplanet, whatever it is, that was long thought to be evidence for something doing

13:18.000 --> 13:18.880
photosynthesis.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.400
Because if you took away all the plant life on the Earth, the oxygen wouldn't just

13:23.400 --> 13:27.840
hang around here as a highly reactive molecule, it would oxidize things.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.520
And so within about a million years, you would probably lose all the oxygen on planet

13:31.520 --> 13:31.880
Earth.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.520
So that was conventionally how we thought we could look for life.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.080
And then we start to realize that it's not so simple because, A, there might be

13:39.120 --> 13:41.720
other things that life does apart from photosynthesis.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.720
Certainly, the vast majority of the Earth's history had no oxygen, and yet there was

13:45.840 --> 13:48.920
living things on it, so that doesn't seem like a complete test.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.720
And secondly, could there be other things that produce oxygen besides from life?

13:55.040 --> 13:59.840
A growing concern has been these false positives in biosignature work.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.360
And so one example of that would be photolysis that happens in the atmosphere.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.840
When ultraviolet light hits the upper atmosphere, it can break up water vapor.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.840
The hydrogen splits off to the oxygen.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.640
The hydrogen is a much lighter atomic species, and so it can actually escape

14:14.760 --> 14:16.440
certainly planets like the Earth's gravity.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.160
That's why we don't have any hydrogen or very little helium.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.800
And so that leaves you with the oxygen, which then oxidizes the surface.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.920
And so there could be a residual oxygen signature just due to this photolysis

14:27.920 --> 14:28.600
process.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.880
So we've been trying to generalize, and certainly in recent years, there's been

14:33.920 --> 14:36.360
other suggestions of things we could look for in the solar system and beyond.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.040
Nitrous oxide, basically laughing gas, is a product of microbes.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
That's something that we're starting to get more interested in looking for.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.960
Methane gas in combination with other gases can be an important biosignature.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.320
Phosphine as well, and phosphine is particularly relevant to the solar system

14:54.320 --> 14:57.440
because there was a lot of interest for Venus recently.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.640
You may have heard that there was a claim of a biosignature in Venus's atmosphere.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.280
I think it was like two years ago now.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.560
And the judge and jury are still out on that.

15:09.680 --> 15:14.720
There was a very provocative claim and signature of a phosphine-like

15:14.840 --> 15:20.440
spectral absorption, but it could have also have been some of the molecule in

15:20.440 --> 15:23.640
particular, sulfur dioxide, which is not a biosignature.

15:24.160 --> 15:30.040
So this is a detection of a gas in the atmosphere of Venus, and it might be

15:30.040 --> 15:32.920
controversial in several dimensions.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.440
So one, how to interpret that.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.800
Two, is this the right gas?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.040
And three, is this even the right detection?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.960
Is there an error in the detection?

15:41.480 --> 15:41.840
Yeah.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.120
I mean, how much do we believe the detection in the first place?

15:44.480 --> 15:47.880
If you do believe it, does that necessarily mean there's life there?

15:48.160 --> 15:52.640
And what gives, how can you have life in Venus's atmosphere in the first place?

15:52.640 --> 15:56.640
Because that's been seen as like a hellhole place for imagining life.

15:56.680 --> 16:01.160
But I guess the counter to that has been that, okay, yes, the surface is a

16:01.200 --> 16:03.720
horrendous place to imagine life thriving.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.360
But as you go up in altitude, the very dense atmosphere means that there is a

16:08.360 --> 16:13.080
cloud layer where the temperature and the pressure become actually fairly

16:13.080 --> 16:14.480
similar to the surface of the earth.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.000
And so maybe there are microbes stirring around in the clouds,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.440
which are producing phosphine.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.000
At the moment, this is fascinating.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.920
It's got a lot of us reinvigorated about the prospects of going back to

16:27.920 --> 16:29.280
Venus and doing another mission there.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.520
In fact, there's now two NASA missions, Veritas and Da Vinci, which are going

16:33.520 --> 16:36.480
to be going back before 2030 or the 2030s.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.120
And then we have a European mission, I think, that's slated now.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.040
And even a Chinese mission might be coming along the way as well.

16:43.040 --> 16:47.160
So we might have multiple missions going to Venus, which has long been overlooked.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.880
I mean, apart from the Soviets, there really has been very little in the

16:50.880 --> 16:53.680
way of exploration of Venus, certainly as compared to Mars.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.800
Mars has enjoyed most of the activity from NASA's rovers and surveys.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.440
And Mars is certainly fascinating.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.640
There's this signature of methane that has been seen there before.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.280
Again, the discussion is whether that methane is a product of biology,

17:10.360 --> 17:14.280
which is possible, certainly that happens on the earth, or whether it's

17:14.320 --> 17:20.520
some geological process that we are yet to fully understand could be, for

17:20.520 --> 17:23.240
example, a reservoir of methane that's trapped under the surface and

17:23.240 --> 17:24.320
it's leaking out seasonally.

17:24.640 --> 17:29.200
So the nice thing about Venus is if there's a giant living civilization

17:29.200 --> 17:33.960
there, it'll be airborne so you can just fly through and collect samples.

17:34.320 --> 17:41.040
With Mars and moons of Saturn, Jupiter, you're going to have to dig under to

17:41.040 --> 17:43.440
find the civilizations that are living.

17:43.600 --> 17:43.920
Right.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.800
And so, yeah, maybe it's easier then for Venus because certainly you can

17:46.800 --> 17:51.920
imagine just a balloon floating through the atmosphere or a drone or something

17:51.920 --> 17:55.080
that would have the capability of just scooping up and sampling.

17:55.560 --> 18:02.600
To dig under the surface of Mars is maybe feasible-ish, especially with

18:02.600 --> 18:07.040
something like Starship that could launch a huge digger basically to the

18:07.040 --> 18:09.680
surface and you could just excavate away at the surface.

18:10.080 --> 18:15.560
But for something like Europa, we really are still unclear about how thick the

18:15.560 --> 18:21.240
ice layer is, how you would melt through that huge thick layer to get to the

18:21.240 --> 18:25.040
ocean, and then potentially also discussions about contamination.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.600
The problem with looking for life in the solar system, which is different from

18:28.600 --> 18:32.040
looking for life with exoplanets, is that you always run the risk of,

18:32.680 --> 18:36.320
especially if you visit there, of introducing the life yourself, right?

18:36.320 --> 18:41.000
It's very difficult to completely exterminate every single microbe and

18:41.000 --> 18:45.720
spore on the surface of your rover or the surface of your lander.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.760
And so there's always a risk of introducing something.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.880
I mean, to some extent, there is continuous exchange of material between

18:53.880 --> 18:55.880
these planets naturally on top of that as well.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.440
And now we're sort of accelerating that process to some degree.

18:59.120 --> 19:04.080
And so if you dig into Europa's surface, which probably is completely pristine,

19:04.080 --> 19:08.400
it's very unlikely there has been much exchange with the outside world for its

19:08.400 --> 19:13.680
subsurface ocean, you are for the first time potentially introducing bacterial

19:13.680 --> 19:17.640
spores into that environment that may compete or may introduce spurious

19:17.640 --> 19:19.360
signatures for the life you're looking for.

19:19.760 --> 19:25.720
And so it's almost an ethical question as to how to proceed with looking for

19:25.720 --> 19:28.160
life on those subsurface oceans.

19:28.440 --> 19:32.520
And I don't think one we've really have a good resolution for at this point.

19:32.520 --> 19:32.920
Ethical.

19:33.240 --> 19:39.520
So you mean ethical in terms of concern for the, like for preserving life

19:39.520 --> 19:43.000
elsewhere, not to murder it as opposed to the scientific one?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.080
I mean, we always worry about a space virus, right?

19:45.480 --> 19:48.000
Coming here or some kind of external source.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
And we would be the source of that potential contamination.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.920
Or the other direction.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.240
Yeah.

19:52.600 --> 19:57.360
I mean, they, that, you know, the, whatever, whatever survives in such

19:57.360 --> 20:02.080
harsh conditions might be pretty good at, uh, surviving in all conditions.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.160
It might be a little bit more resilient and robust.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.720
So it might actually take a ride on us back home.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.480
Possibly.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.680
I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure that some people would be concerned about that.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.240
I think we would, we would hopefully have some containment, uh, procedures

20:16.280 --> 20:18.440
as well, if we did sample return or what you mean, you don't even

20:18.440 --> 20:19.800
really need a sample return these days.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.160
You can pretty much send it like a little micro laboratory to the, the

20:23.160 --> 20:26.520
planet to do all the experiments in situ and then just send them back

20:26.520 --> 20:28.040
to your planet, the data.

20:28.320 --> 20:32.560
And so I don't think this is necessary that especially for a case like that,

20:32.560 --> 20:35.400
where you might have contamination concerns that you have to bring samples

20:35.400 --> 20:39.600
back, um, although probably if you brought back your open sushi, it

20:39.640 --> 20:43.240
would probably sell for quite a bit with the billionaires in New York City.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.120
Sushi.

20:45.160 --> 20:45.440
Yeah.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.160
Um, I would love from an engineering perspective, just to see all the

20:50.160 --> 20:54.200
different candidates and designs for like the scooper for Venus and the

20:54.200 --> 20:57.720
scooper for Europa and, and Mars.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.560
I haven't really looked deeply into how they actually, like the actual

21:01.560 --> 21:05.520
engineering of collecting the samples, because that's the engineering of that.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.600
It's probably essential for not either destroying life or, or polluting it

21:11.600 --> 21:13.280
with our own microbes and so on.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.880
So that's like an interesting engineering challenge.

21:16.040 --> 21:20.520
I usually for rovers and stuff, focus on the, on the robot, on the sort of the

21:20.520 --> 21:24.680
mobility aspect of it, on the robotics, the perception and the movement and the

21:24.680 --> 21:27.840
planning and the control, but there's probably the scooper is probably where

21:27.840 --> 21:31.680
the action is the microscopic sample collection.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.520
So basically you have to first clean your vehicle, make sure it doesn't have

21:36.520 --> 21:41.960
any earth like things on it, and then you have to put it into some kind of thing

21:41.960 --> 21:43.680
that's perfectly sealed from the environment.

21:43.680 --> 21:48.400
So if we bring it back or we analyze it, it's not, um, it's not going to

21:48.400 --> 21:50.560
bring anything else, uh, externally.

21:50.680 --> 21:50.840
Yeah.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.160
I don't know.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.600
It would be, that'd be an interesting engineering design there.

21:53.680 --> 21:53.920
Yeah.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.120
I mean, curiosity has been, uh, leaving these little pods on the surface quite

21:59.120 --> 22:03.120
recently, there's some neat photos that you can find online and it's, they kind

22:03.120 --> 22:08.480
of look like a lightsaber helps, which so, um, the, yeah, to me, I think I

22:08.480 --> 22:11.480
tweeted something like, uh, you know, this weapon is your life, like don't lose

22:11.480 --> 22:15.320
it curiosity because it's just dumping these little vials everywhere and it's,

22:15.320 --> 22:16.800
yeah, it is scooping up these things.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.760
And the intention is that in the future, um, there will be a sample return

22:20.760 --> 22:22.160
mission that will come and pick these up.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.920
Um, but it's, I mean, the engineering behind those things is so impressive.

22:25.920 --> 22:30.680
The thing that blows me away the most has been the landings, um, especially

22:30.680 --> 22:32.040
I'm trained to be a pilot at the moment.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.760
So that's the sort of, you know, watching landings has become like my pet

22:34.760 --> 22:38.480
hobby on YouTube at the moment and how not to do it, how to do it with different

22:38.480 --> 22:43.560
levels of, uh, conditions and things, but with the, you know, when you think

22:43.560 --> 22:47.040
about landing on Mars, just the light travel time effect means that there's

22:47.040 --> 22:52.320
no possibility of a human controlling that descent, and so you have to put all

22:52.360 --> 22:57.560
your faith and your trust in the computer code or the AI or whatever it is

22:57.560 --> 23:00.360
that you've put on board that thing to make the correct descent.

23:00.840 --> 23:05.720
Um, and so there's this famous, uh, period called seven minutes of hell

23:05.960 --> 23:08.880
where you're basically waiting for that light travel time to come back to know

23:08.880 --> 23:11.960
whether your vehicle successfully landed on the surface or not.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.280
And during that period, you know, in your mind simultaneously that it is

23:16.280 --> 23:20.280
doing these multi-stages of, um, deploying its parachute, deploying

23:20.320 --> 23:25.080
the crane, activating its jets to come down and controlling its descent to

23:25.080 --> 23:28.600
the surface, um, and then the crane has to fly away so it doesn't accidentally

23:28.600 --> 23:29.360
hit the rover.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.200
And so there's a series of, uh, multi-stage points where any, any of

23:34.200 --> 23:37.280
them go wrong, you know, the whole mission could, could go awry.

23:37.800 --> 23:43.720
Um, and so the fact that we are fairly consistently able to build these

23:43.720 --> 23:48.800
machines that can do this autonomously is to me, one of the most impressive

23:48.800 --> 23:50.640
acts of engineering that NASA have achieved.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.360
Yes.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.240
The unfortunate fact about physics is the takeoff is easier than the landing.

23:57.080 --> 24:01.480
And you mentioned Starship, one of the incredible engineering feats that you

24:01.480 --> 24:06.080
get to see is the reusable rockets that take off, but they land and they land

24:06.560 --> 24:09.880
up using control and they do so perfectly.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.880
And sometimes when it's synchronous, it's just, it's beautiful to see.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.400
And then with Starship, you see the chopsticks that catch the ship.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.120
I mean, there's just so much incredible engineering, but you mentioned, uh,

24:20.120 --> 24:22.480
Starship is somehow helpful here.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.040
So what's your hope with Starship?

24:24.520 --> 24:28.560
What kind of science might enable possibly?

24:29.120 --> 24:29.800
There's two things.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.440
I mean, it's the launch cost itself, which is hopefully going to mean per

24:32.440 --> 24:35.840
kilogram, it's going to dramatically reduce the cost of it's the sort of the

24:35.840 --> 24:39.240
level, even if it's a factor of 10 higher than what Elon originally promised.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.920
This is going to be a revolution for the cost to launch.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.000
That means you could do all sorts of things.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.440
You could launch, um, large telescopes, which could be basically like JWST,

24:49.440 --> 24:51.200
but you don't even have to fold them up.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.840
JWST had this whole issue with its design that it's six and a half meters across.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.400
And so you have to, there's no fuselage, which is that large at the time.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.840
There is four, it wasn't large enough for that.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.120
And so they had to fold it up into this kind of complicated origami.

25:04.640 --> 25:09.560
And so a large part of the cost was figuring out how to fold it up, testing

25:09.560 --> 25:12.280
that it unfolded correctly, repeated testing.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.120
And, you know, there was something like 130 fail points or something during

25:16.120 --> 25:17.360
this unfolding mechanism.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.040
And so all of us were holding our breath during that process.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.960
But if you have the ability to just launch, you know, arbitrarily large

25:23.960 --> 25:28.360
masses, um, at least comparatively compared to JWST and very large

25:28.360 --> 25:31.960
mirrors into space, you can more or less repurpose ground-based mirrors.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.240
Um, the Hubble space telescope mirror and the JWST mirrors are designed

25:36.240 --> 25:40.960
to be extremely lightweight and that increased their costs significantly.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.240
Um, they have this kind of honeycomb design on the back to try and

25:44.240 --> 25:45.560
minimize the weight.

25:46.240 --> 25:51.040
If you don't really care about weight because it's so cheap, then you could

25:51.040 --> 25:55.240
just literally grab many of the existing ground-based mirrors across telescopes

25:55.240 --> 25:58.800
across the world, four meters, five meters mirrors, and just pretty much

25:58.880 --> 26:01.880
attach them to a chassis and have your own space-based telescope.

26:02.240 --> 26:07.040
Um, I think the Breakthrough Foundation, for instance, uh, is an entity that

26:07.600 --> 26:09.720
has been interested in doing this sort of thing.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.080
Um, and so that raises the prospects of having not just one JWST that just, you

26:15.080 --> 26:18.480
know, JWST is a fantastic resource, but it's split between all of us.

26:18.760 --> 26:23.520
Cosmologists, star formation, uh, astronomers, those of us studying

26:23.520 --> 26:27.000
exoplanets, those of us wanting to study, you know, the ultra deep fields and

26:27.000 --> 26:30.080
the origin of the first galaxies, the expansionary of the universe.

26:30.360 --> 26:35.000
Everyone has to share this resource, but we could potentially each have, you

26:35.040 --> 26:40.000
know, one, uh, JWST each that is, uh, maybe just studying a handful of the

26:40.000 --> 26:43.680
brightest exoplanet stars and measuring their atmospheres.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.360
This is important because if you, you know, we talked about this planet

26:47.360 --> 26:52.680
Trappist-1e earlier, that planet, if JWST studied it and tried to look for

26:52.680 --> 26:58.480
biosignatures, by which I mean oxygen, um, nitrous oxide, methane, it would

26:58.480 --> 27:06.000
take it of order of 200 transits to get even a very marginal, what we'd call

27:06.000 --> 27:09.600
two and a half sigma detection of those, which basically nobody would believe

27:09.640 --> 27:12.360
with, with that and a hundred transits.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.000
I mean, this thing transits once every six days.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.560
So you're talking about sort of four years of staring at the same

27:16.560 --> 27:18.200
star with one telescope.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.920
There'd be some breaks, but it'd be hard to schedule much else because you

27:21.920 --> 27:25.640
have to continuously catch each one of these transits to build up your signal

27:25.680 --> 27:26.120
noise.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.440
And so JWST is never going to do that.

27:28.520 --> 27:33.360
In principle, technically, JWST could technically have the capability of just

27:33.360 --> 27:38.480
about detecting a biosignature on an earth-like planet around a non-sun-like

27:38.480 --> 27:43.040
star, but still impressively, we have basically the technology to do that, but

27:43.040 --> 27:47.160
we simply cannot dedicate all of its time practically to that one resource.

27:47.160 --> 27:52.120
And so Starship opens up opportunities like that of mass producing these kinds

27:52.120 --> 27:56.600
of telescopes, which will allow us to survey for life in the universe, which

27:56.600 --> 27:58.720
of course is one of the grand goals of astronomy.

27:59.080 --> 28:04.960
I wonder if you can speak to the, the bureaucracy, the political battles, the

28:04.960 --> 28:10.960
scientific battles for, for time on the James Webb telescope, is there, there

28:10.960 --> 28:15.560
must be a fascinating process of scheduling that all scientists that are

28:15.560 --> 28:18.200
trying to collaborate and figure out what the most important problems are.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.200
And there's an interesting network of interfering scientific experiments

28:24.200 --> 28:26.160
probably they have to somehow optimize over.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.640
It's, it's a really difficult process.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.480
I don't envy the TAC that are going to have to make this decision.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.160
We call it the TAC, the time allocation committee that make this decision.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.480
Um, and I've served on these before and it's very difficult.

28:38.480 --> 28:43.200
I mean, typically for Hubble, we were seeing at least 10, sometimes 20 times

28:43.200 --> 28:47.680
the number of proposals for telescope time versus available telescope time.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.000
For JJST, there has been one call already that has gone out.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.320
We call it cycle one.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.320
And that was oversubscribed by I think something like six to one, seven to one.

28:57.800 --> 29:02.720
And, uh, the cycle two, which is just been announced, uh, fairly recently

29:02.720 --> 29:04.320
and the deadline is actually the end of this month.

29:04.320 --> 29:08.400
So my team are totally laser focused on writing our proposals right now.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.400
Um, that is expected to be much more competitive, probably more

29:12.400 --> 29:13.880
comparable to what Hubble saw.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
And so it's hard.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.600
More competitive than the second one.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.040
You said already, because that's already

29:19.880 --> 29:20.720
the first cycle.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.200
So I said the first cycle of James Webb was about six to one.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.360
Um, and this will probably be more like 20 to one.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.200
I would expect these are all proposals by scientists and so on.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.320
And it's not like you can schedule at any time.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.880
Cause if you're looking for transit times, you have, you have a time

29:35.880 --> 29:39.400
critical element, yes, time critical element and they're conflicting and

29:39.400 --> 29:42.680
non like not obvious ways, cause the, the, the frequency is different.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.800
The duration is different because it's probably computational needs that are

29:46.800 --> 29:51.200
different, uh, there's a type of sensors, the direction pointing all that.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.360
Yeah, it's hard.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.880
And there were certain programs like doing a deep field study where you just

29:56.880 --> 29:59.320
more or less point the telescope and that's pretty open.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.080
I mean, you're just accumulating photons.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.200
You can just point it at that, at that patch of the sky.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.800
Um, whenever the test gets not doing anything else and just get to your month,

30:06.840 --> 30:09.800
let's say a month of integration time is your, is your goal over the lifetime of

30:09.840 --> 30:12.720
JVST. So that's maybe a little bit easier to schedule.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.640
It's harder, especially for us looking at cool worlds.

30:16.040 --> 30:20.640
Um, because as I said earlier, these, these plants transit very infrequently.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.680
So we have to wait.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.360
If you're looking at the earth, transiting the sun and alien watching us,

30:25.760 --> 30:29.160
they, they would only get one opportunity per year to do that observation.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.760
The transit lasts for about 12 hours.

30:32.120 --> 30:36.120
Um, and so if they don't get that time, it's hard.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.520
That's it.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.560
Uh, if it conflicted with another proposal that wants to do, use the,

30:40.800 --> 30:44.920
another time critical element, it's much easier for plants like, uh, these hot,

30:45.000 --> 30:48.640
these hot plants where these close in plants, um, because they transit so

30:48.640 --> 30:51.360
frequently, there's maybe a hundred opportunities.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.320
And so then the tech can say, okay, they want 10 transits.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.120
There's a hundred opportunities here.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.640
It's easier for us to give us time, to give them time.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.960
Um, we're almost in the worst case scenario.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.200
We're proposing to look for XM means around two cool planets.

31:04.640 --> 31:08.880
And so we really only have one bite of the cherry for each one.

31:09.360 --> 31:13.680
And so our sales pitch has been that these are extremely precious events.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.880
And more importantly, JDBS-T is the only telescope, the only machine

31:19.920 --> 31:24.600
humanity has ever constructed, which is capable of finding moons, akin to

31:24.600 --> 31:25.880
the moons in our solar system.

31:26.160 --> 31:26.880
Kepler can't do it.

31:26.880 --> 31:27.920
Even Hubble can't do it.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.640
JDBC is the first one.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.680
And so there is a new window to the universe.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.640
Cause we know these moons exist.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.040
They, they're all over the place in the solar system.

31:37.040 --> 31:42.160
You have the moon, you have Io, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, Titan, lots

31:42.160 --> 31:45.280
of moons are fairly similar size, sort of 30% the size of the earth.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.960
And this telescope is the first one that can find them.

31:49.440 --> 31:54.040
Um, and so we're very excited about the profound implications of ultimately

31:54.040 --> 31:57.240
solving this journey we're on in astronomy, which is to understand our uniqueness.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.880
We want to understand how common is the solar system.

31:59.960 --> 32:05.760
Are we the way, are we the architecture that frequently emerges naturally?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Or is there something special about what happened here?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.280
I think this is not the worst case of the best case.

32:11.280 --> 32:11.840
It's obvious.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.720
It's super rare.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.320
So you have to like, I would, so I love scheduling from a computer

32:16.320 --> 32:17.920
science perspective, that's my background.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.760
So algorithmically, to solve a schedule problem, I would

32:20.760 --> 32:22.280
schedule the rarest things first.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.320
And obviously this is the, the JDBS-T is the first thing that can

32:26.320 --> 32:28.160
actually detect a cool world.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.760
So this is a big new thing.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.120
You can show off that new thing happens rarely.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.200
Schedule it first.

32:33.200 --> 32:33.720
It's perfect.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.480
You should be in the tech.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.280
This is perfect.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.760
I'll follow my application after we're done with this.

32:38.760 --> 32:42.880
I, I, you know, this part of me is the OCD part of me is the computational aspect.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.160
I love scheduling, uh, computing device.

32:45.160 --> 32:50.000
Cause you have that kind of scheduling on supercomputers on that

32:50.000 --> 32:51.280
scheduling problem is fascinating.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.240
How do you prioritize computation?

32:53.240 --> 32:57.280
How do you prioritize science, uh, data collection, uh, sample collection,

32:57.280 --> 32:57.960
all that kind of stuff.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.960
It's actually kind of, it's kind of fascinating because data in ways

33:01.960 --> 33:08.040
you expect and don't expect will unlock a lot of solutions to, uh, some

33:08.040 --> 33:12.600
fascinating mysteries and so collecting the data and doing so in a way that

33:12.600 --> 33:15.840
maximizes the possibility of discovery is really interesting, like from

33:15.840 --> 33:17.080
a computational perspective.

33:17.120 --> 33:17.440
I agree.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.120
There's, there's a real satisfaction in extracting the maximum

33:20.120 --> 33:23.040
science per unit time out of your telescope.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.640
And that's, that's the tax job.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.000
Um, but the, the tack are not machines.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.520
They're not a piece of computer code.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.680
Um, they will make their selections based off human judgment.

33:34.120 --> 33:38.400
And, um, a lot of the telescope is certainly within the field of exoplanets

33:38.400 --> 33:41.120
because it's different fields of astronomy, but within the field of exoplanets,

33:41.560 --> 33:44.960
I think a good expectation is that most of the telescope time that

33:44.960 --> 33:50.240
JBC have will go towards atmospheric retrieval, which is, uh, sort of

33:50.240 --> 33:52.600
alluded to earlier, you know, like detecting molecules in the

33:52.600 --> 33:55.200
atmospheres, not biosignatures.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.600
Cause as I said, it's really not designed to do that.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.280
It's pushing GDRST probably too far to expect it to do that, but it could

34:01.280 --> 34:05.560
detect, for example, a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1e.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.440
That's not a biosignature, but you could prove it's like a Venus in that case,

34:09.440 --> 34:12.040
or maybe like a Mars in that case, like both those have carbon dioxide rich

34:12.040 --> 34:16.920
atmospheres doesn't prove or disprove the existence of life either way, but

34:16.920 --> 34:21.000
it is our first characterization of the nature of those atmospheres.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.680
Maybe we can even tell the pressure level and the temperature of those atmospheres.

34:24.120 --> 34:29.200
So that's very exciting, but, um, there's, we, we are competing with that.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.840
And that, I think that science is completely mind blowing and fantastic.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.360
We have a completely different objective, which is in our case, to try

34:36.360 --> 34:39.720
and look for the first evidence of these small moons around these planets.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.120
Um, potentially even moons, which could be habitable, of course.

34:43.160 --> 34:49.160
So I think it's a very exciting goal, but, um, ATT&CK has to make a human judgment

34:49.480 --> 34:54.080
essentially about which science are they most excited by, which one has the

34:54.080 --> 34:58.160
highest promise of return, the most highest chance of return.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.840
And so that's hard because if you look at a planetary atmosphere, well, you

35:02.840 --> 35:06.560
know, most of the time the planet has an atmosphere already, and so there's

35:06.560 --> 35:09.120
almost a guaranteed success that you're going to learn something about the

35:09.120 --> 35:10.880
atmosphere by pointing to the UST edit.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.640
Whereas in that case, there's a harder sell.

35:14.920 --> 35:19.320
We are looking for something that we do not know for sure exists yet or not.

35:19.760 --> 35:25.240
And so we are pushing the telescope to do something which is inherently more risky.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.000
Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:34.040
But the existence is shown already gives a deep lesson about what's out there in

35:34.040 --> 35:38.200
the universe, but that means that other stars have similar types of variety as

35:38.200 --> 35:39.520
we have in our solar system.

35:39.920 --> 35:45.200
They have an IO, they have a Europa and so on, which means like, there's a lot

35:45.200 --> 35:50.600
of possibility for icy planets, for water, for planets, they enable planets

35:50.600 --> 35:54.440
and moons that, I mean, that's super exciting because that, that means

35:54.920 --> 36:01.160
everywhere through our galaxy and beyond that there is just innumerable

36:01.160 --> 36:03.280
possibility for weird creatures.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.120
I agree.

36:04.120 --> 36:04.680
Life forms.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.520
You don't have to convince me.

36:06.320 --> 36:11.120
I mean, NASA has been on this quest for a long time and it's

36:11.120 --> 36:12.200
sometimes called Eater Earth.

36:12.560 --> 36:17.880
It's the frequency of earth-like, usually they say planets in the universe.

36:17.880 --> 36:22.840
How common are planets similar to our earth in terms of, ultimately, we'd

36:22.840 --> 36:25.760
like to know everything about these planets in terms of the amount of water

36:25.760 --> 36:28.720
they have, how much atmosphere they have, but for now, it's kind of focused

36:28.720 --> 36:31.880
just on the size and the distance from the star, essentially.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.360
How often do you get similar conditions to that?

36:35.280 --> 36:39.560
That was Kepler's primary mission and it really just kind of flirted with the

36:39.560 --> 36:44.120
answer, didn't quite get to a definitive answer, but I always say, look, if we're

36:44.120 --> 36:50.120
looking, if that's our primary goal to look for earth-like, I would say worlds,

36:50.640 --> 36:56.400
then moons has to be a part of that because we know that earth-like, from

36:56.400 --> 36:58.800
the Kepler day to the preliminary result is that earth-like planets around

36:58.800 --> 37:01.400
sun-like stars is not an inevitable outcome.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.880
It seems to be something like a one to 10% outcome.

37:04.360 --> 37:09.240
So it's not particularly inevitable that that happens, but we do often see about

37:09.240 --> 37:15.040
half of all sun-like stars have either a mini Neptune, a Neptune or a Jupiter in

37:15.040 --> 37:16.200
the habitable zone of their stars.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.600
That's a very, very common occurrence that we see, yet we have no idea how

37:20.600 --> 37:24.040
often they have moons around them, which could also be habitable.

37:24.360 --> 37:30.800
And so there may very well be, if even one in five of them has an earth-like

37:30.840 --> 37:34.760
moon or even a Mars-like moon around them, then there would be more habitable

37:34.760 --> 37:38.680
real estate in terms of exo-moons than exo-planets in the universe.

37:38.960 --> 37:46.040
Essentially 2x, 3x, 5x, maybe 10x, the number of habitable worlds out there in

37:46.040 --> 37:49.400
the universe, our current estimate, like the Drake equation.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.080
Absolutely.

37:50.200 --> 37:57.080
So this is one way to increase the confidence and increase the value of that parameter.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.320
And just know where to look.

37:58.360 --> 38:02.720
I mean, we would like to know where should we listen for technosignatures?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.680
Where should we be looking for biosignatures?

38:05.800 --> 38:10.600
And not only that, but what role does the moon have in terms of its influence on the planet?

38:11.760 --> 38:15.320
We talked about these directly imaged telescopes earlier, these missions that

38:15.320 --> 38:19.880
want to take a photo to quote Carl Sagan, the pale blue dot of our planet, but the

38:19.880 --> 38:24.360
pale blue dot of an exoplanet, and that's the dream to one day capture that.

38:24.560 --> 38:29.200
But as impressive as the resolution is that we are planning and conspiring to

38:29.200 --> 38:32.640
design for the future generation telescopes to achieve that, even those

38:32.640 --> 38:36.920
telescopes will not have the capability of resolving the earth and the moon within that.

38:36.960 --> 38:42.720
It'll be a pale blue dot pixel, but the moon's gray, grayness will be

38:42.720 --> 38:44.720
intermixed with that pixel.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.480
And so this is a big problem because one of the ways that we are claiming to look

38:48.480 --> 38:52.200
for life in the universe is a chemical disequilibrium.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.880
So you see two molecules that just shouldn't be there.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.640
They normally react with each other or even one molecule that's just too reactive

38:59.640 --> 39:01.360
to be hanging around the atmosphere by itself.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.680
So if you had oxygen and methane hanging out together, those would

39:05.680 --> 39:07.640
normally react fairly easily.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.880
And so if you detected those two molecules in your pale blue dot spectra,

39:12.120 --> 39:14.080
you'd be like, okay, we have evidence for life.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.680
Something's metabolizing on this planet.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.120
However, the challenge is what if that moon was Titan?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.040
Titan has a methane rich atmosphere.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.960
And what if the pale blue dot was in fact a plant devoid of life, but it had

39:28.000 --> 39:32.520
oxygen because of water undergoing this photolysis reaction, splitting into

39:32.520 --> 39:33.920
oxygen, hydrogen separately.

39:34.280 --> 39:39.680
So then you have all of the hallmarks of what we would claim to be life, but

39:39.680 --> 39:40.760
all along you were tricked.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.240
It was just a moon that was deceiving you.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.760
And so we are never going to, we're never going to, I would claim really

39:47.760 --> 39:53.480
understand the, or complete this quest of looking for life by signatures in the

39:53.480 --> 39:59.560
universe, unless we have a deep knowledge of the prevalence and role that moons

39:59.560 --> 40:02.760
have, they may even affect the habitability of the planets themselves.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.320
Of course, our own moon is freakishly large by mass ratio.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.920
It's the largest moon in the solar system.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.280
It's a 1% mass moon.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.880
If you look at Jupiter's moons are like 10 to the power minus four, much smaller.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.600
And so our own moon seems to stabilize the obliquity of our planet.

40:16.920 --> 40:20.800
It gives rise to tides, especially early on when the moon was closer, those tides

40:20.800 --> 40:22.320
would have covered entire continents.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.720
And there's those rock pools that would have been scattered across the entire

40:26.720 --> 40:29.680
plateau may have been the origin of life on our planet.

40:30.160 --> 40:34.480
The moon forming impact may have stripped a significant fraction of lithosphere off

40:34.480 --> 40:37.880
the earth, which without it plate tectonics may not have been possible.

40:37.880 --> 40:41.480
We'd heard a stagnant lid because it was just too much lithosphere stuck on

40:41.480 --> 40:42.600
the top of the planet.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.240
And so there are speculative reasons, but intriguing reasons as to why a large

40:49.240 --> 40:55.840
moon may be not just important, but central to the question of having the

40:55.840 --> 40:57.480
conditions necessary for life.

40:57.480 --> 41:02.880
So moons can be habitable in their own right, but they can also play a

41:02.880 --> 41:06.360
significant influence on the habitability of the planets they orbit.

41:06.840 --> 41:12.440
And further, they will surely interfere with our attempts to detect life.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.000
Remotely from afar.

41:15.040 --> 41:20.880
So, uh, taking a tangent upon a tangent, uh, you've written about binary planets.

41:21.600 --> 41:28.320
What what's and that they're surprisingly common or they might be surprisingly

41:28.320 --> 41:32.160
common, what's the difference between a large moon and binary planets?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.720
What, what, what are binary planets?

41:33.720 --> 41:38.040
What, uh, what, what's interesting to say here about giant rocks, flying

41:38.040 --> 41:39.720
to space and orbiting each other.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.920
The thing that's interesting about binary objects is that they're

41:42.920 --> 41:44.160
very common in the universe.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.120
Binary stars are everywhere.

41:46.440 --> 41:50.160
In fact, the majority of stars seem to live in binary systems.

41:50.600 --> 41:55.160
Um, when we look at the outer edges of the solar system, we see binary

41:55.160 --> 41:56.680
Kuiper belt objects all the time.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.200
Asteroids basically bound to one another.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.200
Pluto-Sharon is kind of an example of that.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.000
It's a 10% mass ratio system.

42:03.440 --> 42:08.080
It almost is by many definitions a binary planet, but now it's a dwarf planet.

42:08.080 --> 42:13.040
So yeah, I don't know what you call that now, but we know that these, you

42:13.040 --> 42:14.840
know, the universe likes to make things in pairs.

42:15.360 --> 42:15.560
Yeah.

42:15.600 --> 42:20.880
Um, so you're saying our sun is an incel it's looking.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.800
So most things are dating, they're in relationships and ours is alone.

42:25.440 --> 42:31.080
It's not a complete freak of the universe to be alone, but it is, um, it's

42:31.080 --> 42:32.600
more common for some next stars.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.240
If you count up all the sun next stars in the universe, about half of the sun

42:35.240 --> 42:37.800
next star systems are in binary or trinary systems.

42:38.160 --> 42:42.200
I knew the half a single, but because those binaries are two or three stars,

42:42.480 --> 42:46.600
then cumulatively, maybe like a third of all Sun like stars, a single.

42:46.680 --> 42:51.880
I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize the relationship with each other.

42:52.360 --> 42:56.840
But yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, I've met those folks also.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.840
So is there something interesting to learn about the habitability, the, how

43:01.840 --> 43:06.920
that affects the probability of habitable worlds when they kind of couple up like

43:06.920 --> 43:08.080
that in those different ways?

43:08.480 --> 43:09.520
Well, it depends.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.560
We're talking about the stars of the planet.

43:10.560 --> 43:15.040
Certainly if stars couple up, that has a big influence on the habitability.

43:15.400 --> 43:19.560
Um, of course, this is very famous from Star Wars, Tatooine in Star Wars is a

43:19.560 --> 43:22.560
binary star system and you have Luke Skywalker looking at the sunset and

43:22.560 --> 43:27.440
seeing two stars come down and, uh, for years, we thought that was purely a

43:27.440 --> 43:33.280
product of George Lucas's incredibly creative mind and we didn't think that

43:33.280 --> 43:35.800
planets would exist around binary star systems.

43:35.800 --> 43:40.760
It seems like too tumultuous an environment for a quiescent planetary

43:40.760 --> 43:47.360
disk, circumstellar disk to form planets from, and yet, uh, one of the astounding

43:47.360 --> 43:50.680
discoveries from Kepler was that these appear to be quite common.

43:51.040 --> 43:54.000
In fact, as far as we can tell, uh, they're just as common around

43:54.000 --> 43:55.440
binary stars as single stars.

43:55.880 --> 44:00.280
The only caveat to that is that you don't get planets close into binary stars.

44:00.520 --> 44:05.360
They have like a clearance region in, on the inside where plants, maybe they form

44:05.360 --> 44:10.160
there, but they don't last, they are dynamically unstable in that zone.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.640
But once you get out to about the distance that the earth orbits the sun,

44:13.640 --> 44:17.680
or even a little bit closer in, you start to find planets emerging.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.640
And so that's the right distance for liquid water.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.680
So a distance for potentially life on those planets.

44:22.920 --> 44:26.520
And so there may very well be plenty of habitable planets around the binary stars.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.360
Binary planets is a little bit different.

44:28.400 --> 44:33.280
Um, binary planets, I don't think we have, um, any serious connection

44:33.760 --> 44:36.360
of planet banarity to habitability.

44:36.760 --> 44:40.680
Certainly when we investigated it, that wasn't our drive, that this is somehow

44:40.680 --> 44:44.920
the solution to life in the universe or anything, it was really just a, like

44:44.920 --> 44:47.760
all good science questions, a curiosity driven question.

44:47.920 --> 44:53.360
What's the dynamic, are they legit orbiting each other as they orbit the star?

44:53.600 --> 44:58.080
So the formation mechanism proposed here, um, cause it is very difficult to form

44:58.400 --> 45:01.480
two proto planets close to each other like this, they would generally

45:01.480 --> 45:02.600
merge within the disk.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.680
And so that's why you normally get single planets, but you could have

45:05.680 --> 45:09.880
something like Jupiter and Saturn form at separate distances, they could

45:09.880 --> 45:14.240
dynamically be scattered in towards one another and basically not quite collide,

45:14.240 --> 45:16.080
but have a very close on encounter.

45:16.720 --> 45:21.880
Now, because, uh, tidal forces increase dramatically as the distance decreases

45:21.880 --> 45:25.600
between two objects, the tides can actually dissipate the kinetic energy

45:25.880 --> 45:28.200
and bring them bound into one another.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.640
So that seems when we, you know, when you first hear that, you think, well,

45:32.640 --> 45:36.200
that seems fairly contrived that you'd have the conditions just right to get

45:36.200 --> 45:39.800
these tides to cause a capture, but numerical simulations have shown that

45:39.800 --> 45:44.440
about 10% of planet-planet encounters are shown to produce something like

45:44.440 --> 45:47.440
binary planets, which is a startling prediction.

45:47.880 --> 45:52.560
Um, and so that seems at odds with naively the exoplanet catalog for which

45:52.560 --> 45:55.120
we know of so far, no binary planets.

45:55.760 --> 45:58.960
And we propose one of the resolutions to this might be that the binary planets

45:58.960 --> 46:03.880
are just incredibly difficult to detect, which is also counterintuitive because

46:04.120 --> 46:06.400
remember how they form is through this tidal mechanism.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.760
And so they form extremely close to each other.

46:08.960 --> 46:12.400
So the distance that Io is away from Jupiter, just a few planetary radii,

46:12.640 --> 46:15.960
they're almost touching one another and they're just tidally locked

46:16.000 --> 46:17.640
facing each other for eternity.

46:18.040 --> 46:21.840
And so in that configuration, as it transits across the star, it kind of

46:21.840 --> 46:24.640
looks like you can't really resolve this two planets.

46:24.640 --> 46:27.440
It just looks like one planet to you that's going across the star.

46:27.640 --> 46:31.080
The temporal resolution of the data is rarely good enough to distinguish that.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.440
And so you'd see one transit, but in fact, it's two planets very close

46:35.440 --> 46:37.400
together, which are transiting at once.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.920
And so, yeah, we wrote a paper just recently where we developed, um, some

46:41.920 --> 46:45.480
techniques to try and get around this problem and hopefully provide a tool

46:45.800 --> 46:48.240
where we could finally look for these planets.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.560
The problem of detection of these planets when they're so close.

46:50.560 --> 46:55.320
That was our focus was how do you, how do you get around this, this merging problem?

46:55.320 --> 47:00.520
So whether they're out there or not, uh, we don't know, we were planning

47:00.520 --> 47:04.360
to do a search for them, but, um, it, it remains an open question.

47:04.360 --> 47:08.200
And I think just one of those fun astrophysics, curiosity is questions

47:08.200 --> 47:11.640
where the binary planets exist in the universe, cause then, you know, you

47:11.640 --> 47:15.040
have binary earths, you could have binary Neptune, all sorts of wild stuff

47:15.040 --> 47:17.840
that would, you know, flow to the sci-fi imagination.

47:17.920 --> 47:22.120
I wonder what the physics on a binary planet feels like.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.400
It might be trivial.

47:23.640 --> 47:24.760
I have to think about that.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.880
I wonder if there's some interesting dynamics.

47:26.880 --> 47:31.080
Like you feel multiple or would gravity feel different at different parts of

47:31.080 --> 47:34.520
the, the surface of the sphere when there's another large sphere that's in.

47:35.120 --> 47:39.920
I would think that the force would be fairly similar because the shape of

47:39.920 --> 47:44.920
the object would deform to a flat geo potential, essentially a uniform geo

47:44.960 --> 47:48.960
potential, but it would lead to a distorted shape for the two objects.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.520
I think there'd become ellipsoids facing one another.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.360
Um, so it would be pretty wild when you, you know, people like flat earth or

47:56.360 --> 47:59.160
spherical earth, you fly from space and you see a football shaped earth.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.360
Finally, there's proof.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.240
And I wonder how difficult it'd be to travel from one to the other.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.520
Cause you have to overcome the one.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.360
No, it might be kind of easy.

48:12.280 --> 48:12.640
Yeah.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.680
I mean, they're so close to each other that helps.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.480
And I think the most critical factor would be how massive is the planet.

48:17.720 --> 48:20.720
That's always, I mean, one of the challenges with escaping planets, there

48:20.720 --> 48:24.920
was a fun paper when my colleagues wrote that suggested that super earth

48:24.920 --> 48:28.680
planets may be inescapable if you're a civilization that were born on a super

48:28.680 --> 48:34.600
earth, the surface gravity is so high that the chemical potential energy of

48:34.600 --> 48:40.600
hydrogen or methane, whatever fuel you're using simply, um, is at odds with

48:40.680 --> 48:42.640
the, with the gravity of the planet itself.

48:42.960 --> 48:46.120
And so you would, uh, you know, our current rockets, I'm not sure with

48:46.120 --> 48:49.360
the fraction, but maybe like 90% of the rocket is fuel or something by mass.

48:49.640 --> 48:54.200
These things would have to be, um, like the size of the geyser pyramids of

48:54.200 --> 48:58.280
fuel with just a tiny tip on the top in order just to escape that planetary

48:58.280 --> 48:58.800
atmosphere.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.680
And so it has been argued that if you live on a super earth, you may be,

49:03.760 --> 49:05.240
you may be forced to live there forever.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.160
There may be no escape unless you invent a space elevator or something.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.240
But then how do you even build the infrastructure in space to do something

49:12.240 --> 49:15.200
like that in the absence of a successful rocket program?

49:15.680 --> 49:20.160
Um, and so the more and more we, we look at our earth and think about the sorts

49:20.160 --> 49:24.760
of problems we're facing, the more you see things about the earth, which make

49:24.760 --> 49:29.200
it ideally suited in so many regards, it's almost spooky, right?

49:29.200 --> 49:33.600
That we not only live on a planet, which has the right conditions for life, for

49:33.600 --> 49:37.240
intelligent life, for sustained fossil fuel industry just happens to be in the

49:37.240 --> 49:40.320
ground. We have plenty of fossil fuels that to get our industrial revolution

49:40.320 --> 49:45.560
going. Um, but also the chemical energy contained within those fossil fuels,

49:45.880 --> 49:49.680
um, and hydrogen and other fuels is sufficient that we have the ability to

49:49.680 --> 49:53.440
escape our planetary atmosphere and planetary gravity to have a space

49:53.440 --> 49:57.800
program. And we also happen to have a celestial body, which is just within

49:57.800 --> 50:02.320
reach, the moon, uh, which doesn't also necessarily have to be true where the

50:02.320 --> 50:07.520
moon not there, what effect would that have had on our aspirations of a space

50:07.520 --> 50:11.760
program in the 1960s? Would there have ever been a space race to Mars or to

50:11.760 --> 50:15.760
Venus? That's a much harder, certainly for a human program, that seems almost

50:15.760 --> 50:18.840
impossible with 1960s technology to imagine ever come to fruition.

50:18.840 --> 50:23.360
It's almost as if somebody constructed a set of, uh, challenging obstacles

50:23.360 --> 50:28.240
before us, challenging problems to solve. They're challenging, but they're

50:28.240 --> 50:31.880
doable and there's a sequence of them. Gravity is very difficult to

50:31.880 --> 50:36.840
overcome, but we have given the size of earth. It's not so bad that we can

50:36.840 --> 50:39.800
still actually construct proportional systems that can escape it.

50:40.040 --> 50:43.160
Yeah. And the same with climate change, perhaps. I mean, climate change is the

50:43.160 --> 50:48.440
next major problem facing our civilization, but we know it is

50:48.440 --> 50:53.240
technically surmountable. You know, it's, it's a, it's, it is, it does seem

50:53.240 --> 50:57.920
sometimes like there has been a series of challenges laid out to, um, progress

50:58.080 --> 51:02.480
towards a mature civilization that can one day perhaps expand to the stars.

51:02.880 --> 51:08.200
I'm a little more concerned about nuclear weapons, uh, AI and, uh, uh, natural

51:08.200 --> 51:10.280
or artificial pandemics, but yes, climate change.

51:10.920 --> 51:15.440
Plenty, plenty of milestones that we need to cross. Uh, and we can argue

51:15.440 --> 51:19.040
about the severity of each of them, but, uh, there is no doubt that we live

51:19.040 --> 51:24.040
in a world that has serious challenges that are pushing our intellects in our

51:24.040 --> 51:29.720
will to the limit of whether we're really ready to progress to the next

51:29.720 --> 51:31.040
stage of our development.

51:31.320 --> 51:34.920
So thank you for taking the tangent and there'll be a million more, but can we

51:34.920 --> 51:41.160
step back to Kepler 1625B? What is it? And you, you've talked about this kind

51:41.160 --> 51:49.600
of journey, this effort to discover, uh, exo moons, so moons out there, uh, or

51:49.600 --> 51:52.040
small, cool objects out there.

51:52.360 --> 51:55.760
Uh, where does that effort stand and what is Kepler 1625B?

51:56.360 --> 52:00.200
Yeah, I mean, I've been searching for me for most of my professional career.

52:00.240 --> 52:06.240
And I think a lot of my colleagues think I'm kind of crazy to still be doing it.

52:06.320 --> 52:11.400
You know, after, after five years of not finding anything, I think most people

52:11.400 --> 52:12.720
would probably try doing something else.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.920
I even had people say that to me.

52:13.920 --> 52:17.840
They said, um, you know, professors and I remember the cocktail party took me

52:17.840 --> 52:22.240
to the side and MIT professor and he said, um, you know, you should just look,

52:22.280 --> 52:23.160
look for hot Jupiters.

52:23.160 --> 52:23.720
They're everywhere.

52:23.720 --> 52:25.280
It's really, you can write papers.

52:25.640 --> 52:26.760
That's so easy to find.

52:27.960 --> 52:32.120
I was like, yeah, but hot Jupiters just, they're not interesting to me.

52:32.120 --> 52:37.080
I want to do something that I feel intellectually pushes me to the edge.

52:37.080 --> 52:42.800
And it's maybe a contribution that not no one else could do, but maybe, um, is

52:42.800 --> 52:44.560
not certainly the thing that anybody could do.

52:44.600 --> 52:47.800
I don't want to just be the first to something for the sake of being first.

52:47.800 --> 52:51.120
I want to do something that feels like a meaningful intellectual

52:51.120 --> 52:52.800
contribution to our society.

52:53.120 --> 52:56.600
And so, you know, this ex-I mean problem has been haunting me for

52:56.600 --> 52:57.920
years to try and solve this.

52:58.280 --> 53:02.120
Now, as I said, we looked for years and years using Kepler and the

53:02.120 --> 53:07.200
closest we ever got was just a hint for this one star Kepler 1625 has a

53:07.200 --> 53:09.120
Jupiter light planet in orbit of it.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.960
And that Jupiter light planet is on a 287 day period.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.400
So it's almost the same distance as the earth around the sun, but for a Jupiter.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.720
Um, so that was already unusual.

53:20.720 --> 53:24.960
I don't think people realize that Jupiter like planets are quite rare in the universe.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.520
Certainly many net tunes and net tunes are extremely common, but Jupiters only

53:29.520 --> 53:33.400
about 10% of sunlight stars have Jupiters around them as far as we can tell.

53:33.560 --> 53:36.000
When you say Jupiter, which aspect of Jupiter?

53:36.080 --> 53:39.360
In terms of its mass and it's a major axis.

53:39.360 --> 53:43.400
So anything beyond about half an AU, so half the distance of the earth and the

53:43.400 --> 53:47.720
sun, and something of order of, um, a 10th of a Jupiter mass, that's

53:47.720 --> 53:51.680
the mass of Saturn up to say 10 Jupiter masses, which is basically where

53:51.680 --> 53:52.800
you start to get to brown dwarfs.

53:53.200 --> 53:56.160
Those types of objects appear to be somewhat unusual.

53:56.200 --> 54:01.200
Most solar systems do not have Jupiters, which is really interesting because

54:01.640 --> 54:06.440
Jupiter, again, like the moon seems to have been a pivotal character in the

54:06.440 --> 54:09.840
story of the development of our solar system, perhaps especially having a

54:09.840 --> 54:13.880
large influence of the development of, um, the late heavy bombardment and the

54:13.880 --> 54:16.080
rate of asteroid impacts that we receive and things like this.

54:16.800 --> 54:21.280
Anyway, to come back to 1625, this, this Jupiter light planet, um, had a

54:21.280 --> 54:23.360
hint of, of something in the data.

54:23.360 --> 54:26.320
But what I mean by that is when we looked at the transit, we got the

54:26.320 --> 54:30.280
familiar decrease in light that we always see when a planet tries in front of the

54:30.280 --> 54:34.280
star, but we saw something extra just on the edges, we saw some extra

54:34.600 --> 54:36.120
dips around the outside.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.200
It was right at the hairy edge of detectability.

54:39.640 --> 54:45.240
We didn't believe it because, um, I think one of the challenges of looking

54:45.240 --> 54:49.280
for something for 10 years is that you become your own greatest skeptic.

54:49.320 --> 54:53.600
And no matter what you're shown, you're always thinking I've been, it's like

54:53.640 --> 54:56.400
falling in love so many times and it, and it not working out.

54:56.920 --> 55:01.160
You, you convince yourself it's never going to be, it's never going to happen.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.640
Not for me, you know, this just isn't, this isn't going to happen.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.920
And so I saw that and I didn't really believe it because I didn't

55:06.920 --> 55:09.040
dare let myself believe it.

55:09.800 --> 55:14.960
But being a good scientist, we knew we had an obligation to publish it, to

55:14.960 --> 55:18.760
talk about the result and to follow it up and to try and resolve what was going on.

55:19.520 --> 55:24.400
So we asked for Hubble space telescope time, which was awarded in that case.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.120
So we were one of those lucky 20 that got telescope time.

55:27.600 --> 55:31.000
And we stared at it, uh, for about 40 hours continuously.

55:31.760 --> 55:36.160
And, um, the, to provide some context, the dip that we saw on the

55:36.160 --> 55:40.360
Kepler data corresponded to a Neptune size moon around a Jupiter sized planet,

55:40.360 --> 55:42.440
which was another reason why I was skeptical.

55:42.680 --> 55:45.000
That we didn't have that in the solar system.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.040
That seems so strange.

55:46.680 --> 55:51.720
And then when we got the Hubble data, it seemed to confirm exactly that there was

55:52.440 --> 55:56.920
two really striking pieces of evidence in the data that suggested this moon was there.

55:57.560 --> 56:02.440
Another was a fairly clear second dip in light, pretty clearly resolved by Hubble.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.040
It was about a five sigma detection.

56:04.680 --> 56:09.320
And on top of that, we could see the planet didn't transit when it should have done.

56:09.320 --> 56:13.080
It actually transited earlier than we expected it to by about 20 minutes or so.

56:13.640 --> 56:17.320
And so that's a hallmark of a gravitational interaction between the planet and the moon.

56:17.320 --> 56:18.760
We actually expected that.

56:18.760 --> 56:21.800
You can also expect that if the moon transits after the planet,

56:22.360 --> 56:27.160
then the planet should come in earlier than expected because the barycenter,

56:27.160 --> 56:29.000
the center of mass lives between the two of them.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.560
It kind of like on a balancing arm between them.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.400
And so we saw that as well.

56:33.400 --> 56:34.840
So the phase signature matched up.

56:35.400 --> 56:38.200
The mass of the moon was measured to be Neptune mass.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.640
And the size of the moon was measured to be Neptune radius.

56:41.640 --> 56:45.640
And so everything just really lined up.

56:45.640 --> 56:49.640
And we spent months and months trying to kill it.

56:50.200 --> 56:52.280
This is my strategy for anything interesting.

56:52.920 --> 56:57.080
We just try to throw the kitchen sink at it and say, we must be tricked by something.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.840
And so we tried looking at the centroid motion of the telescope,

57:00.840 --> 57:06.120
but the different wavelength channels have been observed, the pixel level information.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.680
And no matter what we did, we just couldn't get rid of it.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.480
And so we submit it to science.

57:11.480 --> 57:14.600
And I think at the time, science, which is one of the top journals said to us,

57:15.160 --> 57:17.640
would you mind calling your paper discovery of an exo moon?

57:18.680 --> 57:22.360
And I had to push back and we said, no, we're not calling it that.

57:23.640 --> 57:26.360
Even despite everything we've done, we're not calling it a discovery.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.320
We're calling it evidence for an exo moon.

57:29.320 --> 57:34.120
Because for me, I'd want to see this repeat two times, three times, four times,

57:34.120 --> 57:38.200
before I really would bet my house that this is the real deal.

57:38.200 --> 57:43.640
And I do worry, as I said, that perhaps that's my own skepticism, self-skepticism going too far.

57:44.360 --> 57:47.000
But I think it was the right decision.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.800
And since that paper came out, there has been continuous interest in this object.

57:52.440 --> 57:57.480
Another team independently analyzed that star and recovered actually pretty much exactly the

57:57.480 --> 58:02.200
same results as us, the same dip, the same wobble of the planet.

58:02.280 --> 58:04.920
And a third team looked at it and they actually got something different.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.640
They saw the dip was diminished compared to what we saw.

58:07.640 --> 58:10.600
They saw a little hint of a dip, but not as pronounced as what we saw.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.560
And they saw the wobble as well.

58:13.560 --> 58:20.440
So there's been a little bit of tension about analyzing the reduction of the Hubble data.

58:21.720 --> 58:25.400
And so the only way in my mind to resolve this is just to look again.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.920
We actually did propose to Hubble straight after that.

58:28.920 --> 58:35.240
And we said, look, if our model is right, if the Moon is there, it came in late last time.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.640
It transited after the planet.

58:37.640 --> 58:42.040
Because of the orbit, we can calculate that it should transit before the planet next time.

58:42.920 --> 58:46.440
If it's not there, if it doesn't transit before, and even if we see a dip afterwards,

58:46.440 --> 58:47.880
we know that's not our Moon.

58:47.880 --> 58:49.880
It's obviously some instrumental effect with the data.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.920
We had a causal prediction as to where the Moon should be.

58:53.640 --> 58:57.320
And so I was really excited about that, but we didn't get the telescope time.

58:57.880 --> 59:02.760
Unfortunately, if you go further into the future, we no longer have the predictive capability.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.120
Because it's like predicting the weather.

59:04.120 --> 59:07.320
You might be able to predict the weather next week to some level of accuracy,

59:07.320 --> 59:10.360
but predicting the weather next year becomes incredibly hard.

59:10.360 --> 59:14.840
The uncertainties just grow and compound as you go forward into the future more and more.

59:14.840 --> 59:18.200
How were you able to know where the Moon would be positioned?

59:18.200 --> 59:25.960
So you're able to tell the orbiting geometry and frequency?

59:26.200 --> 59:29.560
Yeah, so basically from the wobbles of the planet itself,

59:30.120 --> 59:34.040
that tells us the orbital motion of the Moon.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.120
It's the reflex motion of the Moon upon the planet.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.800
Isn't it just an estimate where...

59:39.880 --> 59:42.280
I'm concerned about you making a strong prediction here.

59:42.280 --> 59:48.360
Because if you don't get the Moon where the Moon leads on the next time around,

59:48.360 --> 59:51.640
if you did get in the Hubble time, couldn't that mean something else if you didn't see that?

59:52.760 --> 59:54.440
Because you said it would be an instrumental...

59:55.400 --> 01:00:03.960
I feel the strong urge to disprove your own, which is a really good imperative.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.160
It's a good way to do science.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.840
But this is such a noisy signal, right?

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.440
Or blurry signal, maybe.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.840
Low resolution signal, maybe.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.440
Yeah, I mean, it's a five sigma signal.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.240
So that's at the slightly uncomfortable edge.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.600
I mean, it's often said that for any detection of a first new phenomena,

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.960
you really want like a 20, 25 sigma detection.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.840
Then there's just no doubt that what you're seeing is real.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.600
This was at that edge.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.520
I mean, I guess it's comparable to the Higgs boson,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.640
but the Higgs boson was slightly different because there was so much theoretical impetus

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.000
as to expect a signal at that precise location.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.200
A Neptune-sized Moon was not predicted by anyone.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.920
There was no papers you can find that expect Neptune-sized Moons around Jupiter-sized planets.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.760
So I think we were inherently skeptical about its reality for that reason.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.160
But this is science in action.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.160
When we fit the wobbles, we fit the dips,

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.320
and we have this 3G geometric model for the motion of the orbit.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:04.040
And projecting that forward, we found that about 80% of our projections

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.560
led to the Moon to be before.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.280
So it's not 100%.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.200
There was maybe 20% of the cases it was over here.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.920
But to me, that was a hard enough projection

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.280
that we felt confident that we could refute the exit,

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.320
which was what I really wanted.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.720
I wanted a refutable, that's the basis of science, a falsifiable hypothesis.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.000
How can you make progress in science

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.320
if you don't have a falsifiable testable hypothesis?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.280
And so that was the beauty of this particular case.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840
So there's a numerical simulation with the Moon

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.720
that fits the data that we observed,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.280
and then you can now make predictions based on that simulation.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:38.780
Yeah.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.840
That's so cool.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.360
It's fun.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.040
These are like little solar systems that we can simulate on the computer

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.880
and imagine their motions.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.080
But we are pushing things to the very limits of what's possible,

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.360
and that's double-edged sword.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.240
It's both incredibly exciting intellectually,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.840
but you're always risking to some degree the pushing too far.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.240
I'd like to ask you about the recent paper you co-authored,

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.480
an exomoon survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets,

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.160
and the new candidate Kepler 1708 BI.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.200
I'd say there's like three or four candidates at this point,

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200
of which we have published two of them,

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.040
and to me, two are quite compelling and deserve follow-up observations.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.400
And so to get a confirmed detection, at least in our case,

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.320
we would need to see it repeat for sure.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.240
One of the problems with some of the other methods

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.120
that have been proposed is that you don't get that repeatability.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.000
So for instance, an example of a technique that would lack that

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.920
would be gravitational microlensing.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.720
So it is possible with a new telescope coming up in the future,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.120
called the Roman Space Telescope,

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.760
which is basically a repurposed spy satellite

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.960
that's the size of the Hubble mirror going up into space.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.720
It will stare at millions of stars simultaneously,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.640
and it will look to see,

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.800
instead of whether any of those stars get dimmer for a short amount of time,

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.160
which would be a transit,

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.280
it'll look for the opposite.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.360
It'll look to see if anything can get brighter.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.880
And that brightness increase is caused by another planetary system

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.000
passing in front and then gravitationally lensing light around it to cause a brightening.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.720
And so this is a method of discovering an entire solar system,

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.000
but only for a glimpse.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.920
You just get a short glimpse of it passing like a ship sailing through the night,

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.440
just that one photo of it.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.200
Now, the problem with that is that it's very difficult.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.960
The physics of gravitational lensing are not surprisingly quite complicated.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.040
And so there's many, many possible solutions.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.280
So you might have a solution, which is this could be a red dwarf star

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.240
with a Jupiter-like planet around it.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.360
That's one solution.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.000
But another solution is that it's a free-floating planet,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
a rogue planet like Jupiter with an Earth-like moon around it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.240
And those two solutions are almost indistinguishable.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.400
Now, ideally, we would be able to repeat the observation.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.520
We'd be able to go back and see,

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.880
well, if the moon really is there,

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.040
then we could predict its mass is predicted as motion

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.920
and expected to be maybe over here next time or something.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.720
With microlensing, it's a one snapshot event.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.680
And so for me, it's intriguing as a way of revealing something

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.280
about the exo-moon population.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.000
But I always come back to transits because it's the only method

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.720
we really have that's absolutely repeatable,

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.800
that we'll be able to come back and prove to everyone

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.680
that, look, on the 17th of October, the moon will be over here,

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.880
and the moon will look like this, and we can actually capture that image.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.640
And that's what we see with, of course, many exoplanets.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.760
So we want to get to that same point of full confidence,

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.280
full confirmation, the slam dunk detection of these exo-moons.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.680
But yeah, it's been a hell of a journey

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.760
to try and push the field into that direction.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.200
And is there some resistance to the transit method?

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.520
I just say to exo-moons.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.800
So the transit method is by far the most popular method

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.400
for looking for exoplanets.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:09.000
But yeah, as I've alluded to, exo-moons is kind of a niche topic

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.160
within the discipline of exoplanets.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.000
And that's largely because there are people, I think,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.360
are waiting for those slam dunks.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.520
And it was like, if you go back to the first exoplanet discovery

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.880
that was made in 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Calloz,

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.760
I think it's true at the time that they were seen as mavericks,

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.680
that the idea of looking for planets around stars was considered fringe science.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.640
And I'm sure many colleagues told them,

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.240
why don't you do something more safe, like study eclipsing stars?

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.400
Two binary star systems, we know those exist.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400
So why are you wasting your time looking for planets?

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.000
You're going to get this alien moniker or something,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.880
and you'll be seen as a fringe maverick scientist.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.560
And so I think it was quite difficult for those early planet hunters

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.360
to get legitimacy and be taken seriously.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.000
And so very few people risked their careers to do it,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.320
except for those that were either emboldened to try

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.520
or had maybe the career, maybe like tenure or something.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.800
So they didn't have to necessarily worry about the implications of failure.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.880
And so once that happened, once they made the first discoveries,

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.360
overnight, everyone and their dog was getting into exoplanets.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.480
And all of a sudden, the whole astronomy community shifted

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.280
and huge numbers of people that were once upon a time studying eclipsing binaries

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.600
changed to becoming exoplanet scientists.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.160
And so that was the first wave of exoplanet scientists.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.200
We're now in a kind of a second wave or even a third wave

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.480
where people like me to some degree kind of grew up

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.560
with the idea of exoplanets as being normal.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.400
I was 11 years old, I guess, when the first exoplanet was discovered.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.880
And so to me, it was a fairly normal idea to grow up with.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.560
And so we've been trained in exoplanets from the very beginning.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.120
And so that brings a different perspective to those who have

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.440
maybe transitioned from a different career path.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.440
And so I suspect with exomoons and probably technosignatures,

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:13.320
astrobiology, many of the topics which are seen at the fringes of what's possible,

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.400
they will all open up into becoming mainstream one day.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.320
But there's a lot of people who are just waiting for that assuredness

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.120
that there is a secure career net ahead of them before they commit.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:36.280
Yeah, it does seem to me that exomoons open wider or open for the first time the door to aliens.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:41.640
So more seriously academically studying, all right, let's look at alien worlds.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.440
So I think it's still pretty fringe to talk about alien life,

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440
even on Mars and the moons and so on.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.160
You're kind of like, you know, it would be nice.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.520
But imagine the first time you discover a living organism.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.480
That's going to change.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.160
Then everybody will look like an idiot for not focusing everything on this.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.480
Because the possibility of the things will, it's possible it might be super boring.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.480
It might be very boring bacteria.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.520
But even the existence of life elsewhere, I mean, that changes everything.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.120
That means life is everywhere.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.520
Yeah, if you knew now that in five years, 10 years,

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.680
the first life would be discovered elsewhere, you knew that in advance.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.600
It would surely affect the way you approach your entire career.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.480
As a, especially someone junior in astronomy, you would surely be like,

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.920
well, this is clearly going to be the direction I have to dedicate my classes

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.880
and my training and my education towards that direction.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:40.440
All the new textbooks, all the, and I think there's a lot of value to hedging,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.760
like allocating some of the time to that possibility because the kind of discovery

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.120
the kind of discoveries we might get in the next few decades,

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:57.480
it feels like we're on the verge of a lot of getting a lot of really good data and

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.280
having better and better tools that can process that data.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.520
So there's just going to be a continuous increase of the kind of discoveries that will open.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.040
But a slam dunk, that's hard to come by.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.320
Yeah, I think a lot of us are anticipating,

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.520
I mean, we're already seeing it to some degree with Venus and the phosphine incident.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.160
But we've seen it before with Bill Clinton and the White House lawn announcing life

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.360
from Mars and there are inevitably going to be spurious claims or at least claims which are

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.080
ambiguous to some degree.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.120
There will be for sure a high profile journal like Nature of Science that will one day publish a

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.960
paper saying by a signature discovered or something like that on Trappist One or some other planet.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.960
And then there will be years of back and forth in the literature.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.760
That might seem frustrating, but that's how science works.

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:53.400
That's the mechanism of science at play of people scrutinizing the results to intense skepticism.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.760
It's like a crucible.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.600
You burn away all the relevances until whatever is left is the truth.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.600
And so you're left with this product which is that, okay,

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.920
we either believe or don't believe that by signatures are there.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.480
So there's inevitably going to be a lot of controversy and debate and argument about it.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.080
We just have to anticipate that.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.160
And so I think you have to basically have a thick skin to some degree,

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.880
academically, to dive into that world.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.520
And you're seeing that with phosphine.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.600
It's been uncomfortable to watch from the outside

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.640
the kind of dialogue that some of the scientists have been having with each other about that.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.440
They get a little aggressive.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.600
You can understand why because…

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:41.880
Jealousy?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.360
I don't know.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.600
That's me saying, not you.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.400
That's me talking.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.120
I'm sure there's some envy and jealousy involved

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.800
on the behalf of those who are not part of the visual discovery.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.400
But there's also, in any case, just leave the particular people involved in Venus alone,

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.920
in any case of making a claim of that magnitude, especially life,

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.000
because life is pretty much one of the biggest discoveries of all time,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.280
you can imagine scientifically.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.680
You can see, and I'm so conscious of this in myself when I get close to, as I said,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.920
even the much smaller goal of setting an exomoon, the ego creep in.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.800
And so as a scientist, we have to be so guarded against our own egos.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:35.480
You see the lights in your eyes of a Nobel Prize or the fame and fortune

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.840
and being remembered in the history books.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.760
And we all grew up in our training learning about Newton and Einstein,

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.880
these giants of the field, Feynman and Maxwell.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.800
And you get the idea of these individual contributions,

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.120
which get immortalized for all time.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.480
And that's seductive.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.040
It's why many of us with the skill set to go into maybe banking instead decided,

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.800
actually, there's something about the idea of being immortalized

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.680
and contributing towards society in a permanent way

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.400
that is more attractive than the financial reward of applying my skills elsewhere.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.040
So to some degree, that ego can be a benefit

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.920
because it brings in skillful people into our field

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.000
who might otherwise be tempted by money elsewhere.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:20.920
But on the other hand, the closer you get towards

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.000
when you start flirting with that Nobel Prize in your eyes

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.760
or you think you're on the verge of seeing something, you can lose objectivity.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.520
A very famous example of this is Barnard's star.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.840
There was a planet claimed there by Peter van der Kamp, I think it was in 1968, 69.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.960
And at the time, it would have been the first ever exoplanet ever claimed.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.160
And he felt assured that this planet was there.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.840
He was actually using the wobbling star method,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.360
but using the positions of the stars to see them to claim this exoplanet.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.520
It turned out that this planet was not there.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.200
Subsequent analyses by both dynamicists and theorists

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.960
and those looking at the instrumental data established fairly unanimously

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.600
that there was no way this planet was really there.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.320
But Peter van der Kamp insisted it was there,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.600
despite overwhelming evidence that was accruing against him.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.000
And even to the day he died, which was, I think, in the early 90s,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.680
he was still insisting this planet was there,

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.120
even when we were starting to make the first genuine exoplanet discoveries.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.960
And even at that point, I think Hubble had even looked at that star

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.200
and had totally ruled out any possibility of what he was talking about.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.200
And so that's a problem.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.440
How do you get to a point as a scientist where

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.040
you just can't accept anything that comes otherwise?

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.760
Because it starts out with the dream of fame,

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.600
and then it ends in a stubborn refusal to ever back down.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.160
Of course, the flip side of that is sometimes you need that

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.120
to have the strength to carry a belief

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.040
against the entire scientific community that resists your beliefs.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.480
And so it's a double-edged sword.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.160
That can happen, but I guess the distinction here is evidence.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:09.400
Yes.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.080
So in this case, the evidence was so overwhelming.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.720
It wasn't really a matter of interpretation.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.160
You'd observe this star with the same star,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.800
but with maybe 10, even 100 times greater precision

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.680
for prolonged, much longer periods of time.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.800
And there was just no doubt at this point this planet was a mirage.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.440
And so that's why you have to be very careful.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.800
I always say, don't ever name my wife and my daughter.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.120
Name this planet after me that you discover.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.000
And I can't ever name a planet after you,

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.880
because I won't be objective anymore.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.600
How could I ever turn around to you and say

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.000
that planet wasn't real that I named after you?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.280
So you're somebody that talks about, and it's clear in your eyes

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.200
and in your way of being, that you love the process of discovery,

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.960
that joy, the magic of just seeing something,

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.960
a new observation, a new idea.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.800
But I guess the point is, when you have that great feeling,

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.800
is to then switch on the skepticism.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.320
To start testing what does this actually mean?

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.440
Is this real?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.400
What are the possible different interpretations

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.200
that could make this a lot less grand than I first imagined?

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.360
So both have the wonder and the skepticism all in one brain.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.000
Yeah, I think generally the more I want something to be true,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.240
the more I inherently doubt it.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.600
And I think that just comes from, I grew up with a religious family

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.880
and was just sort of indoctrinated to some degree,

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.960
like many children are, that, okay, this is just normal,

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.440
that there's a God and this is the way the world is.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.880
God created the earth.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.440
And then as I became more well-read and illiterate

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.840
of what was happening in the world scientifically,

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.120
I started to doubt.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.560
And it really just struck me that the hardest thing to let go of

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.760
when you do decide not to be religious anymore,

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.240
and it's not really like a light bulb moment,

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.280
but it just kind of happens over sort of 11 to 13,

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.400
I think for me it was happening.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.920
But it's that sadness of letting go of this beautiful dream

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.000
which you had in your mind of eternal life

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.040
for behaving yourself on earth.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.520
You would have this beautiful heaven that you could go to

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.640
and live forever.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.480
And that's very attractive.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.720
And for me personally, that was one of the things

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.960
that pulled me against it, it's like it's too good to be true.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.000
And it's very convenient that this could be so.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.160
And I have no evidence directly in terms of a scientific sense

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.000
to support this hypothesis.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.520
And it just became really difficult to reconcile

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.560
my growth as a scientist.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.720
And I know some people find that reconciliation.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.160
I have not, maybe I will one day.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.640
But as a general guiding principle,

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.840
which I think I obtained from that experience,

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.720
was that I have to be extremely guarded

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.040
about what I want to be true because it's going to sway me

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.040
to say things which are not true if I'm not careful.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.920
And that's not what we're trying to do as scientists.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.160
So you felt from a religious perspective

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.400
that there was a little bit of a gravitational field

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.760
in terms of your opinions,

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.920
like it was affecting how you could be as a scientist.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.360
Like as a scientific thinker, obviously you were young.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:41.960
Yeah, I think that's true, that whenever there's something

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:47.640
you want to be true, it's the ultimate seduction intellectually.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.280
And I worry about this a lot with UFOs and it's true already

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.280
with things like Venus, Phosphine,

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.840
and searching for astrobiological signals.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.280
We have to guard against this all the way through

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.880
from however we're looking for life,

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.440
however we're looking for whatever this big question is.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.120
There is a part of us, I think,

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.360
I would love that to be life in the universe.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.320
I hope there is life in the universe,

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:20.760
but I've been on record several times as being fairly firm

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.720
about trying to remain consciously agnostic

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.000
about that question.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.760
I don't want to make up my mind about what the answer is

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.560
before I've collected evidence to inform that decision.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.160
That's how science should work.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.240
If I already know what the answer is, then what am I doing?

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.000
That's not a scientific experiment anymore.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.480
You've already decided, so what are you trying to learn?

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.160
What's the point of doing the experiment

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.120
if you already know what the answer is?

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:44.920
There's no point.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.800
It's so complicated because if I'm being honest with myself,

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.040
when I imagine the universe,

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.400
so first thing I imagine about our world

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.040
is that we humans and me certainly

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.120
as one particular human,

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.400
my first assumption is I know almost nothing

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.760
about how anything works.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.120
So first of all, that actually applies for things

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.600
that humans do know like quantum mechanics

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.680
and all the things that there's different expertises

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.120
that I just have not dedicated to.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.800
So even that starting point,

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.680
but if we take all of knowledge as human civilization,

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.040
we know almost nothing.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.960
That's kind of an assumption I have

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.920
because it seems like we keep discovering mysteries

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.440
and it seems like history, human history

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440
is defined by moments when we said,

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.960
okay, we pretty much figured it all out

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.560
and then you realise a century later,

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.640
when you said that you didn't figure out anything.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.640
Okay, so that's like a starting point.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.560
The second thing I have is I feel like

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.640
the entirety of the universe

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.880
is just filled with alien civilizations.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.640
Statistically, the important thing

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.640
that enables that belief for me

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.040
is that they don't have to be human-like.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.320
They can be anything.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.680
And it's just the fact that life exists

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.600
and just seeing the way life is on earth

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.680
that it just finds a way.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.640
It finds a way in so many different

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.000
complicated environments.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.120
It finds a way.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.240
Whatever that force is,

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.680
that same force has to find a way elsewhere also.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.560
But then if I'm also being honest

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.120
and I don't know how many hours in a day

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.000
I spend seriously considering

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.360
the possibility that we're alone.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.480
I don't know when my heart is in mind

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.520
or filled with wonder,

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.000
I think about all the different life that's out there.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.280
But to really imagine that we're alone,

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.160
like really imagine all the vastness that's out there,

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.880
we're alone, not even bacteria.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.880
I would say you don't have to believe that we are alone,

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.800
but you have to admit it's a possibility

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.040
of our ignorance of the universe so far.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.960
You can have a belief about something

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.240
in the absence of evidence.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.200
Carl Sagan famously described that

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.560
as the definition of faith.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.960
If you believe something when there's no evidence,

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.600
you have faith that there's life in the universe.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.000
But you can't demonstrate,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.600
you can't prove it mathematically,

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.200
you can't show me evidence of that.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.600
So mathematically, math is a funny thing.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.600
Is there, I mean, the way physicists think,

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.160
like intuition, so basic reasoning.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.360
Is there some value to that?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.800
Well, I'd say you can certainly make a very good argument.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.560
I think you've kind of already made one,

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.720
just the vastness of the universe

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.760
is the default argument people often turn to,

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.000
that surely there should be others out there.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.120
It's hard to imagine.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.800
There are an order of 10 to the 22 stars

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.240
in our observable universe.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.800
And so really the question comes down to

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.040
what is the probability of the universe

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.480
being a place of existence?

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.080
It comes down to what is the probability

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.800
of one of those 10 to the 22 planets,

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.840
let's say, Earth-like planets,

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.880
if they all have Earth-like planets,

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.520
going on to form life spontaneously.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
That's the process of abiogenesis,

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.000
the spontaneous emergence of life.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.960
Also the word spontaneous is a funny word.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.320
Okay, maybe we won't use spontaneous,

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.480
but not being, so to say,

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.320
seeded by some other civilization

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.280
or something like this.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.480
It naturally emerges.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.920
Because even the word spontaneous

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.080
makes it seem less likely.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.560
Like there's just this chemistry

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.760
and an extremely random process.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.360
It could be a very gradual process

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.680
over millions of years of growing complexity

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.880
in chemical networks.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.800
Maybe there's a force in the universe

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.360
that pushes it towards interesting complexity,

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.400
pockets of complexity,

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.520
that ultimately creates something like life,

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.360
which we can't possibly define yet.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.120
And sometimes it manifests itself

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.800
into something that looks like humans,

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.640
but it can be a totally different kind

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.200
of computational information processing system

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.520
that we're too dumb to even visualize.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.520
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.120
that complexity develops at all, right?

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.480
Because it seems like the opposite

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.000
to our physical intuition,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:09.880
if you're training in physics,

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.240
of entropy that things should,

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.800
complexity is hard to spontaneously,

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.000
or I shouldn't say spontaneously,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.360
but hard to emerge in general.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960
And so that's an interesting problem.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.080
I think there's been,

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.760
certainly from an evolutionary perspective,

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760
you do see growing complexity.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.200
And there's a nice argument,

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.760
I think it's by Gould who shows that

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.840
if you have a certain amount of complexity,

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.800
it can either become less complex

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.040
or more complex through random mutation.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.160
And the less complex things

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.080
are stripping away something,

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.200
something that was necessary

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.480
potentially to their survival.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.840
And so in general,

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.640
that's going to be not particularly useful

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.360
in its survival.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.720
And so it's going to be detrimental

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.320
to strip away a significant amount

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.840
of its useful traits.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.600
Whereas if you add something,

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.480
the most typical thing that you add

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.600
is probably not useful at all.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.320
It's probably just,

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.680
it doesn't really affect its survival negatively,

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.800
but it neither does it provide

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.080
any significant benefit.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.880
But sometimes on rare occasions,

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.160
of course, it will be of benefit.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.960
And so if you have a certain level of complexity,

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.720
it's hard to go back in complexity,

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:14.120
but it's fairly easy to go forward

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.880
with enough bites at the cherry.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.720
You will eventually build up in complexity.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.120
And that tends to be why we see complexity

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.080
grow in, certainly in an evolutionary sense,

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.160
but also perhaps it's operating

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.360
in chemical networks

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.720
that led to the emergence of life.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.720
I guess the real problem I have

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.320
with the numbers game just to come back to that

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.480
is that we are talking about

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.240
a certain probability of that occurring.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.160
It may be to go from the primordial soup,

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.200
however you want to call it,

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.880
the ingredients that the earth started with,

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.480
the organic molecules,

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.600
the probability of going

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.280
from that initial condition

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.920
to something that was capable

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.440
of Darwinian natural selection

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.880
that maybe we could define as life.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.320
The probability of that is maybe one percent,

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.600
one percent of the time that happens,

01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.480
in which case you're right,

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.880
the universe will be absolutely teeming with life,

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.680
but it could also be 10 to the power minus 10,

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.520
in which case it's one per galaxy

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.280
or 10 to the power of minus 100,

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.560
in which case the vast majority of universes even

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.240
do not have life within it.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.320
Or 90 percent.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.880
You said one percent,

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.320
but it could be 90 percent

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.120
if the conditions,

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.360
the chemical conditions of a planet are correct

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.400
or a moon are correct.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:23.960
I admit that.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.720
It could be any of those numbers.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.160
And the challenge is

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.680
we just have no rigorous reason

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.120
to expect why 90 percent is any,

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:34.680
because we're talking about

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.880
a probability of a probability.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.400
Is 90 percent more a priori likely

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.560
than 10 to the power minus 20?

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560
Well, the thing is we do have an observation,

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.400
and of one, of Earth.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.480
And it's difficult to know what to do with that,

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.920
what kind of intuition you build on top of that,

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.600
because on Earth it seems like life finds a way

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.560
in all kinds of conditions,

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.280
in all kinds of crazy conditions.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.160
And it's able to build up from the basic chemistry.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.360
You could say, okay,

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.640
maybe it takes a little bit of time

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.240
to develop some complicated technology,

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.520
like mitochondria, I don't know,

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.920
like photosynthesis, fine,

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.480
but it seems to figure it out

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.560
and do it extremely well.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.280
Yeah, but I would say

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.720
you're describing a different process.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.680
Maybe I'm at fault

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.680
for separating these two processes,

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.360
but to me you're describing

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.200
basically natural selection evolution at that point,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
whereas I'm really describing abiogenesis,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.720
which is to me a separate distinct process.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.480
Do you limit it to human scientists?

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.880
Yes, but why would it be a separate process?

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.760
Why is the birth of life

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.520
a separate process from the process of life?

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.240
I mean, we're uncomfortable with the Big Bang.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.360
We're uncomfortable with the first thing, I think.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.400
Like, where did this come from?

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.920
Right, so I think I would say,

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.680
I just twist that question around and say,

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.000
you're saying why is it a different process?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440
And I would say why shouldn't it be a different process,

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.720
which isn't really a good defense,

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.760
except to say that we have knowledge

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.040
of how natural selection evolution works.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.360
We think we understand that process.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.280
We have almost no information

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.800
about the earliest stages

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.800
of how life emerged on our planet.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.480
It may be that you're right,

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.560
and it is a part of a continuum.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.880
It may be that it is also a distinct,

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.080
improbable set of circumstances

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.320
that led to the emergence of life.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.920
As a scientist, I'm just trying to be open-minded

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.440
to both possibilities.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.320
If I assert that life must be everywhere,

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.760
to me, you run the risk of experimental bias.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.480
If you think you know what the answer is,

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.920
if you look at an Earth-like planet

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.720
and you are preconditioned to think

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.280
there's a 90% chance of life on this planet,

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.920
it's going to, at some level,

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.720
affect your interpretation of that data.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.080
Whereas if I, however critical you might be

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.280
of the agnosticism that I impose upon myself,

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.360
remain open to both possibilities,

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.080
then I trust in myself to make a fair assessment

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.640
as to the reality of that evidence for life.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.800
Yeah, but I wonder, sort of scientifically,

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.200
and that's really beautiful to hear

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.040
and inspiring to hear,

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.480
I wonder, scientifically,

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.920
how many firsts we truly know of,

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.440
and that we don't eventually explain

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:41.720
as actually a step number one million in a long process.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.400
So I think that's a really interesting thing

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.160
if there's truly firsts in this universe.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.440
For us, whatever happened at the Big Bang

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.680
is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.200
But it just, again, it seems like history shows

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.560
that we'll figure out that it's actually

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.680
a continuation of something.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.000
But then physicists say that time is emergent

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
and that causality in time is a very human kind of construct,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.840
that it's very possible that all of this,

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.800
so there could be really firsts of a thing

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.160
to which we attach a name.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.760
So whatever we call life, maybe there is an origin of it.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.600
Yeah, and I would also say I'm open to the idea

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.200
of it being part of a continuation,

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.920
but the continuation maybe is more broader,

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.000
and it's a continuation of chemical systems

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.280
and chemical networks.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.960
And what we call this one particular type of chemistry

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.720
and this behavior of chemistry life,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.680
but it is just one manifestation of all the trillions

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.120
of possible permutations in which chemical reactions can occur.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.000
And we assert specialness to it because that's what we are.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.480
And so it's also true of intelligence.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.840
You could extend the same thing and say,

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.120
we're looking for intelligent life in the universe,

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:57.240
and then you sort of, where do you define intelligence?

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.680
Where's that continuum of something that's really like us?

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.400
Are we alone?

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.280
There may be a continuum of chemical systems,

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.520
a continuum of intelligences out there.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.800
And we have to be careful of our own arrogance

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.680
of assuming specialness about what we are,

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:19.560
that we are some distinct category of phenomena.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.400
Whereas the universe doesn't really care

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.000
about what category we are.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.960
It's just doing what it's doing and doing everything

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.320
in infinite diversity and infinite combinations,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.440
essentially what it's doing.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.360
And so we are taking this one slice and saying,

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.600
no, this has to be treated separately.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.720
And I'm open to the idea that it could be

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.880
a truly separate phenomenon,

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.000
but it may just be like a snowflake.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.600
Every snowflake's different.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.280
It may just be that this one particular iteration

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.000
is another variant of the vast continuum.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.280
And maybe the algorithm of natural selection itself

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.480
is an invention of earth.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:03.240
I also tend to suspect that whatever the algorithm is,

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.280
it operates at all levels throughout the universe.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.720
But maybe this is a very peculiar thing

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.360
where there's a bunch of chemical systems

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.520
that compete against each other somehow for survival

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.040
under limited resources.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.640
And that's a very earth-like thing.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.880
We have a nice balance of there's a large number

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.880
of resources enough to have a bunch

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.720
of different kinds of systems competing,

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.880
but not so many that they get lazy.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.760
And maybe that's why bacteria were very lazy

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.320
for a long time.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.560
Maybe they didn't have much competition.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:42.840
Quite possibly.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.720
I mean, as fun as it is to get into the speculation

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:52.600
about the definitions of life and what life does

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.640
and this gross network of possibilities,

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.080
honestly, for me, the strongest argument

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:04.200
for remaining agnostic is to avoid that bias

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.400
and assessing data.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.680
And we've seen it.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.000
I mean, Percival Lowell I talked about on my channel

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.280
maybe last year or two years ago.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.400
He's a very famous astronomer who in the 19th century

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.200
was claiming the evidence of canals on Mars.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.400
And from him, from his perspective,

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.160
and even at the time, culturally,

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.200
it was widely accepted that Mars would, of course, have life.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.120
I mean, I think it seems silly to us,

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.400
but it was kind of similar arguments

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.080
to what we're using now about exoplanets that,

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.640
well, of course, there must be life in the universe.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.760
How could it just be here?

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.040
And so it seemed obvious to people

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.440
that when you looked at Mars with its polar caps,

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.800
even its atmosphere had seasons.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.280
It seemed obvious to them that that, too,

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.520
would be a place where life not only was present

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.200
but had emerged to a civilization

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.360
which actually was fairly comparable in technology

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.920
to our own because it was building canal systems.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.000
Of course, the canal system seems

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.080
a bizarre technosignature to us,

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.920
but it was a product of their time.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.240
To them, that was the cutting edge in technology.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.360
It should be a warning shot actually a little bit for us

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.040
that if we think solar panels or building star links

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.200
or whatever space mining is like an inevitable technosignature,

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:17.160
that may be laughably antiquated compared to what other civilizations

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.160
far more advanced than us may be doing.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.280
And so anyway, Percival Lowell,

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.680
I think, was a product of his time

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.800
that he thought life was there.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.200
Inevitably, he even wrote about it extensively.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.680
And so when he saw these lines,

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.760
these lineae on the surface of Mars,

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.080
to him, it was just obvious they were canals.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.040
And that was experimental bias playing out.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.320
He was told, for one,

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.520
that he had basically the greatest eyesight out of any of his peers.

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.840
An ophthalmologist had told him that in Boston,

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.000
that his eyesight was absolutely spectacular.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.800
So he just was convinced everything he saw was real.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.640
And secondly, he was convinced there was life there.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.800
And so to him, it just added up.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.240
And then that kind of wasted decades of research

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.000
of treating the idea of Mars being inhabited

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.600
by this canal civilization.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.080
But on the other hand, it's maybe not a waste

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.560
because it is a lesson in history of how we should be always on guard

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.800
against our own preconceptions and biases

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.120
about whether life is out there.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:17.880
And furthermore, what types of things life might do if it is there.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.440
If I were running this simulation,

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.080
which we'll also talk about because you make the case against it.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.440
But if I were running a simulation,

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440
I would definitely put you in a room with an alien

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.560
just to see you mentally freak out for hours at a time.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.280
You for sure would have thought you will be convinced

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.400
that you've lost your mind.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.720
No, not that.

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.120
But I mean, if we discover life,

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.520
we discover interesting new physical phenomena,

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.400
I think the right approach is definitely to be extremely skeptical

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:48.280
and be very, very careful about things you want to be true.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.160
I'm not like some extreme denialist of evidence.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.600
If there was compelling evidence for life on another planet,

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.320
I would be the first one to be celebrating that

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.880
and be shaking hands with the alien on the White House lawn.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.360
I grew up with Star Trek and that was my fantasy

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:09.160
was to be Captain Kirk and fly across the stars

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.200
meeting at the civilization.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.920
So there's nothing more I'd want to be true as I've said.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.680
But we just have to guard against it when we're assessing data.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:26.840
But I have to say I'm very skeptical that we will ever have that Star Trek moment.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.640
Even if there are other civilizations out there,

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.160
they're never going to be at a point which is in technological lockstep with us,

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.400
similar level of development, even intellectually,

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.440
the idea that they could have a conversation with us even through a translator.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.400
We can't communicate with Humback whales.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.320
We can't communicate with dolphins in a meaningful way.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.920
We can sort of bark orders at them,

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.160
but we can't have abstract conversations with them about things.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.560
And so the idea that we will ever have that fulfilling conversation,

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.920
I'm deeply skeptical of.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.840
And I think a lot of us are drawn to that.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.560
It is maybe a replacement for God to some degree,

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.360
that father figure civilization that might step in,

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.840
teach us the air of our ways and bestow wisdom upon our civilization.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.800
But they could equally be a giant fungus that doesn't even understand the idea of socialization

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.960
because it's the only entity on its planet.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.800
It just swells over the entire surface.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.360
And it's incredibly intelligent because maybe each node communicates with each other

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.760
to create essentially a giant neural net.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.280
But it has no sense of what communication even is.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.440
And so alien life is out there is surely going to be extremely diverse.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.640
I'm pretty skeptical that we'll ever get that fantasy moment I always had as a kid

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.760
of having a dialogue within the civilization.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.600
So dialogue, yes.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.720
What about noticing them?

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.080
What about noticing signals?

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.440
So one thing we've been talking about is getting signatures, biosignatures,

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.680
technosignatures about other planets.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:07.960
Maybe if we're extremely lucky in our lifetime to be able to meet life forms,

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.520
get evidence of living or dead life forms on Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.400
What about getting signals from outer space, interstellar signals?

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.600
What would those signals potentially look like?

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.560
That's a hard question to answer because we are essentially engaging in

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.160
xenopsychology to some degree.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.040
What are the activities of another civilization?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.680
What does the word xenopsychology, I apologize to interrupt, mean?

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.400
Maybe I'm just fabricating that word really.

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.080
But they're trying to guess at the machinations and motivations of

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.440
another intelligent being that was completely evolutionary divorced from us.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.000
So it's like you said exo-moons, exo-psychology, extrasolar psychology.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Yeah, alien psychology is another way of maybe making it more grounded.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.760
But we can't really guess at their motivations too well,

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:06.920
but we can look at the sorts of behaviors we engage in and at least look for them.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.280
We're always guilty that when we look for biosignatures,

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:12.920
we're really looking for, and even when we look for planets,

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.600
we're looking for templates of Earth.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.880
When we look for biosignatures, we're looking for templates of Earth-based life.

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.080
When we look for technosignatures, we tend to be looking for templates of

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.720
our own behaviors or extrapolations of our behaviors.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.760
There's a very long list of technosignatures that people have suggested we could look for.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.120
The earliest ones were of course radio beacons.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.800
That was Project Osmo that Frank Drake was involved in trying to look for radio signatures,

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:45.240
which could either be just blurting out high-power radio signals saying,

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.680
hey, we're here, or could even have encoded within them galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock,

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.640
which has always been the allure of the radio technique.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.480
But there could also be unintentional signatures.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.800
For example, you can have something like the satellite system that we've produced

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.200
around the Earth, the artificial satellite system, Starlink-type systems we mentioned.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.920
You could detect the glint of light across those satellites as they orbit around the planet.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.760
You could set a geostationary satellite belt, which would block out some light as the planet

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.720
transited across the star. You could detect solar panels, potentially spectrally on the

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.520
surface of the planet, heat island effects. New York is hotter than New York State by a couple

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.680
of degrees because of the heat island effect of the city. And so you could thermally map

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:38.120
different planets and detect these. So there's a large array of things that we do that we can

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.680
go out and hypothesize we could look for. And then on the furthest end of the scale,

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:48.200
you have things which go far beyond our capabilities, such as warp drive signatures,

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.800
which have been proposed. You get these bright flashes of light or even gravitational wave

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:57.960
detections from LIGO could be detected. You could have Dyson spheres, the idea of

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.840
covering basically a star is completely covered by some kind of structure which collects all the

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.280
light from the star to power the civilization. And that would be pretty easily detectable to

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.200
some degree because you're transferring all of the visible light thermodynamically,

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.840
it has to be re-emitted to come out as infrared light. So you'd have an incredibly bright infrared

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:25.800
star, yet one that was visibly not present at all. And so that would be a pretty intriguing

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.200
signature to look for. Well, is there efforts to look for something like that for different

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.840
Dyson spheres out there with the strong infrared signal? There has been. Yeah, there has been.

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.920
And I think in the literature, there was one with the IRAS satellite, which is an infrared

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:46.600
satellite. They targeted, I think, a board of 100,000 stars, nearby stars and found no convincing

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.880
examples of what looked like a Dyson sphere star. And then Jason Wright and his team extended this,

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:58.120
I think, using WISE, which is another infrared satellite to look around galaxies. So could an

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.480
entire galaxy have been converted into Dyson spheres or a significant fraction of the galaxy?

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.760
Which is basically the Kardashev type three, right? This is when you've basically mastered

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:15.640
the entire galactic pool of resources. And again, out of 100,000 nearby galaxies, there appears to

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.200
be no compelling examples of what looks like a Dyson galaxy, if you want to call it that.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:29.000
So that by no means proves that they don't exist or don't happen, but it seems like it's an unusual

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.200
behavior for a civilization to get to that stage of development and start harvesting

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:41.240
the entire stellar output. Unusually, yes. And I mean, LIGO is super interesting with gravitational

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.360
waves. If that kind of experiment could start seeing some weirdness, some weird signals,

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:54.760
that compare to the power of cosmic phenomena. Yeah. I mean, it's a whole new window to the

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.320
universe, not just in terms of astrophysics, but potentially for technoscientists as well.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.960
I have to say with the warp drives, I am skeptical that warp drives are possible

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:08.360
because you have kind of a fundamental problem in relativity. You can either really have

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.720
relativity, faster than light travel, or causality. You can only choose two of those three things.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.600
You really can't have all three in a coherent universe. If you have all three, you basically

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.960
end up with the possibility of these kind of temporal paradoxes and time loops and

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.120
grandfather paradoxes. Well, can't there be pockets of causality, something like that,

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.160
like where there's pockets of consistent causality? You could design it in that way.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:38.040
If you had a warp drive or a time machine, essentially, you could be very conscious and

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.560
careful of the way you use it so as to not cause paradoxes or just do it in a local area or

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:50.280
something. But the real fundamental problem is you always have the ability to do it. And so in a

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:57.400
vast cosmic universe, if time machines were all over the place, there's too much risk of someone

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:02.040
doing it, of somebody having the option of essentially breaking the universe.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.360
A fundamental problem, Hawking has this chronology protection conjecture where he said that

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.560
this just can't be allowed because it breaks all our laws of physics if time travel is possible.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.240
Current laws of physics, yes.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.560
Correct, yeah. And so we need to rip up relativity. I mean, that's the point,

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:25.480
is the current laws of physics, so you'd have to rip up our current law of relativity to make sense

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:31.080
of how FTL could live in that universe because you can't have relativity, FTL and causality

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:37.000
sit nicely and play nicely together. But we currently don't have quantum mechanics

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.240
and relativity playing nice together anyway, so it's not like everything is all a nice little

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.120
fabric. It's certainly not the full picture. There must be more to go.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:51.320
So it's already ripped up, so might as well rip it up a little more. And in the process,

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:57.400
actually try to connect the two things because maybe in the unification of the standard model

01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:05.400
and general relativity, maybe there lies some kind of new wisdom about warp drives. So by the way,

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:11.480
warp drives is somehow messing with the fabric of the universe to be able to travel faster than

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.840
the speed of light. Yeah, you're basically bending space-time. You could also do it with a wormhole

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:23.640
or some other hypothetical FTL. So it doesn't have to necessarily be the Alcubair drive,

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:28.520
the warp drive. It could be any faster than light system. As long as it travels superluminally,

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.520
it will violate causality. And presumably that will be observable with LIGO.

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.520
Potentially. Yeah, potentially. It depends on, I think, the properties of whatever the spacecraft

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:43.320
is. I mean, one problem with warp drives is, there's all sorts of problems with warp drives.

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.280
Like the start of that sentence. One problem, the warp drive.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:54.200
There's just this one minor problem that we have to get around. But when it arrives at its destination,

01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:00.040
it basically collects this vast, it has like an event horizon almost at the front of it. And so

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:04.840
it collects all this radiation at the front as it goes. And when it arrives, all that radiation

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:10.920
gets dumped on its destination and would basically completely exterminate the planet it arrives at.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.040
That radiation is also incident within the shell itself. There's Hawking radiation

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:21.400
occurring within the shell, which is pretty dangerous. And then it raises all sorts of

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:26.200
exacerbations of the Fermi paradox, of course, as well. So you might be able to explain why

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.440
we don't see a galactic empire. I mean, even here it's hard. You might be able to explain why

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:37.720
we don't see a galactic empire if everybody's limited to Voyager 2 rocket speeds of like 20

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.960
kilometers per second or something. But it's a lot harder to explain why we don't see the stars

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:51.560
populated by galactic empires when warp drive is eminently possible. Because it makes expansion

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:58.600
so much more trivial that it makes our life harder. There's some wonderful simulation work

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.720
being done out of Rochester where they actually simulate all the stars in the galaxy or a fraction

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:09.480
of them. And they spawn a civilization and one of them, and they let it spread out at sublight

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:14.360
speeds. And actually the very mixing of the stars themselves, because the stars are not static,

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:18.280
they're in orbit of the galactic center and they have crossing paths with each other.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.200
If you just have a range of even like five light years and your speed is of order of a few percent,

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.920
the speed of light is the maximum you can muster, you can populate the entire galaxy within

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:35.240
something like 100,000 to about a million years or so. So in a fraction of the lifetime of the

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:43.400
galaxy itself. And so this raises some fairly serious problems because if any civilization,

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:49.480
the entire history of the galaxy decided to do that, then either we shouldn't be here or we

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:54.920
happen to live in this kind of rare pocket where they chose not to populate to. And so this is

01:46:54.920 --> 01:47:04.200
sometimes called fact A. The fact A is that a civilization is not here now. An alien civilization

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.640
is not in present occupation of the earth. And that's difficult to resolve with the apparent

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.960
ease at which even a small extrapolation of our own technology could potentially populate

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:26.920
a galaxy in far faster than galactic history. So to me, by the way, the Fermi paradox is truly

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:38.200
a paradox for me. But I suspect that if aliens visit earth, I suspect if they are everywhere,

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.840
I think they're already here and we're too dumb to see it. But leaving that aside,

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.280
I think we should be able to, in that case, have very strong,

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:56.440
obvious signals when we look up at the stars, at the emanation of energy required. We would see

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:03.800
some weirdness that like where these are these kinds of stars and these are these kinds of stars

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.920
that are being messed with, like leveraging the nuclear fusion of stars to do something useful.

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:16.200
The fact that we don't really see that. Maybe you can correct me. If there is alien civilizations

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.960
running galaxies, wouldn't we see weirdnesses from an astronomy perspective with the way the

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.960
stars are behaving? Yeah, I mean, it depends exactly what they're doing. But I mean, the Dyson

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:31.240
Sphere example is one that we already discussed where a survey of 100,000 nearby galaxies find

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:37.400
that they have all been transformed into Dyson Sphere collectors. You could also imagine them

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.160
doing things like we wrote a paper about this recently of starlifting, where you can extend

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.040
the life of your star by scooping mass off the star. So you'd be doing stellar engineering,

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:52.680
essentially. If you're doing a huge amount of asteroid mining, you would have a spectral

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.200
signature because you're basically filling the solar system with dust. By doing that,

01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:03.800
there'd be debris from that activity. And so there are some limits on this. Certainly,

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:10.280
we don't see bright flashes, which would be one of these consequences. What I've said is as they

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:15.240
decelerate, they'd produce these bright flashes of light. We don't seem to see evidence of those

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:21.320
kinds of things. We don't see anything obvious around the nearby stars or the stars that we've

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:28.360
surveyed in detail beyond that that indicate any kind of artificial civilization. The closest maybe

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:33.720
we had was Boyajian Star. There was a lot of interest in. There was a star that was just

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.760
very peculiarly dipping in and out its brightness. And it was hypothesized for a time that that may

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:47.160
indeed be some kind of Dyson-like structure, so maybe a Dyson Sphere that's half built.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.760
And so as it comes in and out, it's blocking out huge swaths of the star. It was very difficult

01:49:52.760 --> 01:50:00.120
to explain really with any kind of planet model at the time. But an easier hypothesis that was

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:05.080
proposed was it could just be a large number of comets or dust or something, or maybe a planet

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:11.560
that had broken apart, and as its fragments orbit around, it blocks out starlight. And it turned out

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.600
with subsequent observations of that star, which especially the amateur astronomy community made a

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:24.440
big contribution to as well, that the dips were chromatic, which was a real important clue that

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:29.560
that probably wasn't a solid structure then that was going around it. It was more likely to be dust.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:33.960
Dust is chromatic. By chromatic, I mean it looks different in different colors,

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.560
so it blocks out more red light than blue light. If it was a solid structure, it shouldn't do that.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.840
It should be opaque, a solid metal structure or something. So that was one of the clear

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:50.600
indications, and the behavior of in the way the light changed or the dips changed across

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.680
wavelengths was fully consistent with the expectations of what small particulates would do.

01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:00.760
And so that's very hard. I mean the real problem with alien hunting,

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:08.440
this is the real problem. The one problem with the warp drive and the one problem with

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.640
alien hunting, yes. Actually, I'd say there's three big problems for me with any search for life,

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:21.320
which includes UFOs all the way to fossils and Mars, is that aliens have three unique properties

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:27.400
as a hypothesis. One is they have essentially unbounded explanatory capability. So there's

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.880
almost no phenomenon I can show you that you couldn't explain with aliens to some degree.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:36.440
You could say, well, the aliens just have some super high-tech way of creating that illusion.

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:45.160
Yeah. The second one would be unbounded avoidance capacity. So I might see a UFO tomorrow and then

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:49.080
the next day and then the next day and then predict I should see it on Thursday at the end

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:53.640
of the week. But then I don't see it, but I could always get out of that and say, well,

01:51:53.640 --> 01:52:00.520
that's just because they chose not to come here. They can always avoid future observations fairly

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:06.440
easily. If you survey an exoplanet for biosignatures and you don't see oxygen,

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.000
you don't see methane, that doesn't mean there's no one living there. They could always be either

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.840
tricking their atmosphere, engineering it. We actually wrote a paper about that, how you can

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:21.640
use lasers to hide your biosignatures as advanced civilization. Or you could just be living

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.880
underground or underwater or something where there's no biosignatures. So you can never

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:32.280
really disprove this life on another planet or on another star. It has infinite avoidance.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.160
And then finally, the third one is that we have incomplete physical understanding of the universe.

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.560
So if I see a new phenomena, which Boyaj and Star was a good example of that,

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.360
we saw this new phenomena of these strange dips we'd never seen before.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.160
It was hypothesized immediately this could be aliens. It's like a god of the gaps,

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:53.880
but it turned out to be incomplete physical understanding. And so that happens all the time

01:52:53.880 --> 01:53:01.400
in the first pulsar that was discovered, same story. Jocelyn Bell somewhat tongue in cheek

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.680
called it little green man one, because it looked a lot like the radio signature that was expected

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.560
from alien civilization. But of course, it turned out to be a completely new type of star that we

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:16.760
had never seen before, which was a neutron star with these two jets coming out the top of it.

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:25.320
And so that's a challenge. Those three things are really, really difficult in terms of experimental

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:30.520
design for a scientist to work around something that can explain anything, can avoid anything.

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:36.520
So it's almost unfalsifiable and could always just be to some degree, as you said, we have this very

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:41.560
limited knowledge of the infinite possibilities of physical law. And we probably only scratching

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:48.040
the surface each time. And we've seen it so often in history, we may just be detecting some

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:55.160
new phenomena. Well, that last one, I think I'm a little more okay with making mistakes on

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:59.880
Yeah, which is because it's exciting still. Because no matter. So you might exaggerate

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:05.160
the importance of the discovery. But the whole point is to try to find stuff in this world is

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:10.040
weird, and try to characterize that weirdness. Sure, you can throw a little green man as a label on it.

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:18.200
But eventually, it like, it's as mysterious and as beautiful as as interesting as little agreement,

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.920
like we we tend to think that there's some kind of threshold. But like there's all kinds of weird

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.000
organisms on this earth that operate very differently than humans that are super interesting.

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:34.040
The human mind is super interesting. I mean, like, weirdness and complexity is

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:41.160
is as interesting in any of its forms as what we might think from Hollywood, what aliens are.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:44.600
So like that, that's, that's okay, looking for weirdnesses on Mars.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.160
That's one of the best sales pitches to do tennis signature work is that, you know,

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:54.200
we always have that as our fallback that we're going to look for alien signatures. If we fail,

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.240
we're going to discover some awesome new physics along the way. And so even a,

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.800
if any kind of signature that we detect is always going to be interesting.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:11.160
And so that that compels us to have not only the question of looking for life in the universe,

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:16.760
but it gives us a strong scientific grounding as to why this sort of research should be funded,

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.720
should be executed, because it always pushes the frontiers of knowledge.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:25.800
I wonder if we'll be able to discover and be open enough to a broad definition of aliens,

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:31.000
where we see some kind of techno signature, basically like a touring test, like this thing

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:37.400
is intelligent. Like it's processing information in a very interesting way. But you can say that

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.520
about chemistry, you could say that about physics, maybe not physics, chemistry, like interesting,

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.800
complex chemistry, you could say that this is processing, this is storing information,

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:56.920
this is propagating information over time. It's a gray area between a living organism

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.760
that we would call an alien. And I think that's super interesting. It's able to carry some kind

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.560
of intelligence. Yeah. Information is a really useful way to frame what we're looking for though,

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:14.200
because then you're divorced from making assumptions about even a civilization necessarily

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:20.120
or anything like that. So any kind of information signature, indeed, you can take things like the

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:25.160
light curve from Boyajian star and ask what is the minimum number of free parameters or

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:29.000
the minimum information content that must be encoded within this light curve.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.440
And the hope is that maybe a good example would be from a radio signature, you detect something

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:42.200
that has a thousand megabytes of parameters essentially contained within it. That's pretty

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:46.200
clearly at that point, not the product of a natural process, at least any natural process

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.320
that we could possibly imagine with our current understanding of the universe. And so thinking

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.800
that even if we can't decode, which actually I'm skeptical we'd be able to ever decode it in our

01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.040
lifetimes, it would probably take decades to fully ever figure out what they're trying to tell us.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.960
But if there was a message there, we could at least know that there is high information content

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:12.520
and there is complexity and that this is an attempt at communication and information transfer

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:17.400
and leave it to our subsequent generations to figure out what exactly it is they're trying to say.

01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:25.800
What, again, wild question and thank you for entertaining them. I really, really appreciate

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:31.640
that. But what kind of signal in our lifetime, what kind of thing do you think might happen,

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:37.720
could possibly happen where the scientific community would be convinced that

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:44.120
there's alien civilizations out there? Like what, so you already said maybe a strong infrared

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.160
signature for something like a Dyson Sphere. Yeah, that's possibly, that's also to some degree

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:54.280
a little bit ambiguous because- That's the challenge, sorry to interrupt, is where

01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:01.240
your brain would be, like you as a scientist would be like, I know it's ambiguous but this

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.520
is really weird. Yeah, I think if you had something, I can imagine something like a

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:11.240
prime number sequence or a mathematical sequence like the Fibonacci series, something being-

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:16.120
Mathematically provable that this is not a physical phenomenon. Right, I mean, yeah,

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:20.280
prime numbers is a pretty good case because there's no natural phenomena that produces prime number

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.440
sequences. It seems to be a purely an abstract mathematical concept as far as I'm aware.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:30.920
And so if we detected a series of radio blips that were following that sequence, it would be

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:36.440
pretty clear to me or it could even be, you know, Carl Sagan suggested that pi could be encoded and

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:40.760
that, or you might use the hydrogen line but multiplied by pi, like some very specific

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:47.080
frequency of the universe, like a hydrogen line, but multiply it by a abstract mathematical constant

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:51.480
that would imply strongly that there was someone behind the scenes operating that.

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:57.880
Sorry, stored in which phenomena though? In that case it's a radio wave, but the information,

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:04.120
we kind of toyed with this idea in a video I did about hypothetical civilization on my channel.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:11.080
But one kind of fun way, I do want to bring this conversation towards time a little bit and

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:16.760
thinking about not just looking for life and intelligence around us right now, but looking

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.400
into the past and even into the future to some degree or communicating with the future.

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:25.960
And so we had this fun experiment of imagining a civilization that was born at the beginning

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.800
of the history of the galaxy and being the first and what it would be like for them.

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.640
And they were desperately searching for evidence of life but couldn't find it.

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:38.840
And so they decided to try and leave something behind for future civilizations to discover,

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:42.920
to tell them about themselves. But of course a radio signature is not going to work there

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:47.160
because it has a power source and that's a piece of machinery it's going to eventually break down.

01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:51.880
It's going to be hard to maintain that for billions of years time scale. And so you wanted

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:57.320
something that was kind of passive that doesn't require an energy source but can somehow transmit

01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:02.120
information, which is hard to think about something that satisfies those criteria.

02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:05.400
But there was a proposal by one of my colleagues, Luke Arnold,

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:11.240
which inspired a lot of us in tetanus signatures. And he suggested that you could build artificial

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:19.080
transitors. So you could build sheets of material that transit in front of the star, maybe one thin

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:22.920
sheet passes across first, then two, then three, then five, and seven, so you could follow the

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.800
prime number sequence of these. And so there'd be a clear indication that someone had manufactured

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:32.840
those, but they don't require any energy source because they're just sheets of material in order

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.600
of the star. They would eventually degrade from micrometeorites, maybe their orbits would become

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:42.840
destabilized, but they should have lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of any battery or

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:47.240
mechanical electronic system that we could, at least without technology, conceive of building.

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:51.560
And so you could imagine extending that. And how could you encode not just a prime number

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:56.280
sequence, but maybe in the spatial pattern of this very complex light curve we see,

02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:03.080
you could encode more and more information through 2D shapes and the way those quotations happen.

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:10.840
And maybe you could even encode messages and in-depth information. You could even imagine

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.320
it being like a lower layer of information, which is just the prime number sequence,

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:21.000
but then you look closely and you see the smaller divots embedded within those that have a deeper

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.320
layer of information to extract. And so to me, something like that would be pretty compelling

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:32.200
that there was somebody who had managed, unless it's just a very impressive hoax,

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:35.400
that would be a pretty compelling evidence in this civilization.

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:41.960
And actually the methods of astronomy right now are kind of marching towards

02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.080
being able to better and better detect a signal like that.

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:48.920
Yeah. I mean, to some degree, it's just building bigger aperture in space,

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:54.040
the bigger the telescope, the finer ability to detect those minute signals.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.400
Do you think the current sort of the scientific community, another weird question,

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:02.600
but just the observations that are happening now, do you think they're ready for a prime number

02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:10.520
sequence in the sort of, if we're using the current method, the transit timing variation method,

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:18.040
like do you think you're ready? Do you have the tools to detect the prime number sequence?

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:24.360
Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's 200,000 stars that Kepler monitored and it monitored them

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.520
all the time. It took a photo of each one of them every 30 minutes, measured their brightness,

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:33.400
and it did that for four and a half years. And so you have already,

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:38.280
and Tess is doing it right now, another mission. And so you have already an existing catalog and

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:43.800
people are genuinely scouring through each of those light curves with automated machine

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:48.520
learning techniques. We even developed some in our own team that can look for weird behavior.

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.960
We wrote a code called the weird detector, for instance. It was just the most generic thing

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.480
possible. Don't assume anything about the signal shape. Just look for anything that repeats. The

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:04.440
signal shape can be anything. Can we kind of learn the template of the signal from the data itself?

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:09.160
And then it's like a template matching filter to see if that repeats many, many times in the data.

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.400
And so we actually applied that and found a bunch of interesting stuff, but we didn't see

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.240
anything that was the prime number sequence, at least in the Kepler data. That's 200,000 stars,

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:24.120
which sounds like a lot, but compared to 200 billion stars in the Milky Way,

02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:28.120
it's really just scratching the surface. So one, because there could be something

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:33.000
much more generalizable than the prime number sequence. It's ultimately the question of a

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.360
signal that's very difficult to compress in the general sense of what compressed means. So maybe

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:43.800
as we get better and better machine learning methods that automatically figure out, analyze

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.080
the data to understand how to compress it, you'll be able to discover data that for some reason is

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:56.040
not compressible. But then compression really is a bottomless pit because that's really what

02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:00.280
intelligence is, is being able to compress information. Yeah. And to some degree, the more

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:04.200
I would imagine, I don't work in compression algorithms, but I would imagine the more you

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:12.040
compress your signal, the more assumptions that go on behalf of the decoder, the more

02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:19.000
skilled they really have to be. A prime number sequence is completely unencoded information,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.240
essentially. But if you look at the Arecibo message, they were fairly careful with their

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:32.920
pixelation of this simple image they sent to try and make it as interpretable as possible

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:38.520
to be that even a dumb alien would be able to figure out what we're trying to show them here.

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:44.440
Because there's all sorts of conventions and rules that are built in that we tend to presume

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:50.760
when we design our messages. And so if your message is assuming they know how to do an MP3

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:57.480
decoder, a particular compression algorithm, I'm sure they could eventually reverse engineer it

02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:03.880
and figure it out. But you're making it harder for them to get to that point. So maybe I always

02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.960
think you probably would have a two tier system, right? You'd probably have some lower tier key

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:13.080
system. And then maybe beneath that, you'd have a deeper compressed layer of more in-depth information.

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:20.440
What about maybe observing actual physical objects? So first, let me go to your tweet

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:26.280
as a source of inspiration. You tweeted that it's interesting to ponder that if Oort clouds

02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:32.200
are ever mined by the systems of alien civilizations, mining equipment from billions

02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:39.320
of years ago could be in our Oort cloud, since the Oort clouds extend really, really, really,

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:47.000
really far outside the actual star. So mining equipment, just like basic, boring mining

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.960
equipment out there. I don't know if there's something interesting to say about Oort clouds

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:58.280
themselves that are interesting to you and about possible non-shiny light emitting mining equipment

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:04.200
from alien civilization. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the field of technosignatures and

02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:11.880
looking for life is you can find inspiration and intellectual joy in just the smallest little thing

02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:17.000
that starts a whole thread of building upon it and wondering about the implications.

02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:23.240
And so in this case, I was just really struck by, we kind of mentioned this a little bit earlier,

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:29.560
the idea that stars are not static. We tend to think of the galaxy as having stars in a certain

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:34.200
location from the center of the galaxy, and they kind of live there. But in truth, the stars are

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:41.000
not only orbiting around the center of the galaxy, but those orbits are themselves changing over time

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.400
they're processing. And so in fact, the orbits look more like a spiral graph if you've ever

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:50.680
done those as a kid, they kind of whirl around and trace out all sorts of strange patterns.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:56.760
And so the stars intersect with one another. And so the current closest star to us is Proxima

02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:02.360
Centauri, which is about 4.2 light years away, but it will not always be the closest star. And over

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:07.880
millions of years, it will be supplanted by other stars. In fact, stars that will come even closer

02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:12.600
than Proxima within just a couple of light years. And that's been happening, not just we can project

02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:17.000
that will happen over the next few million years, but that's been happening presumably throughout

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.120
the entire history of the galaxy for billions of years. And so if you went back in time,

02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:25.800
there would have been all sorts of different nearest stars, different stages of the Earth's

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:32.680
history. And those stars are so close that their Oort clouds do intermix with one another. So the

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:37.720
Oort cloud can extend out to even a light year or two on the Earth. There's some debate about

02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:41.800
exactly where it ends. It probably doesn't really have a definitive end, but kind of more just kind

02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:45.800
of peters out more and more and more as you go further away. By the way, for people who don't

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.800
know an Oort cloud, I don't know what the technical definition is, but a bunch of rocks that kind of,

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:56.760
no, objects that orbit the star, and they can extend really, really far because of gravity.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:03.080
These are objects that probably are mostly icy rich. They were probably formed fairly similar

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:08.680
distances to Jupiter and Saturn, but were scattered out through the interactions of those giant

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:14.680
planets. We see a circular disk of objects around us, which kind of looks like the asteroid belt,

02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:19.080
but just further away called the Kuiper belt. And then further beyond that, you get the Oort cloud.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:23.400
And the Oort cloud is not a disk. It's just a sphere. It kind of surrounds us in all directions.

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:29.000
So these are objects that were scattered out three dimensionally in all different directions.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:36.680
And so those objects are potentially resources for us, especially if you were planning to do

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.120
an interstellar mission one day, you might want to mine the water that's embedded within those and

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:48.040
use that as either oxygen or fuel for your rocket. And so it's quite possible. There's also some rare

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.640
Earth metals and things like that as well, but it's quite possible that a civilization might use

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:57.880
Oort cloud objects as a jumping off point. Or in the Kuiper belt, you have things like Planet Nine

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:02.520
even. There might even be objects beyond in the Oort cloud, which are actually planet-like that

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:06.520
we just cannot detect. These objects are very, very faint. So that's why they're so hard to see.

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:12.120
I mean, even Planet Nine is hypothesized to exist, but we've not been able to confirm its existence

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:16.440
because it's at something like a thousand AU away from us, a thousand times the distance of

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.600
the Earth from the Sun. And so even though it's probably larger than the Earth, the amount of

02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.400
light it reflects from the Sun, the Sun just looks like a star at that point so far away from it

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:29.480
that it barely reflects anything back. It's extremely difficult to detect.

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:33.320
So there's all sorts of wonders that may be lurking out in the outer solar system.

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:41.800
And so this leads you to wonder, in the Oort cloud, that Oort cloud must have intermixed with other

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:50.200
Oort clouds in the past. And so what fraction of the Oort cloud truly belongs to us, belongs to

02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:56.360
what was scattered from Jupiter and Saturn? What fraction of it could in fact be interstellar

02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:00.600
visitors? And of course, we've got excited about this recently because of Oumuamua,

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:05.640
this interstellar asteroid, which seemed to be at the time the first evidence of an interstellar

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:11.880
object. But when you think about the Oort cloud intermixing, it may be that a large fraction of

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:17.800
comets, comets are seeded from the Oort cloud that eventually come in. Some of those comets

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.240
may indeed have been interstellar in the first place that we just didn't know about

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:26.200
through this process. There even is an example, I can't remember the name, there's an example of

02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:31.400
a comet that has a very peculiar spectral signature that has been hypothesized to have actually been

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:36.760
an interstellar visitor, but one that was essentially sourced through this Oort cloud mixing.

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:45.080
And so this is kind of intriguing. The outer solar system is like the bottom of the ocean.

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.920
We know so little about what's on the bottom of our own planet's ocean.

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.080
And we know next to nothing about what's on the outskirts of our own solar system.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:11:00.360
It's all darkness. That's one of the things is to understand the phenomena, we need light

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.120
and we need to see how light interacts with it or what light emanates from it.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.480
But most of our universe is darkness. So there could be a lot of interesting stuff.

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:16.440
This is where your interest is with the cool worlds and the interesting stuff lurks in the

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.040
darkness, right? Basically, all of us, 400 years of astronomy, our only window into the universe

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.560
has been light. And that has only changed quite recently with the discovery of gravitational waves.

02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:33.240
That's now a new window. And hopefully, well, to some degree, I guess, solar neutrinos,

02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:36.280
we've been detecting for a while, but they come from the sun, not interstellar space.

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.200
But we may be able to soon detect neutrino messages as even been hypothesized as a way

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:45.560
of communicating between civilizations as well, or just do neutrino telescopes to study the

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:50.760
universe. And so there's a growing interest in what we call multi-messenger astronomy now.

02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:58.520
So not just messages from light, but messages from these other physical packets of information that

02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.360
are coming our way. But when it comes to the outer solar system, light really is our only window.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.000
There's two ways of doing that. One is you detect the light from the cloud object itself,

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.720
which, as I just said, is very, very difficult. There's another trick, which we do in the Kuiper

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:21.080
belt especially, and that's called an occultation. And so sometimes those objects will just pass in

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.960
front of a distant star, just coincidentally. These are very, very brief moments. They last

02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:30.920
for less than a second. And so you have to have a very fast camera to detect them, which

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.680
conventionally astronomers don't usually build fast cameras. Most of the phenomena we observe

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.960
occurs on hours, minutes, days even. But now we're developing cameras which can take thousands

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.960
of images per second and yet do it at the astronomical fidelity that we need for this

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:52.120
precise measurement. And so you can see these very fast dips. You even get these diffraction

02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.400
patterns that come around, which are really cool to look at. And I love it because it's almost

02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:04.280
like passive radar. You have these pinpricks of light. Imagine that you live in a giant black

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.920
sphere, but there's these little pinholes that have been poked. And through those pinholes,

02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:15.560
almost laser light is shining through. And inside this black sphere, there are unknown things

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.880
wandering around and drifting around that we are trying to discover. And sometimes they will pass

02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:24.840
in front of those little pencil thin laser beams, block something out. And so we can tell that it's

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.080
there. And it's not an active radar because we didn't actually beam anything out and get

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:33.160
a reflection off, which is what the sun does. The sun comes off and comes back. That's more

02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:37.800
like an active radar system. It's more like a passive radar system where we are just listening

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:47.800
very intently. And so I'm so fascinated by that, the idea that we could map out the rich architecture

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:52.520
of the outer solar system just by doing something that we could have done potentially for a long

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:58.680
time, which is just listening in the right way, just tuning our instrumentation to the correct

02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:03.560
way of not listening, but viewing the universe to catch those objects.

02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:08.680
Yeah. I mean, it's really fascinating. It seems almost obvious that your efforts,

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:15.400
when projected out over like 100, 200 years, will have a really good map through even methods like

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:21.880
basically transit timing, high resolution transit timing, but basically the planetary and the planet

02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:27.480
satellite movements of all the different star systems out there.

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:30.200
Yeah. And it could revolutionize the way we think about the solar system. I mean,

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.000
that revolution has happened several times in the past when we discovered Vesta

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:41.160
in the 19th century. That was, I think, the seventh planet for a while or the eighth planet

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:44.840
when it was first discovered. And then we discovered Ceres and there was a bunch of

02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:50.360
asteroid objects, Janus. And so for a while, the textbooks had, there was something like 13

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.920
planets in the solar system. And then that was just a new capability that was emerging to detect

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.080
those small objects. And then we ripped that up and said, no, no, we're going to change the definition

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.000
of a planet. And then the same thing happened when we started looking at the outer skirts of

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:09.080
the solar system. Again, we found Eris, we found Sedna, these objects which resembled Pluto.

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:15.960
And the more and more of them we found make, make, and eventually we again had to rethink the way

02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:21.080
we even contextualize what a planet is and what the nature of the outer solar system is.

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.960
So regardless as to what you think about the debate about whether Pluto should be devoted

02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:31.800
or not, which I know often evokes a lot of strong feelings, it is an incredible achievement that we

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:39.080
were able to transform our view of the solar system in a matter of years just by basically

02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:45.560
charge coupled devices, the things that's in cameras. Though the invention of that device

02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:50.840
allowed us to detect objects which were much further away, much fainter and revealed all of

02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:55.240
this stuff that was there all along. And so that's the beauty of astronomy. There's just

02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:02.600
so much to discover and even in our own backyard. Do you ever think about this? Do you imagine what

02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:06.920
are the things that will completely change astronomy over the next 100 years? Like if

02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:12.120
you transport yourself forward a hundred years, what are the things that will blow your mind?

02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:18.600
When you look at, wait, what would it be just a very high resolution mapping of things like

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:26.120
holy crap? Like one surprising thing might be, holy crap, there's like Earth-like moons everywhere.

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.520
Yeah. Another one could be just totally different devices for sensing.

02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:37.000
Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves forward dramatically and science in general when you

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.360
have a new technological capability come online for the first time. And we kind of just gave

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:47.640
examples of that there with the solar system. So what kind of new capabilities might emerge

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.640
in the next 100 years? The capability I would love to see is not just, I mean, in the next 10,

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.280
20 years, we're hoping to take these pale blue dot images we spoke about. So that requires building

02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:03.320
something like JWST, but on an even larger scale and optimize for direct imaging. You'd have to

02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:07.960
have either coronagraph or a star shade or something to block out the starlight and reveal

02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:13.640
those pale blue dots. So in the next sort of decades, I think that's the achievement that

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:19.800
we can look forward to in our lifetimes is to see photos of other Earths going beyond that,

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.800
maybe in our lifetimes towards the end of our lifetimes, perhaps. I'd love it if we,

02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:28.600
I think it's technically possible as Breakthrough Starshot are giving us a lot of encouragement with

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:34.200
to maybe send a small probe to the nearest stars and start actually taking high resolution images

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:39.960
of these objects. There's only so much you can do from far away if you want to have, and we can see

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:43.400
it in the solar system. I mean, there's only so much you can learn about Europa by pointing

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.240
Hubble Space Telescope at it. But if you really want to understand that moon, you're going to have

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.040
to send something to orbit it to hopefully land on it and drill down to the surface.

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:58.120
And so the idea of even taking a flyby and doing a snapshot photo that gets beamed back

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:04.120
that doesn't even have to be more than 100 pixels by 100 pixels, even that would be a completely

02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:12.280
game-changing capability to be able to truly image these objects. And maybe at home in our

02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:17.720
own solar system, we can certainly get to a point where we produce crude maps of exoplanets.

02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:25.000
And one of the ultimate limits of what a telescope could do is governed by its size.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.520
And so the largest telescope you could probably ever build would be one that was the size of the

02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:33.480
Sun. There's a clever trick for doing this without physically building a telescope. That's the size

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.760
of the Sun, and that's to use the Sun as a gravitational lens. This was proposed, I think,

02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:44.360
by Von Eshleman in 1979, but it builds upon Einstein's theory of general relativity, of

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:50.040
course, that there is a warping of light, a bending of light from the Sun's gravitational field.

02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.720
And so a distant starlight is like a magnifying glass. Anything that bends light

02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:59.080
is basically can be used as a telescope. It's going to bend light to a point.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:03.960
Now, it turns out the Sun's gravity is not strong enough to create a particularly great

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:09.800
telescope here because the focus point is really out in the Kuiper belt. It's at 550

02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.160
astronomical units away from the Earth, so 550 times further away from the Sun than we are.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:19.560
And that's beyond any of our spacecraft we've ever gone. So you have to send a spacecraft

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:25.560
to that distance, which would take 30, 40 years, even optimistically improving our chemical

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:31.240
propulsion system significantly. You'd have to bound it into that orbit, but then you could

02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:36.920
use the entire Sun as your telescope. And with that kind of capability, you could image planets

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:42.920
to kilometer scale resolution from afar. And that really makes you wonder. I mean,

02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:48.680
if we can conceive, maybe we can't engineer it, but if we can conceive of such a device,

02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.880
what might other civilizations be currently observing about our own planet?

02:19:55.720 --> 02:20:03.560
And perhaps that is why nobody is visiting us because there is so much you can do from afar

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:09.000
that to them, that's enough. Maybe they can get to the point where they can detect our radio leakage,

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:16.120
they can detect our terrestrial television signals, they can map out our surfaces,

02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:19.960
they can tell we have cities, they can even do infrared mapping of the heat island effect

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:23.640
and all this kind of stuff. They can tell the chemical composition of our planet.

02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:27.640
And so that might be enough. Maybe they don't need to come down to the surface and study

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:34.280
the anthropology and see what our civilization is like. But there's certainly a huge amount

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.720
you can do, which is significantly cheaper to some degree than flying there just by exploiting

02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:45.320
cleverly the physics of the universe itself. So your intuition is, and that's very well made

02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:52.520
be true, that observation might be way easier than travel from our perspective, from an alien

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:59.160
perspective. We could get very high resolution imaging before we can ever get there.

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:04.520
AC It depends on what information you want. If you want to know the chemical composition

02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.960
and you want to know kilometer scale maps of the planet, then you could do that from afar

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:15.720
with some version of these kind of gravitational lenses. If you want to do better than that,

02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:21.080
if you want to image a newspaper sat on the porch of somebody's house, you're going to have to fly

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:26.280
there. There's no way, unless you had a telescope the size of Sagittarius A star or something,

02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:32.680
you just simply cannot collect enough light to do that from many light years away. So there is

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:40.360
certainly reasons why visiting will always have its place depending on what kind of information

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:47.960
you want. We've proposed in my team, actually, that the sun is the ultimate pinnacle of

02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:52.920
telescope design, but flying to a thousand AU is a real pain in the butt because it's just going

02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:58.360
to take so long. And so a more practical way of achieving this might be to use the earth.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.800
Now the earth doesn't have anywhere near enough gravity to create a substantial gravitational

02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:11.640
lens, but it has an atmosphere and that atmosphere refracts light, it bends light. So whenever you

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:17.720
see a sunset, just as the sun setting below the horizon, it's actually already beneath the

02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:22.440
horizon. It's just that the light is bending through the atmosphere. It's actually already

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:28.280
about half a degree down beneath, and what you're seeing is that curvature of the light path.

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:32.200
And your brain interprets it, of course, to be following a straight line because your brain

02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:37.160
always thinks that. And so you can use that bending. Whenever you have bending, you have a

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:42.840
telescope. And so we've proposed in my team that you could use this refraction to similarly create

02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:47.640
an earth-sized telescope. Called the Terrascope. The Terrascope. Yeah. You have a great video on

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:53.160
this. Do you have a paper on the Terrascope? I do. Yeah. Great. Sometimes I get confused

02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:56.200
just because they've heard of an earth-sized telescope because they may have heard of the

02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:03.560
Event Horizon Telescope, which took an image of the center of our black hole. And it's very

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:09.000
impressive, and it previously did Messier 87, a nearby supermassive black hole. And so those

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:14.760
images were interferometric. So they were small telescopes scattered across the earth, and they

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:21.720
combined the light paths together interferometrically to create effectively an earth-sized angular

02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:26.920
resolution. Telescopes always have two properties. There's the angular resolution, which is how small

02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:31.800
of a thing you can see on the surface. And then there's the magnification. How much brighter does

02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:39.240
that object get versus just your eye or some small object? Now, what the Event Horizon Telescope did,

02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:46.680
it traded off amplification or magnification for the angular resolution. That's what it wanted.

02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:50.920
It wanted that high angular resolution, but it doesn't really have much photon collecting power

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:54.920
because each telescope individually is very small. The Terrascope is different because

02:23:55.560 --> 02:24:00.600
it is literally collecting light with a light bucket, which is essentially the size of the

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:06.760
earth. And so that gives you both benefits potentially, not only the high angular resolution

02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:10.840
that a large aperture promises you, but also actually physically collects all those photons.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:14.920
You can detect light from very, very far away, very out to edges of the universe.

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:25.400
And so we propose this as a possible future technological way of achieving these extreme

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:32.600
goals, ambitious goals we have in astronomy. But it's a very difficult system to test because

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:36.760
you essentially have to fly out to these focus points, and these focus points lie beyond the

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:43.880
moon. So you have to have someone who is willing to fly beyond the moon and hitchhike an experimental

02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:48.920
telescope onto it and do that cheaply. If it was something doing low earth orbit, it'd be easy.

02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:53.320
You could just attach a CubeSat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or something and test it out.

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:56.920
It'd probably only cost you a few tens of thousands of dollars, maybe hundreds of thousand

02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:03.800
dollars. But there's basically no one who flies out that far, except for bespoke missions such

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:09.640
as a mission that's going to Mars or something that would pass through that kind of space.

02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:15.400
And they typically don't have a lot of leeway and excess payload that they're willing to strap on

02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:19.880
for radical experiments. So that's been the problem with it. In theory, it should work

02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:24.200
beautifully, but it's a very difficult idea to experimentally test.

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:26.520
Can you elaborate where the focal point is that far away?

02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:32.760
So you get about half a degree bend from the Earth's atmosphere when you're looking at the

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.320
sun at the horizon. And you get that two times over if you're outside of the planet's atmosphere,

02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.280
because the star is half a bend to you still on the horizon and half a degree

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:45.720
back out the other way. So you get about a one degree bend. You take the radius of the Earth,

02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:50.920
which is about 7,000 kilometers, and do your arctan function, you'll end up with a distance

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.840
that's about, it's actually the inner focal point is about two thirds the distance of the

02:25:54.840 --> 02:26:00.840
Earth-Moon system. The problem with that inner focal point is not useful, because that light ray

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:05.480
path had to basically scrape the surface of the Earth. So it passes through the clouds, it passes

02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:10.040
through all the thick atmosphere, it gets a lot of extinction along the way. If you go higher up in

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.680
altitude, you get less extinction. In fact, you can even go above the clouds. And so that's even

02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:17.880
better because the clouds obviously are going to be a pain in the neck for doing anything optical.

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:22.440
But the problem with that is that the atmosphere, because it gets thinner at higher altitude,

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:28.920
it bends light less. And so that pushes the focal point out. So the most useful focal point is

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:33.320
actually about three or four times the distance of the Earth-Moon separation. And so that's what we

02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:37.400
call one of the Lagrange points essentially out there. And so there is a stable orbit,

02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.040
it's kind of the outermost stable orbit you could have around the Earth.

02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:46.440
So the atmosphere does bad things to the signal of light.

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:48.200
Yeah, it's absorbing light.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.480
Is that possible to reconstruct, to remove the noise, whatever? So it's just strength,

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:56.920
it's nothing else.

02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:00.600
It's possible to reconstruct. I mean, to some degree we do this as a technology called adaptive

02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.000
optics that can correct for what's called wavefront errors that happen through the Earth's

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:11.880
atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent. It is not a single plane of air of the same

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:18.120
density. There's all kind of wiggles and currents in the air. And so that each little layer is

02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:22.920
bending light in slightly different ways. And so the light actually kind of follows a wiggly path

02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:28.120
on its way down. What that means is that two light rays, which are traveling at slightly different

02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:33.320
spatial separations from each other, will arrive at the detector at different times,

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.440
because one maybe goes on more or less a straight path and the one wiggles down a

02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:42.120
bit more before it arrives. And so you have an incoherent light source. And when you're

02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:45.480
trying to do imagery construction, you always want a coherent light source. So the way they

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:50.680
correct for this is that if this path had to travel a little bit faster, the straight one

02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:55.240
goes faster and the wiggly one takes longer, the mirror is deformable. And so you actually bend

02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.920
the mirror on the straight one down a little bit to make it an equivalent light path distance.

02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:05.480
So the mirror itself has all these little actuators. It's actually made up of like

02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:09.960
thousands of little elements, almost looks like a liquid mirror because they can manipulate it in

02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.840
kind of real time. And so they scan the atmosphere with a laser beam to tell what the deformations

02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.920
are in the atmosphere and then make the corrections to the mirror to account for it.

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:19.640
That's amazing.

02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.560
So you could do something like this for the pteroscope, but it would be...

02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.520
It's cheaper and easier to go above the atmosphere and just fly out.

02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:33.720
I think so. That's a very challenging thing to do. And normally when you do adaptive optics,

02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:39.480
as it's called, you're looking straight up or very close to straight up. If you look at the horizon,

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:42.840
we basically never do astronomical observations on the horizon because you're looking through

02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:46.680
more atmosphere. If you go straight up, you're looking at the thinnest portion of atmosphere

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.520
possible. But as you go closer and closer towards the horizon, you're increasing what we call the

02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:55.560
air mass, the amount of air you have to travel through. So here it's kind of the worst case

02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.440
because you're going through the entire atmosphere in and out again with a pteroscope.

02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:04.680
So you'd need a very impressive adaptive optics system to correct for that. So

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:08.040
yeah, I would say it's probably simpler, at least for proof of principle,

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:14.680
just to test it with having some satellite that was at a much wider orbit.

02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.720
Now, speaking of traveling out into deep space, you already mentioned this a little bit.

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.880
You made a beautiful video called The Journey to the End of the Universe.

02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:29.800
And sort of at the start of that, you're talking about Alpha Centauri.

02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:37.480
So what would it take for humans or for human-like creatures to travel out to Alpha Centauri?

02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:43.720
There's a few different ways of doing it, I suppose. One is it depends on how fast your

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:48.680
ship is. That's always going to be the determining factor. If we devised some

02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:51.880
interstellar propulsion system that could travel a fraction of the speed of light,

02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:56.600
then we could do it in our lifetimes, which is, I think, what people normally

02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:02.600
dream of when they think about interstellar propulsion and travel, that you could literally

02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.200
step onto the spacecraft. Maybe a few years later, you step off on Alpha Centauri B,

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:10.920
you walk around the surface and come back and visit your family. There would be, of course,

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:15.880
a lot of relativistic time dilation as a result of that trip. You would have aged a lot less

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:19.800
than people back on Earth by traveling close to the speed of light for some fraction of time.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:26.360
The challenge of this, of course, is that we have no such propulsion system that can achieve this.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:34.120
But do you think it's possible? You have a paper called the Halo Drive,

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:39.000
fuel-free relativistic propulsion of large masses via recycled boomerang photons.

02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:47.160
So do you think, first of all, what is that? And second of all, how difficult are alternate

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:55.160
propulsion systems? Yeah, so before I took in the Halo Drive, there was an idea, because I think the

02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:59.960
Halo Drive is not going to solve this problem. I'll talk about the Halo Drive in a moment,

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:03.640
but the Halo Drive is useful for a civilization which is a bit more advanced than us that has

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:08.360
spread across the stars and is looking for a cheap highway system to get across the galaxy.

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:16.360
For that first step, because just to context that, the Halo Drive requires a black hole,

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.120
so that's why you're not going to be able to do this on the Earth right now. But there are

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:23.000
lots of black holes in the Milky Way, so that's the good news. So we'll come to that in a moment.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:30.280
But if you're trying to travel to Alpha Centauri without a black hole, then there are some ideas

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:34.200
out there. There was a Project Daedalus and Project Icarus that were two projects that the

02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:41.480
British Interplanetary Society conjured up on a 20-30 year timescale. And they asked themselves

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:48.600
if we took existing and speculatively realistic attempts at future technology that are emerging

02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:55.400
over the next few decades, how far could we push into the travel system? And they settled on

02:31:56.440 --> 02:32:02.200
fusion drives in that. So if we had the ability to essentially either detonate, you can always

02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:06.760
imagine that nuclear fission or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind the spacecraft and

02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:13.560
propelling it that way, or having some kind of successful nuclear fusion reaction, which

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:17.880
obviously we haven't really demonstrated yet as a propulsion system, then you could achieve

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:22.680
something like 10% the speed of light in those systems. But these are huge spacecrafts, and I

02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:27.400
think you need a huge spacecraft if you're going to take people along. The conversation recently

02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:33.800
has actually switched, and that idea seems a little bit antiquated now. And most of us have

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:39.240
given up on the idea of people physically, biologically stepping on board the spacecraft.

02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:44.440
And maybe we'll be sending something that's more like a micro probe that maybe just weighs a gram

02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:49.160
or two, and that's much easier to accelerate. You could push that with a laser system to very

02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:53.880
high speed, get it to maybe 20% the speed of light. It has to survive the journey. Probably

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:56.600
a large fraction of them won't survive the journey, but they're cheap enough that you

02:32:56.600 --> 02:33:01.720
could maybe manufacture millions of them, and some of them do arrive and are able to send back an

02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:07.960
image. Or maybe even if you wanted to have a person there, we might have some way of doing

02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:14.120
like a telepresence or some kind of delayed telepresence or some kind of reconstruction

02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:18.280
of the planet, which is sent back so you can digitally interact with that environment in a

02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:24.680
way which is not real time, but representative of what that planet would be like to be on the

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:29.480
surface. So we might be more like digital visitors to these planets, certainly far

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:37.000
easier practically to do that than physically forcing this wet chunk of meat to fly across

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:45.000
space to do that. And so that's maybe something we can imagine down the road. The halo drive,

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:51.240
as I said, is thinking even further ahead. And if you did want to launch large masses,

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.560
large masses could even be planet size things. In the case of the halo drive,

02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:02.920
you can use black holes. So this is kind of a trick of physics. I often think of

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.920
the universe as like a big computer game, and you're trying to find cheat codes, hacks,

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.960
exploits that the universe didn't intend for you to use. But once you find them, you can

02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:17.720
address all sorts of interesting capabilities that you didn't previously have.

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:23.160
And the halo drive does that with black holes. So if you have two black holes, which is a very

02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:29.240
common situation, a binary black hole, and they're inspiring towards each other. LIGOs detected,

02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:33.000
I think, dozens of these things, maybe even over 100 at this point. And these things,

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.080
as they merge together, the pre-merger phase, they're orbiting each other very, very fast,

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:44.760
even close to the speed of light. And so Freeman Dyson, before he passed away, I think in the 70s,

02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:49.240
he had this provocative paper called Gravitational Machines, and he suggested that you could use

02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:54.840
neutron stars as an interstellar propulsion system. And neutron stars are sort of the

02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:02.760
lower mass version of a binary black hole system, essentially. In this case, he suggested just doing

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:12.280
gravitational slingshot. Just fly your spacecraft into this very compact and relativistic binary

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.360
system. And you do need neutron stars because if there were two stars, they'd be physically

02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:20.760
touching each other. So the neutron stars are so small, like 10 kilometers across, they can get

02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:24.920
really close to each other and have these very, very fast orbits with respect to each other.

02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:29.720
You shoot your spacecraft through, right through the middle, like flying through the eye of a needle,

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.200
and you do a slingshot around one of them, and you do it around the one that's coming sort

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.120
of towards you. So one will be coming away, one will be coming towards you at any one point.

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:42.600
And then you could basically steal some of the kinetic energy in the slingshot. In principle,

02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:49.080
you can set it up to twice the speed. You can take your speed and it becomes your speed plus

02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:53.880
twice the speed of the neutron star in this case. And that would be your new speed after the slingshot.

02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:58.280
This seems great because it's just free energy, basically. You're not

02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.720
doing anything. You're not generated to have a nuclear power reactor or anything to generate

02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:05.800
this. You're just stealing it. And indeed, you can get to relativistic speeds this way.

02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:12.040
So I loved that paper, but I had a criticism. And the criticism was that this is like trying

02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:18.040
to fly your ship into a blender, right? This is two neutron stars, which have huge tidal forces.

02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:23.640
And they're whipping around each other once every second or even less than a second.

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:27.480
And you're trying to fly your spaceship and do this maneuver that is pretty precarious.

02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:31.400
And so it just didn't seem practical to me to do this, but I loved it.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:38.440
And so I took that idea and this is how science is. It's iterative. You take a previous great

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.440
man's idea and you just sort of maybe slightly tweak it and improve it. That's how I see the

02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:47.960
Hilodrive. And I just suggested, why not replace those out for black holes, which are certainly

02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:54.520
very common. And rather than flying your ship into that hellhole of a blender system,

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:59.640
you just stand back and you fire a laser beam. Now, because black holes have such intense

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:04.120
gravitational fields, they can bend light into complete 180s. They can actually become mirrors.

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:10.360
So the sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a degree through gravitational lensing,

02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:15.880
but a compact object like a black hole can do a full 180. In fact, obviously, if you went too

02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:19.240
close, if you put the laser beam too close to the black hole, it would just fall into it and never

02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:23.320
come back out. So you just kind of push it out, push it out, push it out until you get to a point

02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:28.040
where it's just skirting the event horizon. And then that laser beam skirts around and it comes

02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:34.040
back. Now the laser beam wants to do, I mean, it is doing a gravitational slingshot, but laser,

02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:40.040
I mean, light photons can't speed up unlike the spaceship case. So instead of speeding up,

02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:45.720
the way they steal energy is they increase their frequency. So they become higher energy photon

02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:50.440
packets essentially, and they get blue shifted so that you send maybe a red laser beam that comes

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:56.440
back blue. It's got more energy in it. And because photons carry momentum, which is somewhat

02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.600
unintuitive in everyday experience, but they do, that's how solar cells work, they carry momentum,

02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:05.400
they push things. You can even use them as laser tweezers and things to pick things up.

02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:13.960
Because they push, it comes back with more momentum than it left. So you get an acceleration force

02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:18.360
from this. And again, you're just seeing energy from the black hole to do this. So you can get up

02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:23.320
to the same speed. It's basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson, but doing it from a safer distance.

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:29.000
And there should be a border of a million or so or 10 million black holes in the Milky Way galaxy.

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:35.240
Some of them would be even as close as sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do the

02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.840
occurrence rate statistics of how close you might expect feasibly one to be.

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:42.520
They're of course difficult to detect because they're black and so they're inherently hard to

02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.920
see. But statistically, there should be plenty out there in the Milky Way. And so these objects

02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:53.640
would be natural waypoint stations. You could use them to both accelerate away and to break and slow

02:38:53.640 --> 02:39:00.520
down. And on top of all this, you know, there's, we've been talking about astronomy and cosmology.

02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:08.200
There's been a lot of exciting breakthroughs in detection and exploration of black holes.

02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:14.760
So the boomerang photons that you're talking about, there's been a lot of work on

02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:22.520
photon rings and just all the fun stuff going on outside the black holes. So all the garbage

02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:28.280
outside is actually might be the thing that holds a key to understanding what's going on inside.

02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:33.160
And there's the Hawking radiation. There's all kinds of fascinating stuff like, I mean, there's

02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:37.640
trippy stuff about black holes that I can't even, most people don't understand. I mean,

02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:43.560
the holographic principle with the plate and the information being stored potentially outside of

02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:50.040
the black hole. I don't even, I can't even comprehend how you can project a three-dimensional object

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:55.240
onto a 2D and somehow store information where it doesn't destroy it. And if it does destroy it,

02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:02.200
challenging all the physics. All of this is very interesting, especially for kind of more

02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.960
practical applications of how the black hole could be used for propulsion.

02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:11.560
I mean, it may be that black holes are used in all sorts of ways by advanced civilizations.

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.760
I think, again, it's been a popular idea in science fiction or science fiction tropes that

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:21.080
Sagittarius A star, the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy could be the best place

02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:29.000
to look for intelligent life in the universe because it is a giant engine in a way. A unique

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.800
capability of a black hole is you can basically throw matter into it and you can get these jets

02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:39.080
that come out, the accretion disks and the jets that fly out. And so you can more or less use them

02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:45.000
to convert matter into energy V equals MC squared. And there's pretty much nothing else except for

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.000
annihilation with its own antiparticle as a way of doing that. So they have some unique properties.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.840
You could perhaps power a civilization by just throwing garbage into a black hole,

02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:59.560
just throwing asteroids in and power your civilization with as much energy as you really

02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:05.160
would ever possibly need. And you could also use them to accelerate away across the universe.

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:10.360
And you can even imagine using small artificial black holes as thermal generators. So the hawking

02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:16.360
radiation from them exponentially increases as they get smaller and smaller in size. And so

02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:21.000
a very small black hole, one that you can almost imagine holding in your hand,

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:27.880
would be a fairly significant heat source. And so that raises all sorts of prospects about how

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:31.880
you might use that in an engineering context to power your civilization as well.

02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.280
You have a video on becoming a Kardashev type one civilization. What's our hope

02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:41.000
for doing that? We're a few orders of magnitude away from that.

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.360
Yeah, it is surprising. I think people tend to think that we're close to this scale. The

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:53.640
Kardashev type one is defined as a civilization which is using as much energy as is essentially

02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:59.080
instant upon the planet from the star. That's a border, I think, for the Earth of something like

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.920
10 to the 5 Teraors or 10 to the 7 Teraors. It's a gigantic amount of energy. And we're using a

02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:11.800
tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that right now. So if you became a Kardashev type one civilization,

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.720
which is seen not necessarily as a goal into itself, I think people think, well, why are

02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:23.320
we aspiring to become this energy-hungry civilization? Surely, our energy needs

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.840
might improve our efficiency or something as time goes on. But ultimately, the more energy you have

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:34.600
access to, the greater your capabilities will be. I mean, if you want to lift Mount Everest into

02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:39.640
space, there is just a calculable amount of potential energy change that that's going to

02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:44.280
take in order to accomplish that. And the more energy you have access to as a civilization,

02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:48.920
then clearly the easier that energy achievement is going to be. So it depends on what your

02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:53.240
aspirations are as a civilization. It might not be something you want to ever do. Well,

02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:59.320
but we should make clear that lifting heavy things isn't the only thing. It's just doing work. So

02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:04.440
it could be computation. It could be more and more and more and more sophisticated and larger

02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:10.280
and larger and larger computation, which is it does seem where we're headed with the very fast

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:17.640
increase in the scale and the quality of our computation outside the human brain,

02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:23.400
artificial computation. Yeah. I mean, computation is a great example of, I mean, already I think

02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:28.200
something like 10% of U.S. power electricity use is going towards the supercomputing centers.

02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:33.240
So there's a vast amount of current energy needs which are already going towards computing,

02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:40.040
surely only increase over time. If we start ever doing anything like mind uploading or creating

02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:45.800
simulated realities, that cost will surely become almost a dominant source of our energy

02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:51.160
requirements at that point if civilization completely moves over to this kind of post-humanism

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:56.680
stage. And so it's not unreasonable that our energy needs would continue to grow. Certainly

02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:02.200
historically they always have at about 2% per year. And so if that continues, there is going

02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:08.040
to be a certain point where you're running up against the amount of energy which you can harvest

02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.560
because even if you cover the entire planet in solar panels, there's no more energy to be had.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.640
And so there's a few ways of achieving this. I sort of talked about in the video how

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:24.520
there were several renewable energy sources that we're excited about like geothermal, wind power,

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:29.640
waves, but pretty much all of those don't really scratch the surface or don't really scratch the

02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:33.400
itch of getting into a Kardashev type one civilization. They're meaningful now. I would

02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:38.360
never tell anybody don't do wind power now because it's clearly useful at our current

02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:43.160
stage of civilization, but it's going to be a pretty negligible fraction of our energy

02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:47.720
requirements if we got to that stage of development. And so there has to be a breakthrough

02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:52.920
in either our ability to harvest solar energy, which would require maybe something like a space

02:44:52.920 --> 02:45:00.120
array of solar panels of beaming the energy back down, or some developments and innovations in

02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.480
nuclear fusion that would allow us to essentially reproduce the same process of what's producing

02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:10.520
the solar photons, but here on earth. But even that comes with some consequences. If you're

02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.760
generating the energy here on earth and you're doing work on it on earth, then that work is

02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.040
going to produce waste heat and that waste heat is going to increase the ambient temperature of

02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:24.520
the planet. And so even if this isn't really a greenhouse effect that you're increasing the

02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:28.040
temperature of the planet, this is just the amount of computers that are churning. You

02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.440
put your hand to a computer, you can feel the warmth coming off them. If you do that much work

02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:38.040
of literally the entire instant energy of the planet is doing that work, the planet is going

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:46.680
to warm up significantly as a result of that. And so that clearly indicates that this is not

02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:51.000
a sustainable path, that civilizations as they approach Kalyshev type one are going to have to

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:57.800
leave planet earth, which is really the point of that video to show that it's a Kalyshev type one

02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:02.520
civilization. Even though it's defined as instant energy upon a planet, that is not a species

02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.600
that is going to still be living on their planet, at least in isolation. They will have to be

02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:14.440
harvesting energy from afar. They will have to be doing work on that energy outside of their planet

02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:18.600
because otherwise you're going to dramatically change the environment in which you live.

02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:26.360
Well, yeah. So the more energy you create, the more energy you use, the higher the imperative to

02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:31.000
expand out into the universe, but also not just the imperative, but the capabilities.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.480
And you've kind of as a side on your lab page mentioned that you're sometimes interested in

02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:43.320
astro engineering. So what kind of space architectures do you think we can build

02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:47.240
to house humans or interesting things outside of earth?

02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:54.120
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of fun ideas here. One of the classic ideas is O'Neill Cylinder or

02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:59.880
Stanford Taurus. These are like two rotating structures that were devised in space. They're

02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:05.480
basically using the centrifugal force as artificial gravity. And so these are structures

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:10.280
which tend to be many kilometers across that you're building in space, but could potentially

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:19.240
habitat millions of people in orbit of the earth. Of course, you could imagine pulling them if the

02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:23.720
expanse does a pretty good job, I think, of exploring the idea of human exploration of the

02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:29.720
solar system and having many objects, many of the small near earth objects and asteroids inhabited

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:36.760
by mining colonies. One of the ideas we've played around with our group is this technology called

02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:44.280
aquasite. Aquasite is an extension. Again, we always tend to extend previous ideas,

02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:50.840
ideas built upon ideas. An extension idea called a statite. A statite was an idea proposed, I think,

02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:57.080
by Ron Forward in the 1970s. 1970s seemed to have all sorts of wacky ideas. I don't know what was

02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:04.200
going on then. I think the Stanford Taurus, the O'Neill Cylinder, statites, the gravitational lens,

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:10.760
people were really having fun with dreaming about space in the 70s. The statite is basically

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:17.800
a solar sail, but it's such an efficient solar sail that the outward force of radiation pressure

02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:24.600
equals the inward force of gravity from the sun. It doesn't need to orbit. Normally, the sun is

02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:29.960
pulling us right now through force of gravity, but we are not getting closer towards the sun,

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.760
even though we are falling towards the sun because we're in orbit, which means our translational

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.560
speed is just enough to keep us at the same altitude, essentially, from the sun. You're in

02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:43.640
orbit, and that's how you maintain distance. A statite doesn't need to do that. It could be

02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:50.920
basically completely static in inertial space, but it's just balancing the two forces of radiation

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:56.200
pressure and inward gravitational pressure. A quasite is the in-between of those two states.

02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:03.960
It has some significant outward pressure, but not enough to resist fully falling into the star,

02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:08.760
and so it compensates for that by having some translational motion. It's in between

02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:15.320
an orbit and a statite. What that allows you to do is maintain artificial orbits. Normally,

02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:20.200
if you want to calculate your orbital speed of something that's, say, half an AU, you would use

02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:25.080
Kepler's third law and go through that. You'd say, okay, if it's half an AU, I can calculate

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:30.520
the period by p squared is proportional to a cubed, and go through that. For a quasite,

02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:36.200
you can basically have any speed you want. It's just a matter of how much of the gravitational

02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.080
force are you balancing out. You effectively enter an orbit where you're making the mass of

02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.520
the star be less massive than it really is. It's as if you're orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star or a

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:54.440
0.2 solar mass star, whatever you want. That means that Mercury orbits with a pretty fast orbital

02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:59.880
speed around the Sun because it's closer to the Sun than we are, but we could put something in

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:06.040
Mercury's orbit that would have a slower speed and so it would co-track with the Earth. We

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:12.280
would always be aligned with them at all times. This could be useful if you wanted to have

02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:22.200
either a chain of colonies or something that were able to easily communicate and move between

02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:26.600
one another between these different bases. You'd probably use something like this to maintain that

02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:34.120
easy transferability, or you could even use it as a space weather monitoring system,

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:39.880
which was actually proposed in the paper. We know that major events like the Carrington event that

02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:44.360
happened can knock out all of our electromagnetic systems quite easily. A major solar flare could

02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:53.000
do that, a geomagnetic storm. But if we had the ability to detect those higher elevated activity

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:59.480
cycles in advance, the problem is they travel pretty fast and so it's hard to get ahead of them.

02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:03.080
But you could have a station which is basically sampling solar flares very close to the surface

02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:08.440
of the Earth and as soon as it detects anything suspicious magnetically, it could then send that

02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:13.400
information straight back at the speed light to your Earth and give you maybe a half an hour

02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:18.760
warning or something that something bad was coming. You should shut off all your systems or get in

02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:25.880
your Faraday cage now and protect yourself. These quasites are a cool trick of again hacking the

02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:30.680
laws of physics. It's like another one of these exploits that the universe seems to allow us to do

02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:38.520
to potentially manifest these artificial systems that would otherwise be difficult to produce.

02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:40.840
So leveraging natural phenomena.

02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:48.280
Yeah. That's always the key. In my mind, it's to work with nature. That's how I see astroengineering

02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:53.560
rather than against it. You're not trying to force it to do something. That's why I always

02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:58.360
think solar energy is so powerful because in the battle against nuclear fusion, nuclear fusion,

02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:02.440
you're really fighting a battle where you're trying to confine plasma into this extremely

02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:12.200
tight space. The Sun does this for free. It has gravitation. That's in essence what a solar panel

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:19.320
does. It is a nuclear fusion reactor-fueled energy system, but it's just using gravitation

02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:23.960
for the confinement and having a huge standoff distance for its energy collection.

02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:30.200
And so there are tricks like that. It's a very naive, simple trick in that case,

02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:35.400
where we can rather than having to reinvent the wheel, we can use the space infrastructure,

02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:39.000
if you like, the astrophysical infrastructure that's already there to our benefit.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:44.680
Yeah. I think in the long arc of human history, probably natural phenomena is the right solution.

02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:48.520
That's the simple, that's the other solution because all the power is already there. That's

02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:54.760
why a Dyson Sphere in the long sort of, well, you don't know what a Dyson Sphere would look like,

02:52:54.760 --> 02:53:00.440
but some kind of thing that leverages the power, the energy that's already in the Sun is better

02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:09.240
than creating artificial nuclear fusion reaction. But then again, that brings us to the topic of AI.

02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:19.000
How much of this, if we're traveling out there, interstellar travel or doing some

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:24.280
of the interesting things we've been talking about, how much of those ships would be occupied

02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:34.600
by AI systems do you think? What would be the living organisms occupying those ships?

02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:41.160
Yeah. It's depressing to think about AI in the search for life because

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:46.120
it has, I mean, I've been thinking about it a lot over the last few weeks with playing around

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:51.080
with chat GPT-3 like many of us and being astonished with its capabilities. And you see

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:59.800
that our society is undergoing a change that seems significant in terms of the development

02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:05.480
of artificial intelligence. We've been promised this revolution, this singularity for a long time,

02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:11.240
but it really seems to be stepping up its pace of development at this point.

02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:18.360
And so that's interesting because as someone who looks freely in life out there in the universe,

02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:25.960
it sort of implies that our current stage of development is highly transitional and that

02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:32.520
you go back for the last four and a half billion years, the planet was dumb essentially. If you go

02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:36.440
back the last few thousand years, there was a civilization, but it wasn't really producing any

02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.760
technosignatures. And then over the last maybe a hundred years, there's been something that might

02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:47.080
be detectable from afar. But we're approaching this cusp where we might imagine it. I mean,

02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:52.280
we're thinking of like maybe years and decades with AI development typically when we talk about

02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:57.240
this. But as an astronomer, I have to think about much longer timescales of centuries,

02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:04.520
millennia, millions of years. And so if this wave continues over that timescale,

02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:10.920
which is still the blink of an eye on a cosmic timescale, that implies that everything will

02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:15.720
be AI essentially out there if this is a common behavior. And so that's intriguing because it

02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:23.400
sort of implies that we are special in terms of our moment in time as a civilization, which

02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:29.720
it normally is something we're averse to as astronomers. We normally like this mediocrity

02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.720
principle. We're not special. We're a typical part of the universe. It's not the cosmological

02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:42.360
principle, but in a temporal sense, we may be in a unique location. And perhaps that is part of the

02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:47.640
solution to the Fermi paradox in fact, that if it is true that planets tend to go through basically

02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:54.680
three phases, dumb life for the vast majority, a brief period of biological intelligence,

02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:59.240
and then an extended period of artificial intelligence that they transition to, then

02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:05.160
we would be at a unique and special moment in galactic history that would be of particular

02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:11.080
interest for any anthropologists out there in the galaxy. This would be the time that you would want

02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:16.360
to study a civilization very carefully. You wouldn't want to interfere with it. You would

02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:21.400
just want to see how it plays out, kind of similar to the ancestor simulations that are sometimes

02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:26.600
talked about with the simulation argument, that you are able to observe perhaps your own origins

02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.640
and study how the transformation happens. And so yeah, that has for me recently been throwing the

02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:36.840
Fermi paradox a bit on its head and this idea of the zoo hypothesis that we may be monitored,

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:42.440
which has for a long time been sort of seen as a fringe idea even amongst the SETI community.

02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:50.920
But if we live in this truly transitional period, it adds a lot of impetus to that idea, I think.

02:56:50.920 --> 02:57:01.800
Well, even AI itself, by its very nature, would be observing us. There used to be this concept of

02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:08.200
human computation, which is actually exactly what's feeding the current language models,

02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:15.000
which is leveraging all the busy stuff we're doing to do the hard work of learning. So the

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:23.400
language models are trained on human interaction and human language on the internet. And so AI

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:33.160
feeds on the output of brain power from humans. And so it would be observing and observing,

02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:37.480
and it gets stronger as it observes. So it actually gets extremely good at observing humans.

02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:44.680
And one of the interesting philosophical questions that starts percolating is what is

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:51.320
the interesting thing that makes us human? We tend to think of it, and you said there's three

02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:58.360
phases. What's the thing that's hard to come by in phase three? Is it something like scarcity,

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:02.600
which is limited resources? Is it something like consciousness? Is that the thing that's very,

02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:11.320
that emerged the evolutionary process in biological systems that are operating under

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:18.600
constrained resources? This thing that it feels like something to experience the world,

02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:24.600
which we think of as consciousness, is that really difficult to replicate in artificial systems? Is

02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:31.000
that the thing that makes us fundamentally human? Or is it just a side effect that we attribute way

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:40.040
too much importance to? Do you have a sense, if we look out into the future and AI systems are

02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:46.840
the ones that are traveling out there to Alpha Centauri and beyond, do you think they have to

02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:54.760
carry the flame of consciousness with them? No, not necessarily. They may do, but they may,

02:58:54.760 --> 02:59:00.920
it may not be unnecessarily. I mean, I guess we're talking about the difference here between sort of

02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:07.640
an AGI, artificial general intelligence, or consciousness, which are distinct ideas. And

02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:11.560
you can certainly have one without the other. So I could imagine. I would disagree with this

02:59:11.560 --> 02:59:16.200
certainly in that statement. Okay. Okay. I think it's very possible in order to have

02:59:16.200 --> 02:59:20.520
intelligence, you have to have consciousness. Okay. Well, I mean, to a certain degree,

02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:25.880
chat GBT three has a level of intelligence already. It's not a general intelligence,

02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:33.000
but it displays properties of intelligence with no consciousness. So again, I would disagree.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:40.360
Okay. Okay. Well, I don't, I don't, I don't know. Because you said it's very nice. You said it

02:59:40.360 --> 02:59:45.640
displays properties of intelligence in the same way it displays properties of intelligence. I would

02:59:45.640 --> 02:59:50.200
say it's starting to display properties of consciousness. It certainly could fool you

02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:55.880
that it's conscious. Correct. Yeah. So I guess like a, a Turing test problem, like if it's

02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:01.320
displaying all those properties, if it, if it quacks like a parrot, looks like a parrot

03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:05.880
or cracks like a duck, things like, isn't it, isn't it basically a duck at that point? So yeah,

03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:13.400
I can see that argument. It probably, I mean, certainly as an, I tried to think about it from

03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:17.240
the observer's point of view as an astronomer, what am I looking for?

03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:24.520
Whether that intelligence is conscious or not has little bearing, I think, as to

03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:32.040
what I should be looking for when I'm trying to detect evidence of them. It would maybe affect

03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:40.040
their behavior in ways that I can't predict. But that's again, getting into the game of

03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:44.520
what I would call xenopsychology of trying to make projections about the motivations

03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:50.120
of an alien species is incredibly difficult. And similarly for any kind of artificial intelligence,

03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:55.640
it's unfathomable what its intentions may be. I mean, I would sort of question whether it would

03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:02.600
even be interested in traveling between the stars at all. If its primary goal is computation,

03:01:03.240 --> 03:01:08.360
computation for the sake of computation, then it's probably going to have a different

03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:14.360
way of, it's going to be engineering its solar system and the nearby material around it for

03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:19.640
a different goal if it's just simply trying to increase computer substrate across the universe.

03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:25.160
And that, of course, if that is its principal intention to just essentially convert dumb

03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:31.480
matter into smart matter as it goes, then I think that would come into conflict with our observations

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:37.000
of the universe, right? Because the Earth shouldn't be here if that were true. The Earth

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:41.160
should have been transformed into computer substrate by this point. There has been plenty

03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:51.800
of time in the history of the galaxy for that to have happened. So I'm skeptical in the part

03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:58.360
that that's a behavior that AI or any civilization really engages in. But I also find it difficult

03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:04.760
to find a way out of it, to explain why that would never happen in the entire history of the galaxy

03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:11.160
amongst potentially if life is common, millions, maybe even billions of instantiations of AI could

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:19.240
have occurred across the galaxy. And so that seems to be a knock against the idea that there is life

03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:25.560
else or intelligent life else in the galaxy. The fact that that hasn't occurred in our history

03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:32.040
is maybe the only solid data point we really have about the activities of other civilizations.

03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:39.960
Of course, the scary one could be that we just at this stage, intelligent alien civilizations

03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:45.640
just start destroying themselves. It becomes too powerful. Everything's just too many weapons,

03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:52.680
too many nuclear weapons, too many nuclear weapons style systems that just from mistake to aggression,

03:02:54.120 --> 03:03:00.040
like the probability of self-destruction is too high relative to the challenge of avoiding

03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:03.480
the technological challenges of avoiding self-destruction.

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:11.080
You mean the AI destroys itself or we destroy ourselves prior to the advent of AI?

03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:17.640
As we get smarter and smarter AI, either AI destroys us or other, there could be just a million,

03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:22.120
like AI is correlated, the development of AI is correlated with all this other technological

03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:32.120
innovation. Genetic engineering, all kinds of engineering at the nanoscale, mass manufacture

03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:38.200
of things that could destroy us or cracking physics enough to have very powerful weapons,

03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:45.160
nuclear weapons, all of it, just too much. Physics enables way too many things that can destroy us

03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:55.000
before it enables the propulsion systems that allow us to fly far enough away before we destroy

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:58.440
ourselves. Maybe that's what happens to the other alien civilizations.

03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.320
Is that your resolution? I think us in the technosignature community and the astronomy

03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:07.720
community aren't thinking about this problem seriously enough, in my opinion. We should be

03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:14.200
thinking about what AI is doing to our society and the implications of what we're looking for.

03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:21.320
The only part of this thinking has to involve people like yourself who are more intimate with

03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:27.320
the machine learning and artificial intelligence world is how do you reconcile in your mind,

03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:32.120
you said earlier that you think you can't imagine a galaxy where life and intelligence

03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:37.560
is not all over the place. If artificial intelligence is a natural progression

03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:44.840
for civilizations, how do you reconcile that with the absence of any information around us or any

03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:51.080
clues or hints of artificial behavior, artificially engineered stars, or colonization,

03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:53.880
computer substrate, transformed planets, anything like that?

03:04:53.880 --> 03:05:01.800
It's extremely difficult for me. The Fermi paradox broadly defined is extremely difficult for me,

03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:07.640
and the terrifying thing is one thing I suspect is that we keep destroying ourselves. The

03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:12.840
probability of self-destruction with advanced technology is just extremely high. That's why

03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:19.480
we're not seeing it. But then again, my intuition about why we haven't blown ourselves up with

03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:27.320
nuclear weapons, it's very surprising to me from a scientific perspective. Given all the cruelty

03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:34.760
I've seen in the world, given the power that nuclear weapons place in the hands of a very

03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:40.200
small number of individuals, it's very surprising to me that we destroy ourselves, and it seems to

03:05:40.200 --> 03:05:48.120
be a very low probability situation happening here. And then the other explanation is the zoos,

03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:54.600
the observation that we're just being observed. That's the only other thing. It's so difficult

03:05:54.600 --> 03:06:01.800
for me. Of course, all of science, everything is very humbling. It would be very humbling for me

03:06:01.880 --> 03:06:09.000
to learn that we're alone in the universe. It would change. You know what?

03:06:09.960 --> 03:06:14.200
Maybe I do want that to be true because you want us to be special. That's why I'm resisting that

03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:20.120
thought maybe. There's no way we're that special. There's no way we're that special. That's where

03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:27.400
my resistance comes from. I would just say, the specialness is, implicitly in that statement,

03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:33.080
there's an assumption that we are something positive. We're a gift to this planet or

03:06:33.080 --> 03:06:39.480
something, and that makes us special. But it may be that intelligence is more of, we're like rats

03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:45.400
or cockroaches. We're an infestation of this planet. We're not some benevolent property

03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:51.480
that a planet would ideally like to have if you can even say such a thing. But we may be

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:57.720
not only generally a negative force for a planet's biosphere and its own survivability,

03:06:57.720 --> 03:07:03.000
which I think you can make a strong argument about, but we may also be a very persistent

03:07:03.560 --> 03:07:08.600
infestation that may, even in the wake of a nuclear war,

03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:15.800
would that be an absolute eradication of every human being, which would be a fairly extreme event?

03:07:15.800 --> 03:07:19.880
Or would the candle of consciousness, as you might call it, the flame of consciousness,

03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:25.720
continue with some small pockets that would, maybe in 10,000 years, 100,000 years,

03:07:25.720 --> 03:07:30.040
we'd see civilization re-emerge and play out the same thing over again?

03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:34.120
Yeah, that's certainly, but nuclear weapons aren't powerful enough yet. But yes,

03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:41.480
to sort of push back on the infestation, sure, but the word special doesn't have to be positive.

03:07:42.360 --> 03:07:46.680
I just mean- I think it tends to imply, but I take your point. Yeah, but maybe,

03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:53.880
um, just maybe extremely rare might be. Yeah, and that to me, it just, it's very strange

03:07:55.640 --> 03:08:07.000
for me to be cosmically unique. It's just very strange. I mean, that we're the only thing

03:08:08.120 --> 03:08:12.520
of this level of complexity in the galaxy just seems very strange to me.

03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:19.720
I would just, yeah, I do think it depends on this classification. I think there is sort of, again,

03:08:19.720 --> 03:08:25.080
it's kind of buried within there as a subtext, but there is a classification that we're doing here

03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:30.920
that what we are is a distinct category of life, let's say, in this case. When we talk about

03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:36.200
intelligence, we are something that can be separated. But of course, we see intelligence

03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:40.280
across the animal kingdom in, you know, dolphins, humpback whales,

03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:50.200
octopuses, crows, ravens. And so it's quite possible that these are all manifestations

03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:57.000
of the same thing. And we are not a particularly distinct class, except for the fact we make

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.960
technology. That's really the only difference for our intelligence. And we classify that separately,

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:06.760
but from a biological perspective, to some degree, it's really just all part of a continuum.

03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:13.160
And so that's why when we talk about unique, you are putting yourself in a box, which is

03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:18.040
distinct and saying, this is the only example of things that fall into this box. But the walls of

03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:24.680
that box may themselves be a construct of our own arrogance that we are something distinct.

03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:30.520
And, but I was also speaking broadly for us, meaning all life on Earth.

03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:39.720
That, but then it's possible that there's all kinds of living ecosystems

03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:44.840
and on other planets and other moons that just don't have interest in technological development.

03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:52.360
And maybe, maybe technological development is the parasitic thing. It destroys the organism

03:09:52.360 --> 03:10:00.360
broadly. And then maybe that's actually one of the fundamental realities. Whatever broad way

03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:04.680
to categorize technological development, that's just the parasitic thing that just destroys

03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.680
itself. It's a cancer. We're flirting around, sorry to interrupt, but we're flirting around

03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.800
this idea of the great filter a little bit here. So we're asking, where is this? Does it lie ahead

03:10:13.800 --> 03:10:19.000
of us? Nuclear war may be imminent. That would be a filter that's ahead of us. Or could it be behind

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.280
us and that it's the advent of technology that is genuinely a rare occurrence in the universe and

03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:31.400
that explains the Fermi paradox. And so that's something that obviously people have debated

03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:38.280
and argued about in SETI for decades and decades, but it remains a persistent,

03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:41.880
people argue about whether it should be really called a paradox or not, but it remains a

03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:48.520
consistent apparent contradiction that you can make a very cogent argument as to why you expect

03:10:48.520 --> 03:10:53.800
life and intelligence to be common in the universe. And yet everything we know about

03:10:53.800 --> 03:11:01.960
the universe is fully compatible with just us being here. And that's a haunting thought, but

03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:10.920
I have no preference or desire for that to be true. I'm not trying to impose that view on anyone,

03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:15.880
but I do ask that we remain open-minded until evidence has been collected either way.

03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:23.480
The thing is it's one of, if not the, probably I would argue it's the most important question

03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:29.640
facing human civilization or the most interesting. I think scientifically speaking,

03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:38.840
what question is more important? Then somehow there could be other ways to sneak up to it,

03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:46.280
but it gets to the essence of what we are, what these living organisms are. It's somehow

03:11:46.840 --> 03:11:51.960
seeing another kind helps us understand. It speaks to the human condition, helps us

03:11:51.960 --> 03:12:01.320
understand what it is to be human to some degree. I have tried to remain very agnostic about the

03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:06.920
idea of life and intelligence. One thing I try to be more optimistic about, and I've been

03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:11.320
thinking a lot with our searches for life in the universe, is life in the past.

03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:17.960
I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy right now.

03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:24.120
Living. Yeah, that's currently extent. But there may be very many extinct civilizations. If each

03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:29.000
civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say, AI is the demise of our own,

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:33.160
that's only a few hundred years of technological development or maybe 10,000 years if you go back

03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:39.160
to the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of agriculture, hardly anything in cosmic time span.

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:45.400
That's nothing. That's the blink of an eye. It's not surprising at all that we would happen not

03:12:45.400 --> 03:12:53.240
to coexist with anyone else, but that doesn't mean nobody else was ever here. If other civilizations

03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:58.040
come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour the galaxy around them,

03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:02.760
don't find any evidence for intelligence, then they have two options. They can either give up

03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:08.920
on communication and just say, well, it's never going to happen. We may as well just worry about

03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:13.400
what's happening here on our own planet. Or they could attempt communication, but communication

03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:21.400
is through time. That's almost the most selfless act of communication because there's no hope of

03:13:22.040 --> 03:13:27.960
getting anything back. It's a philanthropic gift almost to that other civilization that you can

03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:32.680
maybe might just be nothing more than a monument, which the pyramids essentially are,

03:13:32.680 --> 03:13:38.680
a monument of their existence, that these are the things they achieved, the things they believed in,

03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:45.560
their language, their culture. Or it could be maybe something more than that. It could be

03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:50.440
lessons from what they learned in their own history. And so I've been thinking a lot

03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:59.800
recently about how would we send a message to other civilizations in the future? Because that

03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:06.040
act of thinking seriously about the engineering of how you design it would inform us about what we

03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:13.240
should be looking for and also perhaps be our best chance, quite frankly, of ever making contact.

03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:19.800
It might not be the contact we dream of, but it's still contact. There would still be a record of

03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:24.120
our existence as pitiful as it might be compared to a two-way communication.

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:32.360
And I love the humility behind that project, that universal project. It's humble.

03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:44.440
It humbles you to the vast temporal landscape of the universe, just realizing our day-to-day

03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:50.760
lives. All of us will be forgotten. It's nice to think about something that sends a signal out to

03:14:50.760 --> 03:14:58.600
others. Yeah. It was almost like a humility of acceptance as well, of knowing that you have

03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:05.000
a terminal disease, but your impact on the earth doesn't have to end with your death. That it could

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:10.200
go on beyond with what you leave behind for others to discover with maybe the books you

03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:15.240
write or what you leave in the literature. Do you think launching the Roadster vehicle

03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:21.320
out in space? Yeah, the Roadster. I'm not sure what someone would make of that.

03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:29.720
I mean, there have been quasi-attempts at it beyond the Roadster. I mean, there's like plaques on,

03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:36.040
there's the Pioneer plaques, there's the Voyager 2 golden record. It's pretty unlikely anybody's

03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:42.200
going to discover those because they're just adrift in space and they will eventually

03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:45.960
mechanically die and not produce any signal for anyone to spot. So you'd have to be extremely

03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.760
lucky to come across them. I've often said to my colleagues that I think the best place is the moon.

03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:59.400
The moon, unlike the earth, has no significant weathering. How long will the Apollo descent

03:15:59.400 --> 03:16:05.960
stages, which are still set on the lunar surface, last for? The only real effect is micrometeorites,

03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:12.040
which are slowly like dust smashing against them pretty much. But that's going to take millions,

03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:17.560
potentially billions of years to erode that down. And so we have an opportunity, and that's on the

03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:21.880
surface. If you put something just a few meters beneath the surface, it would have even greater

03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:28.680
protection. And so it raises the prospect that if we wanted to send something, a significant amount

03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:33.480
of information to a future galactic spanning civilization that maybe cracks the interstellar

03:16:33.480 --> 03:16:40.680
propulsion problem, the moon's going to be there for 5 billion years. That's a long time for somebody

03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:46.920
to come by and detect maybe a strange pattern that we draw on the sand for them to, you know,

03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:52.360
big arrow, big cross, like look under here and we could have a tomb of knowledge of some record of

03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:59.880
our civilization. And so I think when you think like that, what that implies to us, well, okay,

03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:05.240
the galaxy is 13 billion years old. The moon is already 4 billion years old. There may be places

03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:12.760
familiar to us, nearby to us, that we should be seriously considering as places we should look

03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:16.760
for life and intelligent life or evidence of relics that they might leave behind for us.

03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:24.920
So that thinking like that will help us find such relics and it's like a beneficial cycle

03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:31.080
that happens. That enables the science of society better, like of searching for bios

03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:39.640
and tech signatures and so on. And it's inspiring. I mean, it's also inspiring in that we want to leave

03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:46.680
a legacy behind as an entire civilization, not just in the symbols, but broadly speaking.

03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:51.400
That's the last thing somehow. Yeah. And I'm part of a team that's trying to

03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:58.440
repeat the golden record experiment. We're trying to create like an open-source version of the golden

03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:03.400
record that future spacecraft are able to download and basically put in a little hard drive that they

03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:07.800
can carry around with them and, you know, get these distributed hopefully across the solar system

03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:12.680
eventually. So it's going to be called the Hey Tracker's Guide to the Galaxy? Yeah, it could be.

03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:16.360
That's a good name for it. We've been toying a little bit with the name, but I think probably

03:18:16.360 --> 03:18:19.480
it'll just be golden record at this point or golden record version two or something. But

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:28.840
I think another benefit that I see of this activity is that it forces us as a species

03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:34.840
to ask those questions about what it is that we want another civilization to know about us.

03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:40.760
The golden record was kind of funny because it had photos on it and it had photos of people eating,

03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:46.440
for instance, but it had no photos of people defecating. And so I always thought that was

03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:53.640
kind of funny because if I was an alien, or if I was studying an alien, if I saw images of an alien,

03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:58.360
I'm not trying to be like a pervert or anything, but I would want to understand the biology of

03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:08.360
that alien. And so we always censor what we show. We should show the whole actual natural process

03:19:08.360 --> 03:19:13.720
and then also say, we humans tend to censor these things. We tend to not like to walk around naked.

03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:20.280
We tend to not to talk about some of the natural biological phenomena and talk a lot about others

03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:25.480
and actually just be very, like the way you would be to a therapist or something,

03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:30.120
very transparent about the way we actually operate. Yeah. I mean, and Sagan had that with

03:19:30.120 --> 03:19:35.480
the golden record. I think he originally, there's a male and a female figure to pitch on the golden

03:19:35.480 --> 03:19:43.480
record. And the woman had a genitalia originally drawn and there was a lot of pushback from,

03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:48.040
I think, a lot of Christian groups who were not happy about the idea of throwing this into space.

03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:55.560
And so eventually they had to remove that. And so it would be confusing biologically if you're

03:19:55.560 --> 03:20:01.800
trying to study xenobiology of this alien that apparently has no genitalia or the man does,

03:20:01.800 --> 03:20:07.240
but for some reason the woman doesn't. And that's our own societal and cultural

03:20:08.520 --> 03:20:16.200
imprint happening into that information. To be fair, just even having two sexes

03:20:16.760 --> 03:20:20.520
and predators and prey, just the whole, that could be just a very unique Earth-like thing.

03:20:20.520 --> 03:20:24.440
So they might be confused about why there's like pairs of things. Like why are you,

03:20:25.400 --> 03:20:31.720
like why is there a man and a woman in general? Like they could be, I mean, they could be confused

03:20:31.720 --> 03:20:36.280
about a lot of things in general. I don't even know which way to hold the picture.

03:20:38.040 --> 03:20:43.640
Or there's the picture. They might have very different sensory devices to even interpret this.

03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:49.640
If they only have sound as their only way of navigating the world, it's kind of lost to send

03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:55.080
any kind of, there's been a lot of conversation about sending video and audio and video and

03:20:55.080 --> 03:21:00.040
pictures. And that's one of the things I've been a little bit resistant about in the team that I've

03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:06.760
been thinking, well, they might not have eyes. And so if you lived in the Europa surface,

03:21:06.760 --> 03:21:12.760
having eyes wouldn't be very useful. If you lived on a very dark planet on the tightly locked

03:21:12.760 --> 03:21:17.480
nightside of an exoplanet, having eyes wouldn't be particularly useful. So it's kind of a presumption

03:21:17.480 --> 03:21:23.160
of us to think that video is a useful form of communication. Do you hope we become a

03:21:23.160 --> 03:21:29.000
multi-planetary species? So we almost sneaking up to that, but you know, the efforts of SpaceX,

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:33.880
of Elon, maybe in general, what your thoughts are about those efforts. So you already mentioned

03:21:33.880 --> 03:21:39.160
Starship will be very interesting for astronomy, for science in general, just getting stuff out

03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:45.640
into space. But what about the longer term goal of actually colonizing, of building civilizations

03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:51.480
on other surfaces, on moons, on planets? It seems like a fairly obvious thing to do for

03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:59.800
our survival, right? There's a high risk. If we are committed to trying to keep this human experiment

03:21:59.800 --> 03:22:06.760
going, putting all of our eggs in one basket is always going to be a risky strategy to pursue.

03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:12.200
It's a nice basket though. It is a beautiful basket. I personally have no interest in living

03:22:12.200 --> 03:22:17.000
on Mars or the moon. I would like to visit, but I would definitely not want to spend the

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:23.080
rest of my life and die on Mars. It means a hellhole. Mars is a very, very difficult.

03:22:23.080 --> 03:22:29.480
I think the idea that this is going to happen in the next 10, 20 years seems to be very optimistic.

03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:37.960
Not that it's insurmountable, but the challenges are extreme to survive on a planet like Mars,

03:22:37.960 --> 03:22:46.280
which is like a dry, frozen desert with a high radiation environment. It's a challenge of a type

03:22:46.280 --> 03:22:53.000
we've never faced before. I'm sure human ingenuity can tackle it, but I'm skeptical that we'll have

03:22:53.000 --> 03:23:00.920
thousands of people living on Mars in my lifetime. But I would relish that opportunity to maybe one

03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:08.680
day visit such a settlement and do scientific experiments on Mars or experience Mars,

03:23:08.680 --> 03:23:14.360
do astronomy from Mars, all sorts of cool stuff you could do. Sometimes you see these dreams of

03:23:14.360 --> 03:23:19.560
outer solar system exploration and you can fly through the clouds of Venus, or you could

03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:25.560
just do these enormous jumps on these small moons where you can essentially jump as high as a

03:23:25.560 --> 03:23:30.760
skyscraper and traverse them. There's all sorts of wonderful ice skating on Europa might be

03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:37.640
fun. So I love the idea of us becoming interplanetary. I think it's just a question

03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:48.120
of time. Our own destructive tendencies, as you said earlier, are at odds with our emerging

03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:53.960
capability to become interplanetary. The question is, will we get out of the nest before we burn it

03:23:53.960 --> 03:24:01.000
down? I don't know. Obviously, I hope that we do, but I don't have any special insight.

03:24:03.240 --> 03:24:09.960
There is somewhat of an annoying intellectual itch I have with the so-called doomsday argument,

03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:15.800
which I try not to treat too seriously, but there is some element of it that bothers me.

03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:22.680
The doomsday argument basically suggests that you're typically the mediocrity principle,

03:24:22.680 --> 03:24:26.280
you're not special, that you're probably going to be born somewhere in the middle of all human

03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:31.160
beings who will ever be born. You're unlikely to be one of the first 1% of human beings that ever

03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:37.000
lived and similarly the last 1% of human beings that will ever live because you'd be very unique

03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:43.480
and special if that were true. By this logic, you can calculate how many generations of humans you

03:24:43.480 --> 03:24:47.960
might expect. So if there's been, let's say, 100 billion human beings that have ever lived on this

03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:56.280
planet, then you could say to 95% confidence, so you divide by 5%, so 100 billion divided by 0.05

03:24:56.280 --> 03:25:00.840
would give you 2 trillion human beings that would ever live, you'd expect by this argument.

03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:12.920
In general, the planet has a 10 billion population, so that would be 200 generations of humans we

03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:18.040
would expect ahead of us. If each one has an average lifetime, let's say 100 years,

03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:21.560
then that would be about 20,000 years. So there's 20,000 years left in the clock,

03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:32.920
that's how they typically lay it out. A lot of the criticisms of the doomsday argument come down to

03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:36.600
what are you really counting? You're counting humans there, but maybe you should be counting

03:25:36.600 --> 03:25:42.600
years or maybe you should be counting human hours because what you count makes a big difference to

03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:47.240
what you get out on the other end. This is called the reference class. That's one of the big

03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:51.800
criticisms of the doomsday argument. But I do think it has a compelling point that it would be

03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:59.720
surprising if our future is to one day blossom and become a galactic-spanning empire. Trillions

03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:05.240
upon trillions upon trillions of human beings will one day live across the stars for essentially

03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:11.480
as long as the galaxy exists and the stars burn. We would live at an incredibly special

03:26:11.480 --> 03:26:18.520
point in that story. We would be right at the very, very, very beginning. That's not impossible,

03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:26.040
but it's just somewhat improbable. Part of that irks against me, but it also almost feels like

03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:32.200
a philosophical argument because you're talking about souls being drawn from this cosmic pool.

03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:39.080
It's not an argument that I lose sleep about for our fate of the doomsday, but it is

03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:47.560
somewhat intellectually annoying that there is a slight contradiction there, it feels like,

03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:53.560
with the idea of a galactic-spanning empire. Of course, there are so many unknowns.

03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:59.480
I, for one, would love to visit even space, but

03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:03.160
Mars. Just imagine standing on Mars and looking back at Earth.

03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:13.080
It would be an incredible sight. It would give you such a fresh perspective as to your entire

03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:17.240
existence and what it meant to be human. Yeah, and then come back to Earth and it

03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:23.080
would give you a heck of a perspective. Plus, the sunset on Mars is supposed to be nice.

03:27:23.080 --> 03:27:29.320
I loved what William Shatner said after his flight. His words really moved me when he came down,

03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:36.280
and I think it really captured the idea that we shouldn't really be sending engineers,

03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:41.320
our scientists, into space. We should be sending our poets because those are the people when they

03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:48.200
come down who can truly make a difference when they describe their experiences in space. I found

03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:53.560
it very moving reading what he said. Yeah, when you talk to astronauts,

03:27:53.880 --> 03:27:59.880
when they describe what they see, it's like they've discovered a whole new thing that

03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:04.600
they can't possibly convert back into words. Yeah, it's beautiful to see.

03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:10.200
Just as a quick, before I forget, I have to ask you, can you summarize your argument against

03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:16.440
the hypothesis that we live in a simulation? Is it similar to our discussion about the

03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:23.880
Doomsday Clock? No, it's actually probably more similar to my agnosticism about life in the

03:28:23.880 --> 03:28:29.640
universe, and it's just remaining agnostic about all possibilities. The simulation argument,

03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:37.960
sometimes it gets mixed. There's two distinct things that we need to consider. One is the

03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:42.760
probability that we live in so-called base reality, that we're not living in a simulated

03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:48.120
reality itself. Another probability we need to consider is the probability that that technology

03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:53.240
is viable or possible and something we will ultimately choose to one day do.

03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:56.680
Those are two distinct things. They're probably quite similar numbers to each other,

03:28:56.680 --> 03:29:04.040
but they are distinct probabilities. In my paper I wrote about this, I just tried to work through

03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:08.120
the problem. I teach astrocystics, actually, teaching it this morning. It just seemed like a

03:29:08.120 --> 03:29:13.960
fun case study of working through a Bayesian calculation for it. Bayesian calculations work

03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:20.120
on conditionals. When you hear what inspired this project, it was when I heard Musk said it was a

03:29:20.120 --> 03:29:27.720
billion to one chance that we don't live in a simulation. He's right if you add the Bayesian

03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:32.200
conditional, and the Bayesian conditional is conditioned upon the fact that we eventually

03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:37.880
develop that technology and choose to use it, or it's chosen to be used by such species.

03:29:37.880 --> 03:29:42.680
By such civilizations, that's the conditional. You have to add that in because that conditional

03:29:42.680 --> 03:29:50.200
isn't guaranteed. In a Bayesian framework, you can make that explicit. You see mathematically

03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:55.400
explicitly that's a conditional in your equation. The opposite side of the coin is basically

03:29:56.120 --> 03:29:59.400
in the trilemma that Bostrom originally put forward. It's options one and two.

03:29:59.960 --> 03:30:05.320
Option one is that you basically never develop the ability to do that. Option two is you never

03:30:05.320 --> 03:30:13.480
choose to execute that. We kind of group those together as sort of the non-simulation scenario,

03:30:13.480 --> 03:30:17.080
let's call it. You've got a non-simulation scenario and a simulation scenario.

03:30:18.600 --> 03:30:25.960
Agnostically, how do you assess the a priori model probability of those two scenarios?

03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:31.720
It's very difficult. I think people would probably argue about how you

03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:36.440
assign those priors. In the paper, we just assigned 50-50. We just said this hasn't been

03:30:36.440 --> 03:30:41.480
demonstrated yet. There's no evidence that this is actually technically possible,

03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:45.640
but nor is it that it's not technically possible. We're just going to assign 50-50

03:30:45.640 --> 03:30:50.520
probability to these two hypotheses. Then in the hypothesis where you have a simulated reality,

03:30:50.520 --> 03:30:55.640
you have a base reality set at the top. Even in the simulated hypothesis, there's a probability

03:30:55.640 --> 03:31:00.360
you still live in base reality. Then there's a whole myriad of universes beneath that which

03:31:00.360 --> 03:31:06.440
are all simulated. You have a very slim probability of being in base reality if this is true.

03:31:07.160 --> 03:31:12.760
You have a 100% probability of living in base reality, on the other hand, if it's not true and

03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:18.120
we never develop that ability or choose never to use it. Then you apply this technique called

03:31:18.120 --> 03:31:22.200
Bayesian model averaging, which is where you propagate the uncertainty of your two models

03:31:22.200 --> 03:31:28.040
to get a final estimate. Because of that one base reality that lives in the simulated scenario,

03:31:28.680 --> 03:31:33.400
you end up counting this up and getting that it always has to be less than 50%. So the probability

03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:37.560
you live in a simulated reality versus a base reality has to be slightly less than 50%.

03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:45.400
Now that really comes down to that statement of giving it 50-50 odds to begin with. On the one

03:31:45.400 --> 03:31:49.640
hand, you might say, look, David, I work in artificial intelligence. I'm very confident

03:31:49.640 --> 03:31:55.080
that this is going to happen just of extrapolating of current trends. On the other hand, a statistician

03:31:55.080 --> 03:32:01.960
would say you're giving way too much weight to the simulation hypothesis because it's an intrinsically

03:32:01.960 --> 03:32:07.800
highly complicated model. You have a whole hierarchy of realities within realities within

03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:13.720
realities. It's like the inception style thing. And so this requires hundreds, thousands, millions

03:32:13.720 --> 03:32:19.480
of parameterizations to describe. And by Occam's razor, we would always normally penalize inherently

03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:25.480
complicated models as being disfavored. So I think you could argue on being too generous or

03:32:25.480 --> 03:32:30.840
too kind with that. But I sort of want to develop the rigorous mathematical tools to explore it.

03:32:31.400 --> 03:32:35.880
And ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you think that 50-50 odds should be.

03:32:35.880 --> 03:32:41.240
But you can use my formula to plug in whatever you want and get the answer. And I use 50-50.

03:32:41.800 --> 03:32:49.720
But in that first pile, with the first two parts that the boss talks about, it seems like

03:32:50.920 --> 03:32:55.320
connected to that is the question we've been talking about, which is the number of times

03:32:55.320 --> 03:32:59.400
at bat you get, which is the number of intelligent civilizations that are out there that can

03:33:00.760 --> 03:33:06.840
build such simulations. It seems like very closely connected because if we're the only ones

03:33:06.840 --> 03:33:10.840
that are here and it could build such things that changes things.

03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:16.600
Yeah, the simulation hypothesis has all sorts of implications like that.

03:33:17.720 --> 03:33:21.320
I've always loved, as Sean Carroll pointed out, a really interesting contradiction,

03:33:21.320 --> 03:33:24.760
apparently, with the simulation hypothesis that I speak about a little bit in the paper.

03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:32.600
But he pointed out that in this hierarchy of realities, which then develop their own

03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:38.120
AIs within the realities, or really ancestor simulations, I should say, rather than AI,

03:33:38.120 --> 03:33:42.200
they develop their own capability to simulate realities. You get this hierarchy. And so

03:33:42.200 --> 03:33:47.080
eventually there'll be a bottom layer, which I often call the sewer of reality. It's like the

03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:52.360
worst layer where it's the most pixelated it could possibly be. Because each layer is necessarily

03:33:52.360 --> 03:33:56.680
going to have less computational power than the layer above it. Because not only are you simulating

03:33:56.680 --> 03:34:00.760
that entire planet, but also some of that's being used for the computers themselves that those are

03:34:00.760 --> 03:34:08.440
simulated. And so that base reality, or the sewer of reality, is a reality where they are simply

03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:14.760
unable to produce ancestor simulations because the fidelity of the simulation is not sufficient.

03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:17.480
And so from that point of view, it might not be obvious that the universe is pixelated,

03:34:17.480 --> 03:34:20.120
but they would just never be able to manifest that capability.

03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:28.280
What if they're constantly simulating, because in order to appreciate the limits of the fidelity,

03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:32.840
you have to have an observer. What if they're always simulating a dumber and dumber observer?

03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:39.640
What if the sewer has very dumb observers that can't? Scientists, they're the dumbest

03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:46.520
possible scientists. It's very pixelated, but the scientists are too dumb to even see the pixelations.

03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:53.400
Built into the universe always has to be a limitation on the cognitive capabilities of

03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:57.800
the complex systems that are within it. Yeah. So that sewer of reality, they would still

03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:03.560
presumably be able to have a very impressive computational capabilities. They'd probably be

03:35:03.560 --> 03:35:08.840
able to simulate galactic formation or this kind of impressive stuff, but they would be just short

03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:14.840
of the ability to, however you define it, create a truly sentient, conscious experience in a computer.

03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:21.400
That would just be beyond their capabilities. And so Carol pointed out that if you add up all the,

03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:25.640
you count up how many realities there should be, probabilistically, if this is true,

03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:32.760
over here, the simulation hypothesis or scenario, then you're most likely to find yourself in the

03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:37.800
sewer because there's just far more of them than there are of any of the higher levels.

03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:44.600
And so that sort of sets up a contradiction because then you live in a reality which is

03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:48.440
inherently incapable of ever producing ancestor simulations.

03:35:49.800 --> 03:35:56.520
But the premise of the entire argument is that ancestor simulations are possible. So there's a

03:35:56.520 --> 03:36:00.760
contradiction that's been introduced. There's that old quote, we're all living in the sewer,

03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:06.040
but some of us are looking up at the stars. This is maybe more true than we think.

03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:11.640
To me, so there's of course physics and computational fascinating questions here,

03:36:11.640 --> 03:36:18.920
but to me, there's a practical psychological question, which is, how do you create a virtual

03:36:18.920 --> 03:36:28.520
reality world that is as compelling and not necessarily even as realistic, but almost as

03:36:28.520 --> 03:36:36.040
realistic, but as compelling or more compelling than physical reality? Because something tells me

03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:45.560
it's not very difficult in a full history of human civilization. That is an interesting

03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:51.560
kind of simulation to me because that feels like it's doable in the next 100 years,

03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:58.040
creating a world where we all prefer to live in the digital world. And not like a visit,

03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:10.200
but you're seen as insane. You're required, it's unsafe to live outside of the virtual world.

03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:15.080
And it's interesting to me from an engineering perspective how to build that, because I'm

03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:21.320
somebody that loves video games and it seems like you can create incredible worlds there and stay

03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:30.680
there. And it's a different question than creating an ultra high resolution, high fidelity

03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:38.600
simulation of physics. But if that world inside a video game is as consistent as the physics of our

03:37:38.600 --> 03:37:43.240
reality, then you can have your own scientists in that world that are trying to understand

03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:47.160
that physics world. It might look different. I presume they'd eventually

03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:51.240
forget, give it long enough they might forget about their origins of

03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:53.880
being once biological and assume this was their only reality.

03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:59.800
Especially if you're now born, well, certainly if you're born, but even if

03:38:00.600 --> 03:38:04.680
you were eight years old or something when you first started wearing the headset.

03:38:05.560 --> 03:38:10.360
Yeah, or you'd have a memory wipe when you go in. It also maybe speaks to this issue of

03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:16.680
Neuralink and how do we keep up with AI in our world. If you want to augment your intelligence,

03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:23.240
perhaps one way of competing and one of your impetuses for going into this digital reality

03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:29.320
would be to be competitive intellectually with artificial intelligence that you could

03:38:29.320 --> 03:38:35.160
trivially augment your reality if your brain was itself artificial. But I mean, one skepticism

03:38:35.160 --> 03:38:39.560
I've always had about that is whether it's more of a philosophical question, but how much is that

03:38:39.560 --> 03:38:45.960
really you if you do a mind upload? Is this just a duplicate of your memories that thinks it's you

03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:52.280
versus truly a transference of your conscious stream into that reality?

03:38:52.280 --> 03:39:01.640
And I think it's almost like the teleportation device in Star Trek, but with teleportation,

03:39:01.640 --> 03:39:09.480
quantum teleportation, you can rigorously show that as long as all of the quantum numbers are

03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:14.200
exactly duplicated as you transfer over, it truly is from the universe's perspective

03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:20.680
in every way indistinguishable from what was there before. It really is in principle you and

03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:27.560
all the sense of being you versus creating a duplicate clone and uploading memories

03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:35.960
to that human body or a computer that would surely be a discontinuation of that conscious

03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:42.120
experience by virtue of the fact you've multiplied it. And so I would be hesitant about uploading

03:39:42.600 --> 03:39:48.360
for that reason. I would see it mostly as my own killing myself and having some

03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:56.280
AI duplicate of me that persists in this world, but is not truly my experience.

03:39:56.840 --> 03:40:05.400
Typical 20th century human with an attachment to this particular singular instantiation of brain

03:40:05.960 --> 03:40:11.000
and body. How silly humans used to be. Used to have rotary phones and

03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:22.920
other silly things. You're an incredible human being. You're an educator. You're a researcher.

03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:33.160
You have an amazing YouTube channel looking to young people if you were to give them advice.

03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:41.160
How can they have a career that maybe is inspired by yours, inspired by wandering curiosity,

03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:46.520
a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of? What advice would you give?

03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:54.280
I certainly think in terms of a career in science, one thing that I may be discovered late,

03:40:54.280 --> 03:41:00.440
but has been incredibly influential on me in terms of my own happiness and my own

03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:09.640
own productivity, has been this synergy of doing two passions at once, one passion science

03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:15.480
communication and another passion research, and not surrendering either one. I think

03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:22.120
that tends to be seen as something that's an either or. You have to completely dedicate yourself

03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:27.400
to one thing to gain mastery in it. That's a conventional way of thinking about both science

03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:33.720
and other disciplines. I have found that both have been elevated by practicing in each.

03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:42.200
I think that's true in all assets of life. If you want to become the best researcher you possibly

03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:50.520
can, you're pushing your intellect and, in a sense, your body to a high level. To me,

03:41:51.400 --> 03:41:55.080
I've always wanted to couple that with training of my body, training of my mind,

03:41:55.080 --> 03:42:00.120
in other ways besides from just what I'm doing when I'm in the lecture room or when I'm in my

03:42:00.120 --> 03:42:09.160
office calculating something. Focusing on your own development through whatever it is, meditation,

03:42:09.160 --> 03:42:16.600
for me, is often running, working out, and pursuing multiple passions provides this

03:42:17.560 --> 03:42:23.720
almost synergistic bliss of all of them together. So often I've had some of the best research ideas

03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:27.640
from making a YouTube video and trying to communicate an idea or interacting with my

03:42:27.640 --> 03:42:33.000
audience who've had a question that sparked a whole trail of thought that led down this

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:37.800
wonderful intellectual rabbit hole or maybe to a new intellectual discovery. It can go either

03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:45.640
way sometimes with those things. So thinking broadly, diversely, and always looking after

03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:52.040
yourself in this highly competitive and often extremely stressful world that we live in,

03:42:54.280 --> 03:43:01.240
is the best advice I can offer anybody. If you can, it's very cheesy, but if you can follow

03:43:01.240 --> 03:43:08.600
your passions, you'll always be happy. Trying to sell out for the quick cash out, for the quick

03:43:08.600 --> 03:43:15.880
book out, can be tempting in the short term. Looking for exomeons was never easy, but I made

03:43:15.880 --> 03:43:21.080
a career not out of discovering exomeons but out of learning how to communicate the difficult problem

03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:26.360
and discovering all sorts of things along the way. We shot for the sky and we discovered all this

03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:30.680
stuff along the way. We discovered dozens of new planets using all sorts of new techniques.

03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:37.800
We pushed this instrumentation to new places. I've had an extremely productive research career

03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:41.480
in this world. I've had all sorts of ideas working on techno signatures.

03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:48.520
Thinking innovatively pushes you into all sorts of exciting directions.

03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:56.840
It's hard to find that passion, but you can sometimes remember when you were a kid what

03:43:56.840 --> 03:44:01.880
your passions were and what fascinated you as a child. For me, as soon as I picked up a

03:44:01.880 --> 03:44:07.080
space boat when I was five years old, that was it. I was hooked on space. I almost betrayed my

03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:11.880
passion at college. I studied physics, which I've always been fascinated by physics as well,

03:44:12.680 --> 03:44:19.240
but I came back to astronomy because it was my first love. I was much happier doing research

03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:25.880
in astronomy than I was in physics because it spoke to that wonder I had as a child that first

03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:31.800
was the spark of curiosity for me in science. So society will try to get you to look at hot

03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:37.640
Jupiters and the advice is to look for the cool worlds instead. What do you think is the meaning

03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:44.920
of this whole thing? You ever ask yourself why? It's just a ride. It's just a ride. We're on a

03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:53.320
roller coaster and we have no purpose. It's an accident in my perspective. There's no meaning

03:44:53.320 --> 03:45:00.200
to my life. There's no objective deity who is over watching what I'm doing and I have some

03:45:00.200 --> 03:45:07.160
fate or destiny. It's all just riding on a roller coaster and trying to have a good time and

03:45:08.120 --> 03:45:12.440
and contribute to other people's enjoyment of the ride.

03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:19.320
Yeah. Try to make it a happy accident. Yeah. I see no fundamental

03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:26.680
providence in my life or in the nature of the universe. You just see this universe as this

03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:34.040
beautiful cosmic accident of galaxies smashing together, stars forging here and there and

03:45:34.040 --> 03:45:39.880
planets occasionally spawning maybe life across the universe. And we are just one of those

03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:48.040
instantiations and we should just enjoy this very brief episode that we have. And I think trying to

03:45:48.760 --> 03:45:56.520
look at it much deeper than that to me is not very soul satisfying. I just think

03:45:56.520 --> 03:46:00.760
enjoy what you've got and appreciate it. It does seem noticing that beauty

03:46:01.720 --> 03:46:09.160
helps make the ride pretty fun. Yeah, absolutely. David, you're an incredible person. I haven't

03:46:09.160 --> 03:46:12.760
covered most of the things I wanted to talk to you about. This was an incredible conversation.

03:46:13.480 --> 03:46:18.120
I'm glad you exist. I'm glad you're doing everything you're doing and I'm a huge fan.

03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:21.240
Thank you so much for talking today. This was amazing. Thank you so much, Lex. It's a real honor.

03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:26.360
Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Kipping. To support this podcast,

please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:39.720
Carl Sagan. Perhaps the aliens are here, but are hiding because of some Lex Galactica, some

03:46:39.720 --> 03:46:45.560
ethic of non-interference with emerging civilizations. We can imagine them, curious

03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:52.840
and dispassionate, observing us as we would watch a bacterial culture in a dish to determine whether

03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:58.600
this year, again, we managed to avoid self-destruction. Thank you for listening

03:46:58.600 --> 03:47:01.000
and hope to see you next time.
